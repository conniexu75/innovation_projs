https://openalex.org/W2132382863,"Pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains are structurally related regulatory modules that are present in a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction, such as kinases, phospholipases, GTP exchange proteins, and adapter proteins. Initially these domains were shown to mediate protein-protein interactions, but more recently they were also found to bind phosphoinositides. Most studies to date have focused on binding of PH domains to phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 and have not considered the lipid products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase: PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Here we have compared the phosphoinositide specificity of six different PH domains and the Shc PTB domain using all five phosphoinositides. We show that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase PH domain binds to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with higher affinity than to PtdIns-4,5-P2, PtdIns-3,4-P2 or inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4). This selectivity is decreased by the xid mutation (R28C). Selective binding of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 over PtdIns-4,5-P2 or PtdIns-3,4-P2 was also observed for the amino-terminal PH domain of T lymphoma invasion and metastasis protein (Tiam-1), the PH domains of Son-of-sevenless (Sos) and, to a lesser extent, the PH domain of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase. The oxysterol binding protein and β-spectrin PH domains bound PtdIns-3,4,5-P3and PtdIns-4,5-P2 with similar affinities. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-4,5-P2 also bound to the PTB domain of Shc with similar affinities and lipid binding was competed with phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)-containing peptides. These results indicate that distinct PH domains select for different phosphoinositides.

It is believed that these well defined units can, alone or in combination, determine the subcellular localization of a protein by mediating protein/protein interactions and also, as recently described, protein/lipid interactions (3Harlan J.E.

PH domains were first identified as protein regions that share similarities with pleckstrin, the major protein kinase C substrate in platelets (6Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M.

They contain approximately 120 amino acids and are found in several proteins involved in signaling, such as protein kinases (Btk, Akt, and βark), phospholipases (PLC), and proteins that act as exchange factors or GTPase-activating proteins for small G-proteins (Ras-GRF, Dbl, SOS, Ras-GAP, Tiam-1) (7Musacchio A.

Interestingly, the recently described PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 have structural similarity to PH domains and may be thought of as a subclass of PH domains with an additional region that allows binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (5Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 16Zhou M.M.

The physiological relevance of phosphoinositide binding to PH domains is still not completely clear. Several PH domains have now been shown to bind with relatively high affinity to either PtdIns-4,5-P2 or Ins-1,4,5-P3 (3Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W.

Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the case of the phospholipase C-δ PH domain, considerable evidence is provided that PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding to this domain recruits it to the membrane where substrates reside and that the product of PtdIns-4,5-P2 hydrolysis, Ins-1,4,5-P3 binds to the PH domain to dissociate it from the membrane as a feedback regulatory mechanism (15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In most of the studies referenced above, the possibility that the various PH domains might bind to products of PI 3-kinase was not investigated. This is an important question since unlike PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-4-P, which are constitutively produced in cells, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 are nominally absent in quiescent cells and only appear in response to cell stimulation (25Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thus, these lipids could provide a mechanism for regulated recruitment of proteins to the membrane. However, even in stimulated cells the levels of PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 are far below the levels of PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2. Therefore, in order for a protein to be regulated by one of these lipids, it must have a strong selectivity for the D-3 lipids compared with the affinity for PtdIns-4-P or PtdIns-4,5-P2. While this manuscript was in review, two papers have appeared indicating that the PH domain of the Akt/PKB protein-Ser/Thr kinase selectively binds to and is activated by PtdIns-3,4-P2 (26Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 27Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Another paper appeared showing that the PH domain of the Btk protein-Tyr kinase selectively binds to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (28Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and another paper appeared showing that the Btk PH domain selectively binds to Ins-1,3,4,5-P4(29Fukuda M. Kojima T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30303-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this study we have compared the ability of six different PH domains and the Shc PTB domain to bind to five different phosphoinositides as well as to inositol phosphates. We find that a subgroup of the PH domains investigated has a relatively high selectivity for binding to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, while others bind PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with comparable affinity. All of the domains investigated here bound PtdIns-3,4-P2 poorly compared with PtdIns-4,5-P2 or PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, indicating specificity to the binding. These results indicate that distinct PH domains have evolved selectivity for different phosphoinositides to provide discriminatory regulation. pGEX vectors containing the cDNA sequences encoding the mouse Btk PH domain (amino acids −6 to 217), the Shc-PTB domain (amino acids 17–207), the βark, OSBP, β-spectrin, mSos1 (amino acids 456–569), and Tiam-1 N-terminal PH domains were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction (5Zhou M.M.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Sring Harbor, NY1989: 17.38Google Scholar) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and washed several times with 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (HNE) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by HNE, without detergent. Point mutations within the Btk PH domain (R28C) were introduced using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Synthetic water-soluble 3H-labeled dioctanoyl-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (5 × 107cpm/μmol) (32Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was incubated with Sepharose beads containing approximately 800 nm of GST-Btk PH domain fusion protein or GST alone in HNE-0.02% Nonidet P-40 buffer. After 1 h at room temperature, the beads were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The supernatant was then collected, mixed with scintillation liquid, and counted on a Beckman counter. The amount of [3H]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bound to the Btk PH domain was calculated by subtracting the amount of free 3H present in the GST-Btk PH domain supernatant from the amount of free3H present in the control GST supernatant under identical conditions. The beads containing GST alone retained less than 3% of the total counts. A nonlinear least squares fit to the data (Kaleidagraph) was determined using the equation [bound]=Bmax × [free]/(KD + [free]), where [bound] is the concentration of [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bound, [free] is the concentration of [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 free in solution, Bmax is the saturation binding, andKD is the dissociation constant. [32P]3′-Phosphoinositides were prepared by incubating 200 μm of a crude brain phosphoinositide mixture (Sigma; contains 60% PtdIns and phosphatidylserine, 15–20% PtdIns-4-P, and 15–20% PtdIns-4,5-P2] with purified PI 3-kinase as described previously (33Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and the lipids were isolated by chloroform:methanol extraction as described (34Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Sonicated 32P-labeled phosphoinositides (prepared as described above) or synthetic water-soluble 3H-labeled C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (6500 cpm; 0.93 μm) were incubated with competitor lipids (unlabeled PtdIns-4,5-P2(Avanti) or unlabeled synthetic PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (32Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) and 15 μl of Sepharose beads containing approximately 2–20 μg of the indicated GST fusion protein in the HNE buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature, after which the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of HNE-0.5% Nonidet P-40 (2–3 min total). The 32P-labeled lipids that remained associated with the beads were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using 1-propanol:2m acetic acid (65:35, v/v). The radioactivity migrating with PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 was quantified using a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. When 3H-labeled PtdIns-3,4,5-P3was used as a tracer, the washed beads were mixed with scintillation liquid, and the radioactivity associated with them was measured in a Beckman scintillation counter. The data were plotted as a percentage of the control with no additional competitive lipid added. A nonlinear least squares fit to the data was performed using the equation % bound = 100 − n ×L/(KI(app) + L), wheren indicates the percent specific binding, Lindicates the concentration of unlabeled lipid added, andKI(app) is the apparent competitive dissociation constant for the unlabeled lipid. This equation assumes simple competitive binding and that the competitive lipid is in excess over the PH domain concentration (L ∼Ltotal). The apparent competitive dissociation constant relates to true KI by the equationKI(app) = KI (1 +L*/KD*), where L* andKD* are the free concentration and dissociation constant of the radiolabeled lipid, respectively. Thus,KI(app) is an overestimation of the trueKI but approaches the true KI at low concentrations of L* and low concentrations of the PH domain where L ∼ Ltotal. Since the same concentration of PH domain and radiolabeled lipid are used for a given set of PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 competition experiments, the ratios of the apparent dissociation constants measured equal the ratios of the true dissociation constants: e.g. KI(app)(PtdIns-4,5-P2)/KI(app)(PtdIns-3,4,5-P3)=KI(PtdIns-4,5-P2)/KI(PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). For the peptide competition for lipid binding to the Shc PTB domain, the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides SCFTNQGpYFF (from the interleukin-2 receptor) and RENEpYMPMAPQIH (from the polyomavirus middle T protein) were used (pY indicates phosphotyrosine). [32P]Phosphoinositides were prepared using a 200 μm solution of presonicated crude brain phosphoinositides (Sigma) and a mixture of purified PI 3-kinase, PtdIns 4-kinase, and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase as described (33Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dried lipids were resuspended in HNE buffer, sonicated, and added to 40 μl of Sepharose beads containing ∼5 μg of the Btk PH domain GST fusion protein in HNE-0.02% Nonidet P-40. Samples were incubated and washed as described above. Lipids that remained associated with the beads were extracted, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC as described (34Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with each selected lipid was then divided by the radioactivity associated with the same lipid in the starting mixture to determine the fraction of each lipid that bound to a given domain. On average, 8% of the total radioactivity added remained associated with the wild type Btk PH domain beads and 4% with the R28C mutant. The GST beads alone bound only 0.5% of the total lipids, such that the radioactivity associated with each lipid was often undetectable. To compare the relative selectivity of wild type and mutant Btk PH domain for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, the data were normalized such that if all the lipids bound equally well, each would have a selectivity of 1 (4Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated EGF receptor intracellular domain, including the cytoplasmic tail (TKD 61, a gift from Dr. R. Cerione from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), was prepared by infecting SF9 cells with baculovirus carrying the TKD 61 sequence. The cells were lysed in a hypotonic solution containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, by passing the cell suspension through a 23-gauge needle. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and incubated with 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP at 37 °C for 1 h. GST-Shc-PTB-containing beads were incubated with different concentrations of sonicated PtdIns-4,5-P2 or PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of HNE containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Phosphorylated TKD 61 was added to the lipid/beads mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were washed two times with HNE-0.5% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer and incubated for 10 min at 100 °C. Proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted using anti-Tyr(P) antibody (4G10). Blots were developed using the chemiluminescence system (ECL from Amersham Corp.). To avoid the complexity of interpreting protein binding to lipid bilayers and micelles, a water-soluble form of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3(dioctanoyl-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, abbreviated as C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) was used to investigate PH domain binding characteristics. Various concentrations of water soluble3H-labeled C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 were incubated with bacterially expressed GST-Btk PH domain fusion protein immobilized on beads. Fig. 1 A is a plot of the amount of the ligand bound versus free. The data fitted a hyperbolic curve indicating a KD of approximately 800 nm, and the stoichiometry was extrapolated to approximately 0.9 mol of C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bound per mol of PH domain. To determine the importance of the diacylglycerol moiety for binding, we compared the abilities of Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (the head group of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) and unlabeled C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to displace [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 from the Btk PH domain. The results in Fig. 1 B indicate that very high concentrations of Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (>100 μm) are required to displace the [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. In contrast, unlabeled C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 caused 50% displacement at approximately 4 μm. As expected the KI(app) for C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is somewhat higher than theKD determined by direct binding (0.8 μm), since the KI(app) is affected by the total concentration of the PH domain and the concentration of [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 used in the experiment (see “Materials and Methods”). These results indicate that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is capable of directly binding to the PH domain of Btk with approximately 40 times higher affinity than Ins-1,3,4,5-P4. Hence, the diacylglycerol moiety plays a significant role in the interaction of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with the Btk PH domain. To measure the relative affinity of the Btk PH domain for phosphoinositides with long chain fatty acids, Nonidet P-40 micelles containing PtdIns-4,5-P2 or a synthetic dipalmitoyl version of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) were used to compete for [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3binding to this domain (Fig. 2 A). A least squares fit to the data yields a KI(app) of 0.7 μmfor binding of C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Thus, C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 appears to have a 5–6-fold higher affinity than C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 2 A versusFig. 1 B). However, interpretation of this result is complicated by the fact that C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 forms a micelle. Fig. 2 A also shows that C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 has a higher affinity for the Btk PH domain than does PtdIns-4,5-P2, as judged by the concentrations of the two lipids required to displace [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. The ratio of these two constants (8 μm/0.7 μm = 11) indicates that the Btk PH domain has an order of magnitude selectivity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 over PtdIns-4,5-P2. Addition of physiological concentrations of calcium and magnesium did not significantly affect binding of C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, or PtdIns-4,5-P2 (not shown). Since the [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 utilized as a probe in Fig. 2 A is water-soluble and not a natural form of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, we also investigated binding using [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 produced enzymatically from natural lipids as the probe. In this experiment both the radiolabeled probe and the competing lipid are in micelles. The results presented in Fig. 2 B again show that C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 has about a 1 order of magnitude higher affinity for the BTK PH domain than does PtdIns-4,5-P2. The apparent KI values determined in this experiment are higher than those determined in Fig. 2 A due to differences in PH domain concentration, probe concentration, and probe affinity, but the ratio of the constants (21 μm/2.5 μm = 8.4) is similar to that found in Fig. 2 A. High concentrations of PtdIns (20 μm), PtdIns-3,4-P2 (20 μm), Ins-1,4,5-P3 (1 mm), and Ins-1,3,4-P3 (1 mm) were unable to displace [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (not shown). As a third assessment of the selectivity of the Btk PH domain, we added this domain to a mixture of radiolabeled versions of all five phosphoinositides sonicated into the same vesicle containing carrier PtdIns and phosphatidylserine and determined which lipids were preferentially retained following stringent washing with Nonidet P-40. This experiment indicates which lipid has the slowest off rate. Consistent with the competitive binding experiments, [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 was preferentially retained (Fig. 3 A). The fact that both PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4-P2 bound poorly compared with PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 indicates that phosphates at both the 3 and 5 positions are critical for high affinity binding. An Arg to Cys mutation at position 28 in the PH domain of Btk (BtkR28C) causes agammaglobulinemia. In agreement with other studies (28Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I.

Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30303-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we find that this mutation dramatically reduces the selectivity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 over the other lipids by both direct binding experiments (Fig. 3 B) and competition experiments (not shown). We investigated the selectivity of additional PH domains using the competitive binding assays. Both the PH domain of Sos and the N-terminal PH domain of Tiam-1 bound PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with high affinity and specificity. Using the [3H]C8PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 displacement assay, both of these PH domains had apparent KI values for C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 of less than 1 micromolar (Fig. 4,A and B). As discussed above, these measurements are underestimates of the true affinities for C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. In these experiments, the Sos PH domain had about a 5-fold selectivity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 over PtdIns-4,5-P2 (ratio of apparent KI values = 2 μm/0.4 μm). The Tiam-1 N-terminal PH domain had about a 3-fold selectivity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 over PtdIns-4,5-P2 (ratio of apparent KIvalues = 1.5 μm/0.5 μm). The selectivities of these two domains were also investigated using displacement of micellar [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3(Fig. 4, C and D). Although the apparentKI values determined by this assay were higher due to the different probes and conditions, these assays confirmed that both PH domains preferentially bound C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3over PtdIns-4,5-P2 (Sos PH domain selectivity, 16 μm/7 μm = 2.3-fold: Tiam-1 N-terminal PH domain selectivity, 15 μm/4 μm = 3.75-fold). Thus two different types of binding experiments indicate that both of these domains have between 2–5-fold selectivities for binding to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 compared with PtdIns-4,5-P2. Both direct binding experiments (not shown) and competition experiments (Fig. 4, A and B) indicated that PtdIns-3,4-P2 binds more weakly than either PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 or PtdIns-4,5-P2 to these two PH domains. Thus, like the Btk PH domain, the Tiam-1 and Sos PH domains have specificity for PtdIns-4,5-P2 over PtdIns-3,4-P2, but have highest affinity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. The PH domains of βark, OSBP, and β-spectrin were also analyzed. The percentage of [32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 that was competed by 10 μm PtdIns-4,5-P2 was compared with the percentage that was competed by 10 μmPtdIns-3,4,5-P3, to give an estimation of the relative affinity of the different PH domains for these two lipids. The results are summarized in Table I. In contrast to the Btk PH domain, the OSBP and the β-spectrin PH domains bind to PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with similar affinities. The βark PH domain showed a somewhat higher affinity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 than for PtdIns-4,5-P2, both in this experiment and in direct binding experiments (not shown). However, this domain bound PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 more weakly than did the Btk, Tiam-1 and Sos PH domains.Table IDisplacement of [ 32P]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binding to PH domains by unlabeled PtdIns-4,5-P2 and C16PtdIns-3,4,5-P3.

Iodoacetamide (IDAM) is an alkylating toxicant that up-regulates expression of hsp70(Liu, H., Lightfoot, D. L., and Stevens, J. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 4805–4812) and grp78in LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells. Therefore, we used IDAM to determine the role of these genes in tolerance to toxic chemicals. Prior heat shock did not protect cells from IDAM but pretreatment withtrans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane (DTTox), thapsigargin, or tunicamycin enhanced expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 and rendered cells tolerant to IDAM. Cells expressing a 524-base pair antisense grp78 fragment (pkASgrp78) had a diminished capacity to up-regulate grp78and grp94 expression after ER stress. Protection against IDAM due to prior ER stress was also attenuated in pkASgrp78 cells suggesting that ER chaperones of the GRP family are critical for tolerance. Covalent binding of IDAM to cellular macromolecules and depletion of cellular thiols was similar in tolerant and naı̈ve cells. However, DTTox pretreatment blocked the increases in cellular Ca2+ and lipid peroxidation observed after IDAM treatment. Overexpressing the ER Ca2+-binding protein calreticulin prevented IDAM-induced cell death, the rise in cytosolic Ca2+, and oxidative stress. Although activation of the ER stress response did not prevent toxicity due to Ca2+influx, EGTA-AM and ruthenium red both blocked cell death suggesting that redistribution of intracellular Ca2+ to the mitochondria may be important in toxicity. The data support a model in which induction of ER stress proteins prevents disturbances of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, thus uncoupling toxicant exposure from oxidative stress and cell death.

For example, inducing HSPs with mild heat shock treatment confers thermotolerance as well as resistance to damage by cytokines, ischemic injury, and chemicals (8Li G.C. Li L. Liu R.Y. Rehman M.

Thus, multiple stress proteins may be important in the cellular tolerance response. Chemical toxicants including heavy metals, halogenated hydrocarbons, chemotherapeutic agents, or antibiotics induce stress proteins (1Craig E.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 239-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 3Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar,5Lee A.S. Curr.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet the mechanism(s) by which such a stress response prevents chemical damage in the target organs for these toxicants is not clear. The kidney proximal tubular epithelium is a particularly important target, and much is known about mechanisms of chemically induced cell death in kidney (22Goldstein R.S. Schnellmann R.G. Klaassen C.D. Toxicology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996: 417-442Google Scholar) and other cell types (23Mitchell J.R. Smith C.V. Lauterberg B.H. Hughes H. Corcoran G. Horning M. Mitchell J.R.

Orrenius S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In general, toxicant exposure initiates a cascade of biochemical events that ultimately cause cell death. For instance, exposing kidney epithelial cells to toxicants that are metabolized to reactive intermediates results in covalent binding of the metabolites to cellular macromolecules, depletion of cellular protein and nonprotein thiols, e.g. glutathione (GSH), increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and generation of reactive oxygen species (27Chen Q.

In LLC-PK1 cells, blocking any of these events with pharmacological agents blocks the toxicity of reactive metabolites and other toxicants (27Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen Q. Jones T.W. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Chen Q.

Shah S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F214-F221PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these biochemical perturbations constitute a sequential and highly interrelated cytotoxic signaling cascade that results in cell death. Despite the integration of the cell death cascade, activation of stress response genes in kidney epithelial cells is linked to specific perturbations suggesting that discrete signals within the cell death pathway are linked to specific genomic responses. For example, activation of hsp70 expression by iodoacetamide (IDAM) or the nephrotoxicantS-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine is caused by oxidation or depletion of protein and nonprotein thiols and not directly by the covalent binding, Ca2+ disturbances, or oxidant production that also occur as part of the cell death pathway (21Chen Q. Yu K. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Liu H. Lightfoot D.L. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On the other hand, c-myc mRNA induction byS-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine appears to be linked, at least in part, to an the increase in cellular free Ca2+ levels (37Yu K. Chen Q. Liu H. Zhan Y. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alkylation of cellular macromolecules may be sufficient to induce expression of c-fos andgadd153 (37Yu K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8207-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical perturbations caused by toxicant exposure serve both as discrete signals that activate specific stress response genes and as integrated components of a cell death pathway. Intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis has received considerable attention as a cell death signal and as an activator of gene expression, yet consensus has not emerged regarding its role in either process (25Farber J.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Chem. Res.

Nevertheless, maintaining intracellular free Ca2+ levels at about 100 nm in the face of 1–2 mm extracellular Ca2+ is important for cell survival, and toxicant treatment generally causes an increase in free Ca2+ levels (26Nicotera P.

Because ER chaperones are important both in cellular tolerance and in regulating cellular Ca2+, it seems possible that ER stress might protect cells by helping maintain cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. The goal of these studies was to address the role of stress proteins in tolerance to chemical damage using the alkylating toxicant IDAM and the renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 as a model. These cells have been used extensively to investigate cytotoxicity and stress gene activation (21Chen Q. Yu K. Stevens J.L. J. Biol.

Herein, we show that conditioning LLC-PK1 cells with mild ER stress, but not heat shock, increases expression of ER stress proteins and prevents IDAM-induced cell death. Increasing expression of ER stress proteins apparently helps control intracellular Ca2+ levels following IDAM exposure preventing oxidative stress. The results provide new insights into the role of ER stress proteins in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and cell death as well as in tolerance to chemical damage. Fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. LLC-PK1 cells, a porcine renal epithelial cell line with proximal tubule epithelial characteristics (60Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W.

The acetoxymethyl ester of EGTA (EGTA-AM) and Fura-2 (Fura-2AM) and Pluoronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Radiochemicals were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Cell culture and treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with IDAM were carried out as described (27Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Liu H. Lightfoot D.L. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in Dublecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium). Confluent LLC-PK1 cells were treated with IDAM for 15 min in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS), then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and allowed to recover in complete medium. Where appropriate, the antioxidant DPPD, prepared as a 20 mm stock in ethanol, was added to the medium at a concentration of 20 μm during the treatment period and/or during the recovery period. Cell were treated with DTTox (10 mm) for 2 or 3 h in EBSS and returned to complete medium for 12 h. Cells treated for 12 h in complete medium containing thapsigargin (0.3 μg/ml) or tunicamycin (1.5 μg/ml) were washed with PBS and returned to complete medium. For heat shock treatment, confluent LLC-PK1 cells in 10-cm dishes were incubated for 1 h in a water bath maintained at 43 or 45 °C in a humidified incubator at the same temperature and then returned to 37 °C for either 12 or 24 h. Cytotoxicity, determined by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), covalent binding of [14C]IDAM to cellular macromolecules, as well as depletion of protein and nonprotein thiols were measured as described (36Liu H. Lightfoot D.L. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation was determined by the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) as before (27Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An antisensegrp78 expression vector was constructed in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A 524-base pair fragment from a hamster grp78cDNA (62Ting J. Wooden S.K. Kriz R. Kelleher K. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 55: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Amy Lee, was digested withNaeI (+145 to +669) and inserted into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3 in a 3′ to 5′ orientation to create the antisensegrp78 expression plasmid pASgrp78. pASgrp78 or the pcDNA3 empty vector was transfected into LLC-PK1 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and a mass culture of cells that expressed the 0.5-kb antisense RNA (pkASgrp78 cells) was selected in 800 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) and maintained in 500 μg/ml G418. Multiple clones of pkASgrp78 were selected from the mass culture by ring cloning. Empty vector clones, termed pkNEO cells, were selected at the same time. Five pkASgrp78 clones were screened further for expression of GRPs following DTTox treatment by [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine metabolic labeling (see below). Bands on autoradiograms representing 35S-labeled GRP78 were quantitated by densitometric scanning using a BioImage Densitometer (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously (36Liu H. Lightfoot D.L. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The integrated optical densities were normalized by taking the ratio of the GRP78 and actin signals in each lane, and the data were expressed as the fold increase in GRP78 relative to untreated cells. Three clones, pkASgrp78-5, -8, and -10, showed markedly reduced GRP78 synthesis and were further tested for the presence of 0.5-kb grp78cDNA fragment by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA (20 μg) was digested with ApaI and BamHI; fragments were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with a hamster grp78 cDNA probe according to standard procedures. In experiments in which the response of pkNEO and pkASgrp78 clones was compared, three pkNEO clones, 2, 9, and 10, were compared with three pkASgrp78 clones, 5, 8, and 10. The response for the individual clones was determined in at least two separate experiments, and the mean of each clone was used as a single data point to calculate the mean of the three clonal lines. An expression vector, pRC/CMV, containing a full-length (1.9 kb) human calreticulin cDNA (63Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteijn C.-Y.L. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. S. Dedhar. After transfection, calreticulin overexpressing cells (pkCRT) were selected for G418 resistance and were ring cloned as described above. Again, pkNEO cells were selected under identical conditions. Individual clones were tested for the expression of calreticulin by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis using an antibody against calreticulin (StressGen, Vancouver, British Columbia). Clones overexpressing calreticulin were analyzed further for sensitivity to IDAM. Biological responses in three pkNEO clones, 1, 2, and 3, were compared with the pkCRT clones, 2, 3, and 5, as described above for pkASgrp78 cells. Intracellular free Ca2+ was determined with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2 according to Chen et al. (28Chen Q. Jones T.W. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells grown on coverslips coated with bovine collagen type I were rinsed with PBS and loaded with Fura-2AM in EBSS to achieve a final concentration of 3 μm. A 1:1,000 (v/v) dilution of 20% Pluoronic F-127 was added to EBSS to dissolve Fura-2AM and facilitate cell loading. In addition, probenecid, an inhibitor of organic ion transport, was included at a concentration of 2 mm to prevent intracellular transport or extrusion of Fura-2 free acid (33Vamvakas S. Sharma V.K. Sheu S.-S. Anders M.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 455-461PubMed Google Scholar). Loading with Fura-2 was carried out at room temperature. After loading cells with Fura-2AM for 1 h, cells were washed four times with EBSS in the presence of 2 mmprobenecid to prevent leakage. The coverslips were positioned in a quartz cuvette containing 3.5 ml of EBSS with probenecid for fluorescence analysis using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). The calcium concentration was calculated asKd (224 nm)× (R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R) according to Grynkiewicz et al. (64Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as described previously (28Chen Q. Jones T.W. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). R is the ratio (F1/F2) of the fluorescence at excitation (ex) 340 nm, emission 505 nm over that of the fluorescence at excitation 380 nm. In some experiments, Ca2+ concentrations were also determined using digital fluorescence imaging as described (30van de Water B. Zoeteweij J.P. de Bont H.J.G.M. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14546-14552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When spectrofluorometric measurements were used to quantitate intracellular free Ca2+, the distribution of Fura-2 between the cytosol and intracellular compartments was determined in cells loaded as described above. Cytoplasmic Fura-2 was released by adding buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 10 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm succinate) containing 50 μm digitonin for 5 min to permeabilize the plasma membrane. The supernatant was collected, and the cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in buffer A. Fura-2 fluorescence in the digitonin (cytosolic Fura-2) and Triton X-100 fractions (total remaining) were monitored at the calcium-independent wavelength λex = 362 nm. Using this procedure, we found that over 75% of the Fura-2 was in the cytosol, i.e. released by digitonin. Preparation of mRNA was carried out as describ"

Although both the cysteine proteinases and neutral collagenases participate in bone resorption, their roles have remained unclear. Here we show that interstitial collagenase has an essential role in initiating bone resorption, distinct from that of the cysteine proteinases. Treatment of osteoclasts with cysteine proteinase inhibitors did not affect the number of resorption lacunae (“pits”) formed on the surface of dentine slices, but it generated abnormal pits that were demineralized but filled with undegraded matrix. Treatment with metalloproteinase inhibitors did not alter the qualitative features of lacunae, but it greatly reduced the number of pits and surface area resorbed. Treatment of bone cells with an inhibitory anti-rat interstitial collagenase antiserum reduced bone resorption markedly. In the presence of collagenase inhibitors, resorption was restored by pretreatment of dentine slices with rat interstitial collagenase or by precoating the dentine slices with collagenase-derived gelatin peptides or heat-gelatinized collagen. Immunostaining revealed that interstitial collagenase is produced at high levels by stromal cells and osteoblasts adjacent to osteoclasts. These results indicate that interstitial collagenase can function as a “coupling factor,” allowing osteoblasts to initiate bone resorption by generating collagen fragments that activate osteoclasts.

These results indicate that interstitial collagenase can function as a “coupling factor,” allowing osteoblasts to initiate bone resorption by generating collagen fragments that activate osteoclasts. Normal bone turnover is highly regulated. Osteoclasts, the cells that degrade bone, require activation to trigger their bone-resorptive capacity. Once activated, osteoclasts secrete both protons and proteinases at their attachment site, resulting in dissolution of bone mineral and degradation of the matrix (1Vaananen H.K. Ann. Med. 1993; 25: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts produce several cysteine proteinases (2Blair H.C. Kahn A.J. Crouch E.C. Jeffrey J.J. Teitelbaum S.L. J.

We demonstrate distinct roles for the two classes of enzymes and show that collagen degradation by interstitial collagenase produces collagen fragments that activate osteoclast bone resorption.RESULTSMouse bone marrow cells cultured for 5 days in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 generate osteoclasts in vitro (24Takahashi N.

The effect on bone resorption of several proteinase inhibitors was examined in this system (Fig. 1). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are inhibited by tissue-derived inhibitors (TIMPs) and specific peptidomimetic hydroxamates that bind to zinc complexed at the catalytic site of the enzyme (25Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar).

In one experiment, the addition of 3.6 μm TIMP-1 (Ki ∼10−9m), purified as described (28Stricklin G.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12252-12258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also diminished both the number of resorption pits formed and surface area resorbed (not shown). In contrast, the cysteine proteinase inhibitors (29Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) E64 and leupeptin (not shown) did not affect significantly the number or surface area of resorption pits formed on the dentine slices (Fig. 1), nor did the serine proteinase inhibitor eglin C (30Schnebli H.P. Seemuller U. Fritz H. Maschler R. Liersch M. Bodmer J.L. Virca G.D. Lucey E.C. Stone P.G. Snider G.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 180: 287-290PubMed Google Scholar); the inhibition of resorption pit number was observed only with the metalloproteinase inhibitors.Resorption pits formed in the presence of the metalloproteinase inhibitor appeared normal but were decreased in number (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Pits formed in the presence of E64, however, were abnormal, with a shallow and “fuzzy” appearance (Fig. 1 B, right panel); identical results were obtained with 25 μm leupeptin (data not shown). To determine whether the abnormal appearance was the result of undegraded matrix remaining in the pit, we biotinylated dentine slices 3This treatment did not significantly affect the resorptive activity of osteoclasts on the slice.; analysis of the slices by fluorescent confocal microscopy indicated that the biotin label only penetrated about 1 μm into the dentine slice, whereas normal pits range in depth from 2 to 10 μm. The biotin-labeled dentine slices were incubated with marrow cells in the presence or absence of E64 for 5 days, and cells were removed with 0.1m NaOH. 250 nm streptavidin-conjugated latex beads were allowed to bind to the slices, and the slices from the E64-treated cultures were then incubated with cathepsin B either at pH 7.4 or 5.0.In controls (Fig. 2, A andB), streptavidin-coated beads were found on the surface of the dentine slice, but few were found within pits, whose depth exceeded the 1-μm thickness of the biotin labeling. In the E64-treated cultures, with cathepsin post-treatment at pH 7.4 (at which cathepsin B is inactive), beads were abundant both on the undisturbed bone surface and within pits (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that in the presence of E64, even the surface protein matrix of the bone is not removed efficiently. Slices from E64-treated cultures that were post-treated with cathepsin at pH 5 also had shallow pits, but few beads were present within the pits (Fig. 2, E andF). Fig. 2 G provides a quantitative analysis of these observations. The increase in bead density over pits in the E64-treated cultures likely reflects increased access of the beads to the biotin moieties in the demineralized matrix. To confirm that the cathepsin was removing beads by proteolysis of the dentine matrix, we collected beads after proteolysis from six slices from E64-treated cultures versus six slices from control cultures and analyzed them for collagen fragments by immunoblotting with an anti-collagen antibody. Numerous collagen digestion products were detected associated with beads from the slices from the E64-treated cultures, compared with relatively low levels of collagen fragments obtained from the control slices (Fig. 2 H). In summary, the results from Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that the cysteine proteinases are required to degrade the matrix in resorption lacunae and that the neutral metalloproteinases, in contrast, function in the initiation of resorption lacuna formation.Figure 2Mouse marrow cultures treated with cysteine proteinase inhibitors form resorption pits containing undegraded matrix. Dentine slices were biotinylated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and marrow cultures were plated on dentine slices as in Fig. 1. After a 5-day incubation the cells were removed with 0.1 m NaOH, and slices were incubated with streptavidin-coated latex beads. Panels A and B, control slices without E64.

Biotinylated dentine slices were incubated with marrow cultures ± 25 μm E64 and coated with streptavidin beads; bead density (beads/μm2) over pit and non-pit areas was quantified by scanning EM before and after treatment of slices with cathepsin B. The increase in bead density over demineralized pits following E64 likely reflects greater access of the beads to biotinylated matrix. *p < 0.05. Panel H, release of bead-adherent collagen fragments by cathepsin B treatment of dentine slices preincubated with marrow cultures ± E64. Biotinylated slices were treated as in panel G; after treatment of slices with cathepsin B, beads were collected and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an anti-collagen(I) antibody. Collagen fragments were much more abundant on beads recovered from the E64-treated wafers, indicating that collagen was much more susceptible to digestion by cathepsin B if acid cysteine proteases were inhibited during osteoclast bone resorption.iView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Of the known neutral matrix metalloproteinases, interstitial collagenase has been reported to be produced by rodent osteoblasts under certain conditions (13Delaisse J.M.

To determine if interstitial collagenase was the metalloproteinase involved in initiating bone resorption, we treated the marrow cultures with a rabbit antiserum specific for rodent collagenase (anti-rIC; 34), which inhibits its enzymatic activity (34Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.T. Ehlich L.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ehlich L.S. Jeffrey J.J. J. Cell.

Anti-rIC antiserum inhibited resorption by the marrow cultures in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition comparable to that of peptidomimetic hydroxamates (Fig. 3A, inset). In cultures treated with anti-rIC, the initiation of bone resorption was restored by pretreatment of dentine slices with rIC (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that interstitial collagenase is the major metalloproteinase involved in initiating bone resorption in mouse marrow cultures.Figure 3Panel A, effect of anti-rat interstitial collagenase antibody or preincubation with collagenase on resorption pit formation. Mouse marrow was cultured and applied to dentine slices as in Fig. 1, but in the presence of a 1:50 dilution of preimmune antiserum (1:50) or anti-rIC antiserum (1:50). For the collagenase preincubation experiment, dentine slices were incubated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” for 12 h with 250 μg/ml rat interstitial collagenase activated as described previously (34Jeffrey J.J.

Mouse marrow cultures were incubated on the slices as in Fig. 1 ± SC44463 (25 μm) as indicated in the figure.

Partridge N.C. Am. J. Otolaryngol. 1987; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Chambers T.J. Darby J.A. Fuller K. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Chambers T.J. Fuller K. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 76: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). We found, however, that the number of attached osteoclasts in cultures treated with metalloproteinase inhibitors was no different from controls (Fig. 3 B). Alternatively, collagenase could promote bone resorption by generating fragments of collagen which activate osteoclasts directly. To address this possibility, we examined the effect on resorption pit formation of treating dentine slices with gelatin predigested in vitro by rIC. As shown in Fig. 3 C, treatment of marrow cultures with SC44463 inhibited resorption pit formation, as demonstrated above, but incubation of the bone slices with gelatin fragments generated by in vitrodigestion with purified interstitial collagenase restored resorption activity to levels greater than or equal to control levels in the continued presence of SC44463. These results indicate that interstitial collagenase can initiate bone resorption by generating gelatin fragments that activate osteoclasts, rather than by clearing the bone surface of collagen.Collagenase cleavage of collagen could be producing an activation signal either by generating a specific peptide as a cleavage product or by lowering the melting temperature of the collagen helix (9Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar), allowing it to expose an activation signal concealed in the helical conformation. We found that heat-denatured gelatin was nearly as efficient as collagenase-cleaved gelatin at restoring bone resorption in collagenase-inhibited mouse marrow cultures (Fig. 3 C), providing strong evidence in support of the latter mechanism.Antiserum to interstitial collagenase was used to examine the immunocytochemical distribution of the enzyme in the marrow cultures on bone slices. Collagenase was not detected in osteoclasts but was found at high levels in small cells having a fibroblast-like appearance, some of which costained for alkaline phosphatase, a marker for osteoblasts (Fig. 4). Cells that stained with the collagenase antibody were often observed surrounding resorptive osteoclasts, suggesting the possibility that they might be engaged in initiating bone resorption. These findings do not eliminate the possibility that osteoclasts also produce interstitial collagenase; but if they do, it must be present at low levels compared with the surrounding stromal cells.Figure 4Localization of interstitial collagenase in marrow cultures on bone.

Scale bar = 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the initiation of bone resorption and formation of resorption lacunae are two independently controlled processes that require different classes of proteinases. Cysteine proteinases are required for degradation of matrix proteins in the resorption lacunae. Inhibition of cysteine proteinases produces abnormal pits but does not affect the surface area of bone resorbed. Interstitial collagenase, in contrast, is essential for the initiation of bone resorption in this system but not for degradation of mineralized matrix.Several cysteine proteinases (cathepsins) have been investigated for their possible involvement in bone resorption (7Hill P.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and human mutations in cathepsin K produce severe abnormalities in bone resorption (6Gelb B.D. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In this study we have provided direct experimental evidence that cysteine proteinases are required to degrade bone matrix proteins but are not required for osteoclast activation.Several prior studies have indicated that interstitial collagenase is required for bone resorption (3Vaes G. Delaisse J.M. Eeckhout Y. Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 383-388PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kahn A.J. Partridge N.C. Am. J. Otolaryngol. 1987; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Chambers T.J. Darby J.A. Fuller K. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Chambers T.J. Fuller K. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 76: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). The most widely held view has been that collagenase removes unmineralized osteoid, allowing osteoclasts to adhere to mineralized bone which triggers bone-resorptive activity (8Kahn A.J. Partridge N.C. Am. J. Otolaryngol. 1987; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Chambers T.J. Darby J.A. Fuller K. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Chambers T.J. Fuller K. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 76: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). The present study provides evidence against this model, since the dentine slices have no unmineralized matrix layer, the presence or absence of interstitial collagenase activity had no effect on the number of adherent osteoclasts, and the addition of predigested gelatin to the bone slices stimulated resorption even in the presence of metalloproteinase inhibitor.Our results indicate an alternative mechanism: that interstitial collagenase generates collagen degradation fragments that activate osteoclasts to resorb bone. What precisely does collagenase cleavage do to trigger bone resorption? Precoating dentine slices with heat-denatured but uncleaved gelatin restored normal bone resorption in the presence of collagenase inhibitors, suggesting that crucial key event is loss of the helical collagen structure. Collagen has binding sites for α2β1 and αVβ3 integrins, both of which are found on the surface of osteoclasts. A recent study found that osteoclasts adhere to undenatured collagen through α2β1and to denatured collagen through αVβ3; adherence to the two different substrates coated on glass coverslips produced distinct physiologic changes in osteoclasts (40Helfrich M.H. Nesbitt S.A. Lakkakorpi P.T. Barnes M.J. Bodary S.C. Shankar G. Mason W.T. Mendrick D.L. Vaananen H.K. Horton M.A. Bone. 1996; 19: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hence, collagenase cleavage of collagen, which results in a loss of helical collagen structure at 37 °C (41Highberger J.H. Corbett C. Kang A.H. Gross J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), could expose αVβ3 binding sites, an event that may be involved in osteoclast activation.The predominant human collagenase in most human tissues, collagenase-1 (MMP-1), cleaves helical collagen but has little telopeptidase or gelatinolytic activity (21Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Stricklin G.P. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11534-11539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice mutated to disrupt the cleavage site in helical collagen, however, only modest abnormalities of bone remodeling were observed (43Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Jeffrey J. Krane S. Jaenisch R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting that proteinases with substrate specificities different from human MMP-1 may be involved in bone remodeling. The substrate specificity of interstitial collagenase (MMP-13), the only collagenase in rodents, differs significantly from human MMP-1; it possesses telopeptidase and gelatinolytic activity in addition to cleaving helical collagen (43Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M."

Overexpression of Bcl-2 was found to protect against acidification and apoptosis mediated by Fas ligation in these cells. Bcl-2 is present in the outer mitochondrial membrane, but the molecular mechanism by which it protects cells is unknown. Because Bcl-2 projects into the mitochondrial intermembrane space and cytochrome cis located in the intermembrane space, we considered the possibility that Bcl-2 might protect cytochrome c from inactivation during Fas-mediated apoptosis. The present study shows that 1) in Jurkat cells, cytochrome c inactivation during Fas-driven apoptosis requires the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane; and 2) the post-mitochondrial fraction from CEM cells that overexpress Bcl-2 both prevents and reverses cytochrome cinactivation.

Apoptosis refers to a metabolic program that when activated causes a cell to commit suicide according to a stereotyped sequence of events that culminate in the fragmentation of the cell and the ingestion of its remains by mononuclear phagocytes. The net effect of this program is to annihilate the cell without releasing any of its contents into the surrounding medium. Among the characteristic events that occur during apoptosis are the transfer of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane; the cleavage of certain proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by the caspases, a set of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that are activated during apoptosis; intracellular acidification; extensive cross-linking of intracellular proteins; and the destruction of the genome with the release of nucleosome-sized fragments of DNA (1Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Several earlier studies have suggested that cytochrome c is an important participant in the apoptosis program. We found that the cytochrome was inactivated during Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells though it remained associated with the mitochondria (2Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Inactivation was mediated by a heat-labile cytosolic factor that we now call cytochrome c-inactivating factor of apoptosis (CIFA). 1The abbreviations used are: CIFA, cytochromec-inactivating factor of apoptosis; PM, post-mitochondrial; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TMPD, tetramethylphenylenediamine; ZVAD, carbonylbenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp.1The abbreviations used are: CIFA, cytochromec-inactivating factor of apoptosis; PM, post-mitochondrial; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TMPD, tetramethylphenylenediamine; ZVAD, carbonylbenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp. Other groups, however, reported that cytochrome c was lost from mitochondria during apoptosis and that cytochrome c once released into the cytosol promoted the processing of caspase-3 to its active form, leading to the completion of apoptosis (3Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4456) Google Scholar, 4Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar). To try to clarify some of these questions and to learn more about the mechanism by which CIFA inactivates cytochrome c, we examined the effect of CIFA-containing post-mitochondrial (PM) fraction on electron transport in isolated mitochondria. In the present study, we show that the action of CIFA depends in part on the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and demonstrate that its action is opposed by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Jurkat, CEM/Neo, and CEM/Bcl-2 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Apoptosis was induced by incubation with 50 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody (clone CH-11, Kamiya Biomedical Co., Thousand Oaks, CA) at a density of 107 cells/ml for 5 to 60 min in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. Controls were incubated in parallel. For incubations extending to 90 min, 5% fetal calf serum was included. Extent of apoptosis was evaluated by acridine orange staining and scoring of condensed or fragmented nuclei. One hundred million cells were suspended in 1 ml of cavitation buffer (100 mmsucrose, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4, except where noted), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μmtriethanolamine, 5% Percoll, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm each aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation. Except where noted, digitonin (0.01%) was added to the cavitation buffer. After cavitation, a portion of the cell lysate was stored at −70 °C until used for spectrophotometry. The remainder was centrifuged twice at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, which were resuspended in 1 ml of cavitation buffer and stored at −70 °C as the nuclear fraction until used for spectrophotometry. Electron microscopy of the nuclear pellet demonstrated the presence of nuclei and some mitochondria, as well as occasional intact cells. Centrifugation of the 2500 ×g supernatant at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C provided a pellet representing the mitochondrial fraction, which was resuspended either in respiration buffer (0.25 msucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm K/Hepes, 5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) or in 10,000 ×g supernatant (the PM fraction) as noted in figure legends, and used immediately for oxygen uptake measurements. Alternatively, the mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in mitochondrial buffer (300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm each aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) and stored at −70 ° for spectroscopy. The PM fraction was also stored at −70 °C. Although this PM fraction contained some mitochondria, freeze-thawing eliminated the contribution to cytochrome c activity as measured by the oxygen electrode. Cytochrome c activity was measured in an oxygen electrode essentially as described previously (2Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), reducing the cytochrome with ascorbate plus tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD). All results presented are representative of two or three similar experiments and are corrected for azide-independent oxygen uptake. Cytochromes were measured spectrophotometrically. Difference spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 18 spectrophotometer over the wavelength range of 650–400 nm. Mitochondrial fractions (derived from 2 × 108 to 1 × 109 cells) were suspended in 1.4 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by aspiration. Under these conditions, all the cytochromes present were oxidized as determined by pilot experiments in which a small quantity of potassium ferricyanide was added (as oxidant) to the reference cuvette. Reduction of cytochrome c was achieved by the addition of 2 mm ascorbate/200 μm TMPD (final concentrations) to the sample cuvette. The sample was scanned at intervals from 30 s to 10 min after the addition of the reductant. To ensure that full reduction of cytochrome c had occurred, 5 μm potassium cyanide was added (to inhibit cytochrome oxidase), and the spectrum was rerecorded. Finally, the sample was fully reduced by the addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite before recording the dithionite-reduced minus air-oxidized spectrum. The latter spectrum was used to estimate the content of cytochrome oxidase (cytochrome a/a3). Cell cavitates, nuclear fractions, and PM fractions (derived from 2 × 108 to 1 × 109 cells in 1.4 ml) were found to be partially reduced. The cytochrome c content was determined by recording ascorbate/TMPD reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectra. The total cytochrome content was estimated after the addition of dithionite to the sample cuvette. The following extinction coefficients were used: cytochromec (550 nm) = 18.5 mm−1cm−1 (6Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and cytochrome oxidase (cytochromea/a3) (605 nm) = 16 mm−1 cm−1 (7Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that cytosol from Jurkat cells that had been driven into apoptosis with anti-Fas IgM (Fas cytosol) contained CIFA, a heat-labile factor that inactivated electron transport through cytochrome c in digitonin-permeabilized cells (2Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we examined the effect of CIFA on isolated mitochondria. In accord with earlier findings in whole cells, we found that CIFA blocked cytochrome c-mediated electron transport in mitochondria, as measured by N3−-sensitive ascorbate-dependent oxygen uptake. Our experiments further showed that CIFA was generated as early as 5 min after Fas ligation (Fig. 1) and that its effect on cytochrome c in isolated mitochondria was blocked by the general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD·fmk), suggesting that CIFA may be generated by a caspase or may itself be a death protease (Fig. 1). For the foregoing studies, the cells had been treated with digitonin, which permeabilizes the outer membranes of the mitochondria. To determine whether the outer membrane influences the action of CIFA, we carried out experiments with mitochondria prepared from control and anti-Fas-treated cells in the absence of digitonin (designated digitonin-free mitochondria). Outer membranes of mitochondria isolated in this way retain their natural impermeability. In digitonin-free mitochondria, cytochrome c-dependent ascorbate oxidation was resistant to brief incubation with Fas PM fraction (141.4 ± 19.5 and 136.5 ± 34.1 ng at oxygen/min/1.6 × 108 cell eq of mitochondria, respectively, for mitochondria incubated for 5 min with PM fraction from normal and Fas-treated cells). It thus appears that the outer membrane protects cytochromec from CIFA. Nevertheless, cytochrome cinactivation appeared to occur during apoptosis in intact cells because exposure of intact cells to anti-Fas IgM for 90 min led to a fall in oxygen consumption (using TMPD/ascorbate as electron donor), reflecting an inhibition by 31 and 42% in two independent experiments (apoptosis assessed by nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation/nuclear fragmentation) amounted to 48 and 44%, respectively). This finding implies that during apoptosis, the outer mitochondrial membrane is rendered permeable to CIFA, allowing the factor access to the cytochrome c in the intermembrane space. We have shown that cytoplasmic acidification to pH 6.8 and below is a feature of Fas-mediated apoptosis (8Gottlieb R.A. Nordberg J. Skowronski E. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 9Meisenholder G.W. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Nordberg J. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16260-16262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether this fall in pH might be responsible for the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane within the apoptotic cells, we examined the effect of lowering the cytosolic pH on the inactivation of cytochrome c in digitonin-free mitochondria (i.e.mitochondria with an intact outer membrane). For this purpose, we prepared digitonin-free mitochondria from Fas-treated cells and incubated them with Fas PM fraction prepared by disrupting cells in cavitation buffer adjusted at 37 °C to pH 6.8 or 7.2. We found that cytochrome c-dependent oxygen consumption was reduced by almost 25% when mitochondria were treated with Fas PM fraction at pH 6.8 compared with incubation at pH 7.2 or incubation with control PM fraction at either pH (Table I). Thus, the mitochondrial outer membrane becomes permeable to CIFA at a pH value achieved by cells undergoing apoptosis. Interestingly, digitonin-free mitochondria prepared from control cells were not susceptible to CIFA at either pH, suggesting that Fas ligation modifies the outer mitochondrial membrane as well as generating CIFA.Table IEffect of pH on mitochondrial susceptibility to CIFAPM fractionOxygen uptake (% control)pH 7.2pH 6.8ΔNFas mitochondria Fas10075.6 ± 7.424.43 Control87.4 ± 3.889.4 ± 7.1−2.02Control mitochondria Fas100101.2 ± 8.31.23PM fractions were prepared from cells that were disrupted in cavitation buffer adjusted at 37 °C to pH 6.8 or 7.2, as indicated.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the effect of this anti-apoptotic protein on cytochrome c inactivation. For this purpose, we used the T-lymphoblast cell line CEM stably transfected with Bcl-2 (CEM/Bcl-2) or the empty expression vector (CEM/Neo) 2The vectors used for transfection were kindly provided by Dr. John C. Reed. The stably transfected cell lines were the generous gift of Dr. Seamus Martin. (9Meisenholder G.W. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Nordberg J. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol.

Treatment of these cells with anti-Fas IgM as described above led within 30 min to morphologic features of apoptosis in 52.5 ± 2.5% of the CEM/Neo cells, but in <10% of the CEM/Bcl-2 cells. In addition, digitonin-treated mitochondria from Bcl-2–expressing cells were completely resistant to inactivation by CIFA, while the mitochondria from CEM/Neo cells were susceptible to CIFA (Fig. 2). Although PM fraction from Fas-treated CEM/Neo cells could inactivate cytochrome c, PM fraction from Fas-treated CEM/Bcl-2 cells could not (not shown). It appeared that overexpression of Bcl-2 either prevented the formation or nullified the action of CIFA in the same PM fraction. When we incubated digitonin-treated CEM/Neo mitochondria with PM fraction from control CEM/Bcl-2 cells for 5 min, washed them, and then incubated them with CIFA (i.e. PM fraction from CEM/Neo Fas-treated cells), we found that they were resistant to cytochromec inactivation (Fig. 3). In contrast, pretreatment of mitochondria with PM fraction from control CEM/Neo cells did not confer resistance. Thus a protective factor from CEM/Bcl-2 cells was able to interact with the mitochondria in such a way as to confer resistance to CIFA. More surprising was the finding that the inactivation of cytochromec by CIFA could be reversed in part by PM fraction from the CEM/Bcl-2 cells. This was demonstrated by treating normal mitochondria with apoptotic PM fraction from Jurkat cells, then reisolating them and incubating them either with CEM/Neo PM fraction or CEM/Bcl-2 PM fraction, and finally reisolating them again and measuring rates of cytochrome c-dependent oxygen uptake. Rates of oxygen uptake by control and apoptotic mitochondria incubated with CEM/Neo PM fraction were comparable to rates seen in experiments in which the mitochondria had not been incubated with CEM/Neo PM fraction (not shown). Incubation of the apoptotic mitochondria with CEM/Bcl-2 PM fraction, however, resulted in a substantial restoration of oxygen uptake (Table II). Incubation of control mitochondria with the CEM/Bcl-2 PM fraction had no effect.Table IIPartial correction of defective cytochrome c function in apoptotic mitochondria by CEM/Bcl-2 PM fractionIncubation 1 Jurkat PM fractionIncubation 2 CEM PM fractionOxygen uptake (% control)Experiment 1Experiment 2Experiment 3ControlNeo100100100ApoptoticNeo53.079.348.3ApoptoticBcl-261.5100.071.3Normal mitochondria were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with PM fraction from Jurkat cells (incubation 1, control or apoptotic PM fraction), then washed, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with CEM PM fraction (incubation 2, Neo or Bcl-2 as indicated), and finally assayed for electron transport through cytochrome c /cytochrome oxidase as described under “Materials and Methods.” Absolute values of oxygen uptake were 282, 46, and 314 ng-at O2/min/108cell eq for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The p value for the difference between the apoptotic neo and apoptotic Bcl-2 results was <0.02. Open table in a new tab Normal mitochondria were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with PM fraction from Jurkat cells (incubation 1, control or apoptotic PM fraction), then washed, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with CEM PM fraction (incubation 2, Neo or Bcl-2 as indicated), and finally assayed for electron transport through cytochrome c /cytochrome oxidase as described under “Materials and Methods.” Absolute values of oxygen uptake were 282, 46, and 314 ng-at O2/min/108cell eq for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Several recent reports have suggested that during apoptosis, most of the cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria, subsequently promoting caspase activation in the cytosol (3Liu X. Kim C.N.

Our observation that cytochrome c-dependent oxygen uptake by apoptotic mitochondria can be partially or completely reversed by CEM/Bcl-2 PM fraction, however, is not fully consistent with these reports. We therefore investigated the localization of cytochrome c in subcellular fractions from normal and apoptotic cells, comparing the quantities of cytochrome cwith the amounts of cytochrome oxidase in these fractions to distinguish cytochrome c release from mitochondrial contamination. The results (Table III) show that the distribution of cytochrome c among nuclear, mitochondrial, and post-mitochondrial fractions was the same in normal and apoptotic cells. In the nuclear, mitochondrial, and PM fractions, the ratios of cytochrome c to cytochrome oxidase were roughly equal, suggesting that by far the majority of the cytochromec in the nuclear and post-mitochondrial fractions can be accounted for by mitochondrial contamination. Electron microscopy of the nuclear fraction confirmed a similar amount of mitochondrial contamination in both control and Fas-treated samples (not shown). Finally, the amount of cytochrome c (and other mitochondrial cytochromes) in the PM fraction did not vary with the length of incubation in anti-Fas IgM or the extent of apoptosis (measured by nuclear condensation), suggesting that if mitochondrial cytochromec release occurs in this system, it was not apparent even when more than 50% of the cells have undergone chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation.Table IIIDistribution of cytochrome c among the subcellular fractions of normal and apoptotic Jurkat cellsExperiment no.ControlFasCytochrome cCytochrome oxidase% apoCytochrome cCytochrome oxidase% apoMitochondrial fraction % total155.253.754.255.6254.550.955.651.7356.049.34.055.952.052.0457.255.93.555.657.451.4PM fraction % total131.133.131.431.1229.632.528.831.1331.129.930.330.0428.226.428.929.6Nuclear fraction % total113.813.114.113.4216.016.615.617.2313.119.813.718.0414.117.715.513.1Total nmol in fractions110567231108773210947371144737311027431165764410497431095702Total nmol in cavitate113849181487954212628961326865313688161299792412418741215792Recovered (%)176.378.874.581.0286.782.386.385.2380.591.189.796.5484.589.590.188.6Fractions were prepared and measurements made as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Fractions were prepared and measurements made as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mitochondria have been implicated in several of the events of apoptosis (14Kroemer G.

Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that within 5 min after Fas ligation, PM fraction from Jurkat cells acquired a ZVAD-sensitive factor (CIFA) capable of inactivating electron transport through cytochrome c. This observation raised the question of access because cytochrome c is normally separated from the CIFA-containing cytosol by the outer mitochondrial membrane, whereas the earlier investigations had been conducted with mitochondria whose outer membranes had been permeabilized with digitonin. It was, therefore, important to examine the effect of CIFA on mitochondria with intact outer membranes. The studies described above showed that CIFA could not penetrate the outer membranes of normal mitochondria, but the outer membranes of apoptotic mitochondria were permeable to CIFA, provided the pH of the buffer in which the mitochondria were suspended was on the acid side of neutrality. Our results suggest that a potential mechanism for the penetration of the outer mitochondrial membrane by CIFA is a Fas-dependent alteration in the membrane that causes its permeability to increase as the cytoplasm acidifies. Bcl-2, a protein located inter alia in the outer mitochondrial membrane, was found to protect mitochondria against the effects of CIFA. Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family, (18Kizaki M. Sakashita A. Karmakar A. Lin C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1993; 82: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is structurally related to ion channels (19Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E.

Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of Bcl-2 might be mediated through an effect on ion transport across this membrane. Bcl-2 must have protected the mitochondria against CIFA through at least one mechanism unrelated to transport, however, since its protective effect was seen in mitochondria treated with digitonin, a procedure that renders the outer membrane permeable to molecules at least as large as trypsin (molecular mass 24 kDa) (21Holden M.J. Colombini M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our observations with Bcl-2 suggest the possibility of a direct interaction between Bcl-2 and cytochrome c or CIFA. Regardless of mechanism, however, we propose that the protection conferred on cytochrome c by Bcl-2 is able to prevent or delay mitochondrial dysfunction and the other apoptotic events in which the cytochrome is thought to participate (3Liu X.

Several recent reports have suggested that during apoptosis, cytochromec is released from the mitochondria and supports the activation of cytosolic caspases (3Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4456) Google Scholar, 4Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar). Our finding that Bcl-2 is able to partially reverse the CIFA-mediated inactivation of cytochromec led us to study cytochrome c localization in our system. The ability of Bcl-2 to reverse the inactivation of electron transport through cytochrome c indicates that the cytochrome was still present within the mitochondria and argues against its loss from the mitochondria or its irreversible modification by CIFA. The results of spectroscopic measurements also strongly suggest that cytochrome c remained associated with the mitochondria as the cells executed their apoptosis program. It therefore appears that the egress of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is not always required for caspase activation and apoptosis and that, in this system at least, the subcellular location of cytochrome cdid not change during apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2098360584,"In a model liver cell line, recovery from swelling is mediated by a sensitive autocrine pathway involving conductive release of ATP, P2 receptor stimulation, and opening of membrane Cl− channels (Wang, Y., Roman, R. M., Lidofsky, S. D., and Fitz, J. G. (1996)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 12020–12025). However, the mechanisms coupling changes in cell volume to ATP release are not known. Based on evidence that certain ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins may function as ATP channels or channel regulators, we evaluated the potential role of ABC proteins by comparing ATP release and volume regulation in rat HTC and HTC-R hepatoma cells, the latter of which overexpress Mdr proteins. In both cell types, Cl−current activation (ICl-swell) and volume recovery following swelling were dependent on conductive ATP efflux. The rate of volume recovery was ∼6-fold faster in HTC-R cells compared with HTC cells. This effect is likely due to enhanced ABC protein-dependent ATP release since (i)ICl-swell and cell volume recovery were eliminated by inhibition of P-glycoprotein transport (20 μm verapamil and 15 μm cyclosporin A); (ii) swelling-induced Cl− current density was similar in both cell types (approximately −50 pA/pF; not significant); and (iii) ATP conductance measured by whole-cell techniques was increased ∼3-fold in HTC-R cells compared with HTC cells. Moreover, HTC-R cells exhibited enhanced survival during hypotonic stress.

By modulating ATP release, hepatic ABC proteins may play a key role in the cellular pathways coupling changes in cell volume to ion permeability and secretion. Extracellular ATP is a potent signaling factor that modulates a variety of cellular functions through the activation of P2purinergic receptors in the plasma membrane. These receptors are widely distributed among different liver cell types, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells, but the physiologic roles have not been fully defined. Cells release ATP in response to both osmotic and mechanical stimuli, and one mechanism may involve opening of a channel-like pathway (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In respiratory epithelia, ATP release stimulated by cytosolic cAMP activates outwardly rectified Cl− channels coupled to P2U receptors and enhances Cl− secretion (3Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.

Recent studies in a model liver cell line support an alternative pathway where increases in cell volume induce conductive ATP efflux. In these cells, removal of extracellular ATP or P2 receptor blockade prevents both Cl− channel activation and volume recovery (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings suggest functional interactions between ATP release, P2 receptor stimulation, and Cl− channel opening in epithelial secretion and volume regulation. Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); pF, picofarad; α,β-MeATP, α,β-methylene-ATP 2-MeS ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; RVD, regulatory volume decrease. protein family are likely to be relevant to this volume regulatory pathway for two reasons. First, while the molecular basis for the transmembrane ATP conductance has not been established, heterologous expression or up-regulation of ABC family members in some cell models is associated with enhanced electrodiffusional ATP release. In cystic fibrosis respiratory epithelia, cAMP fails to stimulate channel-mediated ATP efflux, a response that is present in native epithelia; CFTR gene transfer restores the ATP conductance (3Schwiebert E.M.

In other cell lines, ATP release is proportional to the expression of mammalian andDrosophila Mdr1 P-glycoproteins (5Abraham E.H. Prat A.G. Gerweck L. Seneveratne T. Arceci R.J. Kramer R. Guidotti G.

Effects include enhancement of ICl-swell and endowment of Cl− channel sensitivity to protein kinase C (mdr1 gene transfer) and increase inICl-swell for a given hypotonic stress (P-glycoprotein overexpression) (7Hardy S.P.

In hepatocytes, P-glycoproteins transport both amphipathic compounds and phospholipids across canalicular membranes into bile (9Lomri N. Fitz J.G. Scharschmidt B.F. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 201-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Smit J.J.M. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M.

However, the functions of multiple other ABC members present in liver cells are unknown. In light of the putative association of certain ABC proteins with channel-mediated ATP and Cl− transport, we sought to investigate the role of hepatocellular ABC proteins in these processes. Findings in rat HTC hepatoma cells were compared with those in a selected population of HTC cells (HTC-R) that overexpress both endogenous and novel Mdr proteins (11Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that inhibition of P-glycoprotein transport prevents recovery from swelling and that overexpression of Mdr proteins is associated with enhanced ATP release, volume recovery, and cell survival during hypotonic stress. Therefore, by modulating ATP transport, one or more hepatic ABC proteins may represent important regulatory elements that directly influence numerous volume- and ATP-dependent liver cell functions. The purinergic agonists used were ATP, UTP, and ATPγS, and the purinergic antagonists were suramin and reactive blue 2. The ATP scavengers used were apyrase and hexokinase.

The cell viability fluorochrome was propidium iodide. All experimental reagents were obtained from Calbiochem or Sigma and were exposed to cells or cell suspensions as described. HTC cells possess ion channels and purinergic receptors similar to those found in primary hepatocytes and exhibit rapid recovery from swelling that is mediated by the opening of Cl− channels (12Fitz J.G.

HTC-R cells represent specially adapted HTC cells originally selected to resist normally toxic concentrations of glycocholic acid methyl ester. HTC-R cells have special advantages for these studies since they overexpress both endogenous and novel Mdr proteins (11Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both cell types were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Glycocholic acid methyl ester was synthesized as described previously (11Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and added to the HTC-R cell medium at concentrations of 300–650 μm. For all physiologic studies, the culture medium was replaced with standard isotonic extracellular buffer that contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). Hypotonic buffer was made by decreasing the NaCl concentration by 20–40% (84–112 mm) as indicated. As determined by a vapor pressure osmometer, the isotonic extracellular buffer osmolarity was ∼295 mosmol/kg, and the hypotonic buffer (40% decrease in NaCl) osmolarity was ∼205 mosmol/kg. The mean cell diameter was measured in cell suspensions at 25 °C by electronic cell sizing utilizing the Coulter Multisizer, Coulter Sample Stand II, and Multisizer Accucomp Version 2.0 software (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, FL) as described previously (14Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the mean cell volume of ∼10,000 cells/time point was calculated from the mean cell diameter using the formula 4/3πr 3. Changes in size over time are expressed as relative volume by normalizing volume to the basal period. Any significant alterations in basal cell volume by experimental reagents are noted. Percent recovery for a given time point was calculated as follows: ((peak relative volume − relative volume at that time point)/(peak relative volume − 1)) × 100. Whole-cell currents were measured ∼24 h after plating using patch-clamp recording techniques (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Cells on a coverslip were placed in a chamber (∼400 μl) and perfused at 4–5 ml/min. Swelling was induced by switching to a buffer containing 20% less NaCl. The standard pipette (intracellular) solution contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH ∼7.2), and free Ca2+adjusted to ∼100 nm (0.5 mm CaCl2and 1 mm EGTA) with a total Cl− concentration of 145 mm (16Chang D. Hsieh P.S. Dawson D.C. Biol. Med. ( Paris ). 1988; 18: 351-366Google Scholar). Cells were viewed through an Olympus IMT-2 inverted phase-contrast microscope using Hoffman optics at a magnification of ×600. Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 7052 glass and had a resistance of 3–10 megaohms. Recordings were made with an Axopatch ID amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) and were digitized (1 kHz) for storage on a computer and analyzed using pCLAMP Version 5.5 programs (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Pipette voltages refer to the bath. Current-voltage relations were measured by 400-ms steps to potentials between −120 and +100 mV in 20-mV increments. In the whole-cell configuration, the pipette voltage corresponds to the membrane potential, and upward deflections of the current trace indicate outward membrane current. Whole-cell currents (pA) and current density (pA/pF) refer to measurements at a pipette voltage of −80 mV (EK) to minimize any contribution of K+ currents. Under physiologic conditions, ATP currents are below the limits of detection (3Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To enhance measurements of ATP transport, whole-cell recordings were performed with high ATP concentrations in both the bath and pipette solutions including 100 mm MgATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES/Tris-OH (pH 7.4) as described previously (1Wang Y.

Swelling was induced by 20% dilution of the bath solution (1 ml) with water (200 μl/ml), and currents were measured before and 5 min after dilution. Cellular toxicity was assessed by propidium iodide fluorescence as described previously (17Wang Y. Sostman A. Roman R. Stribling S. Vigna S. Hannun Y. Raymond J. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18107-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) is thought to penetrate only damaged membranes to form intercalation complexes with double-stranded DNA with an amplification of nuclear fluorescence (excitation at 530 nm with a 620-nm emission filter). In wells containing subconfluent HTC and HTC-R cell monolayers, the number of positively staining nuclei was quantitated at timed intervals during incubation in isotonic and hypotonic buffers. Pooled data are presented as means ± S.E. or S.D., where n represents the number of cell suspensions analyzed by the Coulter Multisizer, the number of cells for patch-clamp studies, and the number of wells for propidium iodide studies. Statistical comparisons were made using the paired or unpairedt test as indicated, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. In HTC cells, recovery from swelling depends on channel-mediated ATP release, stimulation of membrane P2receptors, and activation of Cl− currents (ICl-swell) (Fig. 1) (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Whole-cell patch-clamp and cell-sizing studies were initially performed to confirm that a similar purinergic signaling pathway contributes to volume regulation in HTC-R cells, a model derived from HTC cells that overexpresses ABC proteins (11Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In whole-cell recordings of HTC-R cells, basal Cl−currents in isotonic buffer were small. However, incubation in hypotonic buffer (20% less NaCl) resulted in an increase in Cl− currents from −219.7 ± 38.8 to −3938.8 ± 389.4 pA (n = 13) (Fig. 2, A and D). Removal of extracellular ATP by the addition of the ATPase/ADPase apyrase (1 unit/ml) to hypotonic buffer significantly inhibited activation of ICl-swell (−201.8 ± 44.8 pA, n = 3; p < 0.001). This effect was reversible upon return to apyrase-free solutions (Fig. 2,B–D). The addition of the nonselective P2blockers suramin (100 μm) and reactive blue 2 (10 μm) to hypotonic buffer also inhibited current activation (suramin: −380.9 ± 118.6 pA, n = 4; reactive blue 2: −166.0 ± 48.9 pA, n = 3;p < 0.001), confirming that the effects of extracellular ATP involve stimulation of membrane P2receptors (Fig. 2, C and D). Exposure to ATP (2.5–10 μm) in the absence of swelling markedly increased Cl− currents with similar characteristics toICl-swell (data not shown). The P2receptor subtype involved is unknown since UTP (a P2Uagonist) at similar concentrations did not activate Cl−currents, and in previous studies in HTC cells, neither P2Y-preferring (2-MeSATP) nor P2X-preferring (α,β-MeATP) agonists stimulated channels (18Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharm. Rev. ( N. Y. ). 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). Under isotonic conditions, HTC-R mean cell diameter was 23.81 ± 0.164 μm, corresponding to a mean cell volume of 7068 ± 147 μm3 (n = 10). Notably, the average basal volume for HTC-R cells is 238 ± 6% that of HTC cells (2958 ± 112 μm3, n = 10;p < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 3 A (Control), exposure to hypotonic buffer (40% less NaCl) caused a rapid increase in values by 2 min (mean cell diameter = 25.93 ± 0.21 μm; mean cell volume = 9132 ± 219 μm3), which corresponds to a relative cell volume of 1.29 ± 0.03 (n = 10; p < 0.001). Swelling was followed by a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) to a relative volume of 1.07 ± 0.02 by 30 min. The anion channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (50 μm; no preincubation) completely inhibited volume recovery (p< 0.001), confirming that RVD is dependent on channel-mediated Cl− efflux (Table I).Table IPercent volume recovery for HTC and HTC-R cellsExperimental ConditionHTC cellsHTC-R cellsRVDpValueRVDp Value%%Control64 ± 61-aData were previously published (1).78 ± 71-bVolume recovery at 30 min was significantly greater for HTC-R cells compared with HTC cells (p < 0.01).NPPB1-cNPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid; NS, not significant.(50 μm)0 ± 6<0.001−8 ± 8<0.001Apyrase (3 units/ml)13 ± 61-aData were previously published (1).<0.00124 ± 8<0.001Apyrase (3 units/ml) + ATPγS (25 μm)57 ± 91-aData were previously published (1).NSHexokinase (1 units/ml)29 ± 81-aData were previously published (1).<0.001Suramin (100 μm)33 ± 51-aData were previously published (1).<0.00115 ± 6<0.001Reactive blue 2 (100 μm)33 ± 71-aData were previously published (1).<0.001Verapamil (20 μm)19 ± 11<0.001The effects of anion channel blockade (5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid), extracellular ATP removal (apyrase and hexokinase), P2 receptor blockade (suramin and reactive blue 2), and P-glycoprotein inhibition (verapamil) on volume recovery were evaluated. HTC and HTC-R cell volume changes during incubation in hypotonic buffer (40% less NaCl) for 30 min were determined with a Coulter Multisizer. As a measure of volume recovery, percent RVD was calculated as follows: ((peak relative volume at 2 min − relative volume at 30 min)/(peak relative volume −1)) × 100.

A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).1-b Volume recovery at 30 min was significantly greater for HTC-R cells compared with HTC cells (p < 0.01).1-c NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid; NS, not significant.

HTC and HTC-R cell volume changes during incubation in hypotonic buffer (40% less NaCl) for 30 min were determined with a Coulter Multisizer.

Values represent means ± S.D. andn ≥ 3 for all experiments. Statistical significance was determined between control and experimental values. In HTC cells, volume recovery is abolished by (i) removal of extracellular ATP by the ATP scavengers apyrase and hexokinase, an effect that is reversed by exposure of the nonhydrolyzable P2 agonist ATPγS (25 μm); and (ii) concentration-dependent P2 receptor blockade with suramin and reactive blue 2 (Table I) (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Similarly, in HTC-R cells, apyrase (3 units/ml; no preincubation) reduced percent RVD at 30 min from 78 ± 7% (controls) to 24 ± 8% (p< 0.001) (Table I and Fig. 3 A). In the presence of suramin (100 μm), HTC-R cell swelling was more pronounced (28 ± 7% increase compared with controls at 2 min;p < 0.001), and percent volume recovery was significantly inhibited (15 ± 6% at 30 min; p < 0.001) (Table I and Fig. 3 A). These findings suggest that P2 receptor stimulation by extracellular ATP mediates Cl− current activation and volume recovery during HTC-R cell swelling. Same-day Coulter studies were performed on both cell populations to assess whether overexpression of ABC proteins is associated with a difference in volume recovery rates. As shown in Fig. 3 B, volume recovery was significantly faster for HTC-R cells compared with HTC cells. Enhanced recovery was most notably early in the volume recovery phase; percent RVD at 5 min was 32 ± 8% for HTC-R cellsversus 5 ± 9% for HTC cells (p < 0.001). By 30 min, HTC-R cell volume was closer to basal values (relative volumes of 1.06 ± 0.024 and 1.12 ± 0.023 for HTC-R and HTC cells, respectively; p < 0.001). These findings were unexpected since the lower surface/volume ratio should favor a slower volume recovery phase in the larger cells (HTC-R) and suggested that factors responsible for RVD, such as ATP and/or Cl− efflux, may be up-regulated in these cells. To establish whether volume regulation is Mdr protein-dependent, additional Coulter studies were performed in which verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein-mediated substrate transport, was added to hypotonic buffer. As shown in Fig. 3 C, verapamil (20 μm) markedly attenuated HTC cell volume recovery. The inhibitory effects was apparent at all time points beyond 2 min, and percent volume recovery at 30 min was 19 ± 11% in the presence and 64 ± 6% in the absence of verapamil (p < 0.001) (Table I). These findings suggest that Mdr proteins may contribute directly to the cellular mechanisms that regulate volume recovery. Since Mdr1 P-glycoproteins have been implicated in the regulation of ICl-swell in other cell types, an increase in Cl− permeability could explain the enhanced rate of volume recovery in HTC-R cells. Therefore, the effects of verapamil and cyclosporin A, another P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on HTC cell ICl-swell were assessed. In control studies, exposure of HTC cells to hypotonic buffer (20% less NaCl) led to a marked increase in whole-cell Cl−currents from −81.1 ± 24.4 to −1697.0 ± 121.2 pA (n = 13) (Fig. 4,A and B) as described previously (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Bodily K.O. Wang Y. Roman R. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The addition of verapamil (20 μm) to extracellular buffer 1–2 min prior to hypotonic challenge abolished activation ofICl-swell (−86.9 ± 15.2 pA,n = 5; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4,A and B). This inhibitory effect was reversible upon removal of verapamil from the bath solution. In similar studies, cyclosporin A (15 μm) also prevented current activation (−151.1 ± 62.5 pA, n = 5; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, A and B). Examination of Fig. 1 suggests several potential sites for action of verapamil and cyclosporin A on the Cl− conductance, including direct effects on Cl− channels themselves and/or indirect effects via inhibition of ATP release. The former possibility is unlikely since swelling-induced Cl− current density was not different between HTC and HTC-R cells (approximately −50 pA/pF; not significant) (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, in the presence of verapamil (20 μm), the addition of 10 μm ATP to the bath solution led to a marked increase in HTC whole-cell Cl− currents, which were indistinguishable from those activated by ATP in the absence of verapamil (Fig. 4 C). These findings strongly suggest that verapamil is not functioning as a Cl− channel blocker and that Mdr proteins may therefore regulate a more proximal component in the signaling cascade, such as ATP release (Fig. 1). Enhanced HTC-R cell volume recovery may be related to an up-regulation of purinergic signaling processes secondary to increased availability of ATP. To characterize the ATP conductance, whole-cell studies were performed with ATP4− as the major charge carrier (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Compared with HTC cells, the basal ATP conductance was greater in HTC-R cells (−2.7 ± 0.5 versus −0.6 ± 0.21 pA/pF; p < 0.01). Exposure to hypotonic buffer (20% less NaCl) markedly increased HTC-R cell ATP currents to −46.2 ± 8.3 pA/pF. Notably, swelling-induced ATP current density was ∼3-fold greater in HTC-R cells compared with HTC cells (−16.1 ± 10.4 pA/pF; p < 0.001) (Fig. 5 A). These findings indicate that HTC-R cells exhibit enhanced ATP release and more efficient volume homeostasis. To address the physiologic significance of this response, additional studies examined HTC and HTC-R cell viability with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at timed intervals during a 24-h exposure to either isotonic (control) or hypotonic buffer (Fig. 6). HTC and HTC-R cell death during incubation in isotonic buffer did not differ (<1% at 0–12 h and <3% at 24 h; not significant), and viability during hypotonic exposures ≤6 h was similar to control values. In contrast, longer hypotonic exposures increased cell death compared with controls (87 and 79% increases for HTC and HTC-R cells at 24 h, respectively). In addition, HTC cell death during incubation in hypotonic buffer for 12 and 24 h was significantly greater compared with HTC-R cells (cell death at 12 h: 3.2 ± 0.55% for HTC cells and 1.14 ± 0.48% for HTC-R cells; at 24 h: 19 ± 2.20% for HTC cells and 11.5 ± 2.32% for HTC-R cells; p < 0.001). These findings suggest that enhanced ATP release confers a selective survival advantage during prolonged periods of osmotic stress. Hepatocytes release ATP in response to multiple stimuli, including increases in cell volume, extracellular adenosine, and mechanical stress (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transmembrane ATP efflux occurs through a channel-like pathway in accordance with an electrochemical gradient that favors movement into the extracellular space. In rat hepatoma cells, ATP functions as a local autocrine agonist that regulates cell volume by opening Cl− channels coupled to membrane P2 receptors (1Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The present studies provide evidence that ABC proteins play a important role in volume-sensitive ATP transport. First, overexpression of Mdr proteins is associated with an increase in ATP conductance. Second, inhibition of P-glycoprotein transport eliminates volume recovery and activation ofICl-swell. Finally, the effects of P-glycoprotein inhibition are bypassed by exogenous ATP. Enhanced ATP efflux is associated with more efficient volume regulation and enhanced cell survival during hypotonic stress. Liver cells are localized in a critical anatomic site where they receive dual perfusion from the systemic and portal circulations. Consequently, they are subject to unusually large osmotic demands related to high rates of protein synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and organic solute transport (20Haussinger D. Schliess F. J. Hepatol. ( Amst. ). 1995; 22: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, varying exposure to nutrients, hormones, and oxidative stress between the fed and fasted states leads to dramatic changes in ion transport at rates up to 1010ions/cell/s. Despite this, conductive efflux of solutes such as Cl−, K+, and taurine maintains volume within a narrow physiologic range (13Bodily K.O. Wang Y. Roman R. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Corasanti J.G. Gleeson D. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G290-G298PubMed Google Scholar, 22Al-Habori M. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP, which is present in liver circulation, stimulates membrane Cl−channels similar to those activated by swelling. Furthermore, both ATP and decreases in cell volume have catabolic effects, presumably related to modulation of gene and protein expression (19Nukina S. Fusaoka T. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G99-G105PubMed Google Scholar, 20Haussinger D. Schliess F. J. Hepatol. ( Amst. ). 1995; 22: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Keppens S. De Wulf H.

Based on recent studies implicating volume-sensitive ATP release in recovery from cell swelling, identification of the cellular mechanisms involved in ATP efflux represents an important site for regulation of liver cell and organ function. Several observations indicate that volume-sensitive ATP efflux is mediated by ABC proteins. First, both verapamil and cyclosporin A abolish swelling-induced Cl− current activation, and verapamil inhibits volume recovery during hypotonic stress. It is notable that the effects of verapamil on Cl− currents are reversed by exogenous ATP. Second, overexpression of ABC proteins in HTC-R cells is associated with an exaggerated rate of volume recovery. Finally, volume-activated ATP conductance is markedly enhanced in HTC-R cells. Both verapamil and cyclosporin A have been shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport across hepatocyte membranes in multiple model systems (25Muller M. Mayer R. Hero U. Keppler D.

The effects of verapamil are not likely secondary to changes in intracellular Ca2+ since verapamil at the doses used does not change intracellular Ca2+ in isolated hepatocytes or alter passive Ca2+ transport across membrane vesicles (34Striggow F.

Cyclosporin A also inhibits P-glycoprotein transport, but through a different mechanism by binding to canalicular membrane P-glycoproteins; induction of intrahepatic cholestasis in patients taking this drug may be related to attenuation of canalicular P-glycoprotein-mediated substrate transport (31Stapf V.

The functions of several hepatocellular P-glycoproteins have recently been elucidated, including transport of amphipathic compounds (rodent mdr1a/1b and human MDR1) and phospholipids (murinemdr2 and human MDR3) across canalicular membranes into bile (9Lomri N.

Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). However, hepatocytes and other cells appear to possess multiple additional ABC proteins. In the liver, these novel proteins have been implicated indirectly in the transport of bile acids and hormones (11Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D.

Consequently, it will be important to further evaluate the role of ABC proteins whose endogenous functions have not yet been determined. Characterization of other important aspects of this signaling pathway will require further study. Most important, the mechanism(s) whereby ABC proteins such as P-glycoproteins and CFTR modulate ATP release, such as directly conducting ATP or regulating other as yet unidentified ATP efflux pathways, is presently unclear (37Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Haws C. Wine J.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Hanrahan J.W. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1876-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 38Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11623-11626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in isolated cells do not allow direct conclusions regarding polarity of membrane receptors and channels involved. Finally, the intracellular signals that regulate P-glycoprotein function and ATP transport have not yet been determined. Since physiologic changes in liver cell volume are commonplace, it is interesting that these cells literally invest energy, in the form of ATP, on such an elaborate regulatory mechanism. In addition to activating conductive efflux pathways that maintain cellular integrity, the hydration state in itself directly alters cellular metabolism, solute transport, and gene expression (20Haussinger D. Schliess F. J. Hepatol. ( Amst. ). 1995; 22: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). While these effects target the metabolic balance of hepatocytes, local release of ATP may also act as a paracrine signaling factor by modulating membrane transport in other cell types within the liver. For example, while increased bile formation during hepatocellular swelling has been attributed as least in part to enhanced canalicular bile acid transport, it is attractive to speculate that volume-sensitive ATP release into the bile duct lumen also contributes by stimulating secretion at the ductular level. Support for this model includes evidence that (i) ATP is present in physiologic concentrations in human bile; (ii) hypotonic perfusion of rat livers increases bile ATP levels; and (iii) stimulation of apical P2 receptors in cholangiocytes (IC50 ∼ 2 μm) induces transepithelial Cl− and fluid secretion across biliary cell monolayers (39Chari R.S.

Hepatology. 1996; 24 (abstr.): 514Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). ATP transport also represents a potential pathway that couples the cellular metabolic state to membrane ion permeability. Swelling during anoxic depletion of cytosolic ATP is associated with loss of hepatocyte viability (41Gasbarrini A. Borle A.B. Farghali H. Bender C. Francavilla A. Van Thiel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6654-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gores G.J. Flarsheim C.E. Dawson T.L. Nieminen A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C347-C354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Volume recovery mediated by conductive ion efflux, which depends on ATP release, reduces cell death during these conditions (43Carini R. Autelli R. Bellomo G. Dianzani M.U. Albano E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 44Carini R. Autelli R. Bellomo G. Albano E. Hepatology. 1996; 24 (abstr.): 446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The survival advantage of HTC-R cells during prolonged hypotonic stress may be related to enhanced ATP-dependent volume regulation. Admittedly, the role of other factors, such as larger cell size, cannot be discounted. In conclusion, extracellular ATP has emerged as an important signaling factor capable of influencing volume-related and other cellular functions. ATP transport represents an exciting potential addition to the expanding list of substrate transport pathways regulated by ABC proteins in liver. Moreover, these findings may be relevant to other epithelia that possess ABC proteins and ATP-sensitive Cl−channels as well. Further characterization of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ATP transport will hopefully aid in the development of pharmacological approaches that favorably impact on bile formation and hepatocellular function."

The complex in its enzymatically active form is a dimer. Upon incubation in detergent solution, it converts irreversibly into an inactive, monomeric form that has lost the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, the b6 f-associated chlorophyll, and, under certain conditions, the small 32-residue subunit PetL. The results are consistent with the view that the dimer is the predominant form of the b6 f in situ while the monomer observed in detergent solution is a breakdown product. Indirect observations suggest that subunit PetL plays a role in stabilizing the dimeric state. Delipidation is shown to be a critical factor in detergent-induced monomerization.

Open table in a new tab While membrane proteins frequently are isolated as oligomers, it is often difficult to establish whether oligomerization is purely structural (e.g. as a consequence of the general crowding of the membrane) or whether it is necessary to the function of the protein. Three different examples are photosynthetic reaction centers, bacterial porins, and ligand-gated channels. In reaction centers, the heterodimeric structure is essential to the function, inasmuch as homologous subunits contribute to liganding the special pair of (bacterio)chlorophylls that effects charge separation (15Deisenhofer J.

Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In trimeric porins, oligomerization is required for insertion of the protein into the bacterial outer membrane, even though each protomer contains its own transmembrane channel (17Weiss M.S.

In the present work, we have carried out determinations of itsMr, which show it to be a dimer, and of the amount of lipids and detergent associated with it. We have identified conditions under which the dimeric, active complex is stable and conditions that lead to monomerization and inactivation. Delipidation of the complex is a critical factor in these processes. Some of these data have been reported in preliminary form (47Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Recouvreur M. Popot J.-L. Mathis P.

The protocol comprises the following three steps: specific solubilization of the thylakoid membranes with the neutral detergent Hecameg (HG), fractionation of the supernatant on a sucrose gradient, and hydroxylapatite chromatography (HA). The last two steps are performed in the presence of lipids and near the CMC of HG. EPR measurements were performed as described previously (48Riedel A. Rutherford A.W. Hauska G. Müller A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a Bruker ER200 spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instrument helium cryostat and temperature control system. Spectra were recorded at 20 K in 20 mmMOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm ascorbate and either 20 or 50 mm HG. Instrument settings were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.44 GHz; microwave power, 6.7 milliwatt; and modulation amplitude, 1.6 millitesla. To eliminate the contribution of mitochondrial Rieske protein (49Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 226-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Atteia A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) Ser. III. 1994; 317: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar), the spectrum of membrane-boundb6 f complex was recorded with membranes prepared from the DUM-1 mutant, which lacks the bc1complex (51Matagne R.F. Michel-Wolwertz M.-R. Munaut C. Duyckaerts C. Sluse F. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 108: 1221-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Molecular mass determinations were performed after transferring the purifiedb6 f complex into LM solution. Theb6 f complex eluted from the HA column was either (i) concentrated on a Filtron 100 membrane (Filtron), supplemented with 1 mm LM, and run through a Sephadex G-75 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm LM; or (ii) supplemented with 1 mm LM and dialyzed for 3 h against 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm HG and then overnight against 20 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm LM. Detergent binding was estimated using [14C]LM. Two different procedures for detergent exchange were compared. In Procedure I, b6 f complex in HG was transferred into 0.2 mm LM solution in Tricine-NaOH buffer by dialysis and molecular sieving. [14C]LM was diluted with unlabeled LM to a specific activity of 3.9–4.1 × 1011 cpm/mol (molar fraction of [14C]-labeled detergent <3 × 10−3). This solution was used to prepare 2-ml 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradients in 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm LM. About 15 min before centrifugation, [14C]LM was added to the b6 f sample to reach the same specific activity as in the gradients. In Procedure II, the b6 f complex was transferred into LM solution by dialysis and rate zonal centrifugation. Theb6 f complex in HG was supplemented with 1 mm unlabeled LM and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tricine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 mm unlabeled LM. All following solutions were prepared in 20 mm Tricine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, including protease inhibitors, and contained 0.25 mm LM from a mixture of [14C]LM and unlabeled LM with a specific activity of 3.1 × 1012 cpm/mol. Unbound lipids were removed by centrifuging the dialyzed sample on a 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradient containing 0.25 mm labeled LM. After a second overnight dialysis against 0.25 mm labeled LM, the sample was loaded onto a 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradient containing 0.25 mmlabeled LM. In the two procedures, the gradients were centrifuged for 3.5–4 h at 250,000 × g (54,000 rpm) in the TLS 55 rotor of a TL100 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) and collected by 100-ml fractions. The concentration of b6 f complex was determined from the peak absorbance of cytochromeb6 in dithionite-reduced minus ascorbate-reduced difference spectra (ε564 = 19,300m−1· cm−1). The concentration of LM was determined by counting 20-μl aliquots in 5 ml of Aqualuma counting medium (Lumac LSC, Groningen) in a LS1801 scintillation counter (Beckman). Two measurements were performed according to Procedure I and one according to Procedure II. Variations of the LM/b6 f ratio between experiments were within experimental uncertainty. The most accurate measurement, made using Procedure II, gave a ratio of 130 ± 10 molecules of LM bound per cytochrome f. The molecular mass (M*) of the b6 f/LM particles (heavy and light forms) was estimated from their specific volume (v̄*), diffusion coefficient (D20,w), and sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) according to Svedberg's equation,M* =s0,w RT/D0,w(1 − v̄*ρ), where ρ is the density of water at 20 °C. In this equation, M* and v̄* include contributions from all constituents of the particle (proteins, pigments, detergents, and lipids) except bound water (see Ref. 52Rivas E. Reiss-Husson F. le Maire M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2943-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).v̄* was estimated from the particle composition to be 0.797 cm3· g−1 for the heavy and 0.787 cm3·g−1 for the light form (see Table I). Diffusion coefficients were estimated by molecular sieving on a Sephacryl S-300HR column (Pharmacia, 48 × 1 cm; total volumeVt = 37.7 ml). The void volume (V0 = 16 ml) was measured with dextran blue. The column was calibrated with the following standards (Pharmacia): thyroglobulin (D20,w × 1011 = 2.6 m2 s−1), ferritine (3.4), catalase (4.1), aldolase (4.7), bovine serum albumin (6.1), and ovalbumin (7.76;D20,w values from Refs. 53Kuntz Jr., I.D.

Progress in Protein-Lipid Interactions. 2. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 147-196Google Scholar). A mixture of standards and b6 f/LM particles (final volume 0.4 ml) was layered onto the column and eluted with 50 mmammonium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmLM, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at 4 °C. After 16.5 ml had run through, 500-ml fractions were collected, and the elution volumeVe of each protein was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by heme- and silver-staining. The diffusion coefficients of the particles were determined graphically from a plot of lnD20,w versus Kav, whereKav = (Ve −V0)/ (Vt −V0). Diffusion coefficients and Stokes radii are related by the Stokes-Einstein equation, rh =kT/6πη20,w D20,w. The density of the particles (including bound water) was determined at 4 °C by equilibrium sedimentation on a 40–50% sucrose gradient in 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm LM (12 days at 250,000 × g (54,000 rpm) in the TLS 55 rotor of a TL100 centrifuge). The b6 f/LM particles equilibrated at 44% w/w sucrose (d = 1.197). Sedimentation coefficients were determined by rate-zonal centrifugation on sucrose gradients. b6 f/LM particles were centrifuged in a SW41 Ti rotor on either 5–20 or 10–30% (w/w) sucrose gradients at 4 °C in 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.2, or 0.3 mm LM. Distances of migration were measured for integrated ω2 t products of 1.8–2.9 × 1012 radian2·s.s20,w was calculated by interpolation from the Tables of McEwen (55McEwen C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), assuming a density of 1.2 for theb6 f/LM particles (see above). Purified b6 fcomplex was loaded onto 11- or 2-ml 5–20 or 10–30% (w/w) sucrose gradients, containing either 20 mm HG, 0.1 g/liter PC; 25 mm HG, 0.1 g/liter PC; 25 mm HG; 0.2 mm LM; 3 mm LM; 5 mm LM; or 5 mm LM, 0.3 g/liter PC in a 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, buffer containing protease inhibitors. Before being layered onto a 0.2 mm LM gradient, the purifiedb6 f complex was transferred into 0.2 mm LM by molecular sieving as described above; when layered onto the other LM gradients, the complex was diluted and supplemented with detergent and lipids to have the detergent/lipid composition of the gradient. The gradients were centrifuged either at 270,000 ×g (40,000 rpm) for 18 to 36 h in the SW41 Ti rotor of a Beckman L8 centrifuge or at 250,000 × g (55,000 rpm) for 3–6 h in the TLS 55 rotor of a Beckman TL100 centrifuge. They were collected by 500- or 100-μl fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the analysis of the composition of the two forms, the dimer was obtained after centrifugation of the purified b6 fcomplex onto a gradient containing either 0.1 g/liter PC + 20 mm HG or 0.2 mm LM; the monomer was obtained after two successive centrifugations, the first one with an excess of detergent (25 mm HG or 5 mm LM) and the second one near the CMC of the detergent (20 mm HG or 0.2 mm LM), to fully separate the complex from PetL, chlorophyll a, and the Rieske protein that have been released from it. Purified b6 f complex (6.5 μm b6 f, 13 μm PC) was incubated with either 50 or 100 mm HG either with no added lipids or with a molar ratio of egg PC to HG in the micelles of ∼1/10 or ∼1/5 (3.4 and 6.8 mm PC for 50 mm HG, or 8 and 16 mm PC for 100 mm HG). Electron transfer activity was measured as described by Pierre et al. (12Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995;"

The histidine permease has been reconstituted into PLS that transport histidine when ATP is trapped internally and HisJ is added externally (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol.

As usually assumed in current working models, the liganded receptor sends a signal that initiates ATP hydrolysis and results in subsequent ligand translocation (13Ames G.F.-L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K.

The characterization of the ATPase activity, which is likely to be common to all members of this superfamily of transporters because of the extensive sequence conservation, is crucial for understanding their mechanism of action. ATP hydrolysis has generally been ascribed to the nucleotide-binding domain. Therefore, several laboratories took the approach of purifying this domain (or component) for the purpose of studying its activity in vitro. MalK, following its solubilization with urea and purification from inclusion bodies, has ATP binding and hydrolyzing activity (15Walter C. Honer zu Bentrup K. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8863-8869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other nucleotide-binding components have been purified by a variety of methods and demonstrated to hydrolyze ATP (16Koronakis V. Hughes C. Koronakis E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Richarme G. El Yaagoubi A. Kohiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9473-9477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the activity of the purified subunits in general did not respond to stimulation by the respective soluble receptors. Thus, the interaction with receptors and substrates and the regulation of the ATPase activity must involve the integral membrane components; it is therefore necessary to characterize the properties of the intact membrane-bound complex. In this paper we describe a detailed study of the ATPase activity of the histidine permease reconstituted in PLS, using a novel assay in which the lipid bilayer has been rendered permeable to both ATP and the receptor. It is shown that HisQMP2 has an intrinsic low level ATPase activity in the absence of HisJ. The activity is stimulated slightly by unliganded HisJ and to a high level by liganded HisJ. Both the intrinsic and HisJ-stimulated activities display positive cooperativity for ATP. The biochemical characteristics of the activity have been defined. The following E. coli K12 strains were used: TA1889, which carries deletionunc702 (that eliminates the F0F1-ATPase) and harbors plasmid pFA17 (which contains the S. typhimurium hisQ, hisM, andhisP genes under the temperature-sensitive control of the λPL promoter (18Hobson A. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7333-7337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)); GA298 which is derived from TA1889 by loss of pFA17. Ether/acetone-precipitatedE. coli total phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) were resuspended at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in argon-saturated, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, briefly sonicated with a tip sonicator to obtain a viscous homogeneous suspension, and then stored in liquid nitrogen in aliquots. Before use, phospholipids were defrosted on ice and sonicated in 30-s intervals, with cooling in between, until the suspension became clear and no longer viscous. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; from E. coli; Avanti Polar Lipids), phosphatidylglycerol (16:0), phosphatidylserine (16:0), phosphatidic acid (16:0), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (16:0), and lysophosphatidic acid (18:1, Cis:9) (all from Sigma) were obtained as dry powder and treated in the same way as total phospholipids, except that the final concentration was 10 mg/ml. Cardiolipin (from E. coli; Sigma) was obtained as a suspension in chloroform; aliquots of cardiolipin were dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and sonicated to clarity. The concentration of phospholipids was determined by assaying total phosphate (19Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bartlett G.R. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), from strain TA1889 unless specified differently. ATPase reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 330 μl, either membrane vesicles (10 μl, containing 20 mg/ml protein) or PLS (100 μl, containing 0.4 and 10 mg/ml protein and phospholipid, respectively; or 20 μl of PLS reconstituted from purified HisQMP2, containing 0.2 and 10 mg/ml protein and phospholipid, respectively), and 50 mm MOPS/K+buffer, pH 7.5. Total E. coli phospholipids (3 mg/ml final concentration) were added when the assay was performed with either membrane vesicles or PLS reconstituted with purified HisQMP2. HisJ and histidine were added at the indicated concentrations. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min in a water bath and the assay initiated by the addition of ATP together with MgSO4 (2 and 10 mm final, respectively, unless specified differently). At the indicated times, aliquots (100 μl) were mixed with equal volumes of 12% SDS. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined by assaying the Piliberated (21Chifflet S. Anal.

CF fluorescence was measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Luminescence spectrofluorimeter, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 515 nm, respectively, and 5.0-nm slit widths for both excitation and emission. SDS-PAGE was on 12.5% gels with the pH of the resolving gel adjusted to 8.65 (18Hobson A. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry procedure (23Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and without the trichloroacetic acid precipitation step. HisJ was purified as described (24Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the unliganded and liganded forms were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (25Nikaido K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20706-20712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemicals were purchased from the following sources: CF (high purity mixed isomers), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; protamine (free base, from salmon), Sigma; n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside,n-decanoylsucrose, and C12E8, Calbiochem; n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, Boehringer Mannheim; Deriphat, Miranol, and Hega-11 (undecanoyl-N-hydroxyethylglucamide), Anatrace, Maumee, OH; bafilomycin A1, Calbiochem; ouabain, andN-ethylmaleimide, Sigma; and AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, and ATPγS, Calbiochem. The soluble receptor HisJ must initiate the ATPase activity of HisQMP2 in vivo by sending a signal across the membrane bilayer, because HisJ is located in the periplasm and the ATP-binding domain of HisP is located in the cytosol. It has already been shown that if HisJ and ATP are present on opposite sides of the PLS, either with ATP trapped internally and HisJ added externally (12Bishop L. Agbayani R.J. Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), or vice versa (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the ATPase activity is stimulated by liganded HisJ. The finding that HisJ can stimulate the activity when present on either side of the PLS is due to the fact that under the conditions of reconstitution HisQMP2 is embedded in PLS in roughly equal amounts in the right side-out and inside-out orientations (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because HisP has been shown to be accessible from the periplasmic side of the membrane bilayer (26Baichwal V. Liu D. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is possible that external ATP can reach the cytoplasmic ATP-hydrolyzing domain of HisP. To test this possibility, PLS containing HisQMP2 were prepared (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and their ATPase activity examined when both liganded HisJ and ATP were presented to the outside of PLS. Liganded HisJ does not stimulate significantly the activity (Fig. 1 A, columns 1and 2), indicating that external ATP does not have access to internal hydrolyzing site(s). To analyze the HisJ-stimulated ATPase activity, HisJ and ATP can be placed on opposite sides of PLS, with either one being trapped internally. However, in both situations there are inherent problems. If ATP is trapped internally and HisJ is added externally, an accurate measurement of initial rates is very difficult because the internal ATP pool is rapidly exhausted 2Only a small number of ATP molecules can be trapped into PLS at ATP concentrations around itsKm value (20 molecules per PLS vesicle at 0.5 mm ATP). This calculation assumes an average PLS diameter of 50 nm (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and therefore an average volume of 6.54 × 10−8 per vesicle. Note that not all of the trapped molecules are necessarily accessible because some PLS may be multilamellar.and the accumulated ADP inhibits the reaction (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alternatively, trapping HisJ inside the PLS and supplying ATP externally (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) presents several drawbacks: the procedure for trapping the receptor is cumbersome, a large amount of receptor protein is required, and a sizable fraction of the complexes must be reproducibly inserted in the inverted orientation; furthermore, because only one or two molecules of receptor can be trapped per PLS vesicle, 3At 10, 20, and 40 μm receptor concentration, an average of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 receptor molecules would be trapped inside each vesicle (same calculation and caveat as in Footnote 2). it would be difficult to study the kinetics of the interaction between the receptor and the complex. Therefore, a permeabilizing procedure that renders ATP and HisJ freely accessible to both sides of PLS is desirable. Total membrane solubilization would be a possible approach. We tested numerous detergents, 4n-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside,n-decanoylsucrose, C12E8, Deriphat, Miranol, C-Hega-11, cholic acid, Triton X-100. but they all inhibited the ATPase activity. Mg2+ ions, at an appropriate concentration, were found to allow hydrolysis by PLS of externally added ATP in the presence of HisJ, thus suggesting that they permeabilize PLS. This possibility was explored using CF as an indicator of PLS permeability. CF can be trapped inside PLS at high concentration, which causes quenching of its fluorescence; if PLS are permeabilized, the fluorescence would be reactivated when the CF concentration drops as a consequence of its release into the medium (27Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Bshows that 10 mm MgSO4 induces 100% release of CF from PLS, which indicates that PLS have been permeabilized. The effect is due to Mg2+ ions rather than to SO42− ions, as shown by the fact that MgCl2 permeabilizes as well as MgSO4 (data not shown), while neither Na2SO4 nor NaCl have any effect. CaCl2 causes complete CF release at concentrations lower than those of MgSO4. 5CaCl2 is not routinely used for permeabilizing PLS because it interferes with the ATPase assay. The presence of protein is not required for permeabilization because similar results are obtained with liposomes as well (data not shown). ATP and histidine are also released by exposure to 10 mmMgSO4, demonstrating that this effect is not limited to CF. Large molecules, such as HisJ, can be released as well from PLS by 10 mm MgSO4 (up to 80% of the total), as determined by comparing the amounts of HisJ released from PLS before and after treatment with increasing concentrations of MgSO4, using SDS-PAGE. When Mg2+ ions are mixed with equimolar concentrations of EDTA or ATP before addition to PLS, no permeabilization is observed, indicating that free Mg2+ions are necessary for permeabilization. For the MgSO4 treatment to be useful for the ATPase assay, its effect should be very rapid. Within 9 s after the addition of 10 mm MgSO4, CF release is complete; this is probably an overestimate because it is technically impossible to take samples at earlier times. An analysis of the effect of temperature shows that permeabilization diminishes as the temperature is lowered below 37 °C (Fig. 1 C) and at 0 °C the permeabilization effect is eliminated (for unknown reasons). All experiments in this paper were conducted at 37 °C. In conclusion, although the basis of the Mg2+ permeabilizing effect was not understood, this method appeared to be very useful for assaying the ATPase activity in PLS and, as shown later, also in membrane vesicles. Fig. 1 D (squares) shows that the use of MgSO4 as a permeabilizing agent allows assay of ATP hydrolysis by PLS. The rate of hydrolysis in the presence of liganded HisJ is linear (up to at least 30 min). Fig. 1 E shows that the initial rate of hydrolysis is directly proportional to the volume of PLS added (with the phospholipid to protein ratio maintained constant at 50:1, w/w), and therefore, to PLS protein and phopholipid concentrations. This experiment also shows that a phospholipid concentration of 0.16 mg/ml is compatible with complete permeabilization. PLS were reconstituted with purified HisQMP2 to determine the effect of varying protein concentration while maintaining a constant phospholipid concentration (3 mg/ml). Fig. 1 F shows that the rate of hydrolysis is proportional to protein concentration also in this case, in which the ratio of phospholipid to protein varies from 350:1 to 7000:1 (w/w). Thus, under the standard assay conditions, the activity depends directly on the protein concentration and is not affected by the phospholipid concentration. The effect of varying the Mg2+ concentration on the rate of hydrolysis is shown in Fig. 1 A. When Mg2+ is in excess over ATP and in the absence of HisJ, the hydrolysis rate is 3-fold higher than when they are equimolar (compare columns 1 and 3). In the presence of liganded HisJ, the relative increase is 15-fold (compare columns 2 and4). In both cases, the increase in activity is due to the exposure of ATP to internal ATP-hydrolyzing sites by the permeabilization procedure. The larger increase in the presence of liganded HisJ is due to the fact that both internal ATP-hydrolyzing sites and internal HisJ contact sites become accessible to ATP (for hydrolysis) and HisJ (for signaling); thus, the stimulatory effect of liganded HisJ is the factor being measured. The increase in activity in the presence of MgSO4 is not due to Pi being released from PLS because the activity is dependent on the presence of ATP (data not shown). Fig. 1 D indicates that ATP is continuously replenished inside PLS, i.e. PLS are permeable throughout the length of the assay. If permeabilization were transient, the activity would rapidly decrease in time because of ATP exhaustion and accumulation of inhibitory ADP (as is the case in non-permeabilized PLS (6Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). Alternatively, permeabilization might be transient, while giant PLS might be formed which trap sufficient ATP for sustained hydrolysis. If this were true, chelation of Mg2+ by EDTA should have no effect. However, ATP hydrolysis stops promptly upon addition of EDTA (Fig. 1 D, diamonds). The latter experiment also indicates that permeabilization can be reversed. Three levels of ATPase activity are detected in PLS: 50, 100, and 370 nmol/min/mg protein in the absence of HisJ, and in the presence of HisJ and liganded HisJ, respectively (Fig. 2). The low level ATP hydrolysis observed in the absence of HisJ may be due either to contaminating ATPases or to an intrinsic activity of HisQMP2, or a combination of both. To differentiate between these possibilities, PLS containing various amounts of HisQMP2 in the presence of identical amounts of the other proteins were prepared. A culture of TA1889 was heat induced for different lengths of time and the concentration of HisQMP2in PLS present at each of the induction times was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies raised against HisP and HisQ. Fig. 3 (A andB) shows that, as expected, the amount of HisQMP2 in PLS increases as the heat induction time increases (lanes 5–8). The ATPase activity in these PLS tested in the absence of HisJ increases in parallel (Fig. 3 C, open squares). To determine whether the heat induction of contaminating ATPases contributes to this activity, PLS were prepared from strain GA298 (which contains no HisQMP2) under the same conditions as for TA1889 (Fig. 3 A and B, lanes 1–4); they were shown to have a constant activity at all heat induction times (Fig. 3 C, open circles). Thus, the activity in TA1889 PLS in the absence of HisJ is due to the sum of an activity intrinsic to HisQMP2 (about 25 nmol/min/mg at 70 min induction time) and that of contaminating ATPases. That the complex has an intrinsic activity was further established by purifying it and showing that, upon reconstitution into PLS, it hydrolyzes ATP (140 nmol/min/mg) in the absence of HisJ (Fig. 3 D, squares). 6G.

Purified HisQMP2 gave the same result (Fig. 3 D, diamonds), displaying an activity of 1.05 μmol/min/mg protein (an activity of 1.94 μmol/min/mg protein was obtained in the presence of a saturating concentration of liganded HisJ (50 μm)). The stimulation is specific for HisJ because a number of HisJ mutant proteins were found that are unable to stimulate the ATPase activity. 7C. E. Liu, A. Wolf, and G. F-L. Ames, unpublished data.HisQMP2 also interacts with another soluble receptor, LAO (the periplasmic lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein) (28Higgins C.F. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6038-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which, therefore, would also be expected to stimulate the ATPase activity. Indeed, both unliganded and l-arginine-liganded LAO stimulate the activity. The affinity of LAO for HisQMP2and the maximum level of stimulated activity (purified HisQMP2) were determined to be 5.3 μm and 1.75 μmol/min/mg, respectively. These values are very similar to those obtained for HisJ (13Ames G.F.-L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K. Nikaido K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified HisQMP2 in PLS was used to accurately determine the affinity of HisQMP2 for ATP, both for the intrinsic activity and the activity stimulated by liganded HisJ. In both cases, the curves are sigmoidal with respect to ATP concentration (Fig. 4), implying a positive cooperativity between ATP-binding sites in HisQMP2, with identical Hill coefficients: napp = 1.9 ± 0.05. Thus, two binding sites in HisQMP2 are involved. TheK0.5 values for ATP are 0.5 and 0.6 mm, respectively, for the activity stimulated by liganded HisJ (8 μm) and for the intrinsic activity. TheVmax values are 1.9 and 0.14 μmol/min/mg, respectively, for the activity stimulated by liganded HisJ (11 μm) and for the intrinsic activity. To exclude the possibility that the cooperativity is due to the presence of excess Mg2+, PLS containing internally trapped liganded HisJ were assayed in the presence of external ATP; the activity showed positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient and K0.5value of 2.0 and 1.7 mm, respectively. Nucleotides other than ATP have been shown to support histidine transport and to bind to HisP (18Hobson A. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7333-7337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Ames G.F.-L. Nikaido K. Groarke J. Petithory J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3998-4002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that HisQMP2 has a relatively broad specificity for the hydrolysis of nucleotides and for their utilization in energizing transport. The relative rates of hydrolysis of nucleotides at concentrations between 0.2 and 2 mm are in the following order: ATP > GTP > UTP > CTP (Table I). This order of preference is the same as that obtained when nucleotides were tested for the energization of transport (12Bishop L. Agbayani R.J. Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl."

Precipitated proteins were spun down at 5,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, evaporated to dryness in a glass flask under a flow of N2 and stored at −80 °C. Pigments were first separated by chromatography on thin-layer silica gel plates according to Eichenberger and Grob (21Eichenberger W. Grob E.C. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1962; 45: 974-981Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After methanol extraction from the silica powder, each fraction was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Zorbax-ODS column (Rockland Technologies, Inc.; 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm granulometry). Elution proceeded in the following three phases: (i) during 8 min, 0.1% methylene chloride in acetonitrile/methanol (70:30 v/v); (ii) during 4 min, a 0.1–40% (v/v) gradient of methylene chloride in the same solvent mixture; and (iii) a constant concentration of 40% methylene chloride in the same mixture. The absorption spectrum of the eluted fractions was continuously monitored with a Hewlett-Packard 1040 A diode array detector (wavelength range 230–600 nm). The detector response was calibrated with standards, using extinction coefficients given by Lichtenthaler (22Lichtenthaler H.K.

Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 372-408Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) for quinones. Wild-typeC. reinhardtii cells were grown in TAP medium under standard conditions until stationary phase, diluted 10 times into 200 ml of TAP medium containing 3.7 GBq of sodium [3H]acetate, and further grown under about 1000 lux until stationary phase. Cells were harvested, thylakoid membranes were prepared, and3H-labeled pigments were separated as described above (Fig. 1). Their specific activity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in Aqualuma in a LS1801 counter (Beckman) and spectrometry. A 500-μl sample of C. reinhardtii thylakoid membranes (containing 1.5 mg Chl) in 10 mm Tricine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, plus protease inhibitors, was solubilized by addition of an equal volume of HG 50 mmin 2× concentrated TMK buffer supplemented with 37 μg of [3H]Chla (3.25 × 107 cpm). After 15 min of incubation at 4 °C in the dark and 10 min of centrifugation at 80,000 rpm (160,000 × g) in the TLA 100.3 rotor of a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman), the supernatant was layered on top of an 11-ml 10–30% (w/w) sucrose gradient in TMK-HP buffer and centrifuged for 24 h at 40,000 rpm (270,000 ×g) in the SW41 rotor of an L8 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Fractions of 400 μl were collected. The top fractions were analyzed for Chl and radioactivity. The fractions containing theb6 f complex were pooled, and the complex was purified by HA chromatography as described (13Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The specific activity of free Chl was taken to be that of the Chl present in the uppermost three fractions of the gradient (Fig. 5). An acetone solution containing 2 nmol of [3H]Chla (∼480,000 cpm) was evaporated to dryness under N2. The [3H]Chla was redissolved in 0.5 ml of a 5 μm solution of purifiedb6 f complex in AP-HP buffer and incubated in the dark under N2 at 4 °C. At time intervals, 0.1-ml aliquots were layered onto 2-ml 10–30% (w/w) sucrose gradients in TMK-HP buffer and centrifuged for 3 h at 55,000 rpm (260,000 × g) in the TLS 55 rotor of a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman) to separate free fromb6 f-bound Chl. The brownish band containing the complex was collected, and the specific radioactivity ofb6 f-bound Chl was determined and compared with that of the free Chl present at the top of the gradient. Low-temperature (77 K) fluorescence spectra were recorded on a homemade instrument (see Ref.25Ajlani G. Vernotte C. DiMagno L. Haselkorn R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 189-196Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The exciting beam and the fluorescence emission were passed through a Y-shaped light guide. The sample (∼5 μm in AP-HP buffer) was placed in a flat quartz cuvette (0.1-mm light path), immersed in liquid nitrogen, and held at the common end of the guide. The exciting beam wavelength was selected by a monochromator, with a bandwidth set at 3 nm for excitation spectra and 12 nm for emission spectra. The fluorescence emitted by the sample was monitored by a photomultiplier through a monochromator with a bandwidth of 12 nm for excitation spectra and 3 nm for emission spectra. Spectra were recorded as uncorrected responses of the photomultiplier. Resonance Raman spectra were recorded with a U1000 Raman spectrometer equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (Jobin-Yvon, France) on pellets of oxidized cytochromeb6 f obtained by ultracentrifugation after exposure to 1.5 mm ferricyanide and dilution under the critical micellar concentration of HG. The 441.6 nm excitation light (less than 15 milliwatts on the sample) was provided by a HeCd continuous laser (Model 4270N, Liconix, CA). To prevent photodegradation of Chla during the experiments, samples were cooled at 77 K in a gas flow cryostat (TBT, France). Purified b6 f complex in AP-HP buffer was diluted 10 times into 20 mm HG, 0.1 g/liter PC, to a final concentration of 0.5 μmCytf, 40 mm AP. A 300-μl sample was irradiated at 4 °C under gentle stirring by the two light beams produced by a KL 1500 lamp (Schott; power set at 3). The white light was filtered by a red Wratten low-pass filter No. 92 (Kodak; cut-off wavelength 620 nm) and by 1-cm plastic cuvettes filled with water. The b6 fcomplex from C. reinhardtii contains seven subunits in stoichiometric ratio and four identified redox carriers, onec-type heme, two b-type hemes, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster (13Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to the three cytochromes, UV-visible spectra of even the most highly purified preparations reveal the presence of carotenoids (absorbance peaks at ∼460 and 483 nm) and of Chla (peak at 667–668 nm) (13Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Within experimental accuracy, the visible spectrum of the Chl does not depend on the redox state of the complex (Ref. 13Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; see Fig. 3 A). Using thein situ extinction coefficient ofb6 f-associated Chla(ε668 = 75,000m−1 · cm−1; cf.“Experimental Procedures”) and an extinction coefficient ε554 = 18,000m−1 · cm−1 for Cytf (19Rich P.R. Heathcote P. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 138-151Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the Chla/Cytf ratio was found to be 0.93 ± 0.18 (mean ± S.D. over 26 preparations). Chemical analysis confirmed thatb6 f preparations contain essentially pure Chla; Chlb, which makes up to ∼30% of Chl in thylakoid membranes from WT C. reinhardtii, represents less than 10% of Chl in purified b6 f (Table I). Carotenoids are present in substoichiometric ratio with respect to Chla, while other pigments and quinones either are totally absent or are present in trace amounts (Table I). The approximate 1:1 molar ratio of Chla to Cytf, the excess of Chla over Chlb, as compared with thylakoid membranes, and the retention of Chla throughout the purification procedure suggest that there exists, on theb6 f complex, one binding site with high affinity and specificity for Chla. However, the average stoichiometry is somewhat smaller than 1:1, and its variation from one preparation to the next tends to be larger than the uncertainty on the measurements would lead one to expect. Several factors may explain the dispersion of the data. (i) Traces of Chl collected from the sucrose gradient and incompletely washed from the hydroxylapatite column may contaminate some preparations; (ii) theb6 f-associated Chl is easily bleached (see below); and (iii) exposure of the complex to detergent micelles tends to release the Chl (26Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubaq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Exposing the complex to an excess of laurylmaltoside (LM) micelles induced a bathochromic shift of the Chla peak by ∼2 nm, from 667–668 to 669–670 nm (Fig. 2 A). Similar shifts were observed following denaturing treatments, such as heating the preparation at 50 °C or adding 8m urea, and occurred whether theb6 f complex was in its detergent-solubilized state or reconstituted into lipid vesicles (Fig. 2 B). The spectrum of Chla inb6 f preparations treated with an excess of detergent resembles that of pure Chla dissolved in LM micelles (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that this treatment releases Chl from the complex. Delipidation by detergents indeed induces dissociation of the complex into chlorophyll-free monomers (26Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubaq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, closer examination reveals that the spectral shift actually precedes Chl dissociation. We show elsewhere that mild treatment of the complex with detergent first generates a dimeric form that has lost the Rieske protein and retains the Chl, while a harsher treatment is required for the complex to release the Chl and break down into monomers (26Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubaq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Analysis of the visible spectrum of the Chl bound to purified, Rieske-depleted b6 fdimer revealed a red-shifted (and broadened) absorption peak (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the environment of the Chl has been affected even though it is still bound to the complex and co-purifies with it (26Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubaq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interactions of the Chl with its environment in theb6 f complex were further examined by low temperature fluorescence measurements. Cytochromeb6 f exhibits, in the Soret region, several absorption bands due to the Chl, the carotenoids, and cytochromes f and b6, the latter bands being modulated by the redox potential (Ref. 13Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 A). The possible occurrence of energy transfer between hemes and Chla was examined by analyzing the fluorescence characteristics of the Chl under various redox conditions. At 77 K, excitation at 440 nm in the Chl band of cytochrome b6 f produced an emission of fluorescence with a maximum at 673 nm (Fig. 3 B). Excitation spectra of the fluorescence emitted at 673 nm and emission spectra of the fluorescence excited at 440 nm were recorded in the presence or absence of 5 mm ascorbate or ∼5 mm sodium dithionite. The effects of these additions on the redox state of the cytochromes were checked by absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3 A). Regardless of the addition, there was no significant change in the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra (Fig. 3 C, and data not shown). Incubation at room temperature for 1 h with 100 mm HG, which is known to induce partial dissociation of the cytochromeb6 f complex (26Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubaq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), did not modify the shape of the fluorescence spectra, but enhanced fluorescence intensity by a factor of ∼2 (Fig. 3 B). A more limited increase in fluorescence intensity was observed after freezing and thawing the b6 f solution (Table II). A comparison of these fluorescence intensities with that of free Chla in the same buffer is shown in Fig. 3 B and Table II. These observations indicate that association of Chla with theb6 f complex results in a redox-independent quenching of its fluorescence (by a factor of ∼4), which is partially relieved following detergent treatment.Table IICompared fluorescence intensities of free and b6 f-bound ChlaChlorophyll aCytochromeb6 fFreshAfter freeze/thaw+100 mm HecamegRelative fluorescence intensity at 77 K10025 ± 339 ± 451 ± 5 Open table in a new tab The mode of binding of Chla to the protein was further investigated using resonance Raman spectroscopy. To detect selective contributions from the Chl molecules present in the samples, experiments were performed at 441.6 nm excitation wavelength on oxidized cytochrome b6 f. This laser line is located on the red side of the Soret electronic transition of Chla, more than 1500 cm−1 away from the Soret band of the oxidized cytochromes (∼413 nm). As expected, resonance Raman spectra recorded under these conditions led to barely detectable signals from cytochromeb6. Nevertheless, under these conditions of excitation, intense contributions typical of carotenoid molecules partially masked the middle frequency modes of Chla (data not shown). Analysis, therefore, was focused on the high-frequency region of the spectrum (Fig. 4). Below 1600 cm−1, resonance Raman spectra of Chlamolecules typically feature an intense band at ∼1550 cm−1, which has been attributed to complex vibrational modes of the chlorin ring (27Lutz M. Mäntele W. Scheer H. The Chlorophylls. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 855-902Google Scholar). Between ∼1600 and 1710 cm−1, two or three bands may be observed: (i) a band between 1595 and 1615 cm−1, arising from the stretching modes of the methine bridges of the molecule (27Lutz M. Mäntele W. Scheer H. The Chlorophylls. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 855-902Google Scholar), the frequency of which depends on the conformation of the chlorin ring (28Fujiwara M. Tasumi M. J. Phys. Chem. 1986; 90: 5646-5650Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and is thus sensitive to the coordination state of the central Mg2+ ion (27Lutz M. Mäntele W. Scheer H. The Chlorophylls. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 855-902Google Scholar); (ii) a band at ∼1620 cm−1, arising from the stretching mode of the conjugated vinyl group in position C2 (29Feiler U. Mattioli T.A. Katheder I. Scheer H. Lutz M. Robert B. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1994; 25: 365-370Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and often just appearing as a weak shoulder on the high frequency side of the methine stretching band (29Feiler U. Mattioli T.A. Katheder I. Scheer H. Lutz M. Robert B. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1994; 25: 365-370Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar); and (iii) between 1640 and 1710 cm−1, bands arising from the stretching modes of the conjugated 9-keto carbonyl group, the frequency of which is extremely sensitive to the H-bonding state and to the environment of this group (27Lutz M. Mäntele W. Scheer H. The Chlorophylls. CRC Press Inc., Boca R"
https://openalex.org/W1982788622,"The genes for seven of nine enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of Kdo2-lipid A (Re endotoxin) inEscherichia coli have been reported. We have now identified a novel gene encoding the lipid A 4′-kinase (the sixth step of the pathway). The 4′-kinase transfers the γ-phosphate of ATP to the 4′-position of a tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate intermediate (termed DS-1-P) to form tetraacyldisaccharide 1,4′-bis-phosphate (lipid IVA). The 4′-phosphate is required for the action of distal enzymes, such as Kdo transferase and also renders lipid A substructures active as endotoxin antagonists or mimetics. Lysates ofE. coli generated using individual λ clones from the ordered Kohara library were assayed for overproduction of 4′-kinase. Only one clone, [218]E1D1, which directed 2–2.5-fold overproduction, was identified. This construct contains 20 kilobase pairs of E. coli DNA from the vicinity of minute 21. Two genes related to the lipid A system map in this region: msbA, encoding a putative translocator, and kdsB, the structural gene for CMP-Kdo synthase. msbA forms an operon with a downstream, essential open reading frame of unknown function, designated orfE. orfE was cloned into a T7 expression system. Washed membranes from cells overexpressingorfE display ∼2000-fold higher specific activity of 4′-kinase than membranes from cells with vector alone. Membranes containing recombinant, overexpressed 4′-kinase (but not membranes with wild-type kinase levels) efficiently phosphorylate three DS-1-P analogs: 3-aza-DS-1-P, base-treated DS-1-P, and base-treated 3-aza-DS-1-P. A synthetic hexaacylated DS-1-P analog, compound 505, can also be phosphorylated by membranes from the overproducer, yielding [4′-32P] lipid A (endotoxin). The overexpressed lipid A 4′-kinase is very useful for making new 4′-phosphorylated lipid A analogs with potential utility as endotoxin mimetics or antagonists.

Seven of the nine structural genes coding for the enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis in E. coli have been identified (3Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). However, the lipid A 4′-kinase gene has remained elusive (3Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). The 4′-kinase catalyzes the sixth step of the pathway (Fig. 1) (12Ray B.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1122-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It phosphorylates the 4′-position of a tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate intermediate (termed DS-1-P) to form tetraacyldisaccharide 1,4′-bis-phosphate, also known as lipid IVA(Fig. 1) (12Ray B.L.

Identification of the 4′-kinase gene has been hampered because mutants lacking the 4′-kinase have not been identified (3Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). Presumably the 4′-kinase gene, like most other genes encoding enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis, is required for growth (3Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). Genetic screens for conditionally lethal mutants, such as that used for the identification of the Kdo transferase gene, kdtA (15Clementz T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have not been developed. Attempts to purify the kinase to homogeneity have been thwarted by the protein's association with membranes and its instability in the presence of detergents (12Ray B.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The lipid A 4′-kinase can be used to make 4′-32P-labeled lipid A precursors, such as [4′-32P]lipid IVAand Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, for biochemical analyses of late pathway reactions (12Ray B.L.

The 4′-kinase activity found in wild type E. coli membranes, however, is relatively inefficient and unstable, especially in the presence of low chemical concentrations of ATP (12Ray B.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1122-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hampton R.Y. Raetz C.R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Only 0.1–0.5% incorporation of 32P into [4′-32P]lipid IVA is obtained when trace quantities of [γ-32P]ATP are used together with the physiological substrate, DS-1-P (12Ray B.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

This low level of32P transfer makes it virtually impossible to use the 4′-kinase for phosphorylating DS-1-P analogs that are utilized less efficiently. Identification and overexpression of the 4′-kinase gene would allow investigation of DS-1-P analogs as substrates for the 4′-kinase, possibly facilitating the synthesis of interesting lipid IVA analogs with potential activity as endotoxin antagonists or mimetics (2Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed.

To identify the gene encoding the lipid A 4′-kinase, we employed the approach used by Clementz et al. (22Clementz T. Bednarski J. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Individual lysates generated from the ordered Kohara library (22Clementz T. Bednarski J. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J.

Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) were assayed for overproduction of 4′-kinase activity. Using this procedure, a λ clone was identified that spans 20 kilobase pairs near minute 21 of the E. coli chromosome and is capable of directing slight (2–2.5-fold) overproduction of 4′-kinase activity. Subcloning of a candidate open reading frame present on this hybrid bacteriophage revealed that an essential gene of unknown function, designated orfE (25Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), resulted in ∼2000-fold overproduction of 4′-kinase when expressed behind a T7 promoter.orfE is the downstream gene in an operon that also includesmsbA, a possible translocator for nascent LPS in the inner membrane (25Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We believe that orfE is the structural gene for the 4′-kinase and should be redesignated lpxK.orfE does not display significant sequence homology to other known kinases. The overexpressed 4′-kinase is very useful for the efficient synthesis of labeled precursors and novel lipid A analogs. 32Pi and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, 0.25-mm glass-backed Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates from Merck, yeast extract and tryptone from Difco, restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs, T4 DNA Ligase from Life Technologies, Inc., and Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene. Solvents for thin layer chromatography were reagent grade from Malinckrodt, and solvents for lipid preparations were high pressure liquid chromatography grade (Aldrich). Table I lists the strains used in this study. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Luria Broth (LB) consisting of 10 g of NaCl, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of tryptone per liter (27Miller J.R.

Open table in a new tab E. coli W3110 chromosomal DNA was isolated as described by Ausubel et al. (28). Minipreparations of plasmid DNA were made using the Promega Wizard minipurification system. Large scale preparations of plasmid DNA were made using the 5′–3′ Bigger Prep kit. Polymerase chain reactions were optimized using the Stratagene Optiprime Kit. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiagen Qiaex II gel extraction kit. Restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were used according to the manufacturer's directions. Transformation of E. coli with plasmid DNAs was done using salt-competent cells (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). DS-1-32P was made according to Radika and Raetz (30Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14859-14867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Milligram quantities DS-1-P were enzymatically synthesized from UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine and 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (lipid X) using a partially purified E. colidisaccharide synthase preparation (30Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14859-14867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3-aza-DS-1-P was made in the same manner except that 3-aza-lipid X (31Haselberger A. Hildebrandt J. Lam C. Liehl E. Loibner H. Macher I. Rosenwirth B. Schütze E. Vyplel H. Unger F.M. Triangle. 1987; 26: 33-49Google Scholar) was used in place of lipid X. Base-treated DS-1-P was made by treating 2 mg of DS-1-P for 30 min with 0.2 m NaOH in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The mixture was diluted 10-fold with chloroform/methanol (95:5) and loaded onto a 5-ml silica column equilibrated with 50 ml of chloroform/methanol (95:5). The column was washed with 25 ml of each of the following ratios (v/v) of chloroform/methanol: 95:5, 90:10, 70:30, 1:1, 30:70, and 20:80. Thirty 5-ml fractions were collected. The resolved hydroxy fatty acids and the deacylated DS-1-P were detected by spotting 5 μl of each fraction onto a thin layer chromatography plate, developing the plate in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v), and charring with sulfuric acid. The hydroxy fatty acids eluted with the 70:30 (v/v) solvent mixture. The base-treated, deacylated DS-1-P eluted with the 1:1 solvent ratio. The relevant fractions were pooled, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The base-treated, deacylated 3-aza-DS-1-P was prepared in the same manner. The elution profile for this compound was the same as for the base-treated, deacylated DS-1-P. For use as substrates in 4′-kinase assays, all lipid substrates were dispersed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, by sonic irradiation for 2 min. Fresh lysates of the Kohara λ library were made following the method of Clementz et al. with slight modifications (23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The host E. coli strain, W3110, was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium, supplemented with 0.2% maltose and 10 mm MgSO4. The culture was diluted 1:1 with 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2. The λ lysates used by Clementz et al.(23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were diluted 1:100 and 1:1000 in SM buffer (5.8 g of NaCl, 2 g of MgSO4, 50 ml of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, per liter). Using 96-well microtiter plates, 5 μl of the individual diluted lysates and 10 μl of the diluted host cell suspension were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. LB medium supplemented with 10 mm MgSO4 (150 μl) was added to each well, and incubation continued at 37 °C. After 4 h, theA600 of each well was measured using a Molecular Dynamics Spectramax 250 microplate reader. When the cell suspension had cleared to an A600 less than 0.1, it was considered lysed and was transferred to a fresh microtiter plate at 4 °C. Lysis was evaluated every hour until 8 h after infection. The lysates originating from the 1:1000 dilution of the originals were chosen for assay. Any hybrid λ bacteriophages that did not yield fresh suitable lysates with the 1:1000 dilutions of the original stock were generally obtained from the 1:100 dilutions of the original stock. The final lysates were stored at −80 °C overnight. The 4′-kinase activity of each lysate was assayed in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of lysate, 100 μm DS-1-32P (1000 cpm/nmol), 1 mg/ml cardiolipin, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm ATP, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmMgCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by spotting 5 μl onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. The plates were developed in chloforom/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v), dried, and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screen. Conversion of DS-1-32P to [1-32P]lipid IVA was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The gene encoded by the open reading frameorfE was cloned into pET3a cloning vector (Novagen).orfE was amplified by polymerase chain reaction of E. coli W3110 genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (according to the manufacturer's specifications) and the following primers: 5′-GTTTGGCATATGATCGAAAAAATCTGG-3′ and 5′-ATTCATGGATCCATCAATCGAACGCTG-3′. The first primer introduces aNdeI site at the start codon of orfE, and the second primer introduces a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into a similarly cut pET3a vector. A portion of the ligation reaction was transformed intoE. coli SURE cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant clones and was digested with BamHI andNdeI to identify those constructs that contained the desired 1-kilobase pair insert. One correct plasmid was designated pJK2. pJK2 was transformed into BLR(DE3)pLysS cells and grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB. When the cultures reached an A600 of 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (final concentration of 1 mm) to induce expression of theorfE gene product. After 3 h of induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with 1 liter of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 30 ml of the wash buffer. Cells were broken in a cold French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i., and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,500 × g to form the cell-free extract. The membrane and soluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation of the entire cell-free extract at 150,000 ×g for 60 min. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was removed to a fresh tube, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The soluble fraction and the resuspended membranes were both centrifuged a second time. The final membrane pellet was resuspended by homogenization in 10 ml of the HEPES buffer and stored frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. The membrane-free cytosol was also stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Two methods for analyzing 4′-kinase activity of various protein fractions were employed. The first (method 1) utilizes DS-1-32P as the labeled substrate. Typically, 100 μm DS-1-32P (1000 cpm/nmol), 1 mg/ml cardiolipin, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm ATP, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmMgCl2 are mixed with 0.5–500 μg/ml protein fraction and incubated at 30 °C for various times. Reactions were stopped by spotting a portion of the reaction onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. Plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v) and analyzed as described above. Method 2 (which is not intended for the quantitative determination of specific activities) utilizes [γ-32P]ATP (∼ 8 × 106 cpm/nmol) as the labeled substrate. The reaction conditions are exactly the same as for method 1, except that the ATP concentration is lowered to 0.6 μm and only nonradioactive DS-1-P (final concentration of 100 μm) is added. The reactions were stopped as described above, and plates were developed in chloroform/pyridine/formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v/v/v). Kohara et al. (24Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) have generated a library of 3400 mapped hybrid λ bacteriophage clones that covers theE. coli genome. A subset of this library containing 476 λ clones is available that covers 99% of the genome with some overlap between the clones (23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Clementz et al. showed that enzymatic activity could be detected in E. coli lysates produced by these hybrid λ clones (23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Activities of several enzymes involved in LPS biosynthesis were detected, and lysates generated from the λ clones containing the gene coding for the enzymes of interest displayed 5–10-fold overproduction of the activities (23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Assay of each individual λ lysate for overproduction of the lauroyltransferase (Fig. 1) led to the identification ofhtrB as the structural gene for that enzyme (23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We employed the same approach to identify the gene for the lipid A 4′-kinase. The 4′-kinase activity was assayed in the lysates using method 1 (DS-1-32P and 5 mm ATP). Under these conditions, product formation was linear with respect to time and protein concentration (data not shown), there were no side products, and the results were reproducible for a given lysate. Fresh λ lysates of W3110 were prepared and assayed for 4′-kinase activity in six sets of 80. Fig. 2 shows the assay results for one set, hybrid λ clones [201]4H7 to [280]22E3. No single lysate in the collection gave the 5–10-fold overproduction seen with other enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis (23Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, there were several lysates with significantly higher activity than their neighboring lysates (Fig. 2). To choose lysates for further analysis, the mean and standard deviation values for each set of 80 were calculated. Fifteen clones, the activity of which surpassed the mean by more than two standard deviations, were reassayed (data not shown). One lysate, [218]E1D1 (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 2) consistently displayed 2–2.5-fold more kinase activity than the other lysates. Differences in lysis time could account for some of the variation of the activities seen in the lysates. The original lysates used to make the library were not generated from a fixed titer. To control for this variation among lysates, the plaque-forming units (pfu) for lysates derived from λ clones [216]13E3, [217]6D12, [218]E1D1, and [320]15G10 were determined (Fig. 3). Matched lysates were then made by infe"

These ubiquitous factors form homo- and heterodimers and recognize in vitro a CACGTG core sequence termed E box. Through binding to E boxes of target genes, USF factors have been demonstrated to activate gene transcription and to enhance expression of some genes in response to various stimuli. In particular, in the liver USF1 and USF2 have been shown to bind in vitroglucose/carbohydrate response elements of glycolytic and lipogenic genes and have been proposed, from ex vivo experiments, to be involved in their transcriptional activation by glucose. However, the direct involvement of these factors in gene expression and nutrient gene regulation in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, to gain insight into the specific role of USF1 and USF2in vivo, and in particular to determine whether the USF products are required for the response of genes to glucose, we have created, by homologous recombination, USF2 −/− mice.

Glucose is a major source of metabolic energy for all mammalian cells. In the liver, glucose metabolism begins or ends with the movement of glucose into or out of the hepatocyte. When hormonal conditions favor glucose utilization (high insulin, low glucagon), glucose entry is facilitated along a downhill gradient through the specific GLUT2 transporter, and intracellular glucose is rapidly phosphorylated (1Pilkis S.J.

Two such glucose-responsive genes have been extensively studied in the liver, i.e. the genes for L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), 1The abbreviations used are: L-PK, L-type pyruvate kinase; S14, Spot 14; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; kb, kilobase pair(s); ES, embryonic stem.1The abbreviations used are: L-PK, L-type pyruvate kinase; S14, Spot 14; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; kb, kilobase pair(s); ES, embryonic stem. a glycolytic enzyme, and Spot 14 (S14), a protein associated with lipogenesis. Transient transfection assays in primary hepatocytes have allowed for the identification of a common glucose response element, termed GlRE by our group and ChoRE, for carbohydrate response element, by the group of H. Towle, in the regulatory regions of the L-PK and S14 genes (5Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional importance of the GlRE has been further demonstratedin vivo using transgenic mice (9Cuif M.H. Porteu A. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13769-13772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The L-PK GlRE (located between nucleotides −168 and −144, with respect to the liver-specific start site of transcription) and the S14 ChoRE (between nucleotides −1448 and −1422) present a similar arrangement consisting of two E boxes separated by 5 base pairs (10Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The so-called E box consensus CACGTG is the recognition site for members of the Myc family of transcription factors characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine-zipper domain responsible for dimerization and DNA binding (11Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 621-702PubMed Google Scholar). Through binding to their DNA target as homo- or heterodimers, these factors are known to regulate a variety of genes (12Henrion A. Martinez A. Mattei M.G. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Genomics. 1995; 25: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Henrion A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the liver, the predominant members of this family able to recognize the L-PK GlREin vitro are USF factors (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These USF factors were originally described as a binding activity able to interact and to transactivate the adenovirus major late promoter (15Sawadogo M. Roeder R. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Purification of this activity revealed the presence of two polypeptides of 43 (USF1) and 44 kDa (USF2a) (16Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two forms of USF are encoded by distinct genes that have been cloned and characterized in the mouse (12Henrion A. Martinez A. Mattei M.G. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Genomics. 1995; 25: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Henrion A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Aperlo C. Boulukos K. Sage J. Cuzin F. Pognonec P. Genomics. 1996; 37: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,18Lin Q. Luo X. Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23894-23903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These genes are widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and we have assessed that, in the liver, the USF1/USF2a heterodimer accounted for more than 65% of the USF binding activity (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Besides, we have shown that, when transfected into hepatoma cells, USF isoforms were able to interfere with the glucose response of the L-PK gene (19Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To test for the possible involvement of USF2 in the glucose-mediated induction of hepatic gene expression in vivo and to fully reveal its biological role, we sought to examine mice with a null mutation for USF2. To this end, we have created a mouse USF2 −/− line by disrupting the USF2 locus by gene targeting. In this paper, we present the first model of USF2 −/− mice and provide evidence that, in the liver, USF2 proteins are needed in vivo for a normal transcriptional response of the L-PK and S14 genes to glucose. The USF2 genomic fragments were all generated from λ clones isolated from a murine ES-129 embryonic stem cell line genomic library (12Henrion A. Martinez A. Mattei M.G. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Genomics. 1995; 25: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ES culture and embryo manipulation were performed as described (20). A 7.5-kb XhoI-NotI fragment, encompassing part of exon 7 and the almost totality of intron 7, was blunted, modified by the addition of NotI linkers, and subcloned into the 3′NotI site of the previously reported internal ribosomal entry site-βgeo containing vector (21Mountford P. Smith A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This plasmid wasSalI-digested, and the 5′ USF2 homologous fragment, consisting of a 1.8-kb XhoI-XhoI fragment spanning from intron 1 to exon 7, was inserted. The resulting targeting construct was linearized at the unique XhoI site, and 60 μg was used to electroporate 1 × 107 CCB-ES cells derived from 129Sv/J mice (kindly provided by Martin Evans, Cambridge, UK), which were cultured on mitomycin-treated embryonic fibroblast feeder layers. DNA from clones surviving G418 selection (200 μg/ml) were individually analyzed on Southern blot. DNA was eitherEcoRI-digested and hybridized with a 5′ external probe consisting of a genomic EcoRV-BamHI fragment in the 5′ regulatory sequences of the USF2 gene (see Fig. 1 A) or EcoRV-digested and hybridized with a 3′ external probe consisting of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment encompassing exon 8 to exon 10. ES cells from positive clones were injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6J mice (20). Chimeric males, as judged by the agouti coat color, were mated to wild-type C57BL/6J female for the germ line transmission. Mice heterozygous for the gene targeting event were then used to generate homozygous mutant USF2 −/− mice. Genotyping of offspring was performed by Southern blot analysis with 10 μg of EcoRI-digested mouse tail DNA. For metabolic studies, animals were fed a high carbohydrate diet, for either 18 h (after a 24-h fasting), 40 h, or 5 days. Mice were sacrificed between 10 and 12 a.m. and tissue samples were stored at −80 °C. Each animal was referenced with a double number, the first one indicating the litter and the second one the animal figure. Serum insulin levels were determined using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Behring Diagnostics) with human insulin as standard, and glucose levels were determined with glucose oxidase using a Sigma kit. The level of glucose 6-P in crude liver extract was measured as described previously (22Davidson A. Arion W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Liver samples were homogenized in 1 ml of 6% (w/v) perchloric acid. Denatured proteins were sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was neutralized with KOH in the presence of 20 μl of phenol red. The resulting potassium perchlorate was discarded by centrifugation (10 min at 12,000 × g). Glucose 6-P in 0.45 ml of the neutralized extract was quantified by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm in an assay system of 1 ml containing 1 mm NADP+, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, and 1.7 unit of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (Torula Yeast). A glucose 6-P control was used to assess the reliability of the assay. Subsequently, the amount of total proteins for each liver sample was determined using the Coomassie Blue staining, and the results were expressed in nmol of glucose 6-P per mg of proteins. After an overnight fasting, −/− and +/+ animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of avertin. A 40-mg glucose load was administered into the stomach through a cannula. Blood was sampled from the tail vein at time 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min after glucose ingestion, and glucose was determined using a Glucometer II and Glucostix strips (Ames). RNAs were purified by a modified guanidium chloride procedure from frozen liver, and Northern blot analysis was conducted as described previously (23Cuif M.H. Cognet M. Boquet D. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For detection of L-PK mRNAs, a rat cDNA clone (clone G4), encompassing the coding sequence was used (24Lone Y. Simon M. Kahn A. Marie J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For GLUT2 detection, a rat GLUT2 cDNA was kindly provided by Bernard Thorens (Lausanne, Switzerland). For S14 detection, a polymerase chain reaction-made fragment corresponding to the murine coding sequence was used as a probe (25Liaw C.W. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7253-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each Northern blot was stripped and reprobed with a ribosomal 18 S cDNA, to check for the integrity and the amount of loaded RNAs. Fetal liver samples assayed for L-PK content were homogenized in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), the supernatant proteins were quantified using the Coomassie Blue stain with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the separated proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes in the presence of 10% (v/v) methanol. Efficiency of transfer was checked with Ponceau S staining. After blocking nonspecific protein binding sites for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline-Tween reagent (TBS-T) containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, the blot was incubated with L-PK antibody (26Marie J. Kahn A. Boivin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution for 1.5 h at room temperature. Following three 15-min washes in TBST, the secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit (Dako), was added at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed again as above, and peroxidase activity was detected by fluorography using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). To ensure comparable loading of the samples, the blot was incubated with an anti-annexin V antibody. Specific bands were quantified by scanning the autoradiographs with a Shimadzu densitometer. Adult liver samples assayed for USF2 content were homogenized in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets “COMPLETE”™ (Boehringer Mannheim). Western blot analyses were performed as described above, using affinity purified USF2 1–49 antibodies at a 1:200 dilution (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the DNA binding reaction was performed as described previously (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 μg of whole cell extract proteins, 10 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1–0.5 ng of end-labeled major late promoter oligonucleotides. For supershift experiments, USF1 and USF2 antibodies were included in the binding reactions (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Quality of the extracts was checked by analyzing the ubiquitous NFY binding activities. DNA-binding complexes separated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the relative amount of radioactivity was measured by volume integration with the ImageQuant software. To inactivate the USF2 gene, a replacement vector was constructed with 9.3 kb of ES-129 derived genomic fragment and a selection cassette disrupting exon 7 (Fig. 1 A). Ensured that the USF2 gene was active in embryonic stem (ES) cells, we carried out a promoter trap strategy to maximize the targeting frequency. To this end, the promoterless internal ribosomal entry site-βgeo cassette was chosen as the selection cassette. This cassette allows, via an internal ribosomal entry site element, for efficient translation of the βgeo fusion transcript which leads to the synthesis of a fusion protein with both β-galactosidase and neomycin activities (21Mountford P. Smith A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Successful targeting should abolish the transcriptional function of USF2 by disrupting the basic domain, encoded by exon 7, responsible for its DNA binding. After electroporation and selection of recombinant ES cells, homologous recombinants were detected by Southern analysis. Among them, one targeted stem cell clone contributed particularly to the germ line of chimeric mice. After transmission of the mutation, heterozygous progeny, which were normal and fertile, were intercrossed to produce homozygous offspring. The presence of the mutated gene in the F2 offspring was routinely checked by Southern analysis of tail DNA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, hybridization of EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs with the indicated 5′ external probe led to wild-type alleles of 12.5 kb and mutated alleles of 8.5 kb. Of the 110 F2 offspring analyzed after cesarean section at 19 days post-coitum, 21.8% were homozygous (−/−) for the disrupted allele and 25.4% were wild type (+/+), indicating that USF2 deficiency did not affect embryonic development. However, after birth, survival of homozygous mice was markedly affected by disruption of the USF2 gene. Indeed, only 20% homozygous mice survived a few hours after birth. The USF2 −/− mice were significantly smaller in size than their littermates. This decrease in body weight (approximately 20%) was already evident at the embryo stage of 17.5 days and either stabilized or dramatically increased after birth. Based on this body size criterion, we were able to significantly improve survival of −/− mice, by reducing the litter size. Still, the lifespan of surviving mice was variable. This increase in the survival of USF2 −/− mice suggested that part of the lethal phenotype could be due, at least, to competition for food as homozygotes seemed more apathetic than their littermates. Phenotype of the knock-out mice will be presented in detail elsewhere. Disruption of the USF2 gene resulted in the complete absence of USF2 protein in −/− animals. This was ascertained by immunoblotting of liver nuclear proteins of −/−, −/+, and +/+ animals with an anti-USF2 specific antibody (Fig. 2 A). The 44-kDa USF2a protein was detected only in extracts from heterozygous and wild-type animals. The reduced level of USF2 in −/+ animals, as compared with the +/+ animals, suggested the failure of the wild-type USF2 allele to compensate for the mutation. To determine the changes in the composition of USF binding activity, the same nuclear extracts were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the canonical E box from the adenovirus major late promoter. As visualized in Fig. 2 B, in +/+ extracts, a major band migrating as the control USF1/USF2 heterodimer of the rat liver nuclear extract was observed. The same complex, although less intense, was detected in the −/+ extracts. A fainter and slightly lower band was observed in the −/− extracts which was reminiscent to that observed in rat liver USF2-immunodepleted extracts (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To precisely determine the nature of this complex, we used USF1 and USF2 antibodies (Fig. 2 C). As previously observed, USF1 and USF2 homodimers, visualized as weak bands after supershift with either USF1 or USF2 antibody, appeared to be minor complexes in the liver nuclear extracts of the +/+ and −/+ mice. On the contrary, in −/− nuclear extracts, the use of USF1 antibody fully displaced the observed complex, and the USF2 antibody had no effect. This revealed that, in vitro, the only detectable binding activity on the E boxes, in extracts from animals devoid of USF2, was the USF1 homodimer. By assessing the quantity of USF1 homodimer in −/− extracts, we could speculate that the expression of USF1 gene was poorly affected by the absence of USF2. To test this, RNA samples from the liver of −/− and +/+ mice were assayed by Northern blot using specific USF1 probe. This analysis revealed indeed no change in the USF1 gene expression (data not shown). This result was consistent with our previous observation indicating the absence of E box in the USF1 gene sequence (13Henrion A. Vaulont S. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine the impact of USF2 deficiency on L-PK gene expression, our first experiments were conducted on fetuses of several littermates. After cesarean section at the end of gestation, each fetal liver was homogenized, and the content of L-PK protein was assessed by Western blot analyses using specific L-PK antibody. The signals were quantitated and averaged out into −/−, −/+, and +/+ groups after genotyping. As shown on the histogram of Fig. 3, the amount of L-PK protein was significantly reduced in liver of −/− fetuses. To study further the glucose responsiveness of hepatic gene expression, a series of metabolic analyses was performed on wild-type and surviving USF2 −/− mice. After an 18-h refeeding period with a high carbohydrate diet, animals were sacrificed, and total liver RNAs were prepared and analyzed by Northern blot to assess the content of L-PK and S14 messenger RNAs. This analysis revealed that, in the liver of all the −/− animals tested, the amount of both L-PK and S14 mRNAs was markedly lowered as compared with the +/+ animals (Fig. 4 A). In ad libitumfed animals, the amount of both L-PK and S14 mRNAs was not significantly different (data not shown). After a 40-h feeding period with a high carbohydrate diet, the difference in the level of L-PK and S14 mRNAs was still obvious except for the 17.1 mouse that did contain relatively high level of mRNAs (Fig. 4 B). However, after 5 days on this high carbohydrate diet, −/− and +/+ animals displayed similar levels of L-PK and S14 mRNAs (Fig. 4 C). To assign the diminution in the level of L-PK and S14 mRNAs, observed 18 h after glucose refeeding, to the transcriptional state of the genes rather than to a putative alteration of glucose metabolism, several steps, from blood glucose disposal to cellular glucose utilization, were carefully checked. Blood glucose disposal was first assessed by performing an oral glucose tolerance test in fasted mice. As shown in Fig. 5, after the glucose load, glucose accumulation was quite similar in +/+ and −/− animals. To further challenge glucose homeostasis in −/− animals, blood glucose concentration was assayed in fasted and refed animals. The absence of USF2 seemed to have no effect on the glycemia of either fasted animals (series not shown) or refed animals (1.8 ± 0.5 (n= 7) and 1.6 ± 0.4 (n = 10) g/liter glucose for the −/− and +/+ groups, respectively, Table I). The next step was to confirm that insulin was correctly synthesized and secreted in response to oral glucose, as suggested from the normal plasma glucose levels. As monitored, neither the amount of pancreatic insulin messenger RNA (not shown) nor the plasma insulinemia (Table I) was modified in USF2 −/− refed mice.Table IConcentration of glucose, insulin, and glucose-6-P in USF2 +/+ and −/−miceAnimals+/+−/−4.12.55.16.17.18.19.110.111.112.113.11.21.36.28.212.217.1Glucose1.571.971.481.832.321.451.871.451.261.182.131.321.622.471.121.512.44InsulinND7.6ND13.515.510.8165.84.232ND1-aND, not determined7.281211.7920Glucose 6-P6.24.8ND4.44.35.77.44.579ND3.34.17.177.38.1Serum level of glucose (in g/liter, as determined with a glucose oxidase kit) and insulin (in microunits/ml, as determined with an insulin radioimmunoassay kit) and hepatic glucose 6-P content (in nmol/mg proteins) are indicated for the −/− and +/+ animals refed a carbohydrate-rich diet for 18 h .1-a ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Serum level of glucose (in g/liter, as determined with a glucose oxidase kit) and insulin (in microunits/ml, as determined with an insulin radioimmunoassay kit) and hepatic glucose 6-P content (in nmol/mg proteins) are indicated for the −/− and +/+ animals refed a carbohydrate-rich diet for 18 h . The second part was to evaluate glucose entry and phosphorylation, which in hepatocytes involve the specific GLUT2 transporter, and hexokinase IV or glucokinase (1Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 2Pessin J. Bell G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This coupled transport/phosphorylation system forms part of a glucose sensing apparatus that responds to subtle changes in blood concentration. Therefore, GLUT2 gene expression was assessed by Northern blot analysis and, in fact, as shown in Fig. 6, the hepatic amount of GLUT2 mRNA remained unchanged in USF2 −/− mice. To monitor glucose phosphorylation into glucose 6-P, we measured directly the intracellular concentration of glucose 6-P in the liver of the animals. The results, presented in Table I, demonstrated that the glucose 6-P concentration was roughly similar in both −/− and +/+ groups, 6.2 ± 2.0 (n = 10) and 5.9 ± 1.6 (n = 7) nmol/mg proteins, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of glycogen in liver section of USF2 −/− mice was also noted by histochemical staining (data not shown), indicating a normal capacity of the liver for glycogen replenishment after refeeding. Taken together, these results were indicative of an apparent normal glucose uptake and utilization by the liver of the knock-out mice. In the USF2 −/− mice presented in this paper, we have primarily studied glucose metabolism and expression of glucose-responsive genes in the liver. In the adult USF2 −/− mice refed a high carbohydrate diet, we have assessed that glucose was available, normally transported, and phosphorylated in hepatocytes. Indeed, in these mice, glycemia was normal, the specific facilitative transporter GLUT2 that provides glucose to the hepatocytes was present, and glucose phosphorylation to glucose 6-P was normal as judged from the normal accumulation of glucose 6-P in the liver of −/− mice. Nevertheless, in the liver of these animals, we observed a significant diminution of the L-PK and S14 gene expression 18 h after glucose refeeding, whereas in ad libitum fed mice, no difference was detected. This result, obtained in adult liver of USF2 −/− mice, was consistent with the 64% reduction in the amount of L-PK protein noticed in the liver of −/− fetuses at the end of gestation, when the L-PK promoter begins to be active (27Scott R. Yeoh G. Differentiation. 1983; 25: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We conclude therefore that,in vivo, USF2 proteins are required for a normal kinetics of transcriptional induction of the two genes by glucose. This induction is thought to depend on the nature of the glucose-response complex assembled on the GlRE/ChoRE of the L-PK and S14. Although the exact role of USF proteins in this complex remains disputed (28Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), evidence argues for their important involvement, in cooperation with other still unknown factors (19Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Very recently, Kennedy et al. (29Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate that microinjection of USF antibodies specifically inhibited the glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter in INS-1 rat insulinoma cells. Therefore, we carefully characterized USF binding activity in the liver of animals refed a high carbohydrate diet for 18 h. As previously reported in rat (14Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), USF1/USF2a heterodimers are largely predominant in the liver nuclear extracts from normal mice. In contrast, in nuclear extracts purified from the USF2 −/− mice, the USF binding activity is exclusively accounted for by USF1 homodimers, suggesting that no endogenous factor could replace USF2 in −/− mice. Therefore, the question why USF1 homodimers are less efficient than USF1/USF2 heterodimers in promoting glucose-induced gene expression arises. Several mechanisms could be proposed. USF1 homodimers could be in limiting concentration as compared with the heterodimers, consistent with a gene dosage effect. However, we were unable to detect any alteration of the L-PK and S14 gene expression in heterozygous mice. Binding of USF1 homodimers could modify the binding of the other transcriptional factors known to interact with the L-PK promoter (3Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This particular point was further documented by performing genomic footprintings on liver cells of −/− or +/+ refed animals. 2S. Lopez, unpublished data. In fact, the results indicate that in vivo occupancy of the L-PK promoter appears to be similar in USF2 −/− mice and normal mice. In particular, protection patterns on the GlRE are identical in −/− and +/+ mice. An alternative could be that USF dimers per se have different transactivating properties. Furthermore, since the NH2 activation domains of USF1 and USF2 are extremely different, they could specify differential interactions with other regulatory proteins (partners and/or coeffectors … ). To enlighten the respective role of USF1 and USF2, and to assess whether they are involved in regulating different sets of genes, we have undertaken the knock-out of the USF1 gene. When mice were fed for 5 days a high carbohydrate diet, as well as anad libitum regular diet, L-PK and S14 mRNAs content in the liver of USF2 −/− mice were not significantly different from USF2 +/+ mice. This result seems to indicate that the intrinsic transcriptional capabilities of glucose-responsive genes are normal in USF2 −/− mice but that kinetics of glucose-dependent activation is slow. Alternatively, an altered transcriptional rate could be compensated by progressive accumulation of stable mRNAs. Indeed, we previously reported that L-PK mRNAs appear to be very stable in carbohydrate refed animals (30Vaulont S. Munnich A. Decaux J.F. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7621-7625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we confirm in this paper that USF factors are involved in the normal response of hepatic glucose-responsive genes to glucose and that USF1 homodimers cannot totally replace the predominant USF1/USF2 heterodimers normally present on the GlRE/ChoRE of the L-PK and S14 genes. Further investigations will determine the respective role of USF1 and USF2 in the transcriptional response to glucose. The mechanisms of the other phenotypic abnormalities associated with deficiency in these factors will be investigated in USF2 −/− mice, for instance, growth delay, relatively apathetic and increased post-natal lethality which is not obviously related to the decreased transcriptional activation by glucose in the liver.

There is growing evidence that the binding of vWf to these receptors is not only essential for stable platelet adhesion but is also important for the transduction of activation signals required for changes in platelet morphology, granule secretion, and platelet aggregation. In this study we have investigated signaling events induced by vWf binding to GP Ib-V-IX in both spreading and aggregated platelets. The adhesion of platelets to vWf resulted in dramatic actin filament reorganization, as assessed by immunofluorescence with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin, and the cytoskeletal recruitment of various structural proteins (talin and integrin αIIbβ3) and signaling enzymes (pp60c- src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-1B). Time course experiments in both spreading and aggregated platelets revealed that talin, FAK, and PTP-1B were proteolyzed after translocation to the cytoskeleton. The proteolysis of these proteins was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and was specifically inhibited by pretreating platelets with the membrane-permeable calpain inhibitors calpeptin, E64d, and MDL 28,170, but not with the membrane-impermeable inhibitors leupeptin, E64, and calpastatin. The cytoskeletal translocation of signaling enzymes in vWf-stimulated platelets was abolished by pretreating platelets with an anti-GP Ib-V-IX antibody but was unaffected by blocking ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3. In contrast, calpain activation in vWf-stimulated platelets required ligand binding to both GP Ib-V-IX and integrin αIIbβ3. The activation of calpain in both spreading and aggregated platelets resulted in a substantial decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins and was associated with a 50–80% reduction in the amount of cytoskeletal associated talin, integrin αIIbβ3, PI 3-kinase, FAK, pp60c- src, and PTP-1B. These studies suggest a potentially important role for calpain in regulating the formation and/or stability of cytoskeletal signaling complexes in vWf-stimulated platelets.

Cell adhesion processes play a fundamental role in inflammation, immunity, embryogenesis, and hemostasis. These adhesion processes are regulated by distinct families of cell surface receptors, including the integrins, immunoglobulin gene family, cadherins, selectins, and the leucine-rich glycoprotein gene family, of which the receptor for vWf, 1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RGDS peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FAK, focal adhesion kinase.1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RGDS peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FAK, focal adhesion kinase.

There is growing evidence that many of these receptors not only mediate cell adhesion but also play an important role in transducing signals that regulate cell morphology, motility, growth, and differentiation (3Rosales C.

The molecular basis by which these receptors transmit signals has not been clearly defined, although there is increasing evidence that the interaction between these receptors and the cytoskeleton is critical for signal transduction (4Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). For example, studies in human platelets and a range of cultured cells have demonstrated that the ligation and clustering of integrins on the cell surface lead to the cytoskeletal recruitment of various structural proteins (talin, vinculin, α-actinin, tensin, paxillin) and signaling molecules (FAK, Src kinases, c-CSK, PI 3-kinase, protein kinase C, phospholipase Cγ, rasGAP, Grb2, SOS, SHP1, PTP-1B, Rho, Ras, Raf, MEK kinases, ERK1, ERK2 and calpain) (5Miyamoto S.

A potential candidate protein is the ubiquitous thiol protease, calpain. This enzyme has previously been localized to focal adhesions in cultured cells and in the cytoskeletal fraction of thrombin-stimulated platelets (18Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N.

Recent studies in thrombin-stimulated platelets have revealed that calpain cleavage of FAK and pp60c- src results in a reduction in their autokinase activity (23Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M.

Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that calpain may indirectly regulate the level of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation within the cell (28Ariyoshi H. Oda A. Salzman E.W. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cleavage of talin, pp60c- src, and FAK is associated with their subcellular relocation (23Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Oda A. Druker B.J. Ariyoshi H. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12603-12608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a potentially important role for calpain in regulating the stability of integrin signaling complexes.We have recently reported that vWf binding to GP Ib-V-IX induces the cytoskeletal association of pp60c- src and PI 3-kinase in aggregated platelets (29Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the critical role for this receptor in the initial adhesion of platelets to the site of vascular injury, we have investigated the possibility that vWf binding to GP Ib-V-IX can also induce the formation of cytoskeletal signaling complexes in spreading platelets. Our studies indicate that various structural proteins and signaling enzymes associate with the cytoskeletal fraction of platelets spread on a vWf matrix. The formation of these complexes was associated with calpain activation and the cleavage of talin, FAK, pp60c- src, and PTP-1B. Cleavage of these focal adhesion proteins in spreading and aggregated platelets was associated with a substantial reduction in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and a 50–80% decrease in the cytoskeletal content of integrin αIIbβ3, talin, FAK, pp60c- src, PTP-1B, and PI 3-kinase. These observations suggest a potentially important role for calpain in modulating the formation and/or stability of cytoskeletal signaling complexes in human platelets.DISCUSSIONThe stable adhesion of platelets to the site of vascular injury, particularly under conditions of high shear stress, is critically dependent on the coordinated binding of GP Ib-V-IX and integrin αIIbβ3 to subendothelial bound vWf (34Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that the interaction between vWf and these adhesion receptors plays an important role in the initiation of platelet activation, leading to platelet shape change, spreading, granule release, and aggregation (29Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Weiss H.J. Rodgers J. Brand H. J. Clin.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Despite the fundamental importance of these adhesion events, the signaling processes linked to these receptors, especially GP Ib-V-IX, remain poorly understood. The studies presented in this article reveal the following information regarding signaling processes induced by the binding of vWf to human platelets. First, vWf is capable of inducing the cytoskeletal translocation of multiple structural proteins and signaling enzymes in both spreading and aggregated platelets. The cytoskeletal association of these signaling molecules in aggregated platelets requires vWf binding to GP Ib-V-IX but occurs independently of ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3. Second, vWf stimulation of platelets induces calpain activation, leading to the limited proteolysis of talin, PTP-1B, FAK, and pp60c- src. The activation of calpain by vWf is distinct from the formation of cytoskeletal signaling complexes in that it requires ligand binding to both GP Ib-V-IX and integrin αIIbβ3. Finally, the activation of calpain in vWf-stimulated platelets results in a substantial decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins and is associated with a 50–80% reduction in the cytoskeletal content of integrin αIIbβ3, talin, pp60c- src, FAK, PTP-1B, and PI 3-kinase.Previous studies in suspension-activated platelets have clearly established a central role for integrin αIIbβ3 in regulating the formation of cytoskeletal signaling complexes. Studies in thrombin-stimulated platelets have suggested that fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3 induces cytoskeletal reorganization and the translocation of multiple signaling enzymes to the cytoskeleton (7Grondin P. Plantavid M. Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15705-15709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 per se does not appear to be sufficient for the formation of these signaling complexes, as these events only occur after stirring the platelet suspensions to induce platelet aggregation (8Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a similar phenomenon in vWf-stimulated platelets, whereby the binding of vWf to GP Ib-V-IX induces the translocation of signaling enzymes when these cells are stirred and allowed to aggregate (29Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that vWf binding to GP Ib-V-IX induces cytoskeletal changes similar to those observed following fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3. Recent studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX support these findings, as they demonstrate that binding of transfected cells to vWf induces cell spreading and the extension of pseudopodia. These changes in cell morphology appear to be regulated in part by the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of GP Ibα with the cytoskeleton, as truncation of this tail resulted in a significant alteration in both the morphology and adhesion of these cells (43Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated under a variety of different experimental conditions that the activation of calpain by vWf requires ligand binding to both GP Ib-V-IX and integrin αIIbβ3. A similar requirement for integrin αIIbβ3 in calpain activation has been reported previously in thrombin-stimulated platelets (36Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Groll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which this receptor regulates calpain activity has yet to be established. Studies in platelets have suggested an important role for inositol phospholipids and calcium influx in inducing calpain activation (21Fox J.E.B. Reynolds C.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9973-9981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The more highly phosphorylated phosphoinositides (phosphoinositide 4-phosphate and 4,5-bisphosphate) appear to be most effective in lowering the calcium requirement for calpain activation (44Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in cultured cells and platelets have demonstrated an important role for integrins in regulating the formation of phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate and D-3 phosphoinositides (45McNamee H.M. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 121: 673-678Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 46Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G. Levy-Toledano S. Caen J.P. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23554-23557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin αIIbβ3 can regulate the influx of calcium in response to a variety of physiological agonists, including vWf (47Chow T.W. Hellums J.D. Moake J.L. Kroll M.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Bertolino G. Noris P. Spedini P. Balduini C.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whether these integrin αIIbβ3-regulated signaling processes are directly responsible for calpain activation in vWf-stimulated platelets will require further investigation.Studies of calpain activation in human platelets have been confined to suspension-activated platelets. We have demonstrated here that calpain activation occurs in surface-activated platelets, in the absence of added exogenous agonists or platelet aggregation. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the observed proteolysis of talin, FAK, PTP-1B, and pp60c- src occurredin vivo and was not a post-lysis phenomenon. First, proteolysis of these substrates was not only observed when spreading platelets were lysed with Triton X-100, but also when the cells were directly solubilized in SDS reducing buffer and boiled immediately. Second, proteolysis was prevented by pretreating platelets with membrane-permeable calpain inhibitors such as calpeptin, E64d, and MDL and not by membrane-impermeable inhibitors such as leupeptin, E64, or calpastatin. Finally, pretreating platelets with the membrane-permeable inhibitors of calpain resulted in increased cytoskeletal content of integrin αIIbβ3, talin, PTP-1B, FAK, pp60c- src, and PI 3-kinase and enhanced total cell protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas membrane-impermeable calpain inhibitors had no effect on these signaling events.The observation that calpain is activated in spreading platelets challenges the view that calpain activation only occurs as a post-platelet aggregation event. The ability of this protease to regulate the cytoskeletal content of a range of focal adhesion structural proteins and signaling enzymes raises the possibility that this protease may regulate cell matrix-adhesive processes. Inhibiting calpain activation with a number of different calpain inhibitors, including calpeptin, calpain inhibitor-1, E64d, and MDL, has had no demonstrable inhibitory effect on the rate of platelet adhesion or spreading on a vWf matrix in our static adhesion assays. These conditions do not, however, mimic the situation in vivo, in which platelets adhere and spread at sites of vascular injury over a wide range of shear stresses. It is possible under these conditions that the calpain-mediated reduction in cytoskeletal-associated adhesion complexes may lead to alterations in the stability of adhesion contacts. Future platelet adhesion studies under a variety of flow conditions will be required to resolve these issues.Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the key structural elements and signaling molecules involved in the assembly of cytoskeletal signaling complexes (4Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), there is far less information available regarding potential negative regulators of these processes. The studies presented here, as well as recent observations demonstrating calpain-mediated down-regulation of the kinase activity and cytoskeletal attachment of pp60c- src and FAK (23Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Oda A. Druker B.J. Ariyoshi H. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the regulation of its protease activity by integrins (36Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Groll D.E. J.

Cell adhesion processes play a fundamental role in inflammation, immunity, embryogenesis, and hemostasis. These adhesion processes are regulated by distinct families of cell surface receptors, including the integrins, immunoglobulin gene family, cadherins, selectins, and the leucine-rich glycoprotein gene family, of which the receptor for vWf, 1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RGDS peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FAK, focal adhesion kinase.1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RGDS peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FAK, focal adhesion kinase.

There is growing evidence that many of these receptors not only mediate cell adhesion but also play an important role in transducing signals that regulate cell morphology, motility, growth, and differentiation (3Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The molecular basis by which these receptors transmit signals has not been clearly defined, although there is increasing evidence that the interaction between these receptors and the cytoskeleton is critical for signal transduction (4Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). For example, studies in human platelets and a range of cultured cells have demonstrated that the ligation and clustering of integrins on the cell surface lead to the cytoskeletal recruitment of various structural proteins (talin, vinculin, α-actinin, tensin, paxillin) and signaling molecules (FAK, Src kinases, c-CSK, PI 3-kinase, protein kinase C, phospholipase Cγ, rasGAP, Grb2, SOS, SHP1, PTP-1B, Rho, Ras, Raf, MEK kinases, ERK1, ERK2 and calpain) (5Miyamoto S.

A stable domain comprising the amino-terminal 118 residues was identified that was still capable of ribosome binding and thus represents a novel structural and functional element of trigger factor. Trigger factor was first identified in Escherichia coli(1Crooke E. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5216-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) but meanwhile has also been found in other bacteria (2Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was isolated by its activity to promote in vitro the translocation of precursors of the outer membrane protein A (proOmpA) into membrane vesicles (3Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Crooke E. Brundage L. Rice M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1831-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Trigger factor is associated with ribosomes prepared from cell extracts and binds to purified large ribosomal subunits (5Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) known to contain the exit site for nascent polypeptide chains. These findings led to the earlier proposal that trigger factor acts as a secretion-specific chaperone to shuttle precursors of secretory proteins from their place of synthesis to membrane translocation sites (5Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, E. coli cells depleted of trigger factor do not show secretion defects (6Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, trigger factor was identified as a ribosome-associated peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) 1The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase; FKBP, FK506 binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (7Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The purified protein catalyzed the prolyl isomerization-dependent refolding of the unfolded protein substrate RNaseT1 much more efficiently than other PPIases tested before (7Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This high efficiency is due to the cooperation of PPIase and chaperone activities within the protein (8Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In independent studies, using in vitrotranslation systems, trigger factor was identified as a major cross-linking partner for nascent polypeptide chains of cytoplasmic and secretory proteins (9Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The association of trigger factor with ribosomes was found to be sensitive to the translational status. Translating ribosomes formed complexes with trigger factor that were resistant to high salt treatment and disrupted by puromycin-mediated release of the nascent polypeptide chains, whereas nontranslating ribosomes formed salt-sensitive complexes only (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Together, a scenario was proposed in which trigger factor, by virtue of its PPIase activity and an additional chaperone-like function, assists the folding of nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from the ribosome (7Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B.

A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, trigger factor functionally cooperates with the GroEL chaperone, as shown by its activity to promote the GroEL-dependent degradation of polypeptides in vivo (11Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The PPIase activity was localized in a central domain of trigger factor between amino acids 145 and 247/251 (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This assignment was predicted on the basis of a sequence similarity to FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-type PPIases (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Callebaut I. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and a hydrophobic cluster analysis (14Callebaut I. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and experimentally verified by limited proteolysis of the native protein (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The isolated PPIase domain was ∼1000-fold less active than full-length trigger factor in refolding of RNaseT1, indicating that the flanking amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal parts of its polypeptide chain are required for high refolding activity (8Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We now set out to identify the domain of trigger factor that mediates ribosome binding. This domain is likely to be central to a putative mechanism that targets trigger factor to nascent polypeptide chains. Assuming a modular structure of the protein, we designed recombinant fragments of trigger factor on the basis of the structural information obtained by limited proteolysis. They comprise the amino-terminal part of the polypeptide chain, TF (1–144), the central FKBP domain, TF (145–247), the carboxyl-terminal portion, TF (248–432), or combinations thereof, TF (1–247) and TF (145–432). We found that the amino-terminal 118 amino acids of trigger factor as part of TF (1–144) are necessary and sufficient for specific ribosome binding. Plasmid pTIG2 (6Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the full-length, wild-typetig gene from E. coli served as a template for the polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of different gene fragments. The gene fragment corresponding to the first 144 codons oftig was amplified using the primer pair 5′-GGC CGG ATC CAT GCA AGT TTC AGT TGA AA-3′ (P1) and 5′-GGC CGG ATC CCA GAG TAT CCA GCA TGC CG-3′ (P4), the fragment corresponding to codons 145–247 using the primer pair 5′-GGC CGG ATC CCG TAA ACA GCA GGC GAC CT-3′ (P2) and 5′-GGC CGG ATC CTT CCG GCA GTT CAC GCT CT-3′ (P5), and the fragment corresponding to codons 248–432 using the primer pair 5′-GGC CGG ATC CCT GAC TGC AGA ATT CAT CA-3′ (P3) and 5′-GGC CGG ATC CCG CCT GCT GGT TCA TCA GC-3′ (P6). Fragments corresponding to codons 1–247 and 145–432 were amplified with the primer pairs P1/P5 and P2/P6, respectively. A gene fragment encoding the amino-terminal 118 amino acids of trigger factor was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the primers P1 and 5′-GGC CGG ATC CCT CGA GTT CAA CTT CCG GA-3′ (P7). Polymerase chain reactions were carried out with Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification products were purified, digested with BamHI, and ligated into the single BamHI site of the expression vector pDS56 RBSII, 6 × His (15Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Levkovits I. Pernis B. Immunological Methods. IV. Academic Press, Orlando1990: 121-152Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting expression products have four additional amino acids at the amino terminus (MRGS) and eight additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (RSHHHHHH). Ligations were transformed into E. coli DH5α containing pDMI,1 which encodes lacI q (16Lanzer, M. (1988) Untersuchungen zur Kompetition Zwischen Repressor und RNA-Polymerase um DNA-Bindungsorte. Ph. Thesis, University of Heidelberg.Google Scholar) followed by sequencing of the inserts. Clones with wild-type tigsequences were used for expression and purification of trigger factor fragments. A construct for the expression of full-length, His-tagged trigger factor was obtained by ligation of the two overlapping polymerase chain reaction-derived gene fragments at the singleAccI restriction site. For purification of the proteins, expression of the trigger factor fragments in DH5α containing pDMI,1 was induced at anA600 of 0.5 with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C in LB medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in the cold and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 15% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.6 at 4 °C). Following incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, the cells were frozen at −80 °C, thawed slowly on ice, and lyzed by the addition of a 4-fold volume of cold distilled water and brief sonication. After centrifugation (30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the cleared supernatants were loaded onto Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) columns equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6 at 4 °C) and 100 mm NaCl. Columns were washed with three column volumes buffer A containing 100, 200, and 500 mmNaCl, followed by step elution with 1 column volume each of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, and 200 mm imidazole in buffer A and 100 mm NaCl. Trigger factor peak fractions were either pooled and dialyzed against trigger factor storage buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) or 4-fold diluted with distilled water and rechromatographed on a Protein Pak Q 8 HR (Waters) strong anion exchange column, essentially as described before, for native full-length trigger factor (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purity of the individual fragments was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA-kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. DH5α derivatives expressing the different trigger factor fragments were cultured in LB medium at 30 °C to anA600 of 0.5. Low level expression of trigger factor fragments was achieved by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 20 μm for 1 h. 20-ml aliquots of the cultures were then rapidly cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath and centrifuged at 4 °C to harvest the cells. Cells were lyzed essentially as described above except that the Mg2+ concentration was permanently kept at 10 mm. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and layered onto sucrose cushions (20% (w/v) sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 or 500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6 at 4 °C; three volumes cushion per volume of lysate). Ribosomes were pelleted at 213,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman). Ribosomal pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and aliquots of ribosomes and postribosomal supernatant (50% of the corresponding amount of ribosomal pellets) were analyzed on 13.5% acrylamide denaturing gels. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose, which was then probed with a trigger factor-specific antiserum from rabbit and a chemiluminescence-based detection system (BM blotting substrate, Boehringer Mannheim). Ribosomes were purified from a derivative of the E. coli C600 strain. Briefly, an inducer-regulated chromosomal tig allele was introduced from strain BG87 (6Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into C600 by P1virtransduction and selection of Ampr transductants. Transductants show arabinose-dependent expression of the chromosomal tig gene. To prepare ribosomes depleted of endogenous trigger factor, C600 transductants were grown in the absence of arabinose. Ribosomes were purified as described before (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), omitting, however, the high salt wash step, and stored in ribosome buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 4 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6) at −80 °C. Analytical sucrose gradient centrifugation showed a monosome:subunit ratio of 70:30%. Trigger factor fragments were added at the indicated concentrations followed by 60-min incubation at 30 °C. Samples were then layered onto a 3-fold volume of 20% (w/v) sucrose in buffer A (100 mm KCl, see above). Following high speed centrifugation as described in the previous section, supernatants and pellets were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For sucrose gradient centrifugation, four A260 units of preformed ribosome-TF (1–144) complexes were loaded onto 12 ml of 10–30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6) containing 1 mmMgCl2 (subunit dissociation conditions) or 6 mmMgCl2 (subunit association conditions). Gradients were run in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor at 36,000 rpm for 100 min at 3 °C followed by fractionation from the tube bottom (40 fractions of 300 μl each). SDS-PAGE analysis was done on 13.5% (w/v) acrylamide denaturing gels, followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were probed with antisera raised against trigger factor or ribosomal proteins S7 and L7/L12 and detected as before. For analysis by SDS-PAGE, 40 μg of trigger factor fragments were incubated with 80 ng of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) in a final volume of 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm CaCl2 at 30 °C. At the time points indicated, aliquots were taken, mixed with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 1 mm) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13.5% (w/v) acrylamide) followed by silver staining. For amino-terminal sequencing, digested protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and microsequenced on a 473A Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For mass spectroscopy, 100 μg of TF (1–144) were digested with proteinase K for 20 min at 30 °C, mixed with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and passed over a protein C18 reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (Vydac). Mass spectroscopy was carried out on a Kratos Compact MALDI 3 version 4.0. For ribosome binding studies, TF (1–247) at a final concentration of 30 μm was digested with 6 nm proteinase K for 20 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a 1 mm final concentration. PPIase activity assays were carried out at 10 °C using the substrate Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA essentially as described (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The concentration of trigger factor fragments in the assay was 50 nm. For gel filtration analyses, volumes of 200 μl of the recombinant fragments (final concentration, ∼20 μm) were loaded on a Superdex 75 column (10/30, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in buffer A, 100 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and lysozyme (14 kDa) as standards and blue dextran 2000 to detect the void volume. In vitro transcription/translation reactions of the lacZgene were carried out as before (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The design of trigger factor fragments is based on previous results obtained by limited proteolysis of the full-length protein. Proteolysis by proteinase K, endoproteinase Glu-C (V8), and subtilisin generated stable fragments of ∼12 kDa (amino acids 145–247/251) displaying full PPIase activity (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we prepared recombinant trigger factor fragments comprising the amino-terminal segment (TF 1–144), the central PPIase domain (TF 145–247), the carboxyl-terminal segment (TF 248–432), the overlapping fragments TF (1–247) and TF (145–432), and full-length trigger factor, TF (1–432) (Fig. 1). Each of these proteins carries at its carboxyl terminus a His-tag to facilitate purification. High level expression of the individual fragments in DH5α host cells did not perturb cell growth and resulted in predominantly soluble recombinant fragments. Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA agarose and, depending on the purity achieved, a second chromatography step on a strong anion exchange column (Fig. 1). To analyze the structural integrity of the fragments, PPIase activity assays, gel filtration analyses, and limited proteolysis were carried out. All fragments possessing the central FKBP domain displayed PPIase activity toward the oligopeptide substrate Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA. The specific activities were in the same range as reported before by us and others (7Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for wild-type trigger factor and the isolated FKBP domain (Table I). Gel filtration analyses on a Superdex 75 column (linear separation range for globular proteins between 3 and 70 kDa) was carried out to further exclude that the purified fragments were misfolded and aggregated. For all fragments, 70% or more of the protein eluted within the included volume of the gel filtration column corresponding to monomeric or potentially dimeric states (Table I). Fragments containing the carboxyl-terminal domain, TF (1–432), TF (145–432), and TF (248–432), showed a tendency to aggregate at protein concentrations above ∼10 μm, as indicated by a partial elution of these fragments in the void volume of the gel filtration column. Consistent with a previous report (13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the isolated PPIase domain eluted in a single sharp peak corresponding to a molecular mass 27 kDa. The result of limited proteolysis by proteinase K of full-length His-tagged trigger factor was indistinguishable from that observed before for untagged trigger factor (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The central FKBP domain was entirely resistant to proteolysis in all fragments (data not shown; Fig. 7). The carboxyl-terminal domain of trigger factor, both as the isolated fragment TF (248–432) or as part of TF (1–432) and TF (145–432), was rapidly degraded without populating stable degradation intermediates (data not shown), as observed before for the untagged full-length protein (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results of limited proteolysis of TF (1–144) and TF (1–247) are fully compatible with native polypeptide conformations and are detailed below (Fig. 7). Taken together, the purified recombinant trigger factor fragments, by three different criteria, display native or native-like conformations, allowing functional analyses. Caution may be required when interpreting results for the isolated carboxyl-terminal fragment, TF (248–432).Table ISpecific PPIase activities and gel filtration behavior of recombinant trigger factor fragmentsFragment1-aAll fragments carry a carboxyl-terminal His-tag.PPIase activity Kcat/Km(μm−1 s−1)MrSequence derivedMr Gel filtrationTF (1–432)0.69 ± 0.0349,524.666,0001-bFractions (≤30%) of these proteins eluted with the void volume (Mr ≥70,000).TF (1–144)No catalysis17,320.437,000TF (145–247)1.07 ± 0.00412,931.127,000TF (248–432)No catalysis22,303.339,0001-bFractions (≤30%) of these proteins eluted with the void volume (Mr ≥70,000).TF (1–247)0.72 ± 0.128,763.445,000TF (145–432)0.93 ± 0.0733,719.352,0001-bFractions (≤30%) of these proteins eluted with the void volume (Mr ≥70,000).1-a All fragments carry a carboxyl-terminal His-tag.1-b Fractions (≤30%) of these proteins eluted with the void volume (Mr ≥70,000). Open table in a new tab To identify the domain of trigger factor that mediates ribosome binding, we first investigated a potential cosedimentation of the recombinant trigger factor fragments with ribosomal particles prepared from cell extracts. The positive binding controls were ribosomes prepared from DH5α cells, which chromosomally encode untagged full-length trigger factor. At 100 mm KCl, 30–40% of the cellular trigger factor pool cofractionated with ribosomes (Fig. 2). An increase of the ionic strength to 500 mm during the centrifugation through the dense sucrose cushion reduced the amount of cofractionating trigger factor 2–3-fold. Of the two larger fragments, TF (1–247) but not TF (145–432) cosedimented with ribosomes. Consistent with the failure of TF (145–432) to bind to ribosomal particles, neither of its subfragments TF (145–247) and TF (248–432) showed a ribosomal localization. By contrast, TF (1–144), the amino-terminal domain of trigger factor, cofractionated with ribosomes at 100 mmKCl, indicating that this fragment is necessary and sufficient for binding of trigger factor in vivo. However, binding of TF (1–247) and TF (1–144) to ribosomal particles was more susceptible to salt-induced dissociation than binding of the full-length protein. The ribosome-binding properties of the recombinant trigger factor fragments were further analyzed in vitro with purified ribosomes. To remove the endogenous trigger factor, ribosomes were prepared from trigger factor-depleted cells. This approach avoided high-salt washing of the ribosomes, which may cause microheterogeneity of the ribosomal particles. The ribosomal preparation used was mainly composed of 70S monosomes, as revealed by analytical sucrose gradient centrifugation at 6 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). Ribosomes were then incubated to equilibrium with a molar excess of trigger factor fragments and reisolated by centrifugation through sucrose cushions. Analysis of the ribosomal pellets and postribosomal supernatants by SDS-PAGE confirmed the previous observation that TF (1–247) and TF (1–144), but not TF (145–432), can bind to ribosomes (Fig. 3). Neither TF (145–247) nor TF (248–432) showed ribosome binding in vitro (data not shown). TF (1–144) is thus the smallest of the trigger factor fragments tested to bind to ribosomes in vivo and in vitro. Judged from the staining intensities (Fig. 3), binding of TF (1–247) and TF (1–144) to ribosomal particles shows an apparent saturation at a 1:1 stoichiometry indicative of a single ribosomal attachment site. To substantiate the observation that ribosome binding by trigger factor is a function of its amino-terminal domain, direct competition experiments were carried out. Ribosomes were incubated to equilibrium with equimolar amounts of TF (1–432), TF (1–247), and TF (1–144), re-isolated by centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). In agreement with the experiment shown in Fig. 3, visual inspection of the gel reveals that binding of the individual trigger factor fragments to ribosomes occurs at an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry. Co-incubation of equimolar, saturating amounts of TF (1–432) and TF (1–144) or TF (1–432) and TF (1–247) with ribosomes resulted in a ∼50% reduction in binding of the individual fragments and a concurrent appearance of the proteins in the supernatant fractions. Moreover, a 2-fold molar excess of trigger factor or trigger factor fragments during the incubation with ribosomes resulted in an equivalent binding to the ribosomal particles and appearance of unbound protein in supernatant fractions (Fig. 4). These results indicate that TF (1–432), TF (1–144), and TF (1–247) have the same binding specificity and apparent affinity toward a single ribosomal attachment site. The ribosomal binding site of trigger factor was shown earlier to map to the large ribosomal subunit (5Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Direct competition of TF (1–144) and TF (1–432) for ribosome binding suggests that the amino-terminal fragment is capable of discriminating the ribosomal subunits. This was investigated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. We envisioned that free TF (1–144) may smear into the 30S area of the sucrose gradients, thereby mimicking binding to the small ribosomal subunit. To avoid this potential difficulty, we used as the starting material for the gradient centrifugations the ribosome-TF (1–144)-complex isolated by sucrose cushion centrifugation in the presence of high magnesium concentration. Four A260 units of this complex were centrifuged in sucrose gradients containing either high or low magnesium concentrations to stabilize or destabilize, respectively, the coupled state of the ribosome. Fig. 5 shows the distributions of TF (1–144), ribosomal S7 (to identify the small ribosomal subunit), and ribosomal L7/L12 (to identify the large ribosomal subunit) in the gradient fractions. Accordingly, TF (1–144) binds to 70S couples (upper panel, fractions 15 and 16) and 50S large ribosomal subunits (upper panel, fractions 11 and 12; lower panel, fractions 10–12). There was no binding to the small ribosomal subunit under both magnesium conditions (both panels, fractions 7 and 8). Thus, TF (1–144) further resembles the full-length protein in that it is capable of discriminating the ribosomal subunits and binding to large subunits only. In an earlier study, we found that the association of trigger factor with ribosomes becomes salt-resistant when translation occurs (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These complexes were disrupted by puromycin-mediated release of the nascent polypeptide chains (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both observations are consistent with a scenario in which trigger factor, by hydrophobic interaction, binds to nascent polypeptide chains to assist their folding. Here, we tested whether TF (1–144) and TF (1–247) are capable of forming salt-resistant complexes with translating ribosomes. Trigger factor fragments were added at a final concentration of 1 μm to lacZ in vitro transcription/translation reactions. The endogenous full length trigger factor of the cell-free system was calculated to be present at a concentration of 0.2–0.4 μm during transcription/translation (5Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and served as a positive binding control. Fig. 6 shows the presence of trigger factor and its fragments in the respective ribosomal fractions. Accordingly, TF (1–144) and TF (1–247) differ from full-length trigger factor in that their binding to ribosomes at low salt concentration is insensitive to puromycin treatment. In addition, these fragments cannot form salt-resistant complexes with translating ribosomes as observed for the full-length protein. We conclude that the amino-terminal fragment with or without the adjacent FKBP domain is insufficient to allow salt-resistant and puromycin-sensitive binding to ribosomes in the transcription/translation assay. Neither of the fragments TF (145–432), TF (145–247), and TF (248–432), even at concentrations higher than 1 μm, showed significant cofractionation with ribosomes in the transcription/translation assay (data not shown). We previously used limited proteolysis by proteinase K and endoproteinase Glu-C (V8) to dissect structural domains of trigger factor (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the full-length protein, we failed to populate stable fragments except for the central FKBP-type PPIase domain. In the course of limited proteolysis of recombinant trigger factor fragments by proteinase K, however, we noticed the appearance of distinct products for TF (1–247) and TF (1–144) (Fig. 7). Within the first 2 min of digestion, TF (1–247) was degraded into two prominent proteolytic fragments (PK-1 and PK-3). By amino-terminal sequencing, PK-1 was identified as an extended PPIase domain starting with glycine 119. We had noticed this cleavage site before when sequencing a transient proteinase K fragment of native, full-length trigger factor (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With time, this species was further trimmed amino-terminally to give the ∼12-kDa FKBP fragment (PK-4) starting at arginine 145. PK-3 started with the amino acids MRGSMQVSV and, therefore, represents the amino terminus of TF (1–247). A comigrating species (PK-6), starting with the same amino-terminal amino acids, was generated by proteolysis of TF (1–144). Thus, amino acids 1–144 of trigger factor contain a compactly folded domain. To determine the carboxyl terminus of this domain, mass spectroscopy was performed with TF (1–247) and TF (1–144) samples that had been digested with proteinase K and passed over a reversed-phase HPLC column. The predominant proteolytic fragment common to TF (1–144) and TF (1–247) had an experimentally determined molecular mass of 13,497–13,498 Da. Taking into account that the vector encoded four additional amino acids at the amino terminus, this mass perfectly fits to a fragment of trigger factor ending with glutamine 118 and having a theoretical mass of 13,498.6. This is in agreement with the sequencing result for the larger proteolytic fragment of TF (1–247), PK-1, starting with glycine 119. A second proteolytic fragment (PK-2 and PK-5) was common to TF (1–247) and TF (1–144). Surprisingly, these polypeptides, although migrating slower in SDS-PAGE than PK-3 and PK-6, arose from further proteolysis of PK-3 and PK-6 by six amino-terminal amino acids as revealed by amino-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy. Together, amino acids 1–118 (or 3–118) comprise a compactly folded domain of E. coli trigger factor. To test whether the above described structural element of trigger factor, encompassing the amino-terminal 118 amino acids, also represents a functional entity, two experimental approaches were taken: (a) TF (1–118) was constructed genetically and purified as a recombinant fragment by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography; and (b) a preparative digest of TF (1–247) was carried out to produce the proteinase K fragments PK-1 (starting with glycine 119) and PK-3 (ending with glutamine 118). TF (1–118) and the proteolytic fragments of TF (1–247) were incubated with equimolar amounts of purified ribosomes followed by sucrose cushion centrifugation to re-isolate the ribosomal particles (Fig. 8 a). SDS-PAGE analysis of the ribosomal fractions by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue was insufficient to identify the trigger factor fragments, because they comigrated with ribosomal proteins. Therefore, these fractions were additionally subjected to immunoblotting using a trigger factor-specific antiserum (Fig. 8 a). Positive ribosome-binding signals were obtained for recombinant TF (1–118), residual TF (1–247), and the PK-3 fragment, representing the amino-terminal 118 amino acids of TF (1–247). In control incubations lacking ribosomes, all fragments were recovered from the supernatant fractions. Furthermore, PK-1 exclusively remained in the supernatant fractions, even in presence of ribosomes. Thus, the presence of TF (1–118) and PK-3 in pellet fractions demonstrates ribosome binding by these fragments in vitro. Recombinant TF (1–118), in addition, was capable of binding to ribosomes in vivo, as demonstrated by its cosedimentation with ribosomal particles prepared from cell extracts of TF (1–118) overproducing cells (Fig. 8 b). We conclude that TF (1–118) not only structurally but also functionally fulfills the criteria of a novel trigger factor domain that mediates binding to ribosomes in vivo andin vitro. The present study led to the identification of the ribosome binding site of trigger factor. We found that the amino-terminal trigger factor fragment TF (1–144): (i) is necessary and sufficient for ribosome binding in vivo and in vitro; (ii) shares the same binding site with full-length trigger factor on the large ribosomal subunit; and (iii) contains a compactly folded, protease-protected domain comprising the amino-terminal 118 amino acids of trigger factor. This proteolytic fragment was capable of binding to ribosomes in vivo and in vitro and, therefore, represents the second structural and functional element of trigger factor described so far (Fig. 9). Unlike the central PPIase domain, which belongs to the FKBP family of PPIases (10Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Callebaut I. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), homology searches against updated data bases did not reveal any protein with similarity to TF (1–118). These findings do not formally exclude the existence of additional sites within trigger factor that contribute to ribosome binding but by themselves are insufficient for binding to ribosomes. Such sites would be difficult to detect experimentally. Based on limited proteolysis, the amino-terminal ribosome-binding domain and the central FKBP domain are separated by an exposed 26-amino acid peptide linker that is accessible to proteinase K and endoproteinase Glu-C (V8) (this study and Ref. 12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PhD program for prediction of secondary structure and surface accessibility in proteins (17Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar) predicted a surface-exposed loop conformation for amino acids 118–136 of E. coli and Haemophilus influenzaetrigger factor. With proteinase K, the initial proteolytic cleavage within trigger factor occurs between glutamine 118 and glycine 119, followed by rather slow cleavage between leucine 144 and arginine 145. We, therefore, envision this 26-amino acid linker to be part of an extended PPIase domain rather than being part of the ribosome binding domain. An extended PPIase fragment, starting with glycine 119, was observed before upon digestion of the full-length trigger factor (12Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this extension is unclear. In our previous study, TF (1–118) was not observed as a stable proteinase K fragment for the following reason. TF (1–118) essentially comigrates in SDS-PAGE with the PPIase domain fragment TF (145–247). The overall resistance to proteolysis of TF (1–118) is lower compared with that of the FKBP domain, explaining why TF (1–118) escaped the detection in the former study, in particular because longer digestion times were used. Stoller et al. (13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) noticed an amino-terminal fragment of ∼14 kDa upon digestion of trigger factor by subtilisin. Interestingly, in their study, ribosome-bound trigger factor was completely resistant to subtilisin treatment, indicating the occurrence of substantial structural rearrangements upon ribosome binding or a protection from proteolytic attack by the ribosomal particle. In agreement with our work, the amino-terminal portion of trigger factor was also very sensitive to digestion by subtilisin (13Stoller G. Tradler T. Rücknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Concerning the function of trigger factor at the ribosome, a crucial finding of this study is that a recombinant fragment comprising both the ribosome binding domain and the PPIase domain, TF (1–247), does not form puromycin-sensitive and salt-resistant complexes with translating ribosomes. For this function, apparently, the entire trigger factor molecule is required. Given that the salt-resistant complex of full-length trigger factor with translating ribosomes is disrupted by puromycin treatment, it is tempting to assume that a trigger factor-nascent chain interaction is the basis of the tight ribosomal association. Accordingly, salt-resistant binding of trigger factor to ribosomes would reflect a nonionic interaction with nascent polypeptide chains. Folding assistance could be achieved by a cooperative process involving the catalytic power of the PPIase domain and an additional high affinity substrate binding reminiscent of molecular chaperone action (8Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The isolated PPIase domain is deficient in high affinity binding of protein substrates (8Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which may account for the failure of TF (1–247) to interact with translating ribosomes in a salt-resistant and puromycin-sensitive fashion. High affinity substrate binding by trigger factor could rely on a functional interaction of the FKBP domain with the carboxyl-terminal portion of its polypeptide chain and, possibly, additional contributions by the amino-terminal domain. It is evident, however, that the amino-terminal trigger factor domain fulfills the important targeting function to a site on the large ribosomal particle that is in proximity to the emerging nascent chain. This targeting function is likely to be a prerequisite for the efficient association of trigger factor with nascent chains. We thank H. Bujard for generous support throughout this study, A.

Fluorescence intensities of positively charged 2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-1ethylpyridinium and unchargedN-phenyl-1-naphtylamine were 7 and 4 times higher, respectively, in the mutant lacking OprM and 4 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, in the mutants lacking MexA or MexB than in the wild type strain.

Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa is now attributed mainly to the overexpression of three sets of operons. Overexpression of the operon mexA-mexB-oprM is characteristic fornalB type multidrug-resistant mutants, (8Morshed S.R.-M. Lei Yu Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Irikura T. Iyobe S. Mitsuhashi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A third type designated as nfxC has also been associated with a diminished intracellular drug accumulation (12Fukuda H. Hosaka M. Hirai K. Iyobe S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 1757-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The genes coding for the proteins involved in the drug extrusion have been characterized recently (13Köhler T.

A common characteristic of multiantibiotic-resistant mutants inP. aeruginosa is their broad resistance to quinolones, and hence one method generally used to assess multiantibiotic-resistant-type resistance mutations is based on determination of the time course of quinolones accumulation inside the cell. A critical review of the methods used for measuring the accumulation of quinolones discusses the weaknesses of these methods (14Mortimer P.G.S. Piddock L.J.V. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1991; 28: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A striking point observed by us and others is the fact that an increase in the MIC 1The abbreviations used are; MIC, minimum growth inhibitory concentration; DMP, 2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-1-ethylpyridinium; TMA-DPH, 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; CCCP, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; EtBr, ethidium bromide; NPN, N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine. of quinolone of several orders of magnitude is often reflected by only about a 2-fold decrease in drug accumulation (3Lei Y.

A high background due to unspecific surface binding combined with the release of a substantial fraction of accumulated quinolone during the long washing period are responsible for these results. Fluorescent probes, which change their spectroscopic properties upon entering the cell are particularly suitable for uptake experiments because they fluoresce weakly in aqueous environments, but become strongly fluorescent in nonpolar or hydrophobic environments. The possibility of energized extrusion of fluorescent membrane probes was suggested previously (15Cramer W.A. Postma P.W. Helgerson S.L. Biochim. Biophys.

More recently the combination of several fluorescent probes provided more insight into the extrusion process of the LmrA protein of Lactococcus lactis, which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (20Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We previously reported the construction of mutants lacking one, two, or all three components of the efflux system formed by themexA-mexB-oprM gene products (21Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to MexA-, MexB-, and OprM-deficient mutants constructed by others that were reported to be equally hypersusceptible to many antibiotics (22Poole K. Krebs K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), we were able to divide our mutants into two groups with different antibiotic susceptibility profiles. All the mutants deficient in OprM exhibited 8–16 times higher susceptibility against fluoroquinolone antibiotics, chloramphenicol, and azthreonam than the parent strain, whereas mutants deficient in MexA, MexB, or MexA,B were only 2–4 times more susceptible to these antibiotics than the parent strain. The findings of the ciprofloxacin accumulation experiments were in agreement with the MIC results, but this method provided little information about uptake kinetics. The use of fluorescent probes combined with genetically defined mutants lacking the subunit protein(s) is therefore a powerful approach to obtaining more insight into the extrusion mechanism associated with mexA-mexB-oprMoperon products. In this study, we investigated the response of DMP, TMA-DPH, NPN, and ethidium bromide to the lack of mexA,mexB, or oprM gene product in P. aeruginosa. The following reagents were obtained from the indicated sources and used without further purification: DMP, 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH), and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were purchased from Sigma, and ethidium bromide (EtBr) and NPN were purchased from Wako Chemicals. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All the strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extracts, 0.5% NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2). Experimental cultures inoculated at 10% with a fully grown overnight culture were rotated at 200 rpm at 37 °C for 4 h. The mutants lacking MexA, MexB, OprM, MexA-MexB, and MexA-MexB-OprM were abbreviated to ΔMexA, ΔMexB, ΔOprM, ΔMexA,B, and ΔMexA,B-OprM, respectively.Table IBacterial strainsStrainsRelevant propertiesReferencePAO4290leu-10, argF10, aph-9004, FP−Matsumoto collectionTNP070ΔmexA derivative of PAO429021Yoneyama H.

Cell suspension at a higher cell density leads to rapid oxygen depletion in the uptake medium, resulting in respiration-related artifacts, especially during NPN and DMP accumulation experiments (23Nieva-Gomez D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Sedgwick E.G. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Experimental measurements were generally performed within 2 h after cell preparation. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 30 °C. DMP, TMA-DPH, and NPN were dissolved in absolute methanol and EtBr in water to the final concentrations indicated in the figure legends. CCCP was also dissolved in absolute methanol. Control experiments indicated that the presence of methanol at the maximal experimental concentration of 2.5% did not have a significant effect. Fluorescence emission intensity was measured with a Hitachi 650–10S fluorometer equipped with a Lauda RM6 circulating water bath, and the data were registered on a Hitachi 056 recorder. Excitation and emission wavelengths for DMP were, respectively, 467 and 557 nm, for TMA-DPH 350 and 425 nm, for EtBr 520 and 590 nm, and for NPN 340 and 420 nm. Slit widths were all set at 5 nm for excitation and at 10 nm for emission. The neutral probe NPN has been used to monitor changes in bacterial membranes from the energized to nonenergized state (23Nieva-Gomez D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or to monitor outer membrane permeabilization (25Loh B. Grant C. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The addition of NPN to the cell suspension leads to a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity at 420 nm in comparison with fluorescence without cells (Fig. 1 A). Initial rapid increments within a period of less than 1 min were higher in the deletion mutants when compared with the parent strain, but this level was nearly the same for all mutants. A second slower incremental phase at 0.5–4 min could be observed in all mutants. Eventual fluorescence intensity in the OprM and MexA or MexB mutants were, respectively, 3.7 and 1.7 times higher than that in the parent strain. This second phase was absent in the parent strain due to active efflux of the dye. In parallel with the increase in emission intensity, a blue shift in the emission spectra was observed (Fig. 1 B) reflecting the movement of the probe to a more hydrophobic environment. These results suggested that the lowest fluorescence of NPN in the wild type cell may be due to lower accumulation of the dye resulting from extrusion of NPN by the MexA,B-OprM efflux system. Conversely, the highest and intermediate fluorescence intensities in the mutant lacking OprM (also ΔMexA,B-OprM) and ΔMexA or ΔMexB, respectively, may have been attributable to a total or partial dysfunction of the Mex pump. Increase of DMP fluorescence intensity in the presence of cells is attributed to movement of the dye molecules from the head group region of the cytoplasmic membrane bilayer into the region of the fatty acyl chains (24Sedgwick E.G. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). An instantaneous rise in fluorescence emission at 567 nm upon addition of the probe to the cell suspension was followed by a slower phase in the ΔOprM, ΔMexA, or ΔMexB (Fig. 2 A). The rate of increment for ΔOprM was significantly higher than for ΔMexA or ΔMexB, whereas no significant variation in the fluorescence intensity was detected in the parent strain. The final fluorescence level attained in the OprM mutant was about twice as high as that in the ΔMexA or ΔMexB mutants and 7 times higher than that in the parent strain. These results suggest that DMP may have also been efficiently extruded in the wild type strain. In the mutants, the dye accumulates at higher levels and fluoresces strongly, which is most likely attributable to pump dysfunction. These observations strongly suggest the involvement ofmexA-mexB-oprM gene products in DMP and NPN extrusion. In contrast to NPN, the fluorescence emission spectrum and the increase in DMP fluorescence in the deletion mutants was not accompanied by a shift of the emission maximum (Fig. 2 B). The differences in NPN and DMP fluorescence intensity increment among various kinds of mutants was correlated with the MICs of the antibiotics in these cells, reported elsewhere (21Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Before the discovery of active drug efflux systems, the outer membrane barrier was considered the main cause of low specific antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa (26Nikaido H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the outer membrane barrier and the role of OprM in the overall accumulation rate, the impact of outer membrane permeabilization was investigated. DMP accumulations in PAO4290 and its Mex operon knock-out mutants in the presence and the absence of EDTA are presented in Fig. 3. If we assume that DMP fluorescence emission observed in the parent strain to be the minimum value and the emission in the ΔOprM strain to be the maximum value, the addition of EDTA to PAO4290 resulted in a fluorescence increment of only 15% of the maximum value. The ΔMexA,B mutant reached a fluorescence intensity of about 45% of that in the ΔOprM mutant, which in the presence of EDTA was increased to 90%. The effect of EDTA on DMP fluorescence in the ΔOprM mutant is reflected by a rise of only 10%. Small fluorescence increments in the presence of EDTA for PAO4290 and ΔOprM were attributable to destruction of the outer membrane barrier. Furthermore, a small increment of DMP fluorescence in the parent strain after the addition of EDTA suggests that the ability to extrude the substrate compound is still maintained under these conditions. These results suggest that increased accumulation of the dye in ΔOprM mutant is not due to a higher periplasmic dye concentration, because outer membrane permeabilization allows instantaneous equilibration between the outer medium and the periplasmic space. Consequently, we concluded that MexA,B and OprM form a functional unit during the extrusion process, in which OprM plays an indispensable role. We previously explained the lower MICs of antibiotics in ΔOprM mutants compared with ΔMexA and ΔMexB by assuming the presence of unidentified inner membrane components that act as substitutes for MexA,B. Addition of EDTA showed the highest effect in the MexA,B mutant, leading us to believe that the interaction between OprM and the putative inner membrane pump is susceptible to this treatment. The amphiphilic character arising from attachment of the positively charged phenyltrimethylammonium group to diphenylhexatriene allows orientation of this probe in the lipid bilayer perpendicular to the plane of the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, partitioning of TMA-DPH into the lipid bilayer was shown to be a biphasic process that resulted from rapid insertion of the dye into the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by slower transbilayer movement to the inner leaflet of the membrane (20Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Addition of TMA-DPH to the cell suspensions resulted in rapid increase of the fluorescence intensity, followed by a slower incremental phase leading to the maximum level within about 2 min in the ΔMexA or ΔMexB mutant and the wild type strain (Fig. 4 A). The mutant lacking OprM took a much longer time than the others to equilibrate. The first component of the biphasic process is similar in all strains and the difference in the fluorescence increase mainly occurs during the second phase. The slower second phase was absent in the parent strain, high in the ΔOprM mutant and at an intermediate level in the ΔMexA and ΔMexB strains (Fig. 4). The results clearly showed that TMA-DPH is efficiently extruded via the Mex extrusion machinery, probably from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. Raising the TMA-DPH concentration by the factor of two or more in the parent strain brought the fluorescence intensity to the same level as that caused by half that concentration in the ΔM mutant (Fig. 4 B). This means that accumulation in the parent strain takes place only in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas the dye accumulates in the ΔOprM mutant in both the inner and outer leaflet of the inner membrane. To address the question of whether or not TMA-DPH accumulates in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane and is then extruded from this site by the extrusion system, we performed downhill efflux experiments. Cells were preloaded with concentrated TMA-DPH, and then the suspension was rapidly diluted. We observed a very rapid single-phase decrease in fluorescence of the wild type strain (Fig. 5). On one hand, the fluorescence decrease in ΔABM cells was preceded by a transient rise in fluorescence; then there was a slow decrease until the main equilibration was reached (Fig. 5). We interpreted these results to mean that transient increase in fluorescence represents slow movement of the dye from the cytoplasm to the inner leaflet then to the outer leaflet, because the mutant lacking the extrusion proteins cannot extrude the dye. In the wild type strain, the Mex pump takes up the dye from the inner leaflet very rapidly, and therefore, a sharp decrease in fluorescence represents only the diffusion from the outer leaflet that also occurs in the ΔMexAB-OprM mutant. A downhill extrusion profile of TMA-DPH in the potassium cyanide-poisoned wild type cell is similar but slightly higher than that in the ΔMexAB-OprM mutant, confirming that the extrusion was driven by the cellular energy. In contrast to DMP, NPN, and TMP-DPH uptake, which monitors mainly accumulation of the dye to the cytoplasmic membrane, EtBr uptake reflects the accumulation of this dye into the cytoplasmic compartment. Because the MIC of EtBr in the wild type strain of P. aeruginosa is over 200 μg/ml, it is conceivable that a fraction of this high resistance is due to efflux. All the mutants showed markedly higher fluorescence than in the wild type strain (Fig. 6). In contrast to the hydrophobic membrane probes, EtBr did not show intermediate levels of uptake rates in the ΔMexA, ΔMexB, or ΔMexA,B mutant. These results suggest the following possibilities: (i) the Mex extrusion machinery takes up the substrate also from the cytoplasm; and (ii) intact extrusion assembly is necessary for mediating extrusion from the cytoplasm. Addition of CCCP to the mixture induces a sharp increase in EtBr accumulation, confirming the proton motive force dependence of the extrusion process (Fig. 6, curve d). To determine whether MexA,B-OprM-mediated efflux of the fluorescent dyes was saturable, we examined the effect of external dye concentration on the fluorescence increase (Fig. 7). Fluorescence intensity of DMP in the buffer solution remained constant in the range of 20–80 μm. A maximum saturation in fluorescence increase was reached in the case of the ΔOprM or ΔMexA,B-OprM mutant at a concentration of 50 μm. Increasing external dye concentration further results in the quenching of fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity in the parent strain reaches a steady saturation level at an external concentration of about 50–60 μm, which is at about half the fluorescence intensity of the ΔABM mutant. We calculated the apparent Kmvalue of DMP extrusion from the difference in the fluorescence intensity between the ΔABM mutant and the wild type strain and found the value to be about 10 μm. An apparentKm of 0.2 mm for a putative carrier-mediated active efflux system was determined by Cohen et al. (27Cohen S.P. Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. Souza K.S. McMurry Levy S.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) by using proton motive force-dependent uptake of norfloxacin into everted inner membrane vesicle from E. coli. Fluorescence probes with different intracellular binding modes were used to assess the role of the subunit protein of the Mex extrusion machinery in substrate extrusion by monitoring real time accumulation. The increase in fluorescence with DMP, NPN, and TMA-DPH were shown to be directly related to their accumulation in the cytoplasmic membrane (23Nieva-Gomez D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Midgley M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 3187-3193PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the highest level of NPN, DMP, and TMA-DPH accumulation was observed in the mutant lacking OprM, the intermediate level was observed in the mutant lacking MexA or MexB, and the lowest level was observed in the wild type strain (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). This order of fluorescence probe accumulation was a perfect match with the MICs of fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline in these mutants and the parent strain (21Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that a low level of antibiotic accumulation may be a major factor causing the resistance. A correlation between the deletion of mexA-mexB-oprM operon products and MIC results was firmly established previously (21Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A conspicuous fact is that permeabilization of the outer membrane by EDTA treatment has a minor effect on the induction of a higher level of DMP accumulation in the wild type or ΔOprM when compared with the effect on ΔMexA,B (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the synergistic effect between the outer membrane barrier and extrusion activity in protecting the cell against lipophilic compounds is still valid, but the role of this barrier in the case of hydrophobic low molecular weight molecules, like DMP (molecular weight, 380) and NPN (molecular weight, 219), is less extensive than expected and defers the outer membrane permeability to a secondary role. The outer membrane component of efflux systems in P. aeruginosa is thought to act as a sort of exit channel, because the whole extrusion machinery dysfunctions in the mutants carrying at least ΔOprM. Furthermore, the intermediate level in the MIC of antibiotics in ΔMexA,B suggested the possibility of a two-step extrusion by which OprM can extrude drugs directly from the periplasm. However, DMP accumulation experiments in outer membrane permeabilized cells demonstrated that MexA,B-OprM forms a tight functional unit during extrusion, because the EDTA treatment of the wild type strains only increased fluorescence a little (see “Results” and Fig. 3). The mechanism of extrusion includes at least two steps. In the first step, the dyes and antibiotics located in the inner membrane are recognized by the functional unit composed of MexA and MexB. The second step leads to the release of the drug into the outer medium through OprM. Interaction between the inner membrane components (MexA and MexB) and OprM is the crucial step in triggering the transport of these compounds. We previously suggested the existence of other proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane, capable of substituting the function of MexA,B (21Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The putative functional homologue of MexA,B differs probably in specificity toward different substrates. In the case of ethidium bromide, the accumulation proceeded at the same rate and extent in all mutants (Fig. 6), suggesting that this putative exporter does not recognize this cytoplasmic probe. The MIC test of several hydrophilic β-lactam antibiotics like azthreonam, cefsulodin, and cefoperazone in the MexA,B mutants did not show intermediate susceptibility, suggesting that the complementary system might not be able to initiate the extrusion of these compounds (21Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The interaction between outer and inner membrane proteins during extrusion is not specific to P. aeruginosa. Although suspected for some time, there is now a growing amount of evidence that outer membrane protein TolC is the functional counterpart of OprM for AcrA,B-mediated extrusion in E. coli (29Fralick J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5803-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Deletion of TolC results in hypersensitivity to hydrophobic agents, even in AcrA,B overexpressed mutants. The fact that membrane probes are particularly “sensitive” tomex-operon products is an indication that a crucial step in active extrusion occurs during the membrane crossing step. Bolhuiset al. (20Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) showed previously that the fluorescent membrane probe TMA-DPH is distributed into the phospholipid bilayer via a biphasic process. A first rapid entry of TMA-DPH into the outer leaflet is followed by a slower transbilayer movement to the inner leaflet. The second component of this process is absent when extrusion occurs in energized L. lactis cells. A similar behavior of TMA-DPH accumulation was observed in P. aeruginosa in which the slower transfer to the inner leaflet was notably higher in the knock-out mutants (Figs. 4 and 5). The role of MexA,B-OprM in removing membrane bound TMA-DPH was particularly obvious in the downhill extrusion experiments (Fig. 5). The slow diffusion step of the amphiphilic dye from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet before rapid release from the membrane surface was absent in the parent strain. These results suggest the existence of a common mode of action between MexA,B-OprM and LmrA, the ATP-dependent multidrug resistance pump of L. lactis, which is the extrusion of dye that takes place from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. Because most of the extruded compounds are hydrophobic, it is assumed that the recognition site of the extrusion system possesses lipophilic properties. A recognition site for hydrophobic compounds located in a lipophilic environment has many advantages when compared with a site located in an aqueous environment. Lipophilic interaction sites exposed to the aqueous phase would require complex solvations to stabilize the recognition site (30Ringe D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Initiation of the extrusion process would necessitate complex interactions between the extruded substrate, the water molecules, and the recognition site. This would in turn impose strict structural conditions on the extruded compound. Hence, a hydrophobic site located in a hydrophobic environment can exist without solvation and stay accessible to a broad range of substrates. Our results agree with previously reported observations on the human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (31Stein W.D. Cardelli C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 763-772PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and finally the ATP-dependent drug extrusion in L. lactis. The MDR system driven by the MexA,B-OprM machinery is probably more complex than that described above, because the proteins connecting functions of two membranes are involved. However, well characterized genetic and biochemical systems in P. aeruginosa serve as excellent models for studying the extrusion of noxious compounds. We believe that these studies eventually contribute to understanding of MDR in all living organisms. We assume that a common mechanism drives the first step of the extrusion in all of these systems."

Mutations that produce the largest increases in theKi for a C-terminally truncated form of stromelysin 1, MMP-3(ΔC), but do not disturb the conformation involve substitutions of residues that are located in a ridge that is centered around the disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys70. Specific residues that have a large influence on activity include Cys1, Thr2, Met66, Val69, and Cys70. Of the mutations introduced, the greatest functional disturbances, reflected inKi increases of 2–4 orders of magnitude, are generated by changes that disrupt the Cys1–Cys70 disulfide bond and by substitution of Ala for Thr2. Most mutations that perturb the interaction with MMP-3 have parallel effects on the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) and MMP-2 (gelatinase A).

Marston F.A.O. Angal S. Koklitis P. Panico M. Morris H.R. Carne A.F. Smith B.J. Harris T.J.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is responsible for their inhibitory action against active MMPs, and the C-terminal domain modulates the interaction of TIMPs with pro-MMPs (11Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). TIMPs also have growth factor activity for erythroid and other cells (12Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Uchijima E. Iwata K.

MMPs play critical roles in biological processes associated with connective tissue turnover, and the balance between levels of TIMPs and active MMPs is important in normal processes such as tissue remodeling and wound healing. Imbalances in the activities of TIMPs and MMPs are associated with pathological conditions such as arthritis, tissue ulceration, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Because of their biomedical significance, the mechanisms by which TIMPs regulate the activity of MMPs in vivo and in vitro have been the focus of many previous studies. Aspects of the expression of TIMPs in different tissues or cells and its regulation have been investigated intensively (see Ref. 10Williamson E.A. Marston F.A.O. Angal S. Koklitis P. Panico M. Morris H.R. Carne A.F. Smith B.J. Harris T.J.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem.

Brew K. Suzuki K. Bond J. Intracellular Protein Catabolism. Plenum Press, New York1996: 23-31Google Scholar). However, less progress has been made in determining the molecular basis of the inhibitory mechanism of TIMP. Previously, mutagenesis has been carried out in attempts to identify key residues for the inhibitory activity of TIMP-2 (16O'Shea M. Willenbrock F. Williamson R.A. Cockett M.I. Freedman R.B. Reynolds J.J. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since there was no information available on the three-dimensional structure of TIMP, the design of mutations was based on chemical modification data (17Williamson R.A. Smith B.J. Angal S. Freedman R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and sequence conservation. The results suggested that the region between Cys3 and Cys13, particularly His7 and Gln9, of TIMP-1 is important for its interaction with MMPs. However, because amino acid substitutions at these sites increase Ki values by a factor of 3–7, reflecting a loss of <10% of the free energy of binding, they do not appear to account for the high affinity binding of TIMPs with MMPs. The region of TIMP that is important for its inhibitory activity has also been investigated using synthetic peptides and antibodies to inhibit its interaction with interstitial collagenase, MMP-1 (18Bodden M.K. Harber G.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18943-18952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were interpreted as indicating that the second “disulfide knot” (Cys13–Cys124 and Cys127–Cys174) plays a major role in activity. However, low molecular weight peptides generally have little structure in solution and can potentially inhibit TIMP-1 action by nonspecific binding or by acting as alternative substrates for the metalloproteinase. Such mechanisms appear likely since peptides were required at concentrations in the millimolar range to exert effects as compared with nanomolar concentrations of TIMP-1. The reliability of information obtained with antibodies is also suspect since immunoglobulins are very large as compared with TIMP-1 (Mr = 150,000 as compared with 25,000), and their binding can impede the access of the metalloproteinase to a large surface area around their epitope on TIMP. The solution structure of the inhibitory amino-terminal domain of TIMP-2 has been determined at low resolution by multidimensional NMR (19Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This shows that N-TIMP-2 has a fold similar to that of the OB-fold family of oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding proteins (see Fig. 1) and gives a basis for designing and interpreting the results of structure-function relationships in N-TIMP-1. With the goal of studying structure-function relationships of TIMP, we have developed a bacterial expression system for producing high yields of recombinant human N-TIMP-1 that has been characterized as having a fully native fold by CD spectroscopy and two-dimensional NMR (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This system is convenient for designed mutagenesis studies to probe structure-function relationships and allows appropriate physical characterization of the structural state of variants. We describe here 20 mutants of N-TIMP-1 that have been expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, refolded successfully in vitro, and characterized with respect to activity and CD spectra. Their functional properties emphasize the importance of a region that includes Met66–Cys70 and Cys1-Thr2 for TIMP inhibitory activity. Substitution of Thr2 differentially influences the activity of TIMP-1 for binding to MMP-1, MMP-2 (gelatinase A), and MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), suggesting that it may be possible to engineer TIMPs that are selective inhibitors of MMPs. Ultima DNA polymerase with proofreading function was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Wizard™ PCR Preps purification kits were purchased from Promega. Other reagents, separation media, and kits were from the same sources as described in a previous work (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Dr. R. Werner (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami School of Medicine) provided synthetic oligonucleotides. MMP-1 and MMP-2 were isolated as zymogens as described previously (21Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10261-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 22Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). C-terminally truncated pro-MMP-3(ΔC) was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, from which it was extracted, folded, and purified. 2K. Suzuki, K. Brew, and H. Nagase, manuscript in preparation. Pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-3(ΔC) were activated with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and pro-MMP-1 with MMP-3 in the presence of 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (21Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10261-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The MMP-3 used for pro-MMP-1 activation was removed by anti-MMP-3 affinity chromatography (23Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using the polymerase chain reaction megaprimer method (24Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with the pET3a-N-TIMP-1 expression vector as the template (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The amplification to generate the megaprimer was performed in each case with the synthetic T7 promoter primer or the T7 terminator primer together with an appropriate mutagenic primer. Megaprimers were purified using the Wizard™ PCR Preps purification kit and used in a second amplification with the cognate T7-based primer. After purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, the final amplification product was digested with BamHI and NdeI, and the product was cloned into pET3a as described for N-TIMP-1. The coding sequences of all mutants were checked by DNA sequencing of the expression vector. N-TIMP-1 mutants were expressed as inclusion bodies and extracted, folded, and purified as described previously (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

Fields, University of Minnesota) for MMP-3 (25Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropylAla-Arg-NH2(Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA) for MMP-1 and MMP-2 (26Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) were used to assay TIMP-1 activity as described previously (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The inhibition of each of the above MMPs by N-TIMP-1 and its mutants was assayed by preincubating MMP (0.1–1 nm) and TIMP (at various concentrations) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% Brij 35 at 37 °C for 1 h. The time required for equilibration was determined by following the progress of inhibition after mixing MMPs and TIMP at similar concentrations to those used in the assay. An aliquot (60 μl) of substrate (15 μm) was then added to 540 μl of preincubated MMP/TIMP mixture, and activity was determined at 37 °C by following product release with time. Inhibited rates were measured from the initial 10 min of the reaction profile where product release was linear with time. Ki values were calculated using a treatment of data for slow tight-binding inhibitors (27Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) or, in some cases, by a standard treatment for reversible lower affinity inhibitors. Near- and far-UV CD spectra of N-TIMP-1 and its mutants were determined with a Jasco J-710/720 spectropolarimeter as described previously (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Near-UV CD spectra (250–320 nm) were determined using a cell with a 1-cm path length, and far-UV spectra (200–250 nm) were determined using a cell with a 0.1-cm path length. Proteins were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl. Our strategy has been to probe regions of TIMP-1 that have been implicated in its activity by chemical modification studies and by analogy with other OB-fold proteins that share structural similarities to N-TIMP-2. Trace labeling studies 3S. Yadav, H. Nagase, and K. Brew, unpublished observations. have indicated that groups of residues in the second disulfide loop between Cys13 and Cys70 are perturbed in reactivity toward acetic anhydride on binding to MMP-3. To investigate this region, a series of residues in this region (residues 16, 18, 22, 35, 38, 42, 45, 46, and 66) were mutated to Ala or to amino acids with similar polarity. Tyr35 and Tyr38 were chosen for replacement because, in the low resolution solution structure of TIMP-2, their equivalents are components of a surface loop that is adjacent to the binding site in other OB-fold proteins. Additional evidence that influenced our experimental design was the observation that human neutrophil elastase inactivates TIMP-1 by cleaving the Val69–Cys70 peptide bond, whereas this bond is protected and TIMP-1 activity is preserved by formation of the TIMP·MMP-3 complex. 4Nagase, H., Suzuki, K., Cawston, T. E., and Brew, K. (1997) Biochem. J., in press. These results and the perturbed Ki, observed in the M66A mutant, prompted us to probe residues that are close to this region in covalent structure and in the solution NMR structure. This led us to construct mutants with substitutions of Val69, Cys70, Cys1, Thr2, and Pro5. The locations of the corresponding residues in N-TIMP-2 are shown in Fig. 1. The polymerase chain reaction method introduced some unwanted mutations adjacent to the sequence derived from the mutagenic primer, which can be attributed to the terminal transferase activity of Taq DNA polymerase. These were minimized by the use of a thermostable polymerase with proofreading activity (Ultima DNA polymerase) and by designing primers so that all substitutions at the susceptible site are silent. A few additional mutations were found outside the primer presumably because of errors made by the polymerase, which generated the double mutants C1S/F12Y, M45A/F49V, N14S/V69T, and V69A/A103V. Wild-type and mutant forms of N-TIMP-1 were expressed in E. coli, solubilized, partially purified, and folded in vitro as described above. The final purification was carried out by cation-exchange chromatography with CM52. The yields ranged from 5 to 20 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture, with the exception of the mutant Y38A, for which the yield was ∼2 mg/liter of culture. Concentrations of the mutant proteins were calculated from the absorbance of solutions at 280 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from their contents of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Initially, all mutants were assayed for their activities as inhibitors of a C-terminally truncated form of MMP-3 (MMP-3(ΔC)). The assay was developed to provide a facile means of comparing different mutants. In this assay, preincubation at 37 °C is performed for 1 h to ensure that the binding of inhibitor and metalloproteinase reaches equilibrium, but the addition of substrate results in a 10% dilution of the two proteins. Re-equilibration after this dilution will be slow and is expected to have little effect on the results. Since the substrate concentrations are very low relative to the Km (1.5 μm compared with 25 μm), any correction of the apparent Ki determined directly from the kinetic study for competition by substrate is expected to be negligible. Table I lists the apparentKi values mostly calculated using the treatment for tight-binding inhibitors (27Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar), except with mutants for which very large reductions in affinity became apparent; the data for the latter group were analyzed as low affinity reversible inhibitors. Substitutions of Asp16, Val18, and Lys22 produced only minor changes in affinity compared with the wild type. Substitutions of the methionines at positions 42 (M42T) and 45 (M45A/F49V) and of the tyrosines at positions 35 (Y35A) and 38 (Y38F) produced significant but not major (4–6-fold) reductions in affinity, whereas substitution of Ala for Met66 had a larger effect (14-fold loss of binding). Mutations at positions 2 (T2A) and 38 (Y38A) reduced the affinity for MMP-3(ΔC) by >2 orders of magnitude. Substitutions of either of the two disulfide-bonded cysteines, Cys1 and Cys70, produced a decrease of >3 orders of magnitude in the affinity for MMP-3(ΔC). To put these mutations into perspective in relation to the proportion of molecular contacts between the inhibitor and protease affected by the substitution, the change in the Gibbs free energy change for the protein-protein interaction produced by the mutation (ΔΔG) was calculated for each mutation using the relationship ΔG = −RTln(Ki(wild-type)/Ki(mutant)); these values are shown in Fig. 2. C70S, C1S/F12Y, T2A, and Y38A lost 3–4 kcal/mol of their free energy of interaction with MMP-3(ΔC).Table IInhibition constants (Ki) of N-TIMP-1 and mutants for MMP-3 (ΔC)Mutation(s)KiMutation(s)KinmnmNone1.5Y38A470 ± 28C1S/F12Y2020 ± 230M42T8.0 ± 1.3T2A126 ± 4M45L8.8 ± 0.8P5A1.2 ± 0.1M45A/F49G5.5 ± 0.6D16N2.6 ± 0.7M66A27 ± 4V18A3.2 ± 0.1M66A/C70I12500 ± 1250K22A0.7 ± 0.0V69I7.0 ± 0.6K22R1.6 ± 0.2V69T14 ± 2K22E3.7 ± 0.2V69A/A103V29 ± 2Y35A6.4 ± 0.4C70S3690 ± 110Y38F4.4 ± 0.4The Ki values are all displayed ± S.E.

Mutants with moderate to large decreases in affinity toward MMP-3(ΔC) were selected for further investigation with MMP-1 and MMP-2 (Table II). Interestingly, whereas most mutations had parallel effects on the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for the three proteinases, T2A was more selective than other mutations, showing in particular a 17-fold higher affinity for MMP-3(ΔC) as compared with MMP-1 (Fig. 3).Table IIComparison of the inhibition constants (Ki) of N-TIMP-1 and selected variants for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3(ΔC)TIMP-1 variantKiMMP-1MMP-2MMP-3MMP-1/MMP-3nmN-TIMP-11.5 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.2C1S/F12Y1800 ± 3701450 ± 1202020 ± 2300.9 ± 0.2T2A2090 ± 180308 ± 17126 ± 417 ± 1.5M66A24 ± 121 ± 127 ± 40.9 ± 0.1V69I5.7 ± 0.82.0 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.60.8 ± 0.1V69T13.2 ± 0.58.6 ± 1.314.1 ± 2.00.9 ± 0.1V69A/A103V49 ± 422 ± 229 ± 21.7 ± 0.2C70S2160 ± 2402010 ± 2503690 ± 1100.6 ± 0.1The Ki values are given ± S.E. Open table in a new tab The Ki values are given ± S.E. The mutants that displayed major changes inKi were further characterized by UV CD spectroscopy to see if the loss of activity was a direct result of the sequence change or the indirect consequence of a global change in secondary or tertiary structure in N-TIMP-1. The only feature of the far-UV CD spectrum of N-TIMP-1 is a trough with a minimum at 208 nm (20Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which is not characteristic of any known type of secondary structure. Consequently, changes in the CD spectrum in this wavelength range do not provide useful information about the structural effects of mutations. In contrast, N-TIMP-1 has a complex near-UV CD spectrum with multiple peaks that reflect the fixed environments of aromatic side chains and disulfide bonds in the native structure. The spectrum of this region in N-TIMP-1 is therefore a preferable indicator of changes in tertiary structure introduced by mutations and can help to identify mutants with partially folded conformations (29Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The near-UV CD spectra of mutants that show large changes in functional properties are shown in Fig. 4. Although the mutations affected the magnitude of the largest peak centered at 290 nm, the multiple peaks and inflections between 255 and 285 nm were preserved in most of the mutants, including M66A/C70F, which had the lowest activity of all of the mutants constructed in this study. In contrast, the T2A mutant showed some signs of being structurally perturbed, whereas Y38A and the C1S/F12A double mutant lost much of the detail in their CD spectra. It seems likely that some of the loss of activity in these variants results from a loss of fixed tertiary structure. Tyr38, in particular, is an improbable candidate as a component of the interaction site because substitution with phenylalanine has little effect on activity (Table I). In the absence of a three-dimensional structure for the complex of a TIMP with a MMP, site-directed mutagenesis provides an effective approach for investigating the roles of individual residues in the inhibitory action of TIMP-1. Mutation of a series of sites between Cys13 and Met45 produced relatively small reductions in affinity for MMP-3. As discussed above, the Y38A variant, which has a greatly reduced affinity for MMP-3(ΔC), also has a disturbed tertiary structure that may account for the reduction in activity. The fact that substitution with Phe at this site has little effect on inhibitory activity supports this hypothesis. In the solution structure of TIMP-2, the side chain of the residue corresponding to Tyr38 of TIMP-1 is partially buried (Fig. 1). Substitution of a large hydrophobic side chain with a small methyl group (Y38A) will introduce a cavity in the interior of the protein and destabilize the structure. The low yield of this protein obtained after folding is consistent with the effect of the mutation on folding and stability. Substitution of Ala for Met66 close to the C-terminal section of the same disulfide loop produced a 14-fold increase inKi. Evidence for the location of the interaction site in TIMP-1 derived from a “footprinting” experiment correlates well with this observation. TIMP-1 loses its inhibitory function upon incubation with human neutrophil elastase as a result of cleavage of the peptide bond between Val69 and Cys70.4 Cleavage of this peptide bond by neutrophil elastase and the loss of TIMP activity are prevented when TIMP-1 is preincubated with MMP-3. Although this does not prove that Val69 and Cys70 are in direct contact with MMP-3, it does suggest that they are sufficiently close for MMP-3 to block access of the peptide bond by MMP-3.4 In the three-dimensional structure of TIMP-2, two sections of polypeptide chain, from Met66 to Cys70 and from Cys1 to Pro5, are connected by a Cys1–Cys70 disulfide bridge and form a continuous surface ridge (19Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because the disulfide bond arrangements are conserved in all known TIMPs, a similar structure must also be present in TIMP-1. The mutational and protection results discussed above suggest that this ridge forms part of the binding site. The sequence of this region is well conserved in different TIMPs; besides the conserved disulfide-bonded cysteines (Cys1 and Cys70 of TIMP-1), the only amino acids found at the position corresponding to Val69 of TIMP-1 are Val and Leu, and only Thr and Ser are found at position 2. Proline is conserved as residue 5 throughout the TIMP family. To probe the roles of these conserved residues, the effects of substitutions of Cys1, Thr2, Pro5, Val69, and Cys70 were investigated. Replacement of either cysteine, which prevents the formation of the disulfide bond between these residues, produces a loss of affinity of >3 orders of magnitude. The near-UV spectra of the disulfide bond mutants are qualitatively different from but similar in magnitude to those of the wild-type protein. The change in CD spectrum may be partly attributable to the loss of the disulfide bond since disulfides contribute to the spectrum in this wavelength range (29Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), but some localized change in structure may also be introduced by the mutation. However, the change in CD spectrum is small compared with that of the misfolded Y38A mutant, suggesting that the disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys70 is not essential for the overall fold of N-TIMP-1; mutants lacking this bond probably have structures that are slightly distorted versions of the wild-type structure. Treatment with Ellman's reagent indicates that no free thiol groups are present in the folded disulfide bond mutants (data not shown), so the remaining cysteinyl residue is present as a mixed disulfide with mercaptoethanol or has become oxidized during the purification process. Various substitutions of Val69 produce moderate changes in affinity, but replacing the totally conserved Pro5 with Ala had little effect. A striking functional change arose from substitution of Ala for Thr2, which reduced the affinity for MMP-3 by 2 orders of magnitude. Since this residue is conserved as Thr or Ser in different TIMPs, it is possible that the hydroxyl group is important for the formation of complexes between N-TIMP-1 and MMP-3(ΔC). The CD spectrum suggests that substitution with Ala perturbs the tertiary structure. However, the effects of this substitution on TIMP-1 specificity (see below) support the view that residue 2 plays a key role in TIMP action. There are indications that different TIMPs vary quantitatively in inhibitory activity toward different MMPs (11Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 30Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to determine if mutations that affect the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for MMP-3(ΔC) have similar effects on its interactions with other metalloproteinases. Table II shows that most substitutions have approximately parallel effects on the affinity for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 even when the Ki values are increased by >3 orders of magnitude, with the exceptions of T2A and, to a much lesser extent, V69A/A103V. The former has a particularly striking 17-fold discriminatory inhibitory action on MMP-3 over MMP-1 (see Fig. 3) as well as a 7-fold higher affinity for MMP-2 relative to MMP-1. The structural basis of this selectivity is currently unclear; a simple explanation could be that the interaction with MMP-1 involves a hydrogen bond between the Thr2 hydroxyl group and the enzyme that is less important in binding to MMP-2 and MMP-3. However, this result lends support to the proposal that a region that includes residues 66–70 and residues 1 and 2, linked by the Cys1–Cys70 disulfide bond (TIMP-1 numbering), forms part of the inhibition site in TIMP. Bodden et al.(31Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C. Yermovsky A. Birkedal-Hansen B. Galazka G. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have previously suggested that this disulfide bond is particularly important for structure and/or activity in TIMP. Figs. 1 and5 show that the disulfide bond links the N-terminal region and residues 66–70 to form a distinct ridge on the surface of the TIMP-2 solution structure. Analyses by Jones and Thornton (32Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar) show that, in high affinity heterologous protein-protein interactions that are comparable in nature and strength to the TIMP-MMP interaction, a large surface area of each component is buried on complex formation (785 ± 75 Å2 for other protease-inhibitor systems). The interaction site defined by our current results has a surface area of <200 Å2, smaller than expected for an interaction with a nanomolar dissociation constant. Although the extended ridge defined by our studies represents a suitable structure for fitting the MMP substrate-binding groove and appears to be a major component of the interaction site, additional residues in N-TIMP-1, adjacent to this region, are likely to contribute to the interaction with MMPs. A contribution to binding by a larger part of the N terminus is consistent with the previously published observation (16O'Shea M. Willenbrock F. Williamson R.A. Cockett M.I. Freedman R.B. Reynolds J.J. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that substitutions of His7 and Gln9 in TIMP-1 produce moderate 2–6-fold reductions in the Ki for MMP-7 (matrilysin). Our results also indicate that similar modest reductions in affinity are produced by substitutions of Tyr35, Tyr38, Met42, and Met45. Amino-terminal disulfide-bonded cysteines are uncommon in proteins. The bond between Cys1 and Cys70 appears to be functionally significant as a linker between the two key sections of the reactive site. Additional residues N-terminal to Cys1could potentially disrupt the substrate mimetic character of this region. Cys1 and Cys3 together with their associated disulfide links will also constrain the flexibility of the N-terminal region of TIMP. Structural rigidity in the reactive site may be important for the inhibitory strategy possibly for arresting the catalytic action of MMPs and preventing proteolysis of the inhibitor by its target. The properties of the T2A mutant provide an initial indication that residue 2 of TIMP is a key to specificity and that TIMP-1 variants that are specifically targeted to individual MMPs can be potentially constructed. Such proteins could be used therapeutically against pathological processes (such as tumor cell metastasis) that are associated with the activity of specific MMPs. Mutational studies are in progress to further investigate this possibility. We thank Vera Ondricek, Tom Simmons, and Adriana Vasquez for technical assistance. We are grateful to Dr. Richard Williamson (University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom) for providing the coordinates of the NMR structure of the amino-terminal domain of TIMP-2."
https://openalex.org/W2094895158,"We report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a novel GTP-binding protein, termed Rem (for Rad and Gem-related), that was identified as a product of polymerase chain reaction amplification using oligonucleotide primers derived from conserved regions of the Rad, Gem, and Kir Ras subfamily. Alignment of the full-length open reading frame of mouse Rem revealed the encoded protein to be 47% identical to the Rad, Gem, and Kir proteins. The distinct structural features of the Rad, Gem, and Kir subfamily are maintained including a series of nonconservative amino acid substitutions at positions important for GTPase activity and a unique sequence motif thought to direct membrane association. Recombinant Rem binds GTP in a specific and saturable manner. Ribonuclease protection analysis found Rem to be expressed at comparatively high levels in cardiac muscle and at moderate levels in lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney. The administration of lipopolysaccharide to mice, a potent activator of the inflammatory and immune systems, results in the general repression of Rem mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Thus, Rem is the first Ras-related gene whose mRNA levels have been shown to be regulated by repression.

Thus, Rem is the first Ras-related gene whose mRNA levels have been shown to be regulated by repression. The Ras family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation, intracellular vesicular trafficking, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and cytoskeletonal reorganization. To date, six subfamilies have been identified: Ras, Rho, Rab, Ran, ARF, and a newly described family composed of the Rad, Gem, and Kir proteins (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). These subfamilies are defined largely by primary sequence relationships but also by their regulation of common cellular functions. All GTPases of the Ras superfamily contain five well conserved amino acid motifs involved in guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 3Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These primary sequence motifs have been evolutionarily conserved and define a conserved structure whose importance has been confirmed through extensive mutational analysis (4Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sequence of all GTPases share approximately 20–30% amino acid identity, whereas the sequence identity is considerably higher within subfamilies (5Kahn R.A. Der C.J. Bokoch G.M. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2512-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, most family members share conserved COOH-terminal cysteine rich motifs needed for covalent modification by isoprenoid lipids (6Glomset J.A. Farnesworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Prenylation is the initial step in the attachment of these proteins to the cytoplasmic leaflets of a variety of cellular organelles (7Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be required for normal membrane localization and biological activity (8Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The Ras-related GTPases are thought to act as binary switching molecules, alternating between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound structural state (4Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). They respond to external signals by exchanging GTP for constitutively bound GDP, thereby triggering intracellular signaling cascades. The signal is terminated when the protein hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP in a reaction that is stimulated by guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RGK, Rad, Gem, and Kir Ras-related GTP-binding proteins; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); TNF, tumor necrosis factor-α; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. (9Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Progression through this GTPase cycle is regulated by additional regulatory proteins, including factors that stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange. These regulatory proteins may themselves possess intrinsic effector activity (9Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) and associate with specific GTPases largely through interactions with their G2 effector domains. A variety of G2 regions allow the Ras-related GTPases to interact with a wide range of cellular effector molecules (4Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Thus, small GTPases are extremely versatile and found to regulate an array of cellular processes (2Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar, 9Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The Rad, Gem, and Kir proteins are the first members of a new class of Ras-like GTPases (10Kahn C.R. Reynet C. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Maguire J. Santoro P.J. Siebenlist J.Y. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rad shares 61% identity at the amino acid level with Gem (11Maguire J. Santoro P.J. Siebenlist J.Y. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and Kir (12Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas the coding sequences of the Gem and Kir genes are 98% identical, differing significantly only in the 5′-untranslated sequences (12Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The RGK proteins share structural features that are distinct from other Ras-related proteins. These include several nonconservative amino acid substitutions within regions known to be involved in guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis including unique G2 effector and G3 domains, extended NH2and COOH termini and a conserved COOH-terminal motif thought to mediate membrane association but lacking classical CAAX motifs needed to direct protein isoprenylation. In addition, the members of this Ras subfamily are subject to transcriptional regulation. Rad was found to be overexpressed in muscle of type II diabetes patients (10Kahn C.R. Reynet C. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and Gem expression is induced in mitogen-stimulated T-cells (11Maguire J. Santoro P.J. Siebenlist J.Y. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas Kir expression is induced by oncogenic kinases (12Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the cellular function of these proteins remains to be established, Rad has been shown to associate with skeletal muscle β-tropomyosin and the cytoskeleton of muscle cells (13Zhu J. Bilan P.J. Moyers J.S. Antonetti D.A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 768-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a variety of cultured cell lines (14Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This suggests a role for Rad in skeletal muscle function and cytoskeletal organization. The deregulated expression of Gem prevents proliferation of normal and transformed 3T3 cells, suggesting that Gem is involved in regulating signaling pathways that influence cell growth (11Maguire J. Santoro P.J. Siebenlist J.Y. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Finally, the cellular levels of Kir are dramatically increased in pre-B cells transformed by a select set of abl tyrosine kinase oncogenes (12Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The correlation between Kir expression and the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of BCL/ABL and v-ABL transformed cells suggests that Kir may participate in the processes of invasion or metastasis. When expressed in yeast, Kir leads to the formation of pseudohyphae, a developmental transition normally induced by nitrogen starvation (15Dorin D. Cohen L. Del Villar K. Poullet P. Mohr R. Whiteway M. Witte O. Tamanoi F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2267-2271PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis suggests that Kir acts upstream of theSTE20 kinase and results in the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (15Dorin D. Cohen L. Del Villar K. Poullet P. Mohr R. Whiteway M. Witte O. Tamanoi F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2267-2271PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a model in which Kir, and perhaps other members of the RGK family, may regulate cellular signaling cascades by controlling the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases that have yet to be determined. In this report, we describe the initial characterization of a novel Ras-related GTP-binding protein, Rem, first identified using a degenerate PCR strategy. On the basis of structural criteria, Rem is a new member of the Rad, Gem, and Kir subfamily of Ras-related proteins. Rem mRNA is expressed predominantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, lung, and kidney, and the bacterially expressed protein is shown to bind GTP in a specific and saturable manner. Because other members of the RGK family are transcriptionally regulated, we examined whether a similar method of regulation controlled the expression of Rem. Surprisingly, we find that in mice treated with lipopolysaccharide, a potent activator of cells of the immune and inflammatory systems, the levels of Rem mRNA are repressed in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Thus, Rem is the first Ras-related GTP-binding protein whose mRNA levels are regulated by repression. Standard molecular biology techniques were used (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA clones were subcloned to plasmid pBluescript II vectors (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the M13 universal primer or specific internal primers. Nick-translated probes were synthesized using a labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The strategy used to generate the PCR-derived fragment of Rem from conserved amino acid sequences found within the Rad and Gem/Kir small GTP-binding proteins is outlined in Fig. 1. First strand cDNA from mouse testis and brain total RNA was a kind gift from Dr. Kevin Sarge of this department. The first strand cDNA was used for PCR with the degenerate PCR primers AT(A/C/T)AT(A/C/T)(C/T)TNGTNGGNAA(C/T)AA and GT(T/C)TC(A/T/G) AT(A/G)AA(C/T)TT(G/A)CA(A/G)TC(AG)AA. The resultant 105-base PCR product was blunt ended with T4 polymerase, and 5′-phosphate was added with polynucleotide kinase (17Wang K. Koop B.F. Hood L. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 236-238PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was then subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript KS+(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sixty individual clones were sequenced using a Sequenase™ kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Two PCR products, when sequenced, were found to contain a unique cDNA fragment that was used to design a Rem-specific oligonucleotide (Rem-3; see Fig. 1). The Rem-3 oligonucleotide was then used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed Uni-ZAP XR adult mouse testis cDNA library (the kind gift of Dr. Debra J. Wolgemuth, Center for Reproductive Sciences, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY). Approximately 30,000 plaques were transferred in duplicate to filters that were then probed with 1 × 106cpm/ml of the end labeled oligonucleotide, TTCTACCGAGACTTCCCGGC. Filters were hybridized at 42 °C in hybridization solution containing 6 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate (18Chen W.-J. Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The filters were washed for 2 h with 6 × SSC and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate at room temperature with three changes of wash buffer. Three positives were identified, and the largest (Rem λ10-1, 1.1-kilobase insert) was plaque purified, rescued using phage mediated in vivo excision (according to manufacturer's protocol, Stratagene), and sequenced. To obtain a larger cDNA clone, the mouse testis library was rescreened with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the nick-translatedEcoRI/XhoI fragment of pRem 10-1. Duplicate filters were hybridized at 42 °C in a 5 × SSPE solution (18Chen W.-J. Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) containing 50% formamide. The filters were washed in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 60 °C with three changes of wash buffer. Of five positives, the clone Rem λ6-2 was plaque purified and rescued as a pBS plasmid because of its ability to hybridize to 5′-directed Rem-specific oligonucleotides. To obtain a full-length cDNA clone, a bacteriophage cDNA library was constructed from mouse kidney. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the Straight A's™ mRNA isolation system (Novagen, Madison, WI) and used to construct a random primed cDNA library (Directional RH Random Primer cDNA Library Construction System, Novagen). Approximately 30,000 plaques were transferred in duplicate to filters that were probed under high stringency with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the nick-translatedEcoRI/XhoI fragment of pRem λ6-2. Of the four positive clones identified, pRem λ5, which contained the largest and most 5′-extended insert (0.9 kilobase), was rescued and characterized by DNA sequencing. To construct a plasmid that contained the full Rem coding region, nucleotides 1–502 of pRem 5 were ligated to nucleotides 56–1050 of pRem 6-2 using a unique NheI site. The resulting plasmid, pRemWT, was characterized by restriction mapping and sequencing. Mouse total RNA was isolated using a STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test B, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PstI fragment of pRem 6-2 was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create the plasmid pRem PstI. Plasmids containing an 89-bp fragment of the ribosomal protein L32 (19Hobbs M.V. Weigle W.O. Noonan D.J. Torbett B.E. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J. Cardenas G.J. Ernst D.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3602-3614PubMed Google Scholar) or a 303-bp fragment of mouse TNF-α cDNA subcloned in the vector pGEM-4 were a gift of Dr. Daniel Noonan of this department. Antisense radiolabeled riboprobes were prepared using linearized templates and a Maxiscript™ (Ambion, Austin, TX) kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNase protection assays were performed according to the method of Hobbs (19Hobbs M.V. Weigle W.O. Noonan D.J. Torbett B.E. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J. Cardenas G.J. Ernst D.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3602-3614PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly 20 μg of total RNA was dissolved in 8 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Pipes, pH 6.7). For LPS experiments, two protection assays were performed for each tissue. The first contained a mixture of Rem and L32 riboprobes, whereas the second contained the TNF-α and L32 riboprobe mix. 1 μl (500,000 cpm) of each probe (in hybridization buffer) was added to each sample. Samples were overlaid with mineral oil, incubated for 1 min at 90 °C, and subsequently incubated for 12–16 h at 56 °C. Single-stranded RNA was digested as described by Hobbs (19Hobbs M.V. Weigle W.O. Noonan D.J. Torbett B.E. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J. Cardenas G.J. Ernst D.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3602-3614PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equivalent volume (110 μl) of 4 mguanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% sodium N-lauryl-sarcosine, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mβ-mercaptethanol. Yeast tRNA (25 μg) was added as carrier, and total RNA was precipitated by addition of isopropanol (225 μl) followed by centrifugation (20Hod Y. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 852-854PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol) and electrophoresed in a 5% acrylamide/8 m urea sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for the indicated time. The gel was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SF (model 455A). Simultaneous measurement of the rpL32 transcripts, which encode the L32 ribosomal protein (19Hobbs M.V. Weigle W.O. Noonan D.J. Torbett B.E. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J. Cardenas G.J. Ernst D.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3602-3614PubMed Google Scholar), served as an internal control for housekeeping gene levels. The tissues of adult female C57BL6/C3H mice were kindly provided by Dr. Mark Kindy of this department. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation was achieved by intraperitoneal injection (10 μg/animal) to paired animals for each time point. Lipopolysaccharide was from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (DIFCO). Control animals were not injected. At the indicated times the animals were treated with metafane and euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were harvested immediately and quick frozen on dry ice. RNA was isolated and used for ribonuclease protection analysis as described above. These studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Recombinant Rem was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein. A Rem PCR product containing a 5′ BamHI restriction site was generated using oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACTCTTAACACGCA and 3′-TTCTACCGAGACTTCCCGGC, sequenced to verify the cDNA, and subcloned to BamHI/NheI-digested pRemWT to create pRem express. The BamHI/XhoI fragment of pRem express was subsequently cloned in-frame to pGEX-KG (21Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to create pRem GEX. GST-Rem was produced in BL21DE3 cells upon isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside addition, purified on glutathione agarose beads (Sigma), and removed from GST by thrombin cleavage as described (22Cicchetti P. Ridley A.J. Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage was deemed to be >95% efficient as judged by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies. A bacteria protein co-purified with Rem and was resistant to extensive high salt washes of the glutathione-agarose beads (see Fig. 4 C). Thrombin was removed by incubation with benzamidene-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The protein was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol and stored in multiple aliquots at −70 °C. GTP binding to Rem was determined with the rapid filtration assay (23Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito R. Weinberg A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rem (1 μg) or bovine serum albumin (1 μg) was incubated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μmGTPγS (0.45 μCi/sample)) with the indicated concentration of Mg2+ or EDTA at 22 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots of 100 μl were withdrawn in duplicate, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 400 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and the indicated Mg2+ concentration) and immediately filtered through BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) followed by washing with 12 ml of ice-cold wash buffer. The radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific background was determined by performing the binding assay in the absence of added protein. To assess the specificity of GTP binding, cold ribonucleotides were added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h prior to rapid filtration analysis. We sought a comprehensive method to identify additional members of the RGK family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. A PCR-based strategy using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to exploit amino acid differences between the guanine nucleotide-binding domains of the RGK family and other Ras-related GTP-binding proteins was used to isolate novel RGK-related cDNA fragments from mouse testis cDNA (Fig. 1 and see “Experimental Procedures”). The 5′ oligonucleotide was designed to partially overlap the G4 guanine nucleotide-binding site motif IILVGNK, whereas the 3′ oligonucleotide recognized a portion of the G5 guanine nucleotide-binding region and a flanking region of amino acids highly conserved within the RGK family FDCKFIET. PCR generated a pool of cDNAs of the approximate predicted size (105 bp), which were subcloned and sequenced. Sequencing of 60 individual clones revealed that approximately 90% of the products were identical to the previously characterized Rad, Gem, or Kir genes (10Kahn C.R. Reynet C. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Maguire J. Santoro P.J. Siebenlist J.Y. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two of the remaining clones encoded a previously unknown sequence that was homologous to but clearly different from RGK genes (Fig. 1). To emphasize this relationship we designated this clone Rem, for Rad and Gem-related. A Rem-specific oligonucleotide probe was designed (Rem-3) and used to screen a mouse testis cDNA library, from which several clones were isolated (Fig. 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). The largest of these cDNA clones was λRem 6-2, which extended from a polyadenylation tract to nucleotide 441 (nucleotide positions refer to the final sequence of the cDNA that can be retrieved from GenBank™ U91601). Preliminary ribonuclease protection assays using a portion of the λRem 6-2 cDNA indicated that Rem was abundantly expressed in kidney (data not shown). Based on the high levels of expression in kidney, a random-primed mouse kidney cDNA library was constructed and screened with a probe generated from the λRem 6-2 clone to obtain the 5′ end of the Rem cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Four additional cDNA clones were isolated, one of which (λRem 5) extended from nucleotides 1 to 881. These overlapping cDNA clones (λRem 6-2 and λRem 5) were spliced together to form a full-length cDNA. The 1.5-kilobase cDNA sequence included a portion of the 5′-untranslated region, an 891-nucleotide (219–1109) open reading frame with a putative initiator methionine in a region that matched the Kozak sequence motif (24Kozak M.

No other methionines were observed 5′ to the putative start codon in any other reading frame. In addition, 5′ to the Kozak sequence and 3′ to the in-frame stop codon, stop codons were observed in all three reading frames. Analysis of the open reading frame revealed significant identity at the nucleotide level with members of the Ras superfamily. The deduced amino acid sequence of Rem is shown in Fig. 2. This cDNA predicts a protein of 297 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of 32,893 Da. A data base search was performed to determine the degree of homology of Rem with the RGK family and to identify additional G-proteins with structural similarities. The Rem protein contains a core sequence (amino acids 84–246) that is highly related to members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. The highest degree of similarity was with mouse and human Gem, Kir, and Rad (46.7–47.2% sequence identity), but there was also a high degree of homology with additional Ras-like GTPases, including 22.8, 25.9, and 22.3% identity to dictyostelium RasA (25Reymond C.D. Gomer R.H. Medhy M.C. Firtel R.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 141-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), human Rap-2A (26Farrell F.X. Ohmstede C.A. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and Rap-2B (27Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar). To assure ourselves that Rem was a new member of the RGK Ras subfamily, we performed a general comparative protein analysis among the different Ras-like subfamilies (data not shown). On the basis of this comparison, it is evident that Rem is a novel member of the RGK Ras-related subfamily. Fig. 2 depicts the alignment of Rem with a select subset of these proteins. The greatest similarity exists in regions that correspond to the guanine nucleotide-binding domains conserved in all Ras family members. The Rem protein exhibits all five of the domains (G1–G5) that have been shown to take part in both guanine nucleotide binding and the catalytic functions of the Ras protein superfamily (4Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Although both the NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions past the Ras core region are divergent, the COOH-terminal 10 amino acids of Rem are highly conserved in Rad, Gem, and Kir proteins (Fig. 2). This region does not contain a typical CAAX, XXCC, or CXC prenylation site (where A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) present in almost all Ras family members, although it does contain a conserved cysteine residue at position 7 from the COOH terminus. This conserved COOH-terminal motif may therefore represent a novel lipid modification site or direct the association of these proteins with membranes by interaction with an anchoring protein. Ribonuclease protection analysis revealed that Rem was expressed at detectable levels in every mouse organ examined (Fig. 3). The highest basal levels were detected in cardiac and skeletal muscle with slightly lower levels of Rem mRNA in lung and kidney. Low levels of mRNA were identified in spleen and brain with barely detectable levels in several additional tissues. The significance of the abundance and distribution of Rem message in these tissues is unclear. The tissue distribution of Rem contrasts with that of both Rad and Gem; Gem mRNA is most abundant in kidney, lung, and spleen, whereas Rad is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and lung (10Kahn C.R.

Its molecule is a heterotrimer consisting of two identical α1(I) chains and a slightly different α2(I) chain that are coiled around one another into a triple-helical conformation. The molecule is synthesized in the form of a precursor in which the proα1(I) 1The abbreviations used are: proα1(I) and proα2(I) chain, proα1 and proα2 chain of type I procollagen, respectively; proα1(III) chain, proα1 chain of type III procollagen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOI, multiplicity of infection; CD, circular dichroism; α chain, a chain produced from procollagen by the cleavage of the N and C propeptides; telopeptide, a short region between a N or C propeptide and the collagen domain; pNα chain, a polypeptide chain produced by the cleavage of the C propeptide; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: proα1(I) and proα2(I) chain, proα1 and proα2 chain of type I procollagen, respectively; proα1(III) chain, proα1 chain of type III procollagen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOI, multiplicity of infection; CD, circular dichroism; α chain, a chain produced from procollagen by the cleavage of the N and C propeptides; telopeptide, a short region between a N or C propeptide and the collagen domain; pNα chain, a polypeptide chain produced by the cleavage of the C propeptide; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and proα2(I) chains have propeptide extensions at both their N- and C-terminal ends. In addition to this heterotrimer, several tissues contain small amounts of a molecule with a chain composition of [α1(I)]3known as the type I collagen homotrimer (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). In fact, early renaturation experiments with individual α chains of type I collagen indicated that they are able to form both [α1(I)]2α2(I) heterotrimers and [α1(I)]3 homotrimers although the former were favored, and the Tm of the latter was slightly lower than that of the former (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Homotrimers with the structure of [α2(I)]3 were also obtained at low temperatures, but their yield was much lower and the Tm was only about 20–24 °C (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Type I collagen is now used in many medical applications as a biomaterial and as a delivery system for certain drugs (8Pachene J.M. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1996; 33: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Ramshaw J.A.M. Werkmeister J.A. Glattauer V. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng.

The collagen used in these applications has been isolated from animal tissues and is liable to cause allergic reactions in up to 3% of human subjects (11Cooperman L. Michaeli D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1984; 10: 638-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is obvious, therefore, that an efficient large-scale recombinant system for the production of type I collagen would have many practical applications.We recently reported that insect cells provide an excellent system for the large-scale expression of native triple-helical human type III collagen, a homotrimer consisting of three identical α1(III) chains (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, coexpression with the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an α2β2 tetramer (6Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar,13Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: pp.1-pp51Google Scholar), was required for the production of molecules with stable triple helices (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The properties of the recombinant type III collagen were very similar to those of the corresponding nonrecombinant protein, and the highest expression levels obtained in suspension cultures were up to 40 mg/liter type III collagen, corresponding to 60 mg/liter type III procollagen.The purpose of the present work was to study whether coexpression of the proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of human type I procollagen in insect cells that also express human prolyl 4-hydroxylase will lead to the formation of heterotrimeric molecules with the correct 2:1 chain ratio. The association of type I procollagen chains begins with interactions among the C propeptides, and it has been regarded as likely that their structural features favor the formation of heterotrimers rather than [proα1(I)]3 homotrimers and prevent the formation of [proα2(I)]3 homotrimers (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 6Prockop D.J.

JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1995: 233-254Google Scholar). We therefore also studied whether proα2(I) chains in which the C propeptide has been replaced with that of the proα1(I) or proα1(III) chain will form homotrimeric molecules or whether additional restrictions exist at the level of the collagen domain, as suggested by the early renaturation experiments with isolated α2(I) chains (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe data reported here indicate that coexpression of the proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of human type I procollagen in insect cells leads to the formation of heterotrimeric molecules with the correct 2:1 chain ratio. The data further indicate that expression of proα1(I) chains without proα2(I) chains effectively leads to the formation of homotrimeric molecules. The formation of the heterotrimers was nevertheless clearly favored, as the ratio of pepsin-resistant α1(I) to α2(I) chains remained at 2:1 in the coexpression experiments unless the proα1(I) chains were expressed in a relatively large excess. Replacement of the sequences coding for the signal peptide and the N propeptide of the proα1(I) chain with those of the proα1(III) chain increased the level of expression of the proα1(I) chain about 3-fold, whereas no corresponding effect was seen when a similar modification was made to the proα2(I) chain. The highest expression level obtained for the type I collagen homotrimer with the modified construct was 60 mg/liter, thus being slightly higher than that previously obtained for type III collagen in High Five cells (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The heterotrimeric and homotrimeric procollagen molecules produced in High Five cells were found to be processed with time, as partial conversion of the wild-type proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains to pNα1(I) and pNα2(I) chains (i.e. cleavage of the C propeptides) was seen in all the expression experiments (although not shown for the proα2(I) chain in the coexpression experiments). Although the N propeptides of the wild-type proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains appeared to be stable, the N propeptide of the proα1(III) chain artificially transferred into the proα1(I) chain was less so, as some of the modified proα1(I) chains were processed to α(I) chains even in the case of homotrimeric molecules in which the three type III N propeptides should be able to form a correctly folded trimer. Similar processing of the N propeptide of the proα1(III) chain in insect cells was also found when this propeptide was transferred to the proα1(II) chain,3 whereas the wild-type N propeptide of the proα1(II) chain3 and the N propeptide of the proα1(III) chain (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) appeared to be quite stable when present in their wild-type chains. The N propeptide is likely to fold back on the triple helical collagen domain (25Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and may thus interact with sequences in it. The data obtained with the modified constructs suggest that such an interaction may be lost or reduced when the N propeptide is replaced with that of another proα chain. As procollagen proteinases are extracellular enzymes (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 6Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 15Kivirikko K.I. Bittar E.E. Bittar N. Principles of Medical Biology. 3. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1995: 233-254Google Scholar), the processing of procollagen molecules found here was probably due to some nonspecific intracellular proteinases.The properties of the purified type I collagen heterotrimer were very similar to those of the corresponding nonrecombinant protein. Although early studies on the type I collagen homotrimer produced by renaturation of individual α chains suggested that theTm of the homotrimer may be slightly lower than that of the heterotrimer (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), no lower Tm was found here for the homotrimer whether studied by digestion of crude cell extracts with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at various temperatures or by CD spectrum analysis. The slightly lowerTm found for the homotrimer produced by the renaturation experiments (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) may thus be a property limited to that special case.The wild-type proα2(I) chain did not form any homotrimeric molecules, as no pepsin-resistant α2(I) chains were seen in the absence of the proα1(I) chains. In agreement with this conclusion, the amount of pepsin-resistant α2(I) chains obtained in the coexpression experiments increased with increasing expression levels of the proα1(I) chains. Attempts were also made to produce homotrimeric molecules of proα2(I) chains by replacing the wild-type C propeptide with that of the proα1(III) or proα1(I) chain. Previous data on the formation of type III procollagen [proα1(III)]3homotrimers (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the present data on the formation of type I procollagen [proα1(I)]3 homotrimers clearly demonstrate that the C propeptides used in the modified proα2(I) constructs become effectively associated in insect cells. Pepsin-resistant α2(I) chains were found in these experiments only when the digestion was performed at 4 °C, while the chains were completely digested at 22 °C. These data agree with those obtained in renaturation experiments with individual α2(I) chains in which theTm of the [α2(I)]3 homotrimer was only 22–24 °C (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the potential interchain interactions in type I collagen has likewise suggested that the [α2(I)]3 homotrimer should have fewer stabilizing interactions than the heterotrimer or [α1(I)]3homotrimer (26Traub W. Fietzek P.P. FEBS Lett. 1976; 2: 245-249Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The present data differ from recent results obtained in translation experiments in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate systemin vitro, in which truncated proα2(I) chains with an internal deletion of 830 amino acids in the collagen domain did form triple helices with a Tm of 35 °C provided that the C propeptide of the proα2(I) chain had been replaced by that of the proα1(III) chain (27Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to the large deletion used in the proα2(I) chain in the cell-free assembly experiments (27Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that in addition to control at the level of the C propeptide, additional restrictions may exist at the level of the collagen domain of the full-length proα2(I) chain, which prevent the formation of stable homotrimeric molecules in cells.Hsp-47 is regarded as a chaperone that may be specifically involved in the assembly and/or secretion of collagens (28Nagata K. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The present data indicate, however, that formation of the type I procollagen heterotrimers and homotrimers with stable triple helices did not require the presence of any recombinant Hsp-47. The possibility is not excluded that the cells may have markedly up-regulated expression of an insect Hsp-47, and that this protein assisted folding of the human procollagen molecules. This possibility does not seem very likely, however, as baculovirus infection interferes with the synthesis of cellular proteins (30Jarvis D.L. Summers M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is thus more likely that assembly of the type I procollagen heterotrimers and homotrimers did not require Hsp-47. The failure to obtain [proα2(I)]3 homotrimers with stable triple helices from proα2(I) chains having modified C propeptides in insect cells and in renaturation experiments starting from individual α2(I) chains in vitro (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) might be due to the lack of Hsp-47 if this chaperone were especially important for folding of the proα2(I) chains. The current data on Hsp-47 (28Nagata K. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 31Hu G. Gura T. Dsbsay B. Sauk J. Dixit S.N. Veis A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) does not suggest any such specificity, however. The failure of insect cells to secrete most of the type I and type III (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) procollagen molecules might likewise be due to lack of Hsp-47, but it has been reported previously that insect cells are also poor at secreting many other recombinant secretory proteins (32Vuori K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Sissom J. Ellis L. Biochem.

It thus seems more likely that synthesis and assembly of recombinant heterotrimeric and homotrimeric type I procollagen molecules in insect cells does not require Hsp-47.

The molecule is synthesized in the form of a precursor in which the proα1(I) 1The abbreviations used are: proα1(I) and proα2(I) chain, proα1 and proα2 chain of type I procollagen, respectively; proα1(III) chain, proα1 chain of type III procollagen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOI, multiplicity of infection; CD, circular dichroism; α chain, a chain produced from procollagen by the cleavage of the N and C propeptides; telopeptide, a short region between a N or C propeptide and the collagen domain; pNα chain, a polypeptide chain produced by the cleavage of the C propeptide; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: proα1(I) and proα2(I) chain, proα1 and proα2 chain of type I procollagen, respectively; proα1(III) chain, proα1 chain of type III procollagen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOI, multiplicity of infection; CD, circular dichroism; α chain, a chain produced from procollagen by the cleavage of the N and C propeptides; telopeptide, a short region between a N or C propeptide and the collagen domain; pNα chain, a polypeptide chain produced by the cleavage of the C propeptide; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and proα2(I) chains have propeptide extensions at both their N- and C-terminal ends. In addition to this heterotrimer, several tissues contain small amounts of a molecule with a chain composition of [α1(I)]3known as the type I collagen homotrimer (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). In fact, early renaturation experiments with individual α chains of type I collagen indicated that they are able to form both [α1(I)]2α2(I) heterotrimers and [α1(I)]3 homotrimers although the former were favored, and the Tm of the latter was slightly lower than that of the former (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Homotrimers with the structure of [α2(I)]3 were also obtained at low temperatures, but their yield was much lower and the Tm was only about 20–24 °C (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is now used in many medical applications as a biomaterial and as a delivery system for certain drugs (8Pachene J.M. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1996; 33: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Ramshaw J.A.M. Werkmeister J.A. Glattauer V. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng.

The collagen used in these applications has been isolated from animal tissues and is liable to cause allergic reactions in up to 3% of human subjects (11Cooperman L. Michaeli D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1984; 10: 638-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is obvious, therefore, that an efficient large-scale recombinant system for the production of type I collagen would have many practical applications. We recently reported that insect cells provide an excellent system for the large-scale expression of native triple-helical human type III collagen, a homotrimer consisting of three identical α1(III) chains (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, coexpression with the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an α2β2 tetramer (6Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar,13Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: pp.1-pp51Google Scholar), was required for the production of molecules with stable triple helices (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The properties of the recombinant type III collagen were very similar to those of the corresponding nonrecombinant protein, and the highest expression levels obtained in suspension cultures were up to 40 mg/liter type III collagen, corresponding to 60 mg/liter type III procollagen. The purpose of the present work was to study whether coexpression of the proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of human type I procollagen in insect cells that also express human prolyl 4-hydroxylase will lead to the formation of heterotrimeric molecules with the correct 2:1 chain ratio. The association of type I procollagen chains begins with interactions among the C propeptides, and it has been regarded as likely that their structural features favor the formation of heterotrimers rather than [proα1(I)]3 homotrimers and prevent the formation of [proα2(I)]3 homotrimers (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 6Prockop D.J.

JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1995: 233-254Google Scholar). We therefore also studied whether proα2(I) chains in which the C propeptide has been replaced with that of the proα1(I) or proα1(III) chain will form homotrimeric molecules or whether additional restrictions exist at the level of the collagen domain, as suggested by the early renaturation experiments with isolated α2(I) chains (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe data reported here indicate that coexpression of the proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of human type I procollagen in insect cells leads to the formation of heterotrimeric molecules with the correct 2:1 chain ratio. The data further indicate that expression of proα1(I) chains without proα2(I) chains effectively leads to the formation of homotrimeric molecules. The formation of the heterotrimers was nevertheless clearly favored, as the ratio of pepsin-resistant α1(I) to α2(I) chains remained at 2:1 in the coexpression experiments unless the proα1(I) chains were expressed in a relatively large excess. Replacement of the sequences coding for the signal peptide and the N propeptide of the proα1(I) chain with those of the proα1(III) chain increased the level of expression of the proα1(I) chain about 3-fold, whereas no corresponding effect was seen when a similar modification was made to the proα2(I) chain. The highest expression level obtained for the type I collagen homotrimer with the modified construct was 60 mg/liter, thus being slightly higher than that previously obtained for type III collagen in High Five cells (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The heterotrimeric and homotrimeric procollagen molecules produced in High Five cells were found to be processed with time, as partial conversion of the wild-type proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains to pNα1(I) and pNα2(I) chains (i.e. cleavage of the C propeptides) was seen in all the expression experiments (although not shown for the proα2(I) chain in the coexpression experiments). Although the N propeptides of the wild-type proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains appeared to be stable, the N propeptide of the proα1(III) chain artificially transferred into the proα1(I) chain was less so, as some of the modified proα1(I) chains were processed to α(I) chains even in the case of homotrimeric molecules in which the three type III N propeptides should be able to form a correctly folded trimer. Similar processing of the N propeptide of the proα1(III) chain in insect cells was also found when this propeptide was transferred to the proα1(II) chain,3 whereas the wild-type N propeptide of the proα1(II) chain3 and the N propeptide of the proα1(III) chain (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) appeared to be quite stable when present in their wild-type chains. The N propeptide is likely to fold back on the triple helical collagen domain (25Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and may thus interact with sequences in it. The data obtained with the modified constructs suggest that such an interaction may be lost or reduced when the N propeptide is replaced with that of another proα chain. As procollagen proteinases are extracellular enzymes (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 6Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev.

JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1995: 233-254Google Scholar), the processing of procollagen molecules found here was probably due to some nonspecific intracellular proteinases.The properties of the purified type I collagen heterotrimer were very similar to those of the corresponding nonrecombinant protein. Although early studies on the type I collagen homotrimer produced by renaturation of individual α chains suggested that theTm of the homotrimer may be slightly lower than that of the heterotrimer (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), no lower Tm was found here for the homotrimer whether studied by digestion of crude cell extracts with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at various temperatures or by CD spectrum analysis. The slightly lowerTm found for the homotrimer produced by the renaturation experiments (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) may thus be a property limited to that special case.The wild-type proα2(I) chain did not form any homotrimeric molecules, as no pepsin-resistant α2(I) chains were seen in the absence of the proα1(I) chains. In agreement with this conclusion, the amount of pepsin-resistant α2(I) chains obtained in the coexpression experiments increased with increasing expression levels of the proα1(I) chains. Attempts were also made to produce homotrimeric molecules of proα2(I) chains by replacing the wild-type C propeptide with that of the proα1(III) or proα1(I) chain. Previous data on the formation of type III procollagen [proα1(III)]3homotrimers (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the present data on the formation of type I procollagen [proα1(I)]3 homotrimers clearly demonstrate that the C propeptides used in the modified proα2(I) constructs become effectively associated in insect cells. Pepsin-resistant α2(I) chains were found in these experiments only when the digestion was performed at 4 °C, while the chains were completely digested at 22 °C. These data agree with those obtained in renaturation experiments with individual α2(I) chains in which theTm of the [α2(I)]3 homotrimer was only 22–24 °C (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the potential interchain interactions in type I collagen has likewise suggested that the [α2(I)]3 homotrimer should have fewer stabilizing interactions than the heterotrimer or [α1(I)]3homotrimer (26Traub W. Fietzek P.P. FEBS Lett. 1976; 2: 245-249Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The present data differ from recent results obtained in translation experiments in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate systemin vitro, in which truncated proα2(I) chains with an internal deletion of 830 amino acids in the collagen domain did form triple helices with a Tm of 35 °C provided that the C propeptide of the proα2(I) chain had been replaced by that of the proα1(III) chain (27Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to the large deletion used in the proα2(I) chain in the cell-free assembly experiments (27Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that in addition to control at the level of the C propeptide, additional restrictions may exist at the level of the collagen domain of the full-length proα2(I) chain, which prevent the formation of stable homotrimeric molecules in cells.Hsp-47 is regarded as a chaperone that may be specifically involved in the assembly and/or secretion of collagens (28Nagata K. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The present data indicate, however, that formation of the type I procollagen heterotrimers and homotrimers with stable triple helices did not require the presence of any recombinant Hsp-47. The possibility is not excluded that the cells may have markedly up-regulated expression of an insect Hsp-47, and that this protein assisted folding of the human procollagen molecules. This possibility does not seem very likely, however, as baculovirus infection interferes with the synthesis of cellular proteins (30Jarvis D.L. Summers M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is thus more likely that assembly of the type I procollagen heterotrimers and homotrimers did not require Hsp-47. The failure to obtain [proα2(I)]3 homotrimers with stable triple helices from proα2(I) chains having modified C propeptides in insect cells and in renaturation experiments starting from individual α2(I) chains in vitro (7Tkocz C. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) might be due to the lack of Hsp-47 if this chaperone were especially important for folding of the proα2(I) chains. The current data on Hsp-47 (28Nagata K. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 31Hu G. Gura T. Dsbsay B. Sauk J. Dixit S.N. Veis A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) does not suggest any such specificity, however. The failure of insect cells to secrete most of the type I and type III (12Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) procollagen molecules might likewise be due to lack of Hsp-47, but it has been reported previously that insect cells are also poor at secreting many other recombinant secretory proteins (32Vuori K.

https://openalex.org/W2043402464,"The small GTPase Cdc42 interacts with multiple factors to transduce diverse intracellular signals. The factors that preferentially recognize the GTP-bound, active state of Cdc42 include a panel of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif-containing molecules, and the RasGAP domain containing IQGAP1 and IQGAP2. In the present study, we have determined the kinetic parameters underlying the functional interactions between the Cdc42-binding domains of some of these factors and Cdc42 by monitoring the continuous release of γP<sub>i</sub> and have compared the ability of the domains to bind to Cdc42. The catalytic efficiencies (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) of the GAP domains of Bcr, 3BP-1, and p190 on Cdc42 are found to be 60-, 160-, and over 500-fold less than that of Cdc42GAP, respectively, and the differences are due, to a large part, to differences in<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values of the GAP domains compare well to the binding affinity to the guanylyl imidodiphosphate-bound Cdc42, suggesting a rapid equilibrium reaction mechanism. The affinity of the Cdc42-binding domains of the CRIB motif of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and p21 <sup>cdc42/rac</sup>-activated kinase 1, and the RasGAP-related domain of IQGAP1, which all inhibit the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42, are found to be 4, 0.7, and 0.08 μm, respectively. These quantitative analysis provide insight that Cdc42GAP functions as an effective negative regulator of Cdc42 by fast, relatively tight binding to the GTP-bound Cdc42, whereas IQGAP1 interacts with Cdc42 as a putative effector with over 10-fold higher affinity than the CRIB domains and GAPs, and suggest that various GAPs and effectors employ distinct mechanism to play roles in Cdc42-mediated signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1990271396,"Daudi B lymphoblastoid cells are highly sensitive to the anti-growth and anti-viral effects of interferon (IFN). Unlike many cell lines, these cells show prolonged transcription of IFN-stimulated genes following treatment with IFN-α. This prolonged response correlated with the continued presence of the activated transcription factor, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Pulse-chase labeling experiments indicated that the half-life of the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat)1 and Stat2 was short (<2 h) although the turnover of the proteins themselves was slow (>24 h), indicative of a constitutive phosphatase activity. The administration of protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors at any time point during IFN stimulation led to rapid inhibition of the response, indicating that tyrosine kinase activity was continuously required. Catalytic activity of Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases remained elevated for prolonged periods following stimulation. Continuous presence of IFN-α was necessary for maintaining prolonged activation of ISGF3 and of Janus kinases, an activity that was blocked by antibodies to IFN-α or by cycloheximide. Conditioned medium of IFN-α-stimulated cells was capable of stimulating STAT activation in naive cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the response to IFN-α is controlled by the duration of stimulated Janus kinase activity over the background of constitutive dephosphorylation and that this response can be sustained by autocrine secretion of IFN-α.

There are two types of IFN: type I IFN, comprised of many IFN-α genes and one IFN-β gene, and type II IFN, consisting of a single IFN-γ species. These two types of IFN produce different but somewhat overlapping responses in target cells following binding to two distinct receptors. The receptors for both types of IFN are composed of at least two transmembrane proteins involved in signal transduction. The binding of IFNs to their receptors causes receptor dimerization, triggering signal transduction by activation of intracellular tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. The IFN-induced signal pathway has been elucidated recently (1Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). During the response to IFN-α, Jak1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases are activated, leading to activation of their downstream substrates, s ignal t ransducers and a ctivators of t ranscription (Stat)1 and Stat2. Activated Stat1 and Stat2 assemble as a multimeric complex, the i nterferon- s timulated g ene f actor3 (ISGF3) complex, with a member of interferon regulatory factor family termed ISGF3γ (3Bluyssen H.A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and translocate into the nucleus where they bind to interferon-stimulated response elements in the promoters of IFN-α-stimulated genes. The response to IFN-γ is structured similarly; Jak1 and Jak2 are activated at IFN-γ receptors, leading to the phosphorylation of Stat1. Activated Stat1 forms homodimers as the γ-activated factor, translocates into the nucleus, and binds the γ-activated site elements in the promoters of IFN-γ-induced genes (4Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlieststra R.J. van der Made A.C.J. Leung S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Trapman J. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5645-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The essential role of Stat1 in IFN signaling has been demonstrated by the IFN-resistant phenotypes of cells and animals missing the Stat1 gene product (5Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C.

Upon IFN-α stimulation, Stat1 and Stat2 are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation within minutes, resulting in rapid production of ISGF3 (8Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell J.E.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, these responses are often transient. Following prolonged treatment of cells with IFN, the levels of phosphorylated STAT proteins decline to near pro-treatment levels, leading to a decline in IFN-stimulated gene expression (9Decker T. Lew D.J. Cheng Y.S. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2009-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The waning of induced gene expression is often accompanied by a refractory state during which cells remain unresponsive to addition of fresh inducer (10Larner A.C. Chaudhuri A. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This desensitization phenomenon demonstrates the tight regulation of IFN responses and is likely important to ensure the proper and controlled action of these potent cytokines. Mechanisms responsible for the control of IFN-induced responses probably operate on several levels. These include down-regulation and degradation of receptors (11Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), regulation of the activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) controlling the phosphorylation of STATs, the degradation of JAK and STAT proteins, for example, by proteasomes (12Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and potentially the regulated nuclear transport of activated STATs (13Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms limiting the response to IFN remain undefined. Human Daudi lymphoblastoid cells are highly sensitive to the biological effects of IFN. This high sensitivity is at least partially due to a prolonged rather than transient transcriptional response to IFN in which IFN-stimulated gene expression remains induced for greater than 24 h post-treatment (14Tiwari R.K. Kusari J. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3373-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms for maintaining this response are still unknown. We have examined the mechanisms underlying the prolonged response to IFN-α in Daudi cells. We found that the level of phosphorylated STAT protein in Daudi cells is prolonged following continued treatment with IFN-α, and that this prolonged phosphorylation was strictly dependent on continued activity of JAK protein-tyrosine kinases. Moreover, neither tyrosine dephosphorylation nor protein turnover appeared to be impaired in Daudi cells, suggesting that the maintenance of phosphorylated STAT protein is regulated primarily at the level of active phosphorylation. Interestingly, we found that the continued activity of JAK kinases and of STAT phosphorylation were dependent on the induced secretion of autocrine IFN. Daudi (ATCC), a human lymphoblastoid cell lines, and FS2, a human fibroblast cell line, were maintained in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

In brief, a double-stranded 32P-labeled DNA probe containing interferon-stimulated response element sequence from the human ISG15 gene (17Reich N. Evans B. Levy D.E. Fahey D. Knight E. Darnell J.E.

Total cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tri-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Nuclear extracts were prepared by incubating nuclei in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (18Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h, followed by addition of 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and incubation for 1.5 h (18Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were treated with IFN-α, 500 units/ml, for 30 min, washed three times with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for various times in medium without label. Cells were preincubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h, followed by addition of 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and incubation for 2 h (13Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were washed, incubated in label-free medium, and then treated with IFN-α (500 units/ml) for different times. Jak1 or Tyk2 immunoprecipitated from total cell extracts were incubated with 15 μl of in vitro kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4) containing 20 μm ATP for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding protein sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixture was fractionated on 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and phosphorylation was detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (19Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). As a control, reaction mixtures lacking ATP were processed in parallel. Since Daudi cells maintain transcription of IFN-stimulated genes during prolonged treatment with IFN, we studied the kinetics of activation of ISGF3 and of Stat1 and Stat2 phosphorylation. Cells were treated with recombinant IFN-α-2a for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h, and the kinetics of ISGF3 activation were determined using EMSA. For comparison, ISGF3 was also analyzed in FS2 cells, a human fibroblast cell line that displays a typically transient response. ISGF3 was detected after stimulation for 30 min in FS2, and the complex dramatically decreased after 4 h (Fig. 1 A, upper panel), indicative of a transient response to IFN-α. Following 24 h of continuous treatment with IFN, no active ISGF3 was detected in either cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts (data not shown). A similar phenomenon was seen in other human cell lines, such as HeLa S3 and 2fTGH (data not shown). In contrast, Daudi cells showed prolonged activation of ISGF3. Activated ISGF3 was detected after 30 min of IFN-α treatment and was maintained for greater than 24 h (Fig. 1 A, lower panel, and data not shown). The level of active ISGF3 in extracts of Daudi cells treated with IFN for 24 h was ∼70% of the level observed following 30 min of treatment. As previously reported (20Dron M. Tovey M.G. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a basal activation of ISGF3 was also observed in Daudi cells in the absence of exogenous IFN-α stimulation (Fig. 1 A,lower panel, lane 1). To confirm that Stat1 and Stat2 phosphorylation was prolonged in response to IFN-α, the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of these two proteins were followed by immunoprecipitating with anti-Stat1 (Fig. 1 B, left panel) or Stat2 (Fig. 1 B,right panel) antibody followed by blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. Stat1 and Stat2 were tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation for 10 min, and the phosphorylation was maintained for at least 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), consistent with the formation of ISGF3. Since activated Stat1 and Stat2 formed heterodimers, antibody to either Stat1 or Stat2 also co-immunoprecipitated its counterpart. By reblotting with anti-Stat1 and Stat2 antibodies, the protein levels were shown to be comparable after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1 B,lower panel). These results indicated that Daudi cells have prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2, which results in prolonged activation of ISGF3 in response to IFN-α. The administration of phosphatase inhibitors such as sodium vanadate or pervanadate to cells causes the accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated STATs even in the absence of IFN stimulation (21Haque S.J. Flati V. Deb A. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25709-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Igarashi K. David M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Lamb P. Haslam J. Kessler L. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting tyrosine phosphatases are required to maintain STAT proteins in a latent state. To test the involvement of phosphatases in the prolonged response, the turnover rate of phosphorylated STATs was measured using in vivopulse-chase labeling. Daudi cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 1.5 h, followed by treatment with IFN-α for 30 min. Cells were then washed and incubated in the absence of label for 0, 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h. Stat1 and Stat2 proteins were immunoprecipitated, and phosphorylated protein was detected by autoradiography.32P-Labeled, activated Stat1 (Fig. 2 A, left panel) and Stat2 (right panel) were observed in both cytoplasmic (Fig. 2 A, upper panel) and nuclear (lower panel) extracts at the beginning of the chase process (Fig. 2 A, lane 2 in each panel). The signals, however, disappeared in both compartments after 4 h (Fig. 2 A), even though protein levels of Stat1 and Stat2 were still comparable throughout the experiment (data not shown). This result indicated that the phosphorylation of activated Stat1 and Stat2 turned over very rapidly, although the proteins themselves were relatively stable. The short half-life (<2 h) of phosphorylated STATs suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphatases constantly counteracted ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Alternatively, protein degradation could be responsible for the rapid turnover of activated STAT proteins. To distinguish these possibilities, we performed [35S]methionine pulse-chase labeling to determine the half-life of Stat1 and Stat2 proteins following IFN treatment. Daudi cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h. Cells were then washed, stimulated with IFN-α, and incubated in the absence of label for 0 min, 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h. Stat1 and Stat2 were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and labeled protein was detected by autoradiography. The levels of Stat1 (Fig. 2 B, left panel) and Stat2 (Fig. 2 B, right panel) were found to be comparable during the course of the experiment, indicating that both Stat1 and Stat2 protein stability is considerably greater than the relatively short half-life of the tyrosine phosphate (Fig. 2 A). The rapid turnover of phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 was in marked contrast to the near constant levels of active ISGF3 observed throughout the treatment period. This result suggested that new protein was being constantly phosphorylated to counteract the loss of active STAT protein due to dephosphorylation. This prompted us to examine the requirement for continued kinase activity. Cells were treated for 30 min with IFN-α to activate ISGF3. Then, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was added to block further JAK kinase activity. ISGF3 formation was detected after the initial 30 min of treatment; however, complex formation was significantly blocked following 2 h of treatment with genistein and was undetectable following incubation for 24 h (Fig. 2 C). A similar phenomenon was observed using another kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, while the protein kinase C inhibitor, H7, had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). These results show that continuous protein tyrosine kinase activity was required for maintaining a prolonged response to IFN. The observation that continuous protein kinase activity was required for sustaining the IFN-α response in Daudi cells prompted us to study directly the kinase activity of Jak1 and Tyk2. Jak1 (Fig. 3, upper panel) or Tyk2 (lower panel) were immunoprecipitated from cells either left untreated or treated with IFN-α for 30 min, 4 h, and 24 h, and kinase activity was measured in vitro. Both Jak1 and Tyk2 showed similar kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFN-α. A basal phosphorylation was detected in the absence of IFN-α treatment, which was stimulated to high levels after 30 min of treatment. Augmented levels of kinase activity were maintained for 24 h (Fig. 3, left panel). Similarly, both Jak1 and Tyk2 exhibited elevated kinase activity toward exogenous substrates 24 h after treatment of cells with IFN (data not shown), suggesting that the kinase activity of Jak1 and of Tyk2 were prolonged in Daudi cells in response to IFN-α. The preceding results indicated that the prolonged response to IFN-α was maintained by continued JAK kinase activity. We next considered whether this continued kinase activity required continuous ligand stimulation. Cells were pulsed with IFN-α for 30 min, then incubated in the absence of IFN-α for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by EMSA. ISGF3 was found to be maintained for 24 h in the absence of exogenous IFN. However, there was a transient decrease followed by a reaccumulation of ISGF3 (Fig. 4 A). This profile suggested that the transient loss of ISGF3 might be due to the turnover of activated STAT proteins as observed during pulse-chase labeling (Fig. 2 A). However, active ISGF3 was restored at later times, presumably through the action of induced factors. To test if the synthesis of new proteins might account for these induced factors, cells were treated with IFN in the presence of CHX. Daudi cells were first pretreated with CHX (50 μg/ml) for 15 min followed by treatment with IFN-α for 15 min, 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h. ISGF3 formation in both cytoplasm (Fig. 4 B,upper panel) and nucleus (lower panel) was gradually reduced and eventually disappeared after 8 h of CHX treatment. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and its associated Stat2 was also diminished after CHX treatment for 8 h (Fig. 4 C, upper panel), correlating with the loss of ISGF3 in EMSA. However, no significant change in the levels of Stat1 protein was detected during treatment with CHX (Fig. 4 C,lower panel), indicating that degradation of Stat1 is not a significant mechanism for removal of activated STATs and that its synthesis does not account for CHX sensitivity. Taken together, these results suggested that continuous presence of IFN-α is required to maintain the prolonged activation of STAT proteins, maintaining JAK kinase activity through the action of induced factors. It has been shown that Daudi cells secrete low levels of IFN-α (20Dron M. Tovey M.G. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To test if secretion of IFNs was induced in response to IFN treatment and thus contributed to the reactivation of ISGF3 during the IFN-α withdrawal experiment, anti-IFN-α antisera were employed. Daudi cells were first pulsed with IFN-α for 30 min, and then incubated in the absence of exogenous IFN-α but in the presence of anti-IFN-α antisera for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h. ISGF3 formation was significantly reduced after 4 h, and was totally abolished after 8 h of antibody treatment (Fig. 5 A), indicating that secretion of endogenous IFN-α is required for maintaining a prolonged response in the absence of exogenous IFN-α. To further confirm that secretion of IFN-α indeed was induced in Daudi cells by IFN-α treatment, conditioned medium collected from IFN-α-pulsed cells was used to treat naive Daudi cells. Cells were treated with IFN-α for 30 min and then incubated in the absence of IFN for an additional 24 h. Conditioned medium from these cultures was used to treat fresh cultures of Daudi cells for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h, which were subsequently analyzed by EMSA. Conditioned medium was able to activate ISGF3 formation at 30 min, and this activation was maintained for 24 h (Fig. 5 B). Conditioned medium from cells that had never been exposed to IFN-α showed no such activity (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). ISGF3 complex formation was used as a bioassay to quantitate the amount of IFN-α secreted in IFN-α-stimulated Daudi cells. Activity equivalent to about 0.5 unit/ml recombinant human IFN-α-2a was produced from 1 × 107/ml cells previously pulsed with IFN-α (data not shown). Since anti-IFN-α antibody blocked prolonged activation of ISGF3 in Daudi cells, the effect of this antibody on the activation of Stat1 and Stat2 was examined. Daudi cells were pulsed with IFN-α and treated with anti-IFN-α antibody for 4 and 24 h. As a control, cells were treated with IFN-α for 10 min in the absence of neutralizing antibody. Activated Stat1 and Stat2 were monitored by using antibodies for immunoprecipitation followed by blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. The results showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 appeared after 10 min of stimulation and was readily blocked by treatment with antibody for 4 h (Fig. 6 A, upper panel) even though protein levels were comparable during the 24 h of treatment (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). The kinase activity of Jak1 was also transient under these conditions. Jak1 was no longer autophosphorylated after 4 h of antibody treatment (Fig. 6 B, left panel). Further, the ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrate was also abrogated (data not shown), indicating that neutralization of secreted IFN-α inhibited the prolonged response to IFN. These results suggested that autocrine production and secretion of IFNs were required for maintaining STAT phosphorylation. Regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation (activation) and dephosphorylation (deactivation) of STAT proteins controls IFN-mediated signaling and biological activities. Transient activation of STAT proteins results in rapid responses, whereas prolonged activation leads to prolonged levels of gene induction and enhanced biological activities. The regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is orchestrated by the coordinated action of PTPs and protein-tyrosine kinases (24Tonks N.K. Sun H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). Modulation of the function of either PTPs or protein tyrosine kinases results in imbalanced activity, leading to altered signal transduction and response. For example, an EPO receptor-associated phosphatase SH-PTP1 (HCP, PTP1C, SHP-1) regulates EPO signaling (26Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Cells expressing mutant EPO-R lacking SH-PTP1 docking sites are hypersensitive to EPO stimulation and display a prolonged activation of the receptor-associated protein-tyrosine kinase, Jak2. Similarly, macrophages derived from motheaten mice, which lack SH-PTP1, show increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Stat1 upon IFN-α stimulation (27David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The region of STAT proteins involved in the interaction with phosphatases is further suggested by the constitutive activation and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of an amino-terminally deleted version of Stat1 when overexpressed in cells. While this result suggests that the amino terminus is crucial for modulating STAT activity through tyrosine dephosphorylation (28Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whether tyrosine dephosphorylation is constitutive or ligand-dependent has not been determined. Data presented in this report demonstrate that the unusually prolonged IFN-α response of Daudi cells requires continued protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Jak1 and Tyk2 remain active for prolonged periods following IFN treatment, and addition of protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors at any point during the response leads to a rapid cessation of STAT activity. The need for continued kinase activity appears to be due to the opposing action of one or more PTPs. The half-life of STAT phosphorylation was found to be short (<2 h), reflecting the constitutive activity of PTPs. This rapid turnover of phosphorylation is sufficient to explain the loss of activated STAT proteins observed in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It would also account for the limited duration of STAT activation observed in more typical cell lines that do not maintain prolonged kinase activity (e.g. FS2). Therefore, it is likely that the regulation of JAK activity, rather than changes in the rate of dephosphorylation, is the primary mode for controlling the duration of IFN-α responses. An additional mechanism for the deactivation of STAT proteins besides dephosphorylation could be protein degradation. Given the relatively stable nature of Stat1 and Stat2 protein, such degradation would need to be targeted specifically for phosphorylated protein to explain the loss of activated STATs in the absence of significant loss of total protein. Indeed, specific degradation of phosphorylated Stat1 in IFN-γ treated HeLa cells through a ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway has been recently reported (12Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, protein degradation does not appear to be responsible for the observed turnover of phosphorylated Stat1 or Stat2 in IFN-α-treated Daudi cells. First, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors did not prevent the turnover of phosphorylated STATs (data not shown). Second, we estimate that approximately 50% of total cellular Stat2 and 15–20% of cellular Stat1 are phosphorylated in Daudi cells treated with IFN-α for 30 min (Stat1 is more abundant than Stat2). This estimate was based on the fraction of STAT protein that is translocated to the nucleus and the relative intensities of anti-phosphotyrosine signals in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (data not shown). Given this large fraction of the cellular pool of STAT protein that is activated, significant loss of protein would be expected to be observed following 4 h of treatment if protein degradation played a major role in turnover. In contrast, little or no turnover of total Stat1 or Stat2 was observed by [35S]methionine pulse-chase labeling (Fig. 2 B) while significant turnover of phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, although we cannot completely exclude a role for protein degradation in the turnover of phosphorylated STAT proteins, we conclude that a constitutive PTP contributes the major activity. Similar conclusions implicating the dephosphorylation of activated Stat1 in the absence of significant protein degradation have been recently reported for IFN-γ-treated cells (13Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underlying the prolonged kinase activity of Jak1 and Tyk2 in Daudi cells are still unknown. The continuous requirement of ligand stimulation in maintaining a prolonged response suggests that receptor-mediated signaling is involved. Although evidence has suggested that IFN-α-induced receptor down-regulation and degradation occurred rapidly in Daudi cells (11Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the retention of ligand-receptor-kinase complexes within endosomes might contribute to prolonged kinase activity similar to that seen in the epidermal growth factor-induced response of liver parenchyma (29Di-Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recycling of a small portion of high affinity receptors in Daudi cells could also maintain the kinase activity. Interestingly, the administration of neutralizing antibody inhibited this prolonged response (Fig. 4 B), and conditioned medium collected from IFN-α-stimulated Daudi cells contained IFN-α (Fig. 4 C), suggesting the continuous production and secretion of IFN-α. This autocrine loop of IFN-α not only contributes to a prolonged response, it also increases the sensitivity to IFN-α owing to the basal activation of the signaling machinery. It has been shown that specific IFN-α mRNAs are constitutively present at low levels in organs of normal humans (30Tovey M.G. Streuli M. Gresser I. Gugenheim J. Blanchard B. Guymarho J. Vignaux F. Gigou M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5038-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), indicating that the constant production of IFN-α could also provide an important host defense mechanism against invading pathogens. Thus, the involvement of autocrine secretion and production of IFN-α in maintaining a prolonged response may play a significant role in vivo. Although Daudi cells have been shown to secrete low amounts of IFN-α constitutively (20Dron M. Tovey M.G. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we show here that IFN-α secretion is induced to higher levels in Daudi cells in response to IFN-α. The finding that CHX treatment blocked the prolonged response (Fig. 4) suggested the requirement for new protein synthesis. The IFN detected in conditioned medium was indeed produced by the cells and could not be ascribed to residual exogenous IFN from the treatment pulse. Neutralization with anti-IFN monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the secreted IFN was a mixture of IFN-α subtypes rather than the recombinant IFN-α-2a used for exogenous treatment (data not shown). IFN-γ also has been shown to induce prolonged activation of Stat1 and continued transcriptional activation of an IFN-γ-inducible gene, such as GBP (31Lew D.J. Decker T. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5404-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Decker T. Lew D.J. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, there are several different aspects that distinguish the IFN-α-induced prolonged response. First, the IFN-γ-induced response is stable to removal of ligand, while the response induced by IFN-α is dependent on continuous presence of IFN-α. Second, the response to IFN-γ is sensitive to protein kinase C inhibitors while the IFN-α-induced response is not affected by these kinase inhibitors. Third, the response to IFN-γ is only partially affected by CHX treatment, but the continued response of Daudi cells to IFN-α is totally blocked by CHX. The differences between IFN-γ and IFN-α-induced prolonged response suggest that a unique mechanism may be involved in the regulation of the IFN-α response in Daudi cells. We thank M. Seidel for providing the Jak1 antibody, S. Pellegrini for Tyk2 antibodies, and C. Schindler for Stat1 and Stat2 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2035966771,"We have studied the effects of singlet oxygen produced by photodynamic action on the cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition (PT) in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Mitochondria were incubated with 3 μmhematoporphyrin and irradiated at 365 nm with a fluence rate of 25 watts/m2. For short durations of irradiation (60 s) the adenine nucleotide translocase was inactivated, but mitochondria retained their ability to form a proton electrochemical gradient and accumulated Ca2+ and Pi at the same rate as non-irradiated controls. Strikingly, however, the oxidative effects of photodynamic action prevented opening of the PT pore which is normally induced by Ca2+ plus Pi or by treatment with diethyl pyrocarbonate (a histidine reagent) or diamide (a thiol oxidant). We show that the most likely targets for photodynamic action are critical histidines that undergo degradation. Irradiated, hematoporphyrin-loaded mitochondria treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate or diamide still undergo the PT when treated with phenylarsine oxide, which reacts with a critical dithiol involved in pore modulation (Petronilli, V., Costantini, P., Scorrano, L., Colonna, R., Passamonti, S., and Bernardi, P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16638–16642). These data suggest (i) that the dithiol cysteines are not oxidized by photodynamic action, but rather became inaccessible to oxidants; and (ii) that irradiation of hematoporphyrin-loaded mitochondria does not lead to pore denaturation, but rather to site-selective inactivation of discrete pore functional domains. We have studied the effects of singlet oxygen produced by photodynamic action on the cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition (PT) in isolated rat liver mitochondria.

When Ca2+-loaded mitochondria are treated with a variety of inducing agents, the opening of Ca2+-dependent pores leads to the so-called permeability transition of the inner membrane, which is specifically inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of cyclosporin A. Among Ca2+-dependent pore inducers, oxidizing agents have received considerable attention, and redox state changes of pyridine nucleotides, glutathione, or sulfhydryl groups have been shown to have a prominent role in the mechanism (or in the control) of Ca2+ efflux following pore opening (for general reviews, see Refs. 1Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar and 2Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have studied the effects of the very reactive species, singlet oxygen, 1O2, on isolated rat liver mitochondria. The presence of 1O2 as a transient species able to damage cells, mainly at the mitochondrial level, can be observed in disease, such as in porphyria (3Sandberg S. Romslo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and in the treatment of solid tumor by porphyrin photodynamic therapy (4Dougherty T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 58: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The effects of 1O2 on substrate transport, respiration, and phosphorylation are well documented, but few reports deal with those on the uptake and release of Ca2+ from mitochondria (for a general review, see Ref. 5Salet C. Moreno G. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1990; 5: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In 1981 we have reported (6Salet C. Moreno G. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1981; 399: 227-230Google Scholar) that treatment with 1O2 produced by porphyrin photodynamic action can prevent Ca2+ release due to membrane “damage” resulting from massive Ca2+loading. At that time, our interpretation was that such a release from Ca2+-overloaded mitochondria was probably of no physiological relevance. This aspect must now be reconsidered in the light of recent developments in the mitochondrial PT 1The abbreviations used are: PT, permeability transition; HP, hematoporphyrin IX; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; DIA, diamide; AdNT, adenine nucleotide translocase; PhAsO, phenylarsine oxide; FCCP, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. field. It is now widely accepted that Ca2+ release can occur through opening of a specific channel sensitive to cyclosporin A rather than to unspecific membrane damage. These advances prompted us to study more thoroughly the effect of photodynamic action on mitochondrial energy transduction and Ca2+ fluxes. As in our previous studies, HP has been chosen as an exogenous photosensitizer in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Our results show that, in sharp contrast with other activated oxygen species such as H2O2 or O·̄2 (1Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar), 1O2 does not induce PT. Rather HP photodynamic action leads to suppression of the PT induced by Ca2+ plus Pi, DEPC, or DIA. Photoirradiated, HP-loaded mitochondria treated with DEPC or DIA still undergo the PT when treated with PhAsO, which reacts with a critical dithiol involved in pore modulation (7Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that the dithiol cysteines are not oxidized by 1O2, but rather became inaccessible to oxidants, and suggest that irradiation of HP-loaded mitochondria does not lead to pore denaturation, but rather to site-selective inactivation of discrete pore functional domains comprising critical histidines. Preparation of rat liver mitochondria was performed as described previously (8Salet C. Moreno G. Vinzens F. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 36: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To compare with maximum accuracy the various responses, mitochondria were placed in a vessel fitted with both an oxygen and a Ca2+ electrode (9Salet C. Moreno G. Vinzens F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and all the irradiations were performed under the same optical conditions, i.e. 3 μmHP, giving an absorbance of 0.14/cm at the irradiation wavelength of 365 nm. Irradiation was performed using a Philips HPW 125-watt lamp (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) after 120 s incubation in the dark, since uptake of HP in isolated mitochondria reaches a plateau within 120 s (10Ricchelli F. Gobbo S. Jori G. Moreno G. Vinzens F. Salet C. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 58: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fluence rate incident to the mitochondrial suspension was 25 watts/m2, as measured with a Black Ray UV meter (J 221, Ultraviolet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA). All irradiations were performed at 25 °C under magnetic stirring. Proper controls were carried out, indicating that the inhibitors used (rotenone, oligomycin, and cyclosporin A) gave a negligible light absorption at the wavelength of irradiation and that neither photosensitizer addition in the dark nor illumination alone were able to produce any change in the measured parameters (results not shown). Pi carrier activity was followed using the classical swelling technique of Chappel and Haarhoff (11Chappel G.B. Haarhoff K.N. Slater E.C. Kaniuga Z. Wojtczak L. Biochemistry of Mitochondria. Academic Press and Polish Scientific Publishers, London and Warsaw1967: 75-91Google Scholar). Measurement of ADP/ATP exchange was performed fluorometrically in control and photosensitized mitochondria as described by Passarellaet al. (12Passarella S. Ostuni A. Atlante A. Quagliariello E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial swelling was followed spectroscopically as the decrease in the absorbance of the mitochondrial suspension at 540 nm measured with a SLM Aminco DW 2000 spectrophotometer operated in the split beam mode (13Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reagents were of the finest available grade and were used without further purification. HP was purchased from Aldrich and 1 mm stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Cyclosporin A, a gift from Dr. A. Roche of the Laboratoires Sandoz, Rueil Malmaison, France, was dissolved in ethanol. Incubation conditions and further experimental details are given in the figure legends. We have long been interested in the relative effects of irradiation on specific mitochondrial functions. We have shown that at increasing doses of radiation, oxidative phosphorylation is the first function to be lost, whereas respiration and Ca2+ cycling are more resistant (9Salet C. Moreno G. Vinzens F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that selective targets for the photodynamic effect of porphyrins exist in mitochondria and that these may be exploited to understand the mechanism(s) of phototoxicity. Fig. 1 shows the effects of increasing durations of irradiation in the presence of 3 μm HP on respiration in state 4 (in the absence of ADP) or 3 (in the presence of ADP) and after addition of FCCP. Short exposures to irradiation (up to 60 s) did not affect state 4 respiration, and ADP-stimulated respiration was more sensitive to photodynamic action than FCCP-uncoupled respiration. This suggests that neither electron transport nor membrane potential is severely impaired after short durations of irradiation, in good agreement with Ref. 14Atlante A. Passarella S. Quagliariello E. Moreno G. Salet C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1989; 4: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. Fig. 2 shows that in fact damage to the AdNT (rather than damage to the ATP-synthase, as indicated before in Ref.14Atlante A. Passarella S. Quagliariello E. Moreno G. Salet C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1989; 4: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is responsible for the inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, the exchange rate as a function of ADP concentration at increasing irradiation times indicates a strong non-competitive inhibition of the carrier. From this set of experiments, we conclude that the AdNT is a sensitive target that is easily inactivated by HP photodynamic action.Figure 2Effects of HP + light on the AdNT activity. Experimental conditions were as in Fig. 1. After irradiation for various times, measurement of ADP/ATP efflux was performed in control mitochondria (•), and in mitochondria irradiated for 60 s (○), 120 s (□), or 240 s (×) using an ATP-detecting system, exactly as described in Ref. 12Passarella S. Ostuni A. Atlante A. Quagliariello E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As indicated above, Ca2+ cycling in isolated mitochondria appears to be less sensitive to photodynamic action than oxidative phosphorylation (9Salet C. Moreno G. Vinzens F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have specifically addressed the issue of how irradiation affects Ca2+ uptake and release from mitochondria and the pathways for Ca2+efflux under these conditions. To study the effects of irradiation on Ca2+ transport, Ca2+ uptake was measured after various periods of irradiation and recorded as the initial rate of Ca2+ influx in mitochondria energized with succinate + rotenone under conditions where Ca2+ uptake is not limited by the rate of respiration (20 μm CaCl2 in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+, see Ref. 15Bragadin M. Pozzan T. Azzone G.F. Biochemistry. 1980; 18: 5972-5978Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake strongly declined only after 180 s of irradiation. This is consistent with the results of Fig. 1, indicating that brief irradiations leave mitochondria with a good respiratory capacity, used here to drive Ca2+ uptake along the electrochemical gradient. Inhibition of Ca2+ transport was not a consequence of inactivation of the Pi carrier, since up to 240 s of irradiation had negligible effects on the rate of Pi uptake measured according to Ref. 11Chappel G.B. Haarhoff K.N. Slater E.C. Kaniuga Z. Wojtczak L. Biochemistry of Mitochondria. Academic Press and Polish Scientific Publishers, London and Warsaw1967: 75-91Google Scholar (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows a typical experiment where mitochondria energized with succinate + rotenone, and loaded with 80 μm Ca2+, were subsequently exposed to continuous irradiation. Initially, mitochondria treated in this way remained in a steady state, maintaining an external Ca2+concentration of about 1 μm. After over 120 s of irradiation, a process of Ca2+ efflux ensued, which could not be inhibited by the addition of 0.8 μm cyclosporin A to the medium. We conclude that long durations of irradiation (>120 s) inhibit respiration to the point that the proton electrochemical gradient can no longer be maintained. Under these conditions Ca2+ leaves the matrix by reverse operation of the uniporter rather than through the PT. Shorter irradiation times, on the other hand, do not impair Ca2+ uptake or retention by mitochondria (Figs. 3 and 4). The latter condition was then exploited to test the effect(s) of photodynamic action on the PT. The experiment of Fig. 5illustrates the effect of increasing irradiation duration on the ability of HP-treated mitochondria to take up and retain Ca2+. Non-irradiated mitochondria did not retain a 150 μm Ca2+ pulse, and a fast process of Ca2+ release readily followed the initial phase of Ca2+ uptake (trace A) because of a PT (see Fig. 6). After 30 s of irradiation, mitochondria readily accumulated the initial 150 μmCa2+ pulse (trace B), whereas Ca2+efflux was triggered by a further 20 μm Ca2+load (trace B). After 60 s of irradiation the ability of mitochondria to retain Ca2+ was further improved (trace C), whereas higher irradiation periods impaired the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake (trace D), as expected from the extent of respiratory inhibition and therefore of impairment of membrane potential regeneration (Figs. 3 and 4). For this reason, 60 s of irradiation were used in all subsequent experiments.Figure 6Effects of HP + light on mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes and on permeabilization to sucrose. The incubation medium contained 200 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Mops, pH 7.4, 5 mm succinate Tris, 1 mm Pi, 10 μm EGTA-Tris, 2 μg/ml rotenone, and 3 μg/ml oligomycin.

Fig. 6, panel A, shows that non-irradiated mitochondria underwent a fast, spontaneous Ca2+ release process when challenged with a 150 μm Ca2+ pulse (trace a), which could be totally prevented by 800 nm cyclosporin A (not shown). As expected, spontaneous Ca2+ efflux was prevented by 60 s of irradiation, yet Ca2+ efflux was readily observed after the addition of the uncoupler FCCP (trace b). This process of Ca2+ efflux was not prevented by cyclosporin A (trace c), indicating that upon addition of FCCP rapid reversal of the uniport takes place. The experiments reported in Fig. 6, panel B, show that non-irradiated mitochondria were permeabilized to sucrose by Ca2+(trace a), whereas irradiated mitochondria maintained their permeability barrier when challenged with an identical Ca2+load (trace b), and yet underwent permeabilization and swelling upon addition of FCCP (trace b), in a process that maintained full sensitivity to cyclosporin A (trace c). These findings represent a first indication that the PT pores can still form and open upon depolarization even in photoirradiated mitochondria. Reversible protonation of histidyl residues and oxidoreduction of thiol groups play an important role in the modulation of pore opening (2Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). As1O2 is very reactive with histidine and thiol groups (16Straight R.C. Spikes J.D. Frimer A.A. Singlet O2. IV. CRC, Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 92-143Google Scholar), we have determined whether inducers specifically reacting with these structures have a different mode of action after irradiation. Using the same swelling technique, PT was studied in mitochondria loaded with 40 μm Ca2+. Fig. 7, panel A, shows that addition of DIA to control mitochondria induced the expected PT, with rapid permeabilization to sucrose after a short lag phase (trace a). Strikingly, however, DIA was not able to cause pore opening in irradiated mitochondria (trace b), suggesting that the pore can no longer be induced by thiol oxidation. In irradiated mitochondria the pore could still be opened by the hydrophobic dithiol reagent, PhAsO (trace c), indicating that the dithiol cysteines have not undergone oxidation but are rather not accessible to oxidants from the aqueous phase. It should be mentioned that addition of PhAsO alone in these protocols was followed by pore opening (not shown). Finally, the lack of pore opening by DIA could be observed in a range of concentrations that are very effective at pore opening in control mitochondria (Fig. 7, panel B). Fig. 8, panel A, reports the results of a similar experiment where control or irradiated mitochondria were treated with DEPC. As expected (17Nicolli A.M. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) DEPC treatment caused pore opening in control mitochondria (trace a). On the other hand, DEPC was unable to cause a PT in irradiated mitochondria (trace b), suggesting that histidine(s) are among the targets of 1O2. Also in this case the pore remained competent for opening, as demonstrated by the rapid permeabilization following the addition of PhAsO (trace c). Fig. 8, panel B, shows the effects of increasing concentrations of DEPC on pore opening in control (closed symbols) and irradiated mitochondria (open symbols). It can be appreciated that at concentrations higher than 0.2 mm DEPC the pore slowly opened even in irradiated mitochondria. This effect, however, can be easily accounted for by respiratory inhibition, which in turn causes pore opening because of membrane depolarization (not shown, but see Ref. 17Nicolli A.M. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have described the effects of irradiation on the mitochondrial PT in HP-treated mitochondria, a well-defined system where the highly reactive species,1O2 is generated. We have shown that irradiation does not cause pore opening. Rather, irradiated HP-treated mitochondria no longer undergo a PT when challenged with Ca2+ plus Pi, DIA, or DEPC (Figs. 6, 7, 8). The experimental conditions (HP concentration, wavelength of irradiation, power density, duration of irradiation, and Ca2+ load) were carefully selected to minimize the effects of irradiation on the basic parameters modulating pore activity. In particular, (i) the respiratory capacity and the coupling efficiency of irradiated mitochondria were sufficient to form and maintain a proton electrochemical gradient (see also Ref. 18Salet C. Moreno G. Atlante A. Passarella S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 391-393PubMed Google Scholar), as indicated by the maintenance of respiratory control with FCCP (Fig. 1); furthermore, a decreased proton electrochemical gradient should have promoted rather than inhibited the PT (2Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and cannot therefore account for the present observations of pore inactivation. (ii) The steady-state Ca2+ accumulation maintained by irradiated mitochondria was identical to that maintained by the controls (Figs. 3 and 4), and the Pi carrier was negligibly affected by irradiation in the presence of HP (not shown); thus, pore inhibition cannot be explained by a lower Ca2+load nor by a different response of matrix pH to Ca2+uptake and release because of impaired Pi equilibration. (iii) Even if we cannot exclude a minute generation of O·̄2 due to either energy transfers from HP excited triplet state (19Hariharan P.V. Courtney J. Eleczko S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1980; 37: 691-694Crossref Google Scholar) or increases in the respiratory chain e − leakage after irradiation (20Salet C. Moreno G. Ricchelli F. Free Rad.

Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) indicates that reactive oxygen species promote the PT, most likely through oxidation of matrix glutathione (21Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C141-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Grijalba M.T. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); therefore, it is unlikely that pore inhibition is mediated by other activated oxygen species, which would rather counteract the inactivating effects of1O2. From these considerations we conclude that pore inhibition in irradiated, HP-treated mitochondria most likely depends on direct effects of 1O2 on critical residues important for pore function. Irrespective of the detailed mechanism(s) by which irradiation interferes with the pore, our data are consistent with the idea that 1O2selectively inactivates specific domains, either on the pore itself or on pore regulatory protein(s), normally acting as sensors for modulatory signals. Indeed, the effects of irradiation cannot be ascribed to a denaturation of the pore, since a PT can still be observed in irradiated mitochondria upon addition of FCCP after Ca2+ plus Pi loading (Fig. 6) or upon addition of PhAsO after treatment with DIA or with DEPC (Figs. 7 and 8). 1O2 is a very reactive, transient species capable of damaging nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (16Straight R.C. Spikes J.D. Frimer A.A. Singlet O2. IV. CRC, Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 92-143Google Scholar). Its lifetime is very short in biological materials, which restricts its action to the close vicinity (<0.1 μm) of the photosensitizer (24Moan J. Berg K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Although the membrane lipid phase is clearly involved in modulating the PT, possibly through surface potential effects (25Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 26Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we tend to exclude that pore inactivation by HP photodynamic action is due to lipid peroxidation, which should rather promote the PT (1Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). The most likely target for1O2-dependent pore inhibition appears to be proteinaceous in nature. HP dissolved in aqueous media preferentially accumulates in protein-binding sites of the inner mitochondrial membrane (27Ricchelli F. Gobbo S. Jori G. Salet C. Moreno G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 165-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photosensitized protein damage can produce important primary structural and functional changes through the photo-oxidation of five amino acid residues, namely cysteine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine (16Straight R.C. Spikes J.D. Frimer A.A. Singlet O2. IV. CRC, Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 92-143Google Scholar). Two of these residues readily oxidized by 1O2, cysteine and histidine, have been shown to play a critical role in regulation of the PT (7Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicolli A.M. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Dithiol-disulfide interconversions at vicinal cysteines affect the pore open-closed transitions, a higher open probability being associated with the disulfide (7Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actual dithiol oxidant appears to be oxidized glutathione, which would mediate pore opening by a variety of oxidants (23Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cysteine is oxidized to cystine by1O2 (16Straight R.C. Spikes J.D. Frimer A.A. Singlet O2. IV. CRC, Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 92-143Google Scholar), and in the context of pore regulation by dithiols one could have predicted an increased probability of pore opening rather than the observed pore inactivation. These findings indicate that the inactivating effects of 1O2cannot be simply ascribed to cysteine oxidation leading to a dithiol-disulfide interconversion. The observed pore inactivation probably involves different SH groups or is the consequence of a conformational change brought about by photooxidation of other residues, which in turn prevents access of oxidized glutathione to the dithiol. This is supported by the finding that DIA, an SH group oxidant, is no longer effective at inducing pore opening in irradiated, HP-treated mitochondria; yet, pore opening under these conditions can still be observed by addition of the hydrophobic reagent PhAsO (Fig. 7), which reacts with vicinal dithiols to form a stable complex. Since pore opening by DIA and PhAsO is inhibited byN-ethylmaleimide and monobromobimane with the same apparent I50 (7Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we conclude that their site of action coincides, and we deduce that critical dithiols have not undergone oxidation as a result of irradiation. The pore open-closed transitions are also regulated by reversible protonation of histidine residues from the matrix side of the membrane, with reversible pore closure at acidic matrix pH values that can be prevented by histidine carbethoxylation with DEPC (17Nicolli A.M. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Free histidine residues can be photodegraded to several different compounds after cycloaddition of 1O2 (29Tomita M. Irie M. Ukita T. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 5149-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Based on the inactivating effects of irradiation on the pore, one can speculate that histidine degradation following cleavage of the imidazole ring by1O2 may suppress the regulation of pore opening which depends on histidine protonation-deprotonation. Finally, our findings suggest that under normal conditions the role of histidines is in fact to allow rather than prevent opening of the pore, consistent with the optimum matrix pH for pore opening at 7.3 (17Nicolli A.M. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar),i.e. a pH value at which histidines are largely deprotonated. Among the identified mitochondrial targets for1O2 the AdNT stands out for its extreme sensitivity to photoinactivation (14Atlante A. Passarella S. Quagliariello E. Moreno G. Salet C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1989; 4: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which can be traced to thiol group oxidation at sites critical for transport (30Atlante A. Passarella S. Quagliariello E. Moreno G. Salet C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1990; 7: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since the pore is affected by inhibitors of the AdNT, it has long been suggested that the translocase is involved, directly or indirectly, in pore formation or modulation (see Refs. 1Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar, 2Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar for discussion). More direct evidence has recently come with the demonstrations (i) that the AdNT reconstituted in giant liposomes exhibits a striking Ca2+-dependent, high-conductance channel activity with a marked voltage dependence (31Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) reminiscent of pore behavior both in isolated mitochondria (7Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in single channel measurements on mitoplasts (32Szabo I. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); and (ii) that complexes enriched in hexokinase, porin, and the AdNT exhibit Ca2+-dependent and cyclosporin A-sensitive high-conductance channel activity in planar lipid bilayers (33Beutner G. Rück A. Riede B. Welte W. Brdiczka D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). While it is tempting to speculate that photoinactivation of the AdNT might be responsible for inactivation of the pore as well, we think that evidence remains circumstantial and that photoinactivation might well hit more than one critical target, including pore regulatory proteins like mitochondrial cyclophilin (34Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data presented in this paper support the view that photodynamic action leads to pore inactivation because of selective interference with critical histidine(s), rather than because of a generic pore denaturation, and suggest that the toxic consequences of the photodynamic effect in porphyrias and related disorders may involve an impairment of mitochondrial function also through inactivation of the pore, which is as sensitive to irradiation as is the AdNT. A thorough characterization of the complex consequences of histidine photooxidation on a variety of pore regulatory features (like modulation by the membrane potential and by matrix pH) is currently under way in our laboratories."

RCA are type I transmembrane proteins composed of CCP modules, which contain two intramolecular disulfide bridges and have a size similar to Ig modules (14Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the Ig receptors, in CCP proteins a single module is not sufficient for virus binding. For example, CCP-II to -IV of CD55 are critical for binding of echovirus 7 (15Clarkson N.A. Kaufman R. Lublin D.M. Ward T. Pipkin P.A. Minor P.D. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J.

In human CD21, short amino acid stretches of the EBV-binding CCP modules I and II were exchanged with homologue segments of the non-EBV binding murine CD21. These studies revealed that several amino acids are necessary to maintain a conformation allowing virus binding (16Martin D.R. Yuryev A. Kalli K.R. Fearon D.T. Ahearn J.M. J. Exp.

These secondary interactions, which may be mediated by H and/or by the viral fusion (F) protein (24Devaux P. Loveland B. Christiansen D. Milland J. Gerlier D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), may trigger virus-cell and cell-cell fusion (25Wild T.F. Malvoisin E. Buckland R. J. Gen.

Virol. 1993; 67: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We previously approached the definition of the primary MV binding site by H protein binding studies based on a three-dimensional model of CCP-I-II (27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional model was based on the NMR structure of the CCP modules from another member of the RCA protein family, the human complement factor H. Each of the two CD46 modules is predicted to be about 35 Å long and to form a five-stranded β-barrel structure (27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The two modules are tilted. N-glycosylation sites are situated in the CCP-I-II interface (Asn-80) and on top of CCP-I (Asn-49). We constructed proteins with intermodule exchanges of CCP-I and -II segments. Two of the few altered proteins that reached the cell surface efficiently, a six-amino acid CCP-I exchange mutant (P39-T44, the one letter amino acid code is used) and a 12-amino acid CCP-II exchange mutant (N94-L105), lost H protein binding (27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Partial (P39-T44) or total (N94-L105) loss of reactivity with conformation-dependent antibodies indicated that both mutant proteins did not maintain the native conformation of the CCP modules. Nevertheless, it was noted that both exchanged segments reside on the concave side of the CCP-I-II model, near theN-glycosylation site (Asn-80) essential for the CD46/MV interaction (28Maisner A. Alvarez J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson D.J. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we refine the localization of the MV binding site on CD46. To reduce conformational alterations leading to impaired folding and intracellular transport to a minimum, we based mutagenesis on semi-conservative modifications of single amino acids. We chose residues predicted to be on the CD46 CCP-I-II solvent exposed surface, avoiding alteration of amino acids predicted to constitute the hydrophobic protein core. The mutant proteins were analyzed for H protein binding, viral particle binding, and for binding to conformation-dependent anti-CD46 monoclonal antibodies that exhibited different degrees of interference with the CD46/H protein interaction.DISCUSSIONAttachment of virus proteins to specific cell surface receptors is the first step in viral replication. The description of the molecular mechanism of virus attachment is required to understand cell entry and should guide the rational development of antiviral drugs. Several viral receptors belonging to different protein families have been identified, but only in a few proteins of the Ig family is a three-dimensional description of the receptor binding site available, the best studied case being the HIV receptor CD4. This paper describes mapping of the MV H protein binding site on the two membrane distal CCP modules of the MV receptor CD46, a member of the RCA protein family.Until cocrystals of virus attachment proteins and their receptors will be available, the identification of virus attachment sites has to be sought by other means, including mutagenesis. Then, either affinities of purified soluble receptors or binding efficiencies of recombinant receptors expressed on cell surfaces for their attachment proteins have to be determined. Although dependent on more parameters, we decided on using the latter approach as this reflects the natural situation of viral cell entry more appropriately. Moreover, we used a panel of monoclonal CD46 antibodies, directed against CCP-I or -II, inhibiting the sH·CD46 complex formation to different levels to localize the H attachment site indirectly.An inherent difficulty in the mutagenesis approach is to distinguish between real contact residues and residues necessary to maintain the overall structure of the binding site. Indeed, the exclusive importance of particular residues of the CD4 CDR2 loop for gp120 binding is still disputed (36Zhang X. Gaubin M. Briant L. Srikantan V. Murali R. Saragovi U. Weiner D. Devaux C. Autiero M. Piatier-Tonneau D. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrated severe impairments or even loss of HIV-gp120 binding when single residues of the CDR2 loop were exchanged (37Clayton L.K. Hussey R.E. Steinbrich R. Ramachandran H.

Med. 1992; 176: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, these exchanges often added or reversed charges, possibly altering the native conformation of the binding site. Indeed, less severe substitutions at most of these positions caused only minor effects. Then, only 2 out of 52 mutants with preserved conformation, which remarkably did not contain exchanges of the CDR2 loop, exhibited less than 30% binding activity compared with the standard receptor (41Ashkenazi A. Presta I.G. Marsters S.A. Camerato T.R. Rosenthal K.A. Fendly B.M. Capon D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7150-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).In our analysis, 5 out of 40 mutant CD46 proteins carrying single amino acid exchanges showed reduced binding to sH or purified MV. Previous studies revealed differences between dimeric sH and the tetrameric MV-associated H protein in conformations and their mode of binding to CD46. Therefore, we investigated the binding of both ligands to the mutant receptors. Indeed, exchanges E11A, K29A, and P39A only reduced sH binding but not MV binding. It was previously shown that CCP-III and -IV enhance MV but impair sH binding (23Devaux P. Buchholz C.J. Schneider U. Escoffier C. Cattaneo R. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4157-4160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that these two modules compensated for the slight reductions (binding at about 70% of standard CD46) we observed with E11A and K29A in sH binding when MV was used as ligand. Alternatively, due to their different conformations, sH and MV-associated H might contact different residues on CCP-I and -II (23Devaux P. Buchholz C.J. Schneider U. Escoffier C. Cattaneo R.

Virol. 1997; 71: 4157-4160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Be that as it may, the fact that only minor effects on sH or MV binding with a few mutant receptors occurred shows that the H protein binding motif of CD46 well tolerates single residue exchanges in the CCP-I and -II modules. Therefore, the CD46/H interaction must be based on many contacting residues in CCP-I and -II. For several reasons, we are confident that residues E11, K29, P39, D70, and E84, which reduced sH or MV binding, are among the contacting residues. First, with the possible exception of P39, great care was taken not to alter the module conformations by the residue exchanges. We selected solvent accessible surface residues for the mutagenesis based on the three-dimensional model of CCP-I and -II and replaced them by small residues (alanine for charged and polar residues, serine for apolar residues). The efficient cell surface expression of 38 of the 40 mutant proteins and their unimpaired reactivity against conformation-dependent mAbs revealed that the conformations of the two CCP modules were preserved. Second, residues K29 and D70 are close to or even part of epitopes from mAbs that strongly inhibited the H/CD46 interaction, and residue P39 was covered by the P39-T44 loop exchange mutant, which has lost MV receptor activity (27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, all five residues map to the same (front) side of CCP-I and -II (Fig. 4).Further evidence for the front side containing the H protein attachment site comes from the epitope mapping we performed for mAbs directed against CCP-I or CCP-II. All these mAbs interfered with the CD46/H protein interaction, which is conceivable when a buried antigen area of 560–855 Å2, as determined from crystal structures of antibody/protein antigen complexes (42Davies R.D. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), is considered. Nevertheless, we could distinguish between three groups of mAbs from a panel of seven CCP-I and two CCP-II mAbs inhibiting the complex formation between CD46 and H protein to different levels. As the strongly inhibiting group 3 mAbs reached 100% inhibition of the CD46·H complex formation, we believe that they bind at or close to the H protein attachment site. Their reactivity against the simian CD46 homologue, which is functional as MV receptor, further distinguished them from the other CD46 mAbs investigated and supports the hypothesis that they are directly competing with H protein binding (35Murakami Y. Seya T. Kurita M. Nagasawa S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The moderately and slightly inhibiting group 2 and 1 mAbs are probably indirectly impairing the CD46·H complex formation. Indeed, group 2 also included a CCP-III/IV binding mAb, which can only indirectly interfere.Based on the reactivity of the mAbs against the CD46 mutants, we were able to localize parts of the epitopes of at least one mAb from each of the three groups. The epitope of the slightly inhibiting group 1 mAb is localized on top of the back side of CCP-I (Fig. 4). Indeed, total loss of reactivity against CCP-I was observed with this mAb upon the single amino acid exchange E3A. Exactly this exchange is present in simian CD46, thus explaining the failure of this antigen to react against this mAb. The moderately inhibiting group 2 mAbs seem to have their epitopes on the upper front side of CCP-I, with K17 and, based on indirect evidence, the adjacent E21 as critical residues (Fig. 4, second panel, arrow on E21). Finally, the epitopes of the strongly inhibiting CCP-I mAbs reside in the lower part of the front side of CCP-I, close to the interface (Fig. 4, center panel).Interestingly, the important residues of the I.3.a epitope, especially R25, are close to the loop 39PLATHT44 (Fig. 4, center panel, arrows). This might explain why changing this loop against the corresponding segment of CD55, which is GEKDSV, results in loss of MV receptor function and complete loss of reactivity with all strongly inhibiting CCP-I mAbs (this paper and Ref. 27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is likely that the charged residues within GEKDSV neutralized the mAb binding site and caused local conformational perturbations.While the map of antibody epitopes on CCP-I is quite distinguished, the situation on CCP-II is less clear, especially as only two mAbs were available that both inhibited the H/CD46 interaction strongly. Three residues were mapped as contact side for one of the mAbs. Remarkably, R69, which was the most critical residue for binding of both mAbs, is close to D70, which was critical for sH and MV binding. Moreover, R69, exactly as the epitopes of the strongly inhibiting CCP-I mAbs, maps to the front side of CCP-I-II (Fig. 4, fourth panel).In summary, the back top side of CCP-I contains the epitope of the low inhibiting mAb while the front side of CCP-I-II contains epitopes of the mAbs interfering strongly with the CD46·H complex formation. Moreover, on the CCP-I front side, we can distinguish between epitopes of moderately inhibiting mAbs in the top and strongly inhibiting mAbs in the lower half.An area covering the residues of epitopes belonging to strongly inhibiting mAbs and the putative H protein contact residues discussed before is delimited by a frame in the last top panel of Fig. 4. This area covers the lower half of the CCP-I and most of the CCP-II front side. It includes theN-glycosylation site at residue N80 (arrow in thelast top panel), which was previously shown to be important for the MV receptor function (27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Maisner A. Alvarez J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson D.J. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide chain linked to this residue may either form contacts or participate in maintaining a functional interface. Besides the oligosaccharide also, further amino acid residues in this area, which have not been included in the mutagenesis, may contact the H protein (F35, I37, A79, T82, Y87).Is there a continuous binding region or are there several binding sites within the putative H protein contact area? The latter possibility would require a cooperative binding mechanism based on two binding sites with moderate affinities that do not allow detection of H binding with the available assays when CCP-I or CCP-II are displayed individually on Ig domains (22Buchholz C.J. Schneider U. Devaux P. Gerlier D. Cattaneo R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3716-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Devaux P. Buchholz C.J. Schneider U. Escoffier C. Cattaneo R. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4157-4160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the cooperative mechanism will explain more easily how group 1 and 2 mAbs can interfere with the CD46·H complex formation while having their epitopes outside the putative H protein contact area. Based on the data presented, we assume that one binding site is on the CCP-I front side close to residues R25, D27, and K29 while the other binding site localizes on the CCP-II front side at residues R69 and D70. Both sites would be separated by a distance of about 30 Å. A moderately inhibiting group 2 mAb will then bind directly above the binding site on CCP-I and thereby link two monomeric CD46 molecules, possibly facing each other by their H protein attachment sites. This will alter or at least fix the tilt and twist angles of the CCP-I/II interface. Although attachment of H to the binding site on CCP-II is possible, cooperativity and thus accessibility to the CCP-I site will be reduced due to steric hindrance and loss of flexibility. In the case of the slightly inhibiting mAb I.1.a, steric hindrance is unlikely as here the two CD46 molecules will be linked together facing each other with the backsides of their H protein binding sites. However, this will interfere with cooperative binding as it reduces the flexibility between CCP-I and -II. In agreement with this hypothesis, increased binding efficiencies were observed for certain mAbs and more importantly also for MV and sH when we increased the flexibility between CCP-I and -II by substituting amino acids in the linker peptide (Y61A, R62A, E63A) and thereby destabilizing the putative salt bridges R62-E8 and E63-K110 (27Mumenthaler C. Schneider U. Buchholz C.J. Koller D. Braun W. Cattaneo R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Obviously, flexibility between CCP-I and -II, as well as their positioning to each other, is a critical parameter for H binding.Independently from the presence of a continuos binding region or several cooperating binding sites, the data presented here show that the topology of the MV attachment site on its receptor differs principally from that of HIV, poliovirus, or rhinovirus on their receptors. For the latter viruses, the attachment site is mainly located at the tip of the most membrane distal module. MV in contrast requires two membrane distal modules, of which the interface between the first and second module together with parts of the second module form the binding site while the tip of CCP-I is not required. Likewise, both other viral receptors from the RCA protein family also require more than one module for virus binding. For EBV, the two distal modules of CD21 and for echovirus modules II-IV of CD55 are required (15Clarkson N.A. Kaufman R. Lublin D.M. Ward T. Pipkin P.A. Minor P.D. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J.

Thus, attachment to two or more modules might be a principal scheme when viruses use members of the RCA family as their receptors. However, mapping of the echovirus and EBV binding sites is yet to be awaited. Although numerous viral receptors and coreceptors have been identified (1Wimmer E. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. CSHL Press, 1994: 1-13Google Scholar), virus binding sites have been defined on the three-dimensional structure of only three proteins, all belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) family: CD4 (HIV 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sH, soluble hemagglutinin; MV, measles virus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; CCP, complement control protein; F, fusion; H, hemagglutinin; RCA, regulators of complement activation; pfu, plaque forming unit; PVR, poliovirus receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sH, soluble hemagglutinin; MV, measles virus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; CCP, complement control protein; F, fusion; H, hemagglutinin; RCA, regulators of complement activation; pfu, plaque forming unit; PVR, poliovirus receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. receptor), poliovirus receptor (PVR), and ICAM-1 (rhinovirus receptor).

Their intracellular signals are propagated via respective type I receptors. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, induces ectopic bone formation when implanted into muscular tissues. Two type I receptors (BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB) have been identified for BMP-2. We have reported that BMP-2 inhibits the terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and converts their differentiation pathway into that of osteoblast lineage cells (Katagiri, T., Yamaguchi, A., Komaki, M., Abe, E., Takahashi, N., Ikeda, T., Rosen, V., Wozney, J. M., Fujisawa-Sehara, A. and Suda, T. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 127, 1755–1766). In the present study, we examined the involvement of functional BMP-2 type I receptors in signal transduction in C2C12 cells, which expressed mRNA for BMPR-IA, but not for BMPR-IB in Northern blotting. TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) mRNA was also expressed in C2C12 cells. Subclonal cell lines of C2C12 that stably expressed a kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IA (ΔBMPR-IA) differentiated into myosin heavy chain-expressing myotubes but not into alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive cells, even in the presence of BMP-2. In contrast, the differentiation of the ΔBMPR-IA-transfected C2C12 cells into myotubes was suppressed by TGF-β1, as in the parental C2C12 cells. BMP-2 did not efficiently suppress the mRNA expression of muscle-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase, MyoD, and myogenin, nor did it induce the expression of ALP mRNA in the ΔBMPR-IA-transfected C2C12 cells. In contrast, TGF-β1 inhibited mRNA expression of the muscle-specific genes in those cells. When wild-type BMPR-IA was transiently transfected into the ΔBMPR-IA-transfected C2C12 cells, a number of ALP-positive cells appeared in the presence of BMP-2. Transfection of wild-type BMPR-IB or TβR-I failed to increase the number of ALP-positive cells. These results suggest that the BMP-2-induced signals, which inhibit myogenic differentiation and induce osteoblast differentiation, are transduced via BMPR-IA in C2C12 myoblasts.

These are classified into two groups known as type I and type II receptors that are distinguishable by their amino acid sequences and functional features. Members of the TGF-β superfamily are associated with specific sets of the type I and type II receptors. Formation of a type I-type II receptor complex is required for ligand-induced signalings. Studies on the receptors for TGF-β have revealed the sequential mechanism of receptor activation (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). The TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) first binds to the ligand and then associates and phosphorylates TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I). TβR-I is phosphorylated by TβR-II at serine and threonine residues in the GS domain, which is located upstream of the kinase domain. This phosphorylated TβR-I propagates the ligand-induced signals by phosphorylating downstream substrates. The structure of the type I receptor is conserved in all type I receptors of the TGF-β superfamily, suggesting that the BMP signals are transduced by the BMP type I receptor like those of TGF-β.

BMP-7 can interact with activin type I and type II receptors in addition to BMP-2/BMP-4 receptors (26Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell.

We reported that BMP-2 not only stimulates the maturation of committed osteoblast progenitor cells but also induces the differentiation of pluripotent fibroblastic cells into osteoblastic cells (29Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 30Yamaguchi A.

Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 284: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular mechanism of ectopic bone formation induced by BMPs in muscular tissues, we established a model system using C2C12 myoblasts that reflects an early stage of osteoblast differentiation during bone formation in muscular tissues (33Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). In this model, BMP-2 not only inhibits the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes but also induces the expression of typical osteoblast phenotypes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, parathyroid hormone response, and osteocalcin production. TGF-β also inhibited terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells but did not induce any of the osteoblast phenotypes (33Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). These results suggested that some BMP-2-specific intracellular signalings are involved in the induction of osteoblast differentiation of myoblasts. However, the BMP-2 signaling pathway that regulates the myogenic and osteogenic differentiation of myoblasts is not clear.A kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IA abolished the ventralizing activity of BMP-4 in a dominant negative manner in the Xenopus embryo (23Suzuki A. Thies R.S. Yamaji N. Song J.J. Wozney J.M. Murakami K. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10255-10259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 34Maeno M. Ong R.C. Suzuki A. Ueno N.

Cell. 1994; 79: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether a dominant negative BMP type I receptor could inhibit the BMP-2-induced signalings in myoblasts. We report here that overexpression of the kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IA in C2C12 myoblasts blocks the BMP-2-induced inhibition of myogenic differentiation and induction of osteogenic differentiation. BMP-2 signaling was restored by transiently transfecting wild-type BMPR-IA into kinase domain-truncated mouse BMPR-IA (ΔBMPR-IA)-transfected C2C12 cells but not by transfecting BMPR-IB or TβR-I. These results suggest that the BMP-2-induced signals, namely, the inhibition of myogenic differentiation and the induction of osteoblast differentiation, are transduced via BMPR-IA in C2C12 myoblasts.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we examined the involvement of the functional type I receptor for BMP-2 in C2C12 myoblasts in the molecular mechanism of osteoblast differentiation induced by BMPs. We reported that BMP-2 inhibits the differentiation of C2C12 cells into multinucleated myotubes and converted their differentiation pathway into osteoblast lineage cells (33Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). This model appears to reflect an early stage of osteoblast differentiation from non-osteogenic cells during BMP-induced bone formation in muscular tissues.The intracellular signals of the TGF-β superfamily appear to be propagated via their own type I receptors. Two type I receptors, BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB, have been identified for BMP-2/BMP-4. C2C12 cells expressed BMPR-IA mRNA but not BMPR-IB mRNA as detectable levels by Northern blotting. BMPR-IB mRNA was barely detected by reverse transcription-PCR with excessive amplification. Moreover, reducing the mRNA expression of TGF-β type I receptor causes resistance to the growth suppression induced by TGF-β in mink lung epithelial cells (46Weis-Garcia F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This suggests that when the type I receptor is expressed at a low level, ligand-induced signals cannot be transduced. The present study suggests that the BMP-2 signals are mainly transduced via BMPR-IA but not via BMPR-IB in C2C12 cells because BMPR-IB was expressed at an extremely low level in those cells. To elucidate the involvement of BMPR-IA in the BMP-2 signaling in C2C12 cells, a kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IA was constructed and stably transfected into C2C12 cells. This truncated BMPR-IA acts as a dominant negative receptor for BMP-4 signaling in the Xenopus embryo (23Suzuki A. Thies R.S. Yamaji N. Song J.J. Wozney J.M. Murakami K. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10255-10259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 34Maeno M. Ong R.C. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Kung H.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 79: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). When the kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IA was overexpressed in C2C12 myoblasts, they differentiated into MHC-positive myotubes but not into osteoblast-like ALP-positive cells, even in the presence of BMP-2. In contrast, the differentiation into myotubes of the truncated BMPR-IA-transfected cells was inhibited by TGF-β1. Moreover, the impaired ALP-inducing activity of BMP-2 was rescued when the wild-type BMPR-IA was overexpressed in the cells expressing truncated BMPR-IA. These results suggest that BMPR-IA transduces two distinct signals specific for BMP-2 in C2C12 myoblasts, namely, the inhibition of myogenic differentiation and the induction of osteoblast differentiation.It is believed that the kinase domain-truncated type I receptor for the TGF-β superfamily inhibits the ligand-induced signals through competition during the formation of the complex of endogenous type I and type II receptors. C2C12 cells expressed BMPR-II mRNA. 2M. Namiki, S. Akiyama, T. Katagiri, A. Suzuki, N. Ueno, N. Yamaji, V. Rosen, J. M. Wozney, and T. Suda, unpublished observation. This suggests that the BMP-2 signals are transduced by the complex of BMPR-IA and BMPR-II in these cells. It was reported that both BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB formed complexes with BMPR-II or DAF-4, a type II receptor for a homologue of BMP-2/BMP-4 in C. elegans, in a ligand-dependent manner when overexpressed together on the surface of COS cells (21Koenig B.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22522-22526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast to the truncated BMPR-IA, the kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IB did not inhibit the BMP-2 signaling in C2C12 cells even if its mRNA was abundantly expressed. Moreover, the truncated BMPR-IB was not cross-linked with 125I-BMP-2. These results indicate that the truncated BMPR-IB does not bind BMP-2 with a high affinity in C2C12 cells. Interestingly, Nohno et al. (27Nohno T. Ishikawa T. Saito T. Hosokawa K. Noji S. Wolsing D.H. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22522-22526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) reported that a truncated BMPR-II (BRK-3) did not efficiently cross-link to 125I-BMP-4 when expressed alone in COS cells. However, coexpression of the truncated BMPR-II with the type I receptor enhanced the binding to 125I-BMP-4. Although we could not detect endogenous type I nor type II BMP receptors in ΔIB-12 and Vec-16 cells by cross-linking using125I-BMP-2, these endogenous receptors were detected in the truncated BMPR-IA-overexpressed cells (Fig. 4). Taking together, these results suggest that the endogenous receptors require sufficient amount of type I and type II receptors to bind ligands with a high affinity.In the present study, wild-type BMPR-IB failed to rescue the impaired ALP-inducing activity of BMP-2 in C2C12 cells transfected with truncated BMPR-IA. The reason for this is not clear, but there are at least two possible explanations. First, the downstream signaling pathways of BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB may be different, and C2C12 cells lack the pathway for BMPR-IB. To test this notion, we examined the effects of a constitutively active mutant BMPR-IB on the induction of ALP activity. Wieser et al. (47Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and Attisano et al.(48Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) reported that similar mutant receptors of TβR-I and activin type-IB constitutively activate their kinases and transduce the ligand-induced signals in the absence of the ligands and appropriate type II receptors. Transfection of constitutively active BMPR-IB into truncated BMPR-IA-expressing C2C12 cells induced ALP activity even in the absence of BMP-2. Moreover, the stable transfection of constitutively active BMPR-IB into C2C12 cells inhibited their differentiation into in the absence of BMP-2 (49Akiyama, S., Katagiri, T., Namiki, M., Yamaji, N., Yamamoto, N., Miyama, K., Shibuya, H., Ueno, N., Wozney, J. M., and Suda, T. (1997)Exp. Cell Res., in press.Google Scholar). These results clearly indicate that C2C12 cells have a functional downstream signaling pathway for BMPR-IB.Secondly, BMPR-IB may not be able to associate with BMPR-II (or other type II receptors that are associated with BMPR-IA), or BMPR-IB may not be activated by BMPR-II in C2C12 cells. Although C2C12 cells expressed BMPR-II mRNA, it is not clear whether BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB share the same BMPR-II that was expressed at the physiological level in C2C12 cells. If BMPR-IB associated with the same type II receptor for BMPR-IA in C2C12 cells, a kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IB should have inhibited the BMP-2-induced signals in these cells. The affinity binding assay followed by immunoprecipitation indicates that the wild-type BMPR-IB was expressed on the cell surface and bound BMP-2 in ΔBMPR-IA-expressing C2C12 cells (Fig. 7 a). Moreover, we recently found that the wild-type BMPR-IB-overexpressed C2C12 cells responded to another member of the BMP subfamily. 3N. Yamaji, Y-H. Gao, S. Akiyama, J. M. Wozney, and A. Yamaguchi, manuscript in preparation. These results suggest that the wild-type BMPR-IB can transduce BMP signaling when its appropriate ligand is present. Interestingly, Liu et al.(26Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) reported that BMPR-IB·BMPR-II complex could bind BMP-2 and BMP-7 although BMP-2 could not activate the transcription of reporter genes in COS cells. These results suggest that BMPR-IB is associated with a different type II receptor from that for BMPR-IA. Further studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.At present, a mediator of the osteoblast differentiation-inducing signals of BMP-2 that acts at a downstream site of BMP type I receptor has not been elucidated. Genetic studies in Drosophila have identified Mothers against dpp (Mad), a gene that acts downstream of the signals of DPP, aDrosophila homologue of mammalian BMP-2/BMP-4 (50Raftery L.A. Twombly V. Wharton K. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 241-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M.

The Mad-related protein was expressed in the cytoplasm and accumulated into the nucleus by the BMP-2/BMP-4 signals that were transduced by BMPR-IA or BMPR-IB (53Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J.

These results suggest that Mad and/or its related proteins also mediate the osteoblast differentiation-inducing signals of BMP-2 via the activated type I receptor in some cells, including C2C12 myoblasts. Further studies are necessary to confirm this notion.In conclusion, both BMP-2-induced signals, namely, the inhibition of myogenic differentiation and the induction of osteoblast differentiation, are transduced via BMPR-IA in C2C12 myoblasts. The downstream signaling pathway of BMPR-IA is involved in the ectopic bone formation induced by BMP-2 in muscular tissues. This in vitro model of C2C12 myoblasts is a useful system with which to investigate the molecular mechanism of not only osteoblast differentiation, but also of the BMP-2 signaling pathways. Demineralized bone matrix can induce ectopic bone formation when implanted into muscular tissues (1Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar).

Since the structure of the carrier is likely to influence the interaction of NO with macromolecular targets, we assessed the interaction of a dinitrosyl-iron-dithiolate complex carrying different thiol ligands with glutathione reductase. The enzyme was irreversibly inhibited by dinitrosyl-iron-di-l-cysteine and dinitrosyl-iron-di-glutathione in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (IC50 30 and 3 μm, respectively). Evaluation of the inhibition kinetics according to Kitz-Wilson yielded a Ki of 14 μm, and ak3 of 1.3 × 10−3s−1. A participation of catalytic site thiols in the inhibitory mechanism was indicated by the findings that only the NADPH-reduced enzyme was inhibited by dinitrosyl-iron complex and that blockade of these thiols by Hg2+ afforded protection against irreversible inhibition. This inhibition was not accompanied by formation of a protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron complex and/orS-nitrosation of active site thiols (Cys-58 and Cys-63). However, one NO moiety exhibiting an acid lability similar to a secondary N-nitrosamine was present per mol of inhibited monomeric enzyme.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) may influence protein function by allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, reversible S-nitrosation of cell membrane-bound proteins may be involved in transmembraneous NO transport (11McDonald B. Reep B. Lapetina E.G. Molina y Vedia L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11122-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).A concept has been derived from established chemistry to account for the influence of the redox state of the NO moiety on biological NO transfer reactions. According to this concept nitrosation of nucleophilic targets occurs by attack of nitrosonium (NO+)-like species assumed to be present in “NO carriers” such as N2O3,S-nitrosothiols, and certain iron-nitrosyl complexes (3Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar,12Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). Less attention has been paid to the influence of the carrier structure on the interaction of NO with macromolecular targets. However, it is conceivable that the NO carrier will direct the NO moiety specifically to macromolecules recognizing the carrier structure, provided the NO adduct is sufficiently stable and the binding kinetics between the carrier and the macromolecules are rapid enough to outbalance the decomposition of the NO carrier adduct. There is also evidence that NO adducts may exhibit intrinsic bioactivity independent of NO release. Thus, the l-stereoisomer ofS-nitrosocysteine was found to exhibit a significantly higher blood pressure lowering activity compared with thed-isomer, suggesting the existence of stereospecificS-nitroso-l-cysteine receptors in the cardiovascular system (13Travis, M. D. & Lewis, S. J. (1997) Am. J.

These complexes exhibit S-nitrosating activity toward serum albumin in vitro (2Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and protein-bound forms exist in vivo in animal tissues expressing inducible NO synthase activity (14Chamulitrat W. Jordan S.J. Mason R.P. Litton A.L. Wilson J.G. Wood E.R. Wolberg G. Molina y Vedia L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The flavoenzyme GR catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to maintain a high intracellular level of GSH. GR carries a redox-active disulfide (Cys-58–Cys-63) in its active site which is reduced by electron transfer from NADPH via the flavin (15Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that GR is inhibited by certain NO carriers (S-nitrosoglutathione, sodium nitroprusside,S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine) in millimolar concentrations (16Becker K. Gui M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that GR is a potential target for nitrosation reactions.We show here that low mass dinitrosyl-iron complexes in concentrations that may be present under pathophysiological conditions irreversibly inhibit GR, possibly via N-nitrosation. We furthermore demonstrate that the inhibitory potency of the dinitrosyl-iron moiety increases with structural resemblance of the NO carrier to the natural GR substrate, GSSG.DISCUSSIONOne objective of the present study was to demonstrate that the structure of NO-carrier complexes influences the interaction of NO with macromolecular targets. Since GR was previously shown to be inhibited by S-nitrosothiols (16Becker K. Gui M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we chose this enzyme as a model target to study its interaction with another class of biological NO carriers, DNIC. Two different types of DNIC were used withl-cysteine and GSH as thiol ligands, and the inhibitory reaction of GR with these compounds was studied in detail to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of GR by NO carriers.Inhibition of GR by DNICBoth types of DNIC readily accomplished inhibition of GR in the presence of NADPH. The potency of the inhibitors depended on the nature of the thiol ligand, DNIC-GSH being a more potent inhibitor (IC50 = 3 μm) than DNIC-l-cysteine (IC50 = 30 μm). In comparison, the IC50 of other NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside, S-nitrosoglutathione, orS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine are at least 100-fold higher (16Becker K. Gui M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and also the nitrosourea diethyl [1-[3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosoureido]ethyl]phosphonate (Fotemustine) exhibits an IC50 of 1.5 mm (28Schallreuter K.U. Gleason F.K. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, DNIC are the most potent inhibitors of GR reported to date. Assuming that these complexes attack the catalytic center of GR, the higher inhibitory potency of DNIC-GSH compared with DNIC-l-cysteine may be explained by its similarity to the natural substrate GSSG (see Structure Fs1), which favors the interaction of DNIC-GSH with the active center of the enzyme. Since inhibition of the enzyme was not reversible by dilution (1000-fold) and progressed exponentially with time, inhibition kinetics could be evaluated according to Kitz and Wilson (22Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent rate constants of inhibition correlated with the concentration of DNIC-GSH applied. A dissociation constant of the reversible complexKi of 14 μm and a rate constant of the conversion of the reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex to the irreversibly inhibited enzyme k3 of 1.3 × 10−3 sec−1 were derived from the Kitz-Wilson replot. Thus DNIC-GSH was bound with high affinity in a rapid equilibrium preceding the irreversible inhibitory reaction.Chemical Characterization of DNIC-inactivated GRThe irreversible inhibition of GR suggests a covalent modification of the enzyme by DNIC. A likely target site is the catalytic center of GR, which carries a redox-active disulfide (Cys-58–Cys-63). The requirement for reduced thiols at the catalytic site was evidenced by the finding that DNIC led to inhibition of GR only in the presence of the coenzyme NADPH, and that GR pretreated with Hg2+ was protected against inhibition by DNIC. Other agents which inhibit GR by carbamoylation (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) or alkylation (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-nitrosourea) of Cys-58 also influence the enzyme activity only after two-electron reduction of the enzyme by NADPH (28Schallreuter K.U. Gleason F.K. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Jochers-Scherübl M.C. Schirmer R.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore inhibition of GR by DNIC could involve a stable attachment of the dinitrosyl-iron moiety to one or both cysteines via a ligand exchange reaction (30Vanin A.F. Kiladze S.V. Kubrina L.N. Biofizika. 1975; 20: 1068-1073PubMed Google Scholar) or aS-nitrosation of one or both cysteines, as has been shown for the interaction of DNIC with serum albumin (2Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Low molecular weight DNIC did not react with GR to form a protein-bound DNIC, as assessed by EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). This finding excludes that GR is inhibited by a linkage of the dinitrosyl-iron group to the active site cysteine residues. We next assessed the formation of aS-nitroso group in DNIC-inhibited GR by the Saville reaction. No S-nitrosation was detectable, although 1 mol of the DNIC-inhibited enzyme contained about 0.8 mol/subunit Griess-positive NOx released from the enzyme by 0.25m HCl, but not by 0.1 m HCl. Similar acid lability of the NO moiety was observed withN-nitrosopyrrolidine, a nitrosamine of a cyclic secondary amine, whereas the C-nitroso bond of 1-nitroso-2-hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonic acid was acid-resistant. This result indicates that DNIC-inhibited GR bears aN-nitroso moiety.A similar conclusion was derived from the comparison of the guanylyl cyclase-stimulating activity of DNIC-inhibited GR, S-nitrosoalbumin, N-nitrosopyrrolidine, and 1-nitroso-2-hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonic acid. OnlyS-nitrosoalbumin was able to enhance guanylyl cyclase activity.Since in vitro a nitrosation of cyclic secondary amines byS-nitrosothiols has been described (31Oae S. Kim Y.H. Fukushima D. Takata T. Chem. Lett. 1977; 893: 65-69Google Scholar), and a histidine residue (His-467) located in the vicinity of Cys-58 participates in the catalytic reduction of GSSG, we considered N-nitrosation of this residue as a likely mechanism of GR inhibition by DNIC. In fact, GR activity was also lost after N-carboxylation of histidine residues by DEPC. This finding implies that blocking of an imidazole nitrogen could account for inhibition of GR activity by DNIC.Our results are consistent with the following hypothetical mechanism of GR inhibition by DNIC (Fig. 6). In a rapid pre-equilibrium DNIC interacts reversibly with active site thiols. DNIC then S-nitrosates Cys-58, which is characterized by a higher electronegativity than Cys-63 (32Karplus P.A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Schirmer R.H. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and is located at the entrance of the active site. This reaction is immediately followed by an intramolecular trans-nitrosation yielding aN-nitrosamine, presumably at the imidazole nitrogen of His-467. In this context it should be noted that the covalent modification achieved by bichloroethylnitrosourea is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbamoyl oxygen and the His-467 (29Jochers-Scherübl M.C. Schirmer R.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This implies that a trans-nitrosation between Cys-58 and His-467 should be sterically feasible. However, the involvement of His-467 in the inhibitory mechanism and its N-nitrosation by DNIC has to be proven by x-ray diffraction analysis. Since minor species differences in the protein structure of GR have a great influence on GR's susceptibility to different kinds of inhibitors, the scheme proposed here may be valid only for GR from bovine intestinal mucosa.Figure 6Scheme of the putative mechanism of GR inhibition by DNIC-GSH. The reduced form of GR (1) bearing the charge-transfer complex between the flavin and Cys-63 reacts with a nitrosyl moiety of DNIC (2) to form an intermediate S-nitrosothiol at Cys-58. Trans-nitrosation from Cys-58 to an imidazole nitrogen of His-467 (3) yields a stable N-nitroso bond at His-467 (4) and accounts for irreversible inhibition of GR (35Schirmer R.H. Müller J.G. Krauth-Siegel L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 141-154Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conclusion, we have shown that low mass DNIC irreversibly inactivate GR and exhibit a much higher inhibitory potency than other known inhibitors of GR. From our study two biochemical principles might emerge. First, N-nitrosation is a novel mechanism by which proteins may be post-translationally modified and which broadens the spectrum of NO-mediated signal transduction. Adjacent cysteine and histidine residues would be expected to be susceptible to this modification. As a consequence of its size and charge distribution, DNIC should nitrosate proteins more selectively than NO2/N2O3, as accessibility to DNIC is determined by protein three-dimensional structure in the immediate vicinity of the target thiol. Second, we have shown that the thiol ligand structure influences the interaction of DNIC with macromolecular targets. A similar effect of the NO carrier structure on the interaction of NO with proteins has been reported. For instance, human glutathione peroxidase specifically liberates NO fromS-nitrosoglutathione, but not fromS-nitroso-l-cysteine (33Freedman J.E. Frei B. Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or dinitrosyl-iron complex. 2M. Boese, M. A. Keese, K. Becker, R. Busse, and A. Mülsch, unpublished results. Furthermore,S-nitrosoglutathione exhibits specific toxicity againstS. typhimurium, because the peptide is taken up into the microorganism by a specific transporter system (34DeGroote M.A. Granger D.

Evidence has been provided that endogenous low mass S-nitrosothiols (predominantlyS-nitrosoglutathione) and proteinaceousS-nitrosothiols (S-nitroso-hemoglobin,S-nitroso-serum albumin, and other yet unidentified proteins) exist in human erythrocytes (4Jia L.

A further NO adduct with GSH, GSNOH, was recently postulated as another transport form of NO (7Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11494-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) may influence protein function by allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, reversible S-nitrosation of cell membrane-bound proteins may be involved in transmembraneous NO transport (11McDonald B. Reep B. Lapetina E.G. Molina y Vedia L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11122-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A concept has been derived from established chemistry to account for the influence of the redox state of the NO moiety on biological NO transfer reactions. According to this concept nitrosation of nucleophilic targets occurs by attack of nitrosonium (NO+)-like species assumed to be present in “NO carriers” such as N2O3,S-nitrosothiols, and certain iron-nitrosyl complexes (3Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar,12Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). Less attention has been paid to the influence of the carrier structure on the interaction of NO with macromolecular targets. However, it is conceivable that the NO carrier will direct the NO moiety specifically to macromolecules recognizing the carrier structure, provided the NO adduct is sufficiently stable and the binding kinetics between the carrier and the macromolecules are rapid enough to outbalance the decomposition of the NO carrier adduct. There is also evidence that NO adducts may exhibit intrinsic bioactivity independent of NO release. Thus, the l-stereoisomer ofS-nitrosocysteine was found to exhibit a significantly higher blood pressure lowering activity compared with thed-isomer, suggesting the existence of stereospecificS-nitroso-l-cysteine receptors in the cardiovascular system (13Travis, M. D. & Lewis, S. J. (1997) Am. J. Physiol. in press.Google Scholar). To assess the influence of the carrier structure on the interaction of NO with a given macromolecule we chose glutathione reductase (GR; EC1.6.4.2) as a model target, and low mass dinitrosyl-iron complexes withl-cysteine and glutathione ligands as NO carriers. These complexes exhibit S-nitrosating activity toward serum albumin in vitro (2Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and protein-bound forms exist in vivo in animal tissues expressing inducible NO synthase activity (14Chamulitrat W.

The flavoenzyme GR catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to maintain a high intracellular level of GSH. GR carries a redox-active disulfide (Cys-58–Cys-63) in its active site which is reduced by electron transfer from NADPH via the flavin (15Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that GR is inhibited by certain NO carriers (S-nitrosoglutathione, sodium nitroprusside,S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine) in millimolar concentrations (16Becker K. Gui M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that GR is a potential target for nitrosation reactions. We show here that low mass dinitrosyl-iron complexes in concentrations that may be present under pathophysiological conditions irreversibly inhibit GR, possibly via N-nitrosation. We furthermore demonstrate that the inhibitory potency of the dinitrosyl-iron moiety increases with structural resemblance of the NO carrier to the natural GR substrate, GSSG. DISCUSSIONOne objective of the present study was to demonstrate that the structure of NO-carrier complexes influences the interaction of NO with macromolecular targets. Since GR was previously shown to be inhibited by S-nitrosothiols (16Becker K. Gui M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we chose this enzyme as a model target to study its interaction with another class of biological NO carriers, DNIC. Two different types of DNIC were used withl-cysteine and GSH as thiol ligands, and the inhibitory reaction of GR with these compounds was studied in detail to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of GR by NO carriers.Inhibition of GR by DNICBoth types of DNIC readily accomplished inhibition of GR in the presence of NADPH. The potency of the inhibitors depended on the nature of the thiol ligand, DNIC-GSH being a more potent inhibitor (IC50 = 3 μm) than DNIC-l-cysteine (IC50 = 30 μm). In comparison, the IC50 of other NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside, S-nitrosoglutathione, orS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine are at least 100-fold higher (16Becker K. Gui M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and also the nitrosourea diethyl [1-[3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosoureido]ethyl]phosphonate (Fotemustine) exhibits an IC50 of 1.5 mm (28Schallreuter K.U. Gleason F.K. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, DNIC are the most potent inhibitors of GR reported to date. Assuming that these complexes attack the catalytic center of GR, the higher inhibitory potency of DNIC-GSH compared with DNIC-l-cysteine may be explained by its similarity to the natural substrate GSSG (see Structure Fs1), which favors the interaction of DNIC-GSH with the active center of the enzyme.

A dissociation constant of the reversible complexKi of 14 μm and a rate constant of the conversion of the reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex to the irreversibly inhibited enzyme k3 of 1.3 × 10−3 sec−1 were derived from the Kitz-Wilson replot. Thus DNIC-GSH was bound with high affinity in a rapid equilibrium preceding the irreversible inhibitory reaction.Chemical Characterization of DNIC-inactivated GRThe irreversible inhibition of GR suggests a covalent modification of the enzyme by DNIC. A likely target site is the catalytic center of GR, which carries a redox-active disulfide (Cys-58–Cys-63). The requirement for reduced thiols at the catalytic site was evidenced by the finding that DNIC led to inhibition of GR only in the presence of the coenzyme NADPH, and that GR pretreated with Hg2+ was protected against inhibition by DNIC. Other agents which inhibit GR by carbamoylation (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) or alkylation (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-nitrosourea) of Cys-58 also influence the enzyme activity only after two-electron reduction of the enzyme by NADPH (28Schallreuter K.U.

Therefore inhibition of GR by DNIC could involve a stable attachment of the dinitrosyl-iron moiety to one or both cysteines via a ligand exchange reaction (30Vanin A.F. Kiladze S.V. Kubrina L.N. Biofizika. 1975; 20: 1068-1073PubMed Google Scholar) or aS-nitrosation of one or both cysteines, as has been shown for the interaction of DNIC with serum albumin (2Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I.

Academic Press, Inc., New York1951: 131-182Google Scholar). Leishmania tarentolae was found to contain free porphyrins but required intact iron-protoporphyrin for growth in culture, suggesting that it may lack ferrochelatase, the enzyme required to incorporate iron into protoporphyrin (5Gaughan P.L.Z. Klassner S.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1971; 39B: 5-18Google Scholar). Trypanosome cruziwas shown to require hemin/hemoglobin for growth. It was reported to manifest ALA dehydrase activity, but porphobilinogen deaminase was absent. However, functional ferrochelatase could be detected, leading to the conclusion that the parasite has lost part of its heme pathway due to mutations in some of the enzyme sequences, necessitating preformed hemin requirement (6Salzman T.A. Stella A.M. Wider De XiFra E.A. Del C. Battle A.M. Docampo R. Stoppani A.O.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 72B: 663-667Google Scholar). The malarial parasite contains cytochromes (7Fry M.

O. 1987; 65: 381-386PubMed Google Scholar), and studies in this laboratory have demonstrated a requirement for heme to sustain optimal protein synthesis (9Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). De novo synthesis of heme is vital to the malarial parasite, since treatment of the culture with succinylacetone, a specific inhibitor of ALA dehydrase, leads to death of the parasite. It has, therefore, been concluded that the parasite utilizes the heme synthesized de novo for metabolic purposes, whereas it stores the surplus heme, which is toxic, derived from hemoglobin degradation as inert hemozoin pigment (1Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In view of these results and the possibility that the heme biosynthetic pathway of the malarial parasite could be a new drug target, studies have been carried out on the possible origin of the enzymes of the pathway. The results indicate the interesting feature that the parasite genome may not code for all the enzymes of the pathway. While the parasite makes ALA synthase, the first enzyme of the pathway, it imports ALA dehydrase and perhaps most of the other enzymes of the pathway from the host red cell to acquire the heme biosynthetic potential. Antibodies raised against purified CPO and FC preparations from the human red blood cells in rabbits (10Taketani S. Kohno H. Okuda M. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Antibodies to human red cell ALAS and full-length mouse erythroid ALAD clone were kind gifts from Dr.Gloria C. Ferreira, University of South Florida and Dr. Terry Bishop, Johns Hopkins University, respectively. [2-14C]Glycine and 4-14C-labeled δ-aminolevulinic acid were obtained from BRIT (Bombay) and NEN Life Science, respectively. Swiss mice were injected with P. berghei, and blood was removed at different stages of parasitemia ranging from 30 to 80%. The parasitized red cells as well as the red cells from uninfected mice (control) were spun down and put into overnight culture as described for P. falciparum(11Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). In some experiments, P. falciparum maintained on O+ human red blood cells in culture (about 8% parasitemia) as described earlier (1Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar) was also used. After appropriate treatment of culture, the cells were isolated and lysed with 0.15% (w/v) saponin (12Fitch C.D. Chevli R. Banyal H.S. Phillips G. Pfaller M.A. Krogstad D.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 819-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parasite pellet as well as the infected red cell supernatant (IRS) were obtained by centrifugation. The red cells from uninfected mice were processed similarly to isolate the uninfected red cell supernatant (URS) and the membrane pellet. Mice were injected with P. berghei and blood was removed at different stages of parasitemia ranging from 30 to 80%. The parasitized as well as control red blood cells were spun down and put into overnight culture (8 h), during which time they were incubated with [4-14C]ALA (1 μCi) or [2-14C]Glycine (12.5 μCi). The red cells were pelleted, and the parasite pellet, IRS, and URS were isolated after lysis. The fractions were extracted with ethyl acetate/acetic acid (3:1). The extract was washed with water and then 1.5 n HCl to remove the precursor used and all the porphyrins. The final ethyl acetate layer was washed twice with water to remove acid and used to measure radioactivity incorporated into heme (13Levin W. Jacobsen E. Sernatinger E. Kuntzman R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1983; 1: 267-274Google Scholar). Separate analysis of the ethyl acetate layer by chromatography has revealed that the radioactivity is entirely accounted for by heme (14Bhat G.J. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The first water wash and the 1.5 n HCl-extracted fractions were used to analyze for radioactivity in ALA plus porphobilinogen (PBG) and coproporphyrin plus protoporphyrin, respectively (13Levin W. Jacobsen E. Sernatinger E. Kuntzman R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1983; 1: 267-274Google Scholar). ALA and porphobilinogen were separated by fractionation on a Dowex-1 (acetate) column (15Gardner L.C. Smith S.J. Cox T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22010-22018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ALAS, ALAD, and FC activities were assayed in isolated fractions of the parasite, IRS, and URS. The parasite pellet was lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 by repeated homogenization, and the membrane fraction was pelleted at 8000 × g (15 min). This fraction was used to assay ALAS and FC, since the activities were located in this fraction. The assay mixture for ALAS contained the following (16Burnham W.F. Irwing E.A. Elliott W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 195-204Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar): Tris, pH 7.5 (50 mm), glycine (100 mm), sodium succinate (10 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), coenzyme A (500 μm), ATP (5 mm), pyridoxal phosphate (200 μm), partially purified Escherichia colisuccinyl-CoA synthase (20 μg), and the membrane protein (100 μg). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The product was converted to porphobilinogen by the addition of purified ALAD, and porphobilinogen formed was estimated using modified Ehrlich reagent (17Mauzerall D. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 435-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FC was also assayed in the membrane fraction (18Dailey Jr., H.A. Lascelles J. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 815-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the assay mixture contained Tris, pH 7.5 (20 mm), protoporphyrin 1 X (100 μm), β-mercaptoethanol (1 mm), 59FeCl3 (2.5 μCi), and membrane protein (50 μg). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Radioactive heme formed was then extracted and radioactivity measured. ALAD was assayed in the soluble fractions after passing the same through a DEAE-Sepharose column to remove hemoglobin. The enzyme activity was located in the 0.2m NaCl eluate, and the assay mixture contained Tris, pH 7.5 (20 mm), ALA (50 μm), ZnCl2 (10 μm), β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm), and enzyme fraction (20 μg of protein). The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The porphobilinogen formed was estimated using modified Ehrlich reagent (17Mauzerall D. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 435-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ALAD was purified from the parasite pellet and mouse and human red blood cells by a slight modification of the known procedure (19Anderson P.M. Desnik R.J. J. Biol Chem. 1979; 254: 6924-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parasite and red cell lysates were spun at 8000 ×g for 15 min, and the soluble fractions were subjected to the following steps: DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation (0–45%), and octyl-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. The last two column steps were repeated with the preparation obtained to get the pure protein. The preparation from human red blood cells was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The purified ALAD preparations (75 ng) from the parasite and mouse red blood cells were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. Similarly, membrane fractions (8000 × gpellet, 100 μg of protein) from the parasite, IRS, and URS were used for Western analysis of ALAS, CPO, and FC. The crude soluble fraction (75 μg of protein) was also used for analysis of ALAD. The blots were screened with antibodies to the human enzyme preparations, diluted in the range 1:200 to 1:1000. The blots were finally analyzed with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Purified ALAD from the parasite (P. berghei) was subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis using a Shimadzu gas phase protein sequencer (PSQ1). Immunogold electron microscopy was carried out (20Shahabuddin M. Gunther K. Lingelbach K. Aikawa M. Schreiber M. Ridley R.G. Scaife J.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the isolated parasite (P. berghei), as well as with the infected and uninfected red cells. These were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and embedded in LR Gold resin. Sections (60–70 nm) were cut and picked on copper grids. In experiments where purified ALAD was incubated with parasite membrane to demonstrate binding, the membrane preparation was first sonicated briefly to get a homogenous preparation. After incubation with ALAD and washing, the membrane pellet was diluted severalfold and used directly for coating copper grids by incubating at room temperature for 1 h. All of the grids were washed with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 2 h with ALAD antibodies (1:1000 diluton), washed again, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to gold particles (10 nm in diameter) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The grids were stained with 2% osmium tetroxide and examined under the electron microscope. Succinylacetone is known to be an irreversible inhibitor of ALAD activity (21Tschudy D.P. Hess R.A. Frykholm B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9915-9923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh human RBCs (in complete medium) were incubated with succinylacetone (500 μm in final concentration) overnight at 4 °C. These as well as RBCs not treated with succinylacetone (control) were washed thoroughly with culture medium and then incubated with PBS containing 2 mm ALA for 2 h at 37 °C to remove any free succinylacetone by converting it nonenzymatically to a pyrrole (22Ebert P.S. Hess R.A. Frykholm B.C. Tschudy D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A 3-day-old culture (1.5 ml) of P. falciparum was subcultured in two vials, one receiving succinylacetone-treated RBCs and the other control RBCs. After another 4 days, a second subculturing was done with the respective RBCs. After another 48 h, the cultures were incubated with 1 μCi of [4-14C]ALA overnight as described earlier. Radioactivity incorporation into heme was measured in the parasite and red cell supernatant fractions. In another experiment, several vials were pooled after second subculturing, and ALAD activity was assayed in the parasite and red cell supernatant fractions. To ensure that the succinylacetone-treated RBCs used in culturing did not have any carryover of free succinylacetone to inhibit ALAD activity, untreated and succinylacetone-treated RBCs were lysed, and the enzyme activity was assayed in each of the fractions as well as when they were mixed. The parasites were isolated from infected mouse red blood cells by saponin lysis as described earlier. The parasites were then lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was spun down at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was washed with PBS. The membrane pellet was suspended in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and an aliquot (200 μg of protein) was incubated with partially purified ALAD from mouse RBCs at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. A similar incubation was carried out with mouse red cell membrane and trypsin-treated, washed parasite membrane. Another control employed was the incubation of bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase and glutathioneS-transferase-retinoic acid X receptor fusion proteins with the parasite membrane under similar conditions. After the incubations, the membrane fractions were reisolated by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with PBS, and the pellet was then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gels) followed by Western analysis with anti-ALAD and anti-fusion protein antibodies. In addition, the membrane fraction was also examined through immunoelectron micrography as described earlier. Full-length mouse erythroid ALAD-cDNA was cloned and expressed with histidine tag in the T7 polymerase promoter based vector, pRSETB. The transformed E. coli cells were grown in 5 ml of LB medium (inoculated from an overnight culture) and after 2 h of growth (OD 0.6), 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 200 μCi of [35S]methionine were added. After another 2½ h of incubation, labeled ALAD was isolated from E. coli cells and purified on a nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column, using a single-step affinity procedure. The parasite membrane (2.4 mg of protein) was solubilized using 2.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium cholate, and 0.5 m NaCl for suspension followed by sonication. The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and the solubilized membrane was loaded onto nitrocellulose membrane filters. These filters were then blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder in TTBS (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-buffered saline) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated with increasing amounts of labeled ALAD for 1 h in the presence and absence of a 100-fold excess of nonradioactive ALAD. The nitrocellulose membrane filters were washed thrice with TTBS and dried, and radioactivity was measured. The data were used to generate the saturation curve and the Scatchard plot to calculate the dissociation constant and the number of binding sites. In the case of P. berghei, blood from infected and uninfected mice was spun down, and the cells were incubated with [2-14C]glycine or [4-14C]ALA for 8 h in culture. In the case of P. falciparum, the parasite maintained in culture was incubated with the radiolabeled precursors overnight. The cells were then pelleted down, washed, and lysed with saponin, and the parasite pellet, IRS, and URS were used for measurement of radioactivity in the heme fraction. The results presented in Fig. 1 (A andB) indicate that similar results are obtained with P. berghei and P. falciparum. The parasite-infected red cell synthesizes 5–8-fold more heme than the uninfected red cell. Certain interesting features of the incorporation pattern of the precursors into heme are also evident. With [4-14C]ALA as precursor, 80% of the radioactive heme is recovered in IRS, whereas with [2-14C]glycine as precursor, the bulk of the radioactive heme is recovered in the parasite pellet. Next, it was of interest to examine the heme biosynthetic potential of the isolated fractions. These experiments were carried out withP. berghei, since high yields of the parasite could be obtained from infected mice. The IRS, URS, and the parasite pellet were individually incubated with [4-14C]ALA, and the incorporation of radioactivity into heme and intermediates of the pathway was measured. The results presented in Table I indicate certain interesting features. First, maximum heme synthesis is again seen in IRS that is ∼ 4–5-fold more than URS or parasite pellet. The parasite pellet has a substantial amount of [4-14C]ALA remaining unutilized compared with URS or IRS. This correlates with the low levels of ALAD detected in P. berghei (this study) as well as in P. falciparum (1Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the parasite converts the porphyrin intermediates to heme efficiently and is more effective than the URS. This suggests that FC, catalyzing iron incorporation into protoporphyrin, could be present at significant levels in the parasite.Table ISynthesis of heme by isolated fractions from infected (P. berghei) and uninfected red cells in vitroMetabolitesRadioactivity incorporatedPIRSURScpm/4 × 10 8 cellsALA (unutilized)499,95055,00062,000PBG141,40037,00024,000CPP plus PRP1-aCoproporphyrin plus protoporphyrin.250,000177,000790,000Heme193,000755,000125,000Infected or uninfected blood was spun down, pelleted red cells were lysed, and the washed parasite pellet (P), IRS, and URS were incubated with 1 μCi of [4-14C]ALA for 8 h.

The results presented are those obtained in a typical experiment. The next step was to assay the activities of ALAS, ALAD, and FC in P. berghei and mouse IRS and URS fractions. ALAS and FC activities were detected in the 8000 × g pellet in each case, whereas ALAD activity was detected in the soluble fractions. The results presented in Table II indicate that ALAS activity in the parasite is 3–4-fold more than in IRS or URS. FC activity in the parasite is as high as that in IRS and is 9–10-fold more than in URS. ALAD activity in the parasite is ∼20-fold lower than IRS and 4–5-fold lower than in URS. From the results presented, it is also clear that, whereas the activity of ALAS is the same in infected and uninfected RBC preparations, the activities of ALAD and FC are at least 5-fold greater in IRS than in URS.Table IIALAS, ALAD, and FC activities in isolated fractions from infected (P. berghei) and uninfected red cellsEnzyme activityALAS2-aValues for ALAS are in μmol of PBG equivalent/mg of protein.ALAD2-bValues for ALAD are in μmol of PBG/mg of protein.FC2-cValues for FC are cpm in heme/mg of protein.Parasite0.130 ± 0.0080.074 ± 0.0061.17 ± (0.09 × 107)IRS0.040 ± 0.0123.879 ± 1.0238.89 ± (0.81 × 106)URS0.039 ± 0.0080.442 ± 0.0581.16 ± (0.06 × 106)The parasite pellet, IRS, and URS fractions were isolated as described earlier.

ALAD was purified to homogeneity from P. berghei (Fig. 2), mouse and human red blood cells. The human enzyme preparation was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The parasite and mouse red cell (uninfected) enzymes appear identical on the basis of several criteria. Both of the purified preparations show a Km of about 1.5 × 10−4m for ALA. They exhibit a broad pH optimum with a peak at about 7.2. Both preparations show a requirement for zinc. Succinylacetone at a concentration of 50 μmbrings about 50% inhibition of the activities of both of the enzyme preparations. Both enzyme species have identical subunit molecular mass (∼37 kDa) on SDS-PAGE and cross-react equally well with antibodies to the human enzyme (Fig. 3 A). The N-terminal 20-amino acid sequence of both of the preparations is identical (Fig. 3 B). In view of the fact that ALAD preparation from humans and mice differ by as many as 3 amino acids and are totally different between mice and yeast in this stretch (23Boese Q.F. Spano A.J. Li J. Timko M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17060-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has to be concluded that the P. berghei and mouse red cell (uninfected) ALAD activities are due to the same protein species.Figure 3Western blot analysis and N-terminal sequence of purified ALAD from P. berghei and uninfected mouse RBC.

B, sequence of 20 amino acids at the N terminus of purified ALAD from P. berghei and mouse RBC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further prove that the parasite ALAD is of host red cell origin, attempts were made to demonstrate that when the host red cell ALAD is inhibited irreversibly by succinylacetone, the parasite (P. falciparum) cultured with such RBCs also acquires the inhibited enzyme. First, it was found that while the parasite cultured in control RBCs had a detectable ALAD activity, the activity was too low to be detected in parasites derived from succinylacetone-treated RBCs. This was further substantiated by measuring [4-14C]ALA incorporation into heme in the parasite and IRS fractions. The results presented in Table III indicate that incorporation of [4-14C]ALA into heme in the parasite and IRS fractions derived from succinylacetone-treated RBCs is around 10% of the corresponding fractions derived from control RBCs. ALAD activity assays from control, succinylacetone-treated, and mixed RBC lysates indicate that there is no free succinylacetone left to inhibit the enzyme activity or heme synthesis in the parasite (Table IV). It has also been noted that the parasitemia tends to fall when the parasite is cultured in succinylacetone treated RBCs, and there is a striking inhibition of parasite growth after three"
https://openalex.org/W2087787674,"Borna disease virus (BDV) is a newly classified nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus (order of Mononegavirales) that persistently infects specific brain regions and circuits of warm-blooded animals to cause behavioral disturbances. Viruses within the order of Mononegavirales have phosphoproteins that typically serve as transcription factors and are modulated in functional activity through phosphorylation. To identify the kinases involved in BDV phosphoprotein (BDV-P) phosphorylation, in vitrophosphorylation assays were performed using recombinant phosphoprotein produced in Escherichia coli as substrate and cytoplasmic extracts from a rat glioma cell line (C6) or rat brain extracts as sources of kinase activity. These experiments revealed that BDV-P was phosphorylated predominantly by protein kinase C (PKC) and to a lesser extent by casein kinase II. Partial purification of the PKC from rat brain extract suggested that the BDV-P phosphorylating kinase is PKCε. A role for PKC phosphorylation in vivo was confirmed by using the PKC-specific inhibitor GF109203X. Furthermore, peptide mapping studies indicated that BDV-P is phosphorylated at the same sites in vitro as it is in vivo. Mutational analysis identified Ser26 and Ser28as sites for PKC phosphorylation and Ser70 and Ser86 as sites for casein kinase II phosphorylation.

Phosphoproteins of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses are typically integral components of the viral polymerase complex (16Banerjee A.K. Barik S. De B.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The activity of these proteins, and in some cases their three-dimensional structure, is dependent upon phosphorylation (17Das D.

Casein kinase II (CKII)-mediated phosphorylation of VSV-P leads to its multimerizationin vitro and promotes transcription (17Das D. Gupta A.K. Sims P.W. Gelfand C.A. Jentoft J.E. Banerjee A.K. J.

Virology. 1995; 208: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), CKII-mediated phosphorylation of phosphoprotein is also a prerequisite for transcriptional activity (18Barik S. McLean T. Dupuy L.C. Virology. 1995; 213: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,22Mazumder B. Barik S. Virology. 1994; 205: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) phosphoprotein is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC)ζ rather than by CKII (19De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the effect of HPIV3 phosphoprotein phosphorylation is similar in significance to phosphorylation of VSV-P and RSV phosphoprotein; inhibition of PKCζ by pseudopeptides results in abrogation of viral replication (19De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of the BDV phosphoprotein (BDV-P) is likely to be an important step in the life cycle of BDV we have identified the kinases involved in this process and mapped the BDV-P phosphorylation sites. Our findings indicate that BDV-P is phosphorylated predominantly by PKCε and to a lesser extent by CKII. BDV-infected C6 cells (23Carbone K.M. Rubin S.A. Sierra-Honigman A.M. Lederman H.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (5 × 105) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated in modified RPMI medium 1640 (Irvine Scientific) without Pi (2 ml) in the presence or absence of GF109203X (1–5 μm/ml) (Biomol) for 6 h, and then labeled with inorganic 32P (100 μCi/ml) (NEN Life Science Products) for 3 h. Following two washes with PBS, cells were scraped into PBS, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm okadaic acid (gift of A. Lepple, University of California, Irvine). BDV-P was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antiserum to BDV-P diluted 1:400 in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation with Protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, bound protein was collected by centrifugation and then released by boiling in Laemmli buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Proteins were size-fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE for analysis by autoradiography. BDV-P mutants were generated by PCR using plasmid p23 (25Kliche S. Briese T. Stitz L. Niemann H. Mangalam H. Lipkin W.I. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8133-8137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the complete phosphoprotein open reading frame in pBluescript (Stratagene). The BDV-P mutant P11 (lacking 11 amino acids at the amino terminus) was generated using a 5′-primer containing an NdeI site (p23-NdeI) and a 3′-primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase binding site (T7 primer). All other BDV-P mutants were generated by amplifying overlapping PCR fragments using the T7 primer or p23-NdeI primer and combinations of the primers described below. In a final PCR, the complete BDV-P ORF mutant sequence was amplified with the p23-NdeI primer and T7 primer and cloned into theNdeI/HindIII site of pET15b (Invitrogen). Introduction of the correct sequence for each mutant was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Primers used to generate the PKC mutants were P-26/28 (5′-AACGAGCGGGGGCACCAAGACC-3′), P-55 (5′-ATCGCAGACCCAGAC-3′), P-130 (5′-CTCCGATGCCATCAGAATCC-3′), and P-144 (5′-GGATCGCGCCATGAAGAC-3′). Primers used to generate the CKII mutants were P-11 (5′-AGAATCATATGCTGGAGGACGAAGAA-3′), P-58 (5′-ATCGCAGACCCAGAC-3′), P-70 (5′-CTAGCGAATGATGAG-3′), and P-86 (5′-AATGCCATGATCGAGG-3′). Histidine-tagged BDV-P (25Kliche S. Briese T. Stitz L. Niemann H. Mangalam H. Lipkin W.I. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8133-8137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and BDV-P mutants were purified from the soluble supernatant of transformed E. coli by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously except that Nonidet P-40 was not used (26Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal histidine tract was removed using avidin-coupled thrombin (Invitrogen). BDV-P was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 unit of thrombin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 250 mm imidazole. The thrombin digestion reaction was stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the avidin-coupled thrombin was removed with biotin-agarose according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Cleaved BDV-P was bound to Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 and then eluted with 550 mm NaCl. Pilot studies indicated that phosphorylation activity was equivalent with uncleaved and thrombin-cleaved BDV-P; thus, thrombin-cleaved protein was used only for peptide mapping experiments. Methods used for purification of phosphoproteins of VSV and HPIV3 have been described (19De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PKC was purified from cytoplasmic extracts of C6 (rat glial) cells as described (19De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 108 cells were washed in PBS, collected in 4 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell extracts were centrifuged at either 10,000 × g for 10 min (S10 extract) or 100,000 ×g for 60 min (S100 extract) at 4 °C. The S100 supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer A) overnight at 4 °C and then subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The highest PKC activity was present in fractions eluted between 200 and 250 mmNaCl. These fractions were pooled and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. Whereas PKC activity was found in the flow-through fraction of this column, heparin-sensitive kinase (CKII) activity was eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl starting at 300 mm. The flow-through fraction of the phosphocellulose column was again subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and PKC was eluted as already described. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm K2PO4, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol and applied to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the same buffer. PKC activity was eluted between 250 and 350 mm potassium phosphate. Methods used to purify PKC from rat brain were similar to those employed to purify PKC from C6 cells except that whole rat brain was lysed by Dounce homogenization in buffer A rather than by alternate freeze-thaw cycles. SDS-PAGE immunoblot analyses were performed using 10–20 μg of cell lysates (S10 extract) or 500 ng of purified protein fraction from the final hydroxylapatite column (rat brain material). Polyclonal antibodies against PKCε, PKCδ, PKCζ (Life Technologies, Inc.), and PKCη (Panvera) were used at concentrations suggested by the manufacturer. Recombinant PKCs (PKCε, PKCδ, and PKCζ) expressed in a baculovirus vector system were a gift of W. Koelch, München. For kinase experiments, 100–200 ng of BDV-P and variable amounts of cellular kinases or recombinant PKCs were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm ATP, 5–10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and when indicated, 200 mm CaCl2, phosphatidylserine (PS, 10 μg/ml), or diacylglycerol (DAG, 100 μg/ml) for 60 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 30 μl. After addition of 1.5 μl of 10 mm ATP and 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli buffer, reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Peptide phosphorylation assays were performed as described (39Koide H. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1149-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kinase activities were assayed under standard reaction conditions (30-μl volume) in the presence of PS (10 μg/ml), DAG (100 μg/ml), EGTA (0.2 mm), and substrate peptides at 200 μm or substrate protein at 200 μg/ml. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, a 3-μl aliquot was spotted onto P81 paper (Whatman). Radioactivity bound to paper was counted after washing for 5 min with 75 mm H3PO4 five times. Peptides AcMBP-(4–14) (Boehringer Mannheim), Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide, Sigma), α-peptide [Ser-25]PKC-(19–31) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ε-peptide [Ser-159]PKC-(149–164) (Peninsula Laboratories), and proteins histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim), and histone IIA (Boehringer Mannheim) were used as substrates. 32P-Radiolabeled BDV-P was fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane-bound BDV-P was digested in situ with trypsin, and peptides were recovered as described by Boyle et al.(27Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Trypsin-digested peptides were fractionated on cellulose plates (J. T. Baker Inc.) by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 at 900 V for 25 min in a precooled peptide map apparatus and then subjected to chromatography in 1-butanol (37.5%, v/v), pyridine (25%, v/v), glacial acetic acid (7.5%, v/v), and deonized water (30%, v/v) for 6–8 h. Plates were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Recombinant BDV-P was purified from E. coli to use as substrate to study phosphorylation of BDV-P in vitro. Incubation of BDV-P with an S10 extract of C6 cells resulted in its phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A,lane 1). Initially, two kinase inhibitors were used to gain insight into the nature of the kinase that phosphorylates BDV-P. Whereas staurosporin, a potent inhibitor of PKC and other kinases (28O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1734-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), had a strong inhibitory effect on BDV-P phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5), heparin which efficiently inhibits CKII had only a minimal effect (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 3, and 6). The combination of staurosporin and heparin resulted in nearly complete inhibition of BDV-P phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). Incubation with an antibody to the conserved catalytic subunit of PKC (αPKC1.9) resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of BDV-P phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2and 3). The extent of inhibition with saturating concentrations of αPKC1.9 (2 μg) was similar to that observed with 400 nm staurosporin (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Inhibition was also observed following addition of the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X to 6.0 μm final concentration. CKII-mediated phosphorylation of VSV-P was not affected by αPKC1.9 antibodies (data not shown). These results indicate that a cellular kinase of the PKC family is the major kinase involved in the incorporation of phosphate into the BDV-P. The PKC enzymes include two subgroups, which differ in their response to calcium (29Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of BDV-P was mediated by a calcium-dependent PKC (PKCα, -β, and -γ) or calcium-independent PKC (PKCζ, -δ, -ε, and -η) (29Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar), phosphorylation experiments with C6 or rat brain S100 extracts were performed in the presence of EGTA or supplemental calcium. Neither 0.5 mm EGTA nor calcium to 200 μm concentration had any effect on kinase activity (data not shown). The BDV-P-phosphorylating PKC was partially purified from C6 cells (data not shown) and rat brain by sequential chromatography through columns composed of DEAE, phosphocellulose, DEAE, and hydroxylapatite. Although elution profiles were similar with C6 and rat brain extracts, levels of phosphorylation activity were higher in fractions representing rat brain extracts. Fig. 2 displays results with rat brain extracts. Phosphorylation of BDV-P by the kinase in the elution fractions of the second DEAE column (Fig. 2 A,upper panel) correlated with the presence of PKCε in each fraction as judged by Western immunoblot (WIB) using a PKCε subtype-specific antibody (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). In contrast, WIB analysis of the same fractions using PKCζ subtype-specific antibodies revealed a different elution pattern, which did not correlate with the BDV-P phosphorylation activity (data not shown). In the final chromatography step, the kinase was eluted with 250 mm potassium phosphate (Fig. 2 B, fraction 30 and beyond). The highest concentration of protein was eluted at 180 mm potassium phosphate (data not shown). BDV-P phosphorylation activity by the kinase eluted in fraction 40 was inhibited by staurosporin and αPKC1.9 antibodies but not by heparin (data not shown). To identify the PKC present in fraction 40, PKC subtype-specific antibodies (PKCε, PKCδ, PKCζ, PKCη) were used for WIB analysis. Only PKCε was detected in fraction 40 (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). To assess whether the purified BDV-P-phosphorylating PKC might be sensitive to the known PKC activators PS or DAG, the kinase activity was measured in experiments where substrate was not a limiting factor (Fig. 3 A). Addition of 10 μg/ml PS (lane 1), 100 μg/ml DAG (lane 2), and 10 μg/ml PS and 100 μg/ml DAG in the presence (lane 3) or absence (lane 4) of 200 μm calcium stimulated phosphorylation of BDV-P 3–4-fold. The characteristics of the BDV-P protein kinase present in extracts from C6 cells and rat brain suggested its identity as PKCε. To further investigate the activity of individual PKC isotypes with respect to BDV-P, recombinant PKCε, PKCδ, and PKCζ were examined for the capacity to phosphorylate BDV-P (Fig. 3) and a panel of phosphate acceptors (Table I). When employed at concentrations normalized for phosphorylation of PKC α-peptide, the efficiency of PKCε in BDV-P phosphorylation was 5–10-fold higher than PKCδ and PKCζ (Fig. 3 B). Whereas the efficiencies of BDV-PK and PKCε in PKC ε-peptide phosphorylation were similar (BDV-PK, 106%; PKCε, 118%), phosphorylation of ε-peptide by PKCδ and PKCζ was less efficient (PKCδ, 60%; PKCζ, 80%). BDV-PK and PKCε were also similar in inefficiency of AcMBP phosphorylation (BDV-P, 10%; PKCε, 13%). In contrast, PKCδ and PCKζ were more efficient in AcMBP phosphorylation (PKCδ, 58%; PKCζ, 45%). All kinases tested (BDV-PK, PKCε, PKCδ, and PKCζ) were inefficient in phosphorylation of histone H1 and histone IIA (4–8%), phosphate acceptors that are phosphorylated by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase rather than PKC.Table IRelative enzymatic activity of BDV-PK with various phosphate acceptorsSubstrateProtein kinase activityBDV-PKεδζ%α100100100100ε1061186080AcMBP10135845Kemptide1511310Histone H18868Histone IIA7648Protein kinase activities were assayed in the presence of PS (10 μg/ml) and DAG (100 μg/ml). Results were normalized to the activity with α-peptide as substrate. Substrates were added at 200 μg/ml (proteins) or 200 μm (peptides). Open table in a new tab Protein kinase activities were assayed in the presence of PS (10 μg/ml) and DAG (100 μg/ml). Results were normalized to the activity with α-peptide as substrate. Substrates were added at 200 μg/ml (proteins) or 200 μm (peptides). Phosphorylation of proteins may differ in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, to test whether BDV-P is also phosphorylated by PKC in vivo, infected C6 cells were incubated with the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X and inorganic [32P]phosphate. BDV-P was immunoprecipitated from these cells using a monospecific antibody to BDV-P and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Increasing concentrations of GF109203X resulted in decreased BDV-P phosphorylation (Fig. 4, lanes 3–6) indicating a role for PKC in phosphorylation of BDV-P. Peptide mapping studies were pursued to determine whether BDV-P is phosphorylated by PKC at the same sites in vivo and in vitro. For this purpose, BDV-P from infected C6 cells phosphorylated in vivo and recombinant BDV-P phosphorylatedin vitro using a PKC-enriched fraction (C6 cells, second DEAE column) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, digested in situ with trypsin, and separated on thin layer chromatography plates for analysis by autoradiography. Peptide maps were identical (Fig. 5 A) with three dominant spots. Similar maps were observed when recombinant BDV-P was phosphorylated with the crude S10 extract of C6 cells (data not shown). Previous work had shown that BDV-P is phosphorylated in vivoat serine residues (30Thiedemann N. Presek P. Rott R. Stitz L. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the five potential sites of BDV-P phosphorylation were investigated using BDV mutants in which serine residues were changed to alanine by PCR mutagenesis. Experiments with a C6 S100 extract depleted of CKII revealed that the double mutant BDV-P (26/28) was not efficiently phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B). Peptide mapping of BDV-P (26/28) revealed that this site corresponds to the major peptide spot1 (Fig. 5 A). Due to the lack of a trypsin cleavage site between Ser26 and Ser28 it was not possible to differentiate between the two potential phosphorylation sites with peptide maps. The observations that staurosporin did not completely block phosphorylation of BDV-P and that the residual kinase activity was heparin-sensitive (Fig. 1) suggested the possibility of minor phosphorylation by CKII. To investigate this further, CKII was purified from the C6 S100 extract by phosphocellulose chromatography. The majority of PKC-mediated kinase activity was found in the void volume (Fig. 6 A,lane 1). This activity was inhibited by staurosporin (Fig. 6 A, lane 3) but not by heparin (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). In contrast, kinase activity in fraction 50 was inhibited by heparin (Fig. 6 B, lane 2) and not by staurosporin (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). The kinase activity in fraction 50 was also inhibited by antibodies to CKII (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). To identify the sites of CKII phosphorylation, BDV-P mutants were generated by PCR that either lacked the first 11 amino acids (deleting two potential CKII sites) or substituted alanine for serine residues at positions 58, 70, and 86. Incubation of these BDV-P mutants and wild-type recombinant BDV-P with a commercial CKII revealed that the serine residues at positions 70 and 86 are the major sites of phosphorylation by CKII (Fig. 6 C). Neither mutation had an impact on the PKC-dependent phosphorylation (data not shown). Similarly, mutations at sites found to impair PKC-dependent phosphorylation of BDV-P (residues 26 and 28) had no effect on CKII-mediated phosphorylation (data not shown). Phosphorylation of wild-type BDV-P by a commercial CKII was similar in the presence or absence of S10 C6 cell extracts (data not shown). The objective of this study was to characterize the cellular kinases responsible for phosphorylation of BDV-P. In vitroexperiments with recombinant BDV-P and crude extracts from C6 cells indicated that BDV-P was phosphorylated by both PKC and CKII; however, phosphorylation appeared to be mediated primarily by PKC. BDV-P phosphorylation was largely inhibited in vitro by antibodies directed against the catalytic subunit of PKC. Exposure of infected cells to increasing concentrations of GF109203X, a specific PKC inhibitor (31Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boisson P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in decreased phosphorylation of BDV-P. Analysis of extracts from C6 cells and rat brain enriched for BDV-P phosphorylation activity revealed that the BDV-PK is PKCε. The enzymatic activity of BDV-PK was correlated with the presence of PKCε rather than that of PKCδ, PKCζ, or PKCη. In addition, thein vitro enzymatic activity profiles of purified BDV-PK and recombinant PKCε were similar with respect to BDV-P and a panel of phosphate acceptors. Peptide maps of BDV-P phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo were identical and revealed one major and two minor phosphopeptides. Experiments with BDV-P mutants lacking potential PKC sites indicated that the major phosphopeptide represents a PKC site. The major phosphopeptide found in peptide maps from in vivophosphorylated BDV-P contained the potential PKC sites, Ser26 and Ser28. We have only examined phosphorylation of BDV-P from BDV strain He/80. Because this viral strain lacks a suitable cleavage site between Ser26 and Ser28, it was not possible to directly determine which site was phosphorylated through peptide mapping. However, the observation that Ser26 is not present in BDV strain V (32Briese T. Schneemann A. Lewis A.J. Park Y.-S. Kim S. Ludwig H. Lipkin W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4362-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) suggests that BDV-P is likely to be phosphorylated at Ser28 in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant BDV-P established Ser70 and Ser86 as the principal sites for phosphorylation by CKII in vitro. A potential basis for the observation that CKII-dependent phosphorylation is less pronounced than phosphorylation mediated by PKC is that CKII sites are more sensitive to phosphatases. However, this explanation appears to be unlikely given that levels of BDV-P phosphorylation with recombinant CKII did not differ in the presence or absence of crude C6 cell extract. Alternatively, the difference in the efficiency of PKC and CKII phosphorylation in vitro may reflect accessibility of individual sites in the folded protein. Whether BDV-P is phosphorylated by CKII in vivo remains to be determined; however, the observation that kinase activity cannot be eliminated in vivo using PKC inhibitors is consistent with a role for CKII in BDV-P phosphorylation. Phosphoproteins of other nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses are typically phosphorylated in vitro only by one kinase, CKII (e.g. measles (33Das T. Schuster A. Schneider-Schaulies S. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1995; 211: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and RSV (34Mazumder B. Adhikary G. Barik S. Virology. 1994; 205: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) or PKC (e.g.HPIV3 (19De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). An exception is VSV-P where initial phosphorylation by CKII induces a conformational change of VSV-P (New Jersey) that opens sites for secondary phosphorylation by an l-associated kinase (35Barik S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6570-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). BDV-P is phosphorylated in vitro by both PKCε and CKII. Although there are no data concerning the possibility that phosphorylation by one kinase effects a conformational change in BDV-P, the activities of these kinases appear to be independent because mutants lacking PKC sites are phosphorylated by CKII, and conversely, mutants lacking CKII sites are phosphorylated by PKC. The observation that BDV-P is predominantly phosphorylated by PKCε does not imply that CKII phosphorylation is inconsequential. There is precedent for functionally significant phosphorylation of individual cellular transcription factors by more than one kinase. For example, phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding proteins Jun and Fos by different kinases has been shown to regulate their activities (36Meek D.W. Street A.J. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 287: 1-15Google Scholar). We can only speculate as to the role of phosphorylation of BDV-P at multiple sites by different kinases. BDV is the only nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus known to have a nuclear localization for transcription and replication. Perhaps phosphorylation of BDV-P by one kinase impacts its translocation to the cell nucleus. Consistent with such a hypothesis is the observation that the PKC phosphorylation sites are located within the putative nuclear localization signal of phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation by a second kinase might then trigger assembly with other cellular or viral proteins (for example, the BDV polymerase) to form an active transcription factor complex. Finally, it is intriguing to speculate that phosphorylation events may play a role in BDV tropism for limbic circuitry. Indeed, the anatomic distributions of PKCε (37Saito N. Itouji A. Totani Y. Osawa I. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Ogita K. Tanaka C. Brain Res. 1993; 607: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and BDV are similar in rat brain (3Ludwig H. Bode L. Gosztonyi G. Prog. Med.

As recombinant BDV systems are established these hypotheses will be tested using BDV-P mutants lacking specific phosphorylation sites. We thank C. Glabe and R. A.

The kon andkoff values for the binding of the enzyme to the 36-bp substrate were 1.5 × 106m−1 s−1 and 3.2 × 10−2 s−1, respectively. Similar values were obtained with the shorter substrates. Using uncleavable 2′-O-methylated RNA-DNA substrates, values forkon and koff were 2.1 × 105m−1s−1 and 1.3 × 10−1 s−1 in the absence of Mg2+ that were further reduced in the presence of Mg2+ to 7.4 × 103m−1 s−1 and 2.6 × 10−2 s−1. Kinetic parameters similar to the wild-type enzyme were obtained using an active-site mutant enzyme, Asp134 replaced by Ala, whereas a greatly reduced on-rate was observed for another inactive mutant enzyme, in which the basic protrusion is eliminated, thereby distinguishing between poor catalysis and inability to bind to the substrate. Stoichiometric analyses of RNase HI binding to substrates of 18, 24, 30, and 36 bp are consistent with previous reports suggesting that RNase HI binds to 9–10 bp of RNA-DNA hybrid.

Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI (RNase HI) degrades only the RNA strand of an RNA-DNA hybrid (1Crouch R.J. Dirksen M.-L. Linn S.M. Roberts R.J. Nucleases.

The importance of this region for substrate binding has been demonstrated in several studies. The RNase HI domain isolated from HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is enzymatically inactive (13Becerra S.P.

Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the positively charged residues in this region are important for substrate binding (17Kanaya S. Katsuda C. Kimura S. Nakai T. Kitakuni E. Nakamura H. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Ikehara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6038-6044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of the basic protrusion of E. coli RNase HI at the equivalent position of the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase resulted in the production of the active HIV-1 RNase H domain (18Stahl S.J.

Thus, it seems likely that all amino acid residues that are involved in catalytic function and substrate binding have been identified. However, it is not fully understood how RNase H binds to its substrate. A kinetic study using synthetic nucleosides with modifications of their 2′-hydroxyl groups revealed the importance of the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nucleoside on the 3′-side of the cleaved phosphodiester and that of the second nucleoside 5′ to the cleaved phosphodiester for hydrogen bonding (20Iwai S. Kataoka S. Wakasa M. Ohtsuka E. Nakamura H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Models for the binding of the enzyme to an RNA-DNA hybrid have been proposed based upon computer docking of the structure ofE. coli RNase HI (free from its substrate) with an RNA-DNA hybrid whose structure was assumed to be an A form (6Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.J. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 11Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M. Matsushima M. Ishikawa M. Kanaya S. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. Matsuzaki T. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 1029-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), was found by NMR to be an A form (7Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Otsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Miyashiro H. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11535-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), or that was neither A nor B (21Fedoroff O.Y. Salazar M. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In these models, the RNA strand upstream of the cleavage site interacts with the enzyme. None of these models assumes that either the enzyme or the substrate alters its conformation upon binding. Recently, kinetic analyses using RNA-DNA hybrids, under conditions in which the hybrid was cleaved at a unique site (22Kanaya E. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggest that DNA residues complementary to the RNA residues located six or seven residues upstream of the cleavage site interact with the basic protrusion region of the enzyme. Such an interaction seems to require a conformational change in the enzyme or substrate, or in both. Determination of kinetic parameters and stoichiometry of RNase HI molecules bound to substrates of various lengths would provide additional information about the binding of enzyme to substrate. Magnesium ions may also modulate protein-nucleic acid interactions and participate in catalysis. For example, the binding ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae RNase HI to double-stranded RNA is influenced by Mg2+ concentration, with tight binding being detected at low concentrations and little binding in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ (23Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 246-259PubMed Google Scholar), and the DNA binding specificity of EcoRV is increased in the presence of Mg2+(24Jeltsch A. Maschke H. Selent U. Wenz C. Köhler E. Connolly B.A. Thorogood H. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6239-6246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the influence of magnesium ions on binding of RNase HI to RNA-DNA substrates. In this study, we have analyzed the interaction between E. coli RNase HI and RNA-DNA hybrids using the BIAcore™ system, an instrument based on surface plasmon resonance technology. This technology is useful for obtaining kinetic data on the interaction between enzyme and substrate, particularly when the enzyme is inactive. This system enabled us to distinguish between inability to bind the substrate and inability to cleave. Furthermore, utilization of a 2′-O-methylated substrate permitted analysis of the effect of the Mg2+ ions on substrate binding. The BIAcore™ instrument was manufactured by Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Sensor chips CM5, Tween P20, and the amine coupling kit containingN-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were from Pharmacia Biosensor AB. Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA ligand) was a kind gift from S. Khilko (25Gershon P.D. Khilko S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Poly(rA)·poly(dT) was made by annealing poly(rA) with poly(dT) obtained from Pharmacia. Annealing was performed by mixing 100 μg of poly(rA) and poly(dT) in HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween P20, pH 7.0), boiling for 2 min, and cooling slowly to room temperature. The plasmid pJAL600 (26Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 28: 117-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), used for overproduction of E. coli RNase HI, was constructed previously. Competent cells of E. coli HB101 (F − hsdS20(rB−, mB−) recA13 ara-13 proA2lacY1 galK2 rpsL20(Smr)xyl-5 mtl-1 supE44 λ−) were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Cells were grown in Luria Bertani medium (27Miller J.H. Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. The RNA oligonucleotides biotinylated on the 5′-amino group (Fig. 1) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and Oligos, Etc. DNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. All concentrations are expressed as moles of molecules and not bp. RNA and DNA oligonucleotides (1 μm) were annealed in HBS buffer by boiling for 2 min and allowed to cool to room temperature to form RNA-DNA hybrids. E. coli RNase HI wild-type protein (28Ma W.P. Hamilton S.E. Stowell J.G. Byrn S.R. Davisson V.J. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 2: 169-179Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the mutant protein D134A, in which Asp134 is replaced by Ala (5Haruki M. Noguchi E. Nakai C. Liu Y.-Y. Oobatake M. Itaya M. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were prepared as described. The enzyme with an N-terminal 6×His-Tag (6×His-RNase HI) was obtained as described (16Zhan X. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22023-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 246-259PubMed Google Scholar). A group of plasmids for overproduction of the RNase HI variants with randomized sequences, in which Ile82 and Val101are connected by four random amino acid residues resulting in deletion of the basic protrusion, was constructed as follows. Because the plasmid pJAL600 has a unique BamHI site in the sequence encompassing amino acid residues 81–83, and a unique SalI site about 50-base pairs downstream of the termination codon of thernhA gene, the rnhA gene in plasmid pJAL600 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using BamHI site-containing 5′-mutagenic primer, 5′-CCGGATCCNSNNSNNSNNSGTCGATCTCTGGCAACGTCTTGATGC-3′ and SalI site-containing 3′-primer 5′-GGGTCGACCAATTCGCAGGCGGTTGG-3′. In these sequences, N represents A, G, C, or T and S represents G or C, and restriction sites are underlined. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 25 cycles with a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler (model PJ2000) using a Gene Amp kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. These oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by Sawady Technology Co., Ltd. After digestion of the polymerase chain reaction fragment with BamHI andSalI, the resultant 280-base pair fragment and largeBamHI-SalI fragment of pJAL600 were ligated to construct pJAL600ΔBP. The mutant proteins were overproduced inE. coli HB101 harboring plasmid pJAL600 derivatives as described previously (26Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 28: 117-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cellular production levels of these proteins were estimated by subjecting whole cell lysates to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R250). RNase H activity was determined either in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2 by measuring the radioactivity of the acid-soluble digestion product of the substrate, 3H-labeled M13 DNA-RNA hybrid, as described previously (16Zhan X. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22023-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), or by degradation of32P-labeled poly(rA)·poly(dT) as described (30Hall S.H. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4092-4097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the UV absorption, assuming that all mutant proteins, except for ΔBP-RNase HI, have the same absorption coefficient,A 0.1%280 = 2.0, as that of the wild-type protein (31Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Ikehara M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The absorption coefficient of ΔBP-RNase HI was estimated as 1.65 by using ε = 1576m−1 cm−1 for Tyr (× 5) and 5225m−1 cm−1 for Trp (× 4) at 280 nm (32Goodwin T.W. Morton R.A. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), and a molecular mass of 15,860 Da. The CD spectra were measured on a J-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.) at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.1m NaCl, as described previously (33Kimura S. Oda Y. Nakai T. Katayanagi K. Kitakuni E. Nakai C. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). RNA-DNA hybrids were prepared so that the RNA strand was biotinylated at the 5′-end. Streptavidin was covalently linked to the dextran on the surface of research-grade CM5 sensor chips via primary amino groups using the amine coupling kit from Pharmacia. Carboxylate groups on the dextran were activated by injecting a mixture ofN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide followed by 20 μl of 25 μg/ml streptavidin in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.7. Ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, was injected to block unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters. Typically, the resonance unit (RU) value increase following this procedure was 500–1000. Twenty microliters of RNA-DNA hybrid (50–100 nm) in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% Tween P20, pH 8.0) were injected onto the streptavidin-modified sensor chip giving an increase of 50–100 RU. Unoccupied streptavidin was blocked by biotin. All the proteins and poly(rA)· poly(dT) were dissolved in TBS buffer or TBS buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 instead of EDTA (TBSM buffer). Samples were injected at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min onto the sensor chip surface on which the RNA-DNA hybrid had been immobilized, or onto a control surface on which streptavidin had been immobilized and blocked with biotin. Binding surfaces were regenerated by washing with 2 m NaCl. Immobilization was carried out as described (25Gershon P.D. Khilko S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The CM5 sensor chip was modified with NTA. Ni2+ was chelated by injecting NiCl2 onto the NTA-modified surface, which was followed by injection of 6×His-RNase HI to immobilize the protein by chelation, giving a change in RU value of 800. The 36-bp RNA-DNA hybrid was then injected onto the surface. Binding surfaces were regenerated by washing with 0.5 m EDTA. Sensorgrams for the interaction of RNase HI and RNA-DNA hybrids were analyzed with BIAlogue kinetics evaluation software, as described in the standard model (34Karlsson R. Michaelson A. Mattson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), after subtraction of the values for the interactions between the samples and streptavidin-coated control surface. The association rate constants (kon) were calculated from the association phases of the sensorgrams at various concentrations of the analyte, using Equation 1.ks=kon×C+koffEquation 1 koff values obtained from Equation 1 are not very reliable for low ranges (34Karlsson R. Michaelson A. Mattson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Therefore,koff values were calculated from the dissociation phases of the sensorgrams using Equation 2.ln(RU1/RUn)=koff×tEquation 2 Association constants (KA) were calculated using Equation 3.KA=kon/koffEquation 3 Association constants (KAeq) can also be obtained from equilibrium levels of the analyte binding to the surface (RUeq) using Equation 4.RUeq/C=KAeq×RUmax−KAeq×RUeq.Equation 4 Three versions ofE. coli RNase HI were examined by plasmon resonance studies as follows: wild-type enzyme, a mutant (D134A) with very low RNase H activity, and a protein whose handle or basic protrusion had been removed, presumably altering its ability to bind to RNA-DNA hybrids. This latter protein is described here for the first time. By studying the binding kinetics of enzymes one can distinguish whether the lower activity of the mutant form of a protein is due to poor binding to the substrate or to a defect in catalytic activity. Previously, it has been shown that the inactivity of a protein derived from the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase can be overcome by inserting handle region of E. coli RNase HI into the corresponding position of the HIV-1 RNase H protein. These results support the role of the handle in binding to the RNA-DNA substrate (18Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Vikic-Topic S. Crouch R.J. Wingfield P.T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further substantiate this function of the handle region, we made a deletion of amino acid residues 83–100 and replaced it with four randomly generated amino acid residues. It has previously been shown that E. coli strain MIC3001, with thernhA-339::cat and recB270(TS) mutation, can effectively screen for genes encoding a functional RNase H molecule (35Itaya M. McKelvin D. Chatterjie S.K. Crouch R.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, no clone was obtained after deletion-substitution of the handle region of E. coli RNase HI that could support growth of MIC3001 at the restrictive temperature, suggesting that the basic protrusion of E. coli RNase HI is critical for enzyme function in vivo. We screened the clones for an RNase HI variant that can be overproduced in a soluble form. When 22 E. coli HB101 transformants bearing pJAL600 derivatives were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for overproduction, only one was able to produce soluble RNase HI in amounts suitable for subsequent purification (data not shown). Plasmid DNA was isolated from this transformant, and the DNA sequence of the mutated rnhA gene was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence connecting Ile82 and Val101 was Arg-Thr-Asn-Ser. This mutant protein, ΔBP-RNase HI, was recovered in a soluble form after sonication lysis, and the lysate was subjected to DE52 chromatography using a column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. The protein was eluted from the column by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5m. Fractions containing the protein were combined and applied to a Sephacryl-S300 (Pharmacia) (2.2 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmEDTA and 0.1 m NaCl. Fractions containing the pure protein were combined and used for further analyses. The amount of the mutant protein ΔBP-RNase HI purified from a 1-liter culture was about 0.64 mg. No enzymatic activity was detected for the mutant protein ΔBP-RNase HI either in the presence of the Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion, indicating that this mutant is completely inactive. CD spectra of the wild-type protein and of the mutant protein ΔBP-RNase HI are shown in Fig. 2. Few spectral changes were detected between these proteins in the far ultraviolet region, in which the spectra reflect the content of the secondary structure of the protein (Fig. 2 a). This result suggests that the mutant protein ΔBP-RNase HI folds correctly. On the other hand, in the near ultraviolet region, in which the spectra reveal environments of aromatic amino acid residues, the spectra were clearly distinguishable (Fig. 2 b). This change in the spectrum may be due to a local conformational change upon the deletion of the basic protrusion and/or to the loss of two tryptophan residues. For the binding of RNase HI molecules to the 36-bp RNA-DNA hybrid, TBS containing RNase HI at concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 1.5 μmwere passed, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, over the surface of the sensor chip, on which the substrate had been immobilized. The slope of the ln(RU1/RUn) versus RU plots in each sensorgram was linear (data not shown), indicating that dissociation of the enzyme from the substrate occurs in an apparently first-order reaction. The sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 3. When the RNase HI molecules bound to the sensor chip were dissociated by running the RNase-free buffer at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, the dissociation rate constants (koff) decreased as the initial amount of the RNase HI molecules bound to the sensor chip decreased. This change is probably due to rebinding of the protein to the RNA-DNA hybrid on the sensor chip when the hybrid is present at high densities on the surface. Increasing the flow rate to 100 μl/min increased the dissociation rate constant nearly 5-fold, but thekoff value was still dependent on the initial number of RNase HI molecules bound to the sensor chip (Fig. 4). Addition of the poly(rA)·poly(dT) competing substrate to the buffer for dissociation at 39 μg/ml resulted in a 10–20-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant (Fig. 4). The koff values were nearly constant when the initial amount of the protein bound to the sensor chip increased, indicating that the competition completely abolishes the rebinding. In the presence of this competing substrate, binding of RNase HI to the immobilized hybrid was completely inhibited (data not shown).Figure 4Dissociation rates of E. coliRNase HI from the immobilized substrate. Values ofkoff are plotted versus the concentration of E. coli RNase HI. Enzyme was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min onto a surface on which 58 RU of the 36-bp RNA-DNA hybrid had been immobilized. Dissociation was observed upon injection of buffer at a flow rate of 5 μl/min (open squares), buffer at a flow rate of 100 μl/min (open circles), or buffer containing 39 μg/ml poly(rA)·poly(dT) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min (closed circles).

Association profiles fit satisfactorily with a mono-exponential equation for protein concentrations up to 100 nm.ks versus C plots for 10–80 nm protein concentrations were linear (Fig. 5), indicating that, unlike thekoff values, the konvalues are not affected by RNase H concentrations in the binding buffer. Similar sensorgrams were obtained when the 30-, 24-, or 18-bp RNA-DNA hybrids were used as immobilized substrates (data not shown). Kinetic parameters of the interaction between RNase HI and these substrates were similar with, at most, a 2-fold variation between them (Table I).Table IKinetic and association constants for the binding of E. coli RNase HI to immobilized RNA-DNA hybridsHybridkoffkonKAKAeq1KAeq2s −1 × 10 −2m −1 s −1 × 10 −6m −1 × 10 −7m −1 × 10 −7m −1 × 10 −736 bp1-akon andKAeq1 are the average of three experiments with S.D.

https://openalex.org/W1967274831,"A 25-kDa murine lysophospholipase (LysoPLA I) has been cloned and expressed, and Ser-119 has been shown to be essential for the enzyme activity (Wang, A., Deems, R. A., and Dennis, E. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12723–12729). In the present study, we show that LysoPLA I represents a new member of the serine hydrolase family with Ser-119, Asp-174, and His-208 composing the catalytic triad. The Asp-174 and His-208 are conserved among several esterases and are demonstrated herein to be essential for LysoPLA I activity as the mutation of either residue to Ala abolished LysoPLA I activity, whereas the global conformation of the mutants remained unchanged. Furthermore, the predicted secondary structure of LysoPLA I resembles that of the α/β-hydrolase fold, with Ser-119, Asp-174, and His-208 occupying the conserved topological location of the catalytic triad in the α/β-hydrolases. Structural modeling of LysoPLA I also indicates that the above three residues orient in such a manner that they would comprise a charge-relay network necessary for catalysis. In addition, the regiospecificity of LysoPLA I was studied using 31P NMR, and the result shows that LysoPLA I has similar LysoPLA1 and LysoPLA2 activity. This finding suggests that LysoPLA I may play an important role in removing lysophospholipids produced by both phospholipase A1 and A2 in vivo. A 25-kDa murine lysophospholipase (LysoPLA I) has been cloned and expressed, and Ser-119 has been shown to be essential for the enzyme activity (Wang, A., Deems, R. A., and Dennis, E. A. (1997) J.

This finding suggests that LysoPLA I may play an important role in removing lysophospholipids produced by both phospholipase A1 and A2 in vivo. Lysophospholipids (LysoPL) 1The abbreviations used are: LysoPL, lysophospholipid; LysoPLA1 and LysoPLA2, lysophospholipase A1 and A2, respectively; PLA1, and PLA2, phospholipase A1and A2, respectively; 1PGPC, 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; 2PGPC, 2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-dgalactoside; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. are the detergent-like intermediates in phospholipid metabolism whose in vivo levels must be strictly regulated for proper cell function and survival. Accumulation of LysoPL can perturb the activities of many membrane-bound signal-transducing enzymes (1Shier W.T. Baldwin J.H. Nilsen-Hamilton M. Hamilton R.T. Thanassi N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Increased LysoPL levels have also been detected in a variety of disease states including lethal dysrhythmias in myocardial ischemia and segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves (7Shaikh N.A.

Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The increased LysoPL levels are believed to be caused by the malfunction of LysoPL-regulating enzymes including lysophospholipases (LysoPLA), phospholipases A1 and A2 (PLA1 and PLA2), transacylases, and acyltransferases (Scheme I). As shown in Scheme I, lysophospholipases (LysoPLA1 and LysoPLA2) regulate LysoPL levels by further hydrolyzing the LysoPL generated by PLA1 or PLA2. Over the past few years, PLA2 has attracted much attention due to its roles in signal transduction and in the release of arachidonic acid, an important precursor for other lipid messengers such as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes (12Dennis E.A.

Arachidonic acid that occurs predominantly in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, however, could also be released by the sequential actions of PLA1 and LysoPLA2. Therefore, LysoPLA2 may also contribute to arachidonic acid releasein vivo. LysoPLA has been identified in a variety of cells and tissues, and recently a rat and a mouse enzyme have been sequenced, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli cells (17Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These two enzymes (both of 25 kDa molecular mass) share very high sequence homology as well as similar properties and represent the first characterized mammalian lysophospholipid-specific LysoPLA (referred to as LysoPLA I) (18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both the mouse and the rat enzymes contain a GXSXG motif, and the serine residue in the center of the motif was shown to be essential for enzymatic activity (18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and structural modeling to investigate the mechanism of action of LysoPLA I and to determine if a Ser/His/Asp catalytic triad is involved in catalysis. We have also investigated the substrate regiospecificity of LysoPLA I using 31P NMR spectroscopy. Previously, we cloned the murine LysoPLA I gene into the pLEX vector (Invitrogen) at the multiple cloning sites of NdeI and EcoRI (18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To subclone LysoPLA I into the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen), both the pET28a(+) and the pLEX/LysoPLA I vectors were digested by the same two restriction enzymes, NdeI and EcoRI, and then separated by 1% agarose gel. The bands corresponding to LysoPLA I (∼700 base pairs) and pET28a(+) (∼5300 base pairs) were purified from the gel using Wizard™ PCR Preps (Promega), and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The ligation product was used to transform competent E. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen), and the resulting colonies were screened by restriction enzyme analysis of the isolated plasmids. Finally, the entire LysoPLA I coding region in the pET28a(+) vector was checked by the automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems 373 from Perkin-Elmer) at the University of California at San Diego Center for AIDS Research Molecular Biology Core. It should be noted that this cloned LysoPLA I has an extra 20 amino acids at the N-terminal of the protein, the sequence of which is shown in Sequence 1. SEQUENCE*1As indicated above, the His·Tag can be removed by thrombin cleavage, leaving only an extra three amino acids at the N terminus of the protein. Three pairs of mutagenic primers with H28A, D174A, and H208A mutations were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. (H28A, 5′GCGGTTATTTTCCTTGCCGGATTGGGAGATACAGGGC 3′ and 5′GCCCTGTATCTCCCAATCCGGCAAGGAAAATAACCGC 3′; D174A, 5′GCCATGGAGATTGTGCCCCTTTAGTTCCCC 3′ and 5′GGGGAACTAAAGGGGCACAATCTCCATGGC 3′; H208A, 5′CTATGAAGGCATGATGGCCAGCTCATGTCAGCAGG 3′ and 5′CCTGCTGACATGAGCTGGCCATCATGCCTTCATAG 3′). These primers were used to generate the mutated proteins by PCR using QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Here, the pET28a(+)/LysoPLA I plasmid isolated from the NovaBlue cells was used as the template for the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After PCR, the wild-type parent plasmid remaining in the PCR product was selectively digested by the DpnI restriction enzyme (Stratagene), and the resultant mixture was used to transform competentE. coli NovaBlue cells. The desired mutations were selected by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing and were confirmed to be the only mutation introduced in each mutant. The pET28a(+) vector harboring either the wild-type or the mutant LysoPLA I insert was used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and a single colony was inoculated in an overnight culture in LB-kanamycin (50 μg/ml) medium. This overnight culture was then diluted 40-fold into Terrific Broth-kanamycin (50 μg/ml) medium and allowed to grow at 37 °C until theA600 nm reached 1. Then IPTG (Fisher) was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were grown at 22 °C for another 4 to 5 h to induce foreign protein expression. Finally, the E. coli cells were centrifuged and the pellet was stored at −20 °C. The same purification scheme was used to purify both the wild-type and mutant enzymes, and all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The purification was started by resuspending the E. coli pellet in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mmNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the mixture was stirred slowly for half an hour. The mixture was then sonicated intermittently 6 times for 10 s each and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected and passed through a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). The column was then washed with 40 ml of the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Generally, LysoPLA I was eluted in the first 15 ml of the elution buffer with some minor high molecular weight contaminants. It was then loaded onto a gel filtration column, Sephadex G-75 (2.5 × 90 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in buffer A (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The LysoPLA I eluted from the G-75 column was essentially free of contaminants and was used for both CD measurements and activity assays. To remove the His·Tag at the N-terminus of the protein, the purified protein was digested with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) for more than 16 h at 4 °C, and the biotinylated thrombin was removed at the end of the digestion by streptavidin-agarose (Novagen). The His·Tag-removed protein was used for both 31P NMR measurements and activity assays. Lysophospholipase activity was measured at 40 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 125 μm1-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (1.6 μCi/μmol) (obtained from Avanti and NEN Life Science Products) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The assay was initiated by adding an aliquot of enzyme solution to the substrate mixture and incubating for the desired time. The released fatty acid was extracted by the Dole method and then quantified by scintillation counting (19Zhang Y.Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9965-9972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the E. coli homogenate was quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard, and the purified LysoPLA I was quantified by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.85 (mg/ml)−1cm−1. This coefficient was calculated based on the absorbance (20Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, CA1980: 380-381Google Scholar) and the numbers of Trp and Tyr residues in the LysoPLA I sequence and was found to give essentially the same result as that obtained by Bio-Rad protein assay. Protein purity was examined using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), and the protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. CD spectra were measured using a modified Cary 61 spectropolarimeter (18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CD spectra were collected at 7 °C using a cylindrical quartz cuvette with path length of 0.5 mm. For each protein sample (purified wild-type or mutant LysoPLA I) and blank solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) 10 separate spectra were collected and averaged. The final protein spectra were obtained by subtracting the blank spectra from the sample spectra and converting the difference to mean residue ellipticity. Conversion of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) to 2PGPC was achieved using Rhizopus lipase (Boehringer Mannheim) following published procedures (22Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The enzymatically catalyzed reaction did not proceed to completion. However, 2PGPC could be separated from the starting material by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma). The 2PGPC prepared in this manner gave a single spot on analytical TLC but showed two peaks on31P NMR corresponding to a 4:1 mixture of 2PGPC:1PGPC isomers. Similarly, commercial 1PGPC contains approximately 10% of the corresponding 2PGPC isomer. These cross-contaminations have been documented and are attributed to migration of the fatty acyl chain during the preparation and purification of lysophospholipids (22Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). NMR samples were made up in a final buffer of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Appropriate amounts of 1PGPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 2PGPC (synthesized above) were combined to give a ∼1:1 mixture of isomers. As lysophospholipids were stored as chloroform solutions at −20 °C, the chloroform was removed at the beginning of the experiment by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting film was dissolved in the reaction buffer by vortexing and bath sonication to give a clear and colorless solution (14.3 mm total lysophospholipid). From this lysophospholipid solution, 350 μl was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. After a reference spectrum was obtained, 150 μl of purified LysoPLA I was added to initiate the reaction. The starting concentrations of reagents were 10 mm substrate and 540 μg/ml enzyme in 500 μl of buffer. The reaction was carried out at 20 °C. In addition, an insert containing 10 mm pyrophosphate in D2O (Cambridge Isotopes) was used as an external standard. 31P NMR spectra were obtained on a Brucker spectrometer operating at 243 MHz. A 90° pulse with a 2-s delay and a spectral width of 2671 Hz and 8 K data points was used. Broad band proton decoupling was utilized. Spectra were obtained at varying time intervals at 20 °C. The resulting free induction decay was apodized with an exponential multiplication with line broadening of 5 Hz. Peak intensities were taken to represent the relative concentrations of the phosphorus-containing species in solution. Under the same conditions as NMR experiments, nonenzymatic catalyzed hydrolysis was negligible as determined by the Dole assay. The LysoPLA I sequence was aligned with that of the acetylcholinesterase (23Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) or dielelactone hydrolase (24Pathak D. Ollis D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) based on the predicted secondary structure of LysoPLA I (18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the known crystal structures of the above two proteins. The modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using Modeller 3, a program 2R. Sánchez and A. Šali,http://guitar.rockefeller.edu for automated comparative modeling based on the satisfaction of spatial restraints. The resulted protein structure was visualized by the RasMol and Insight II programs. To optimize protein expression and to simplify large scale protein purification, the coding region of LysoPLA I in the pLEX vector was subcloned into pET28a(+) at restriction sites of NdeI and EcoRI, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This expression system provides a His·Tag at the N-terminal of LysoPLA I, which can be easily removed by thrombin cleavage after the fusion protein is purified by the Ni-NTA column. As shown in Fig. 1, a protein band at an apparent molecular mass of ∼29 kDa was strongly induced by 0.4 mmIPTG in E. coli (lane 3 versus lane 2). The lysophospholipase activity in E. coli homogenate harboring pET28a(+)/LysoPLA I was also increased more than 35-fold compared with the control, demonstrating that such a system expressed an active LysoPLA I at a very high level. With the purification procedures described below, more than 20 mg of pure recombinant protein can be obtained from a liter of E. coli culture. To purify the expressed protein, the homogenate of induced E. coli cells was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The LysoPLA I in the supernatant fraction was then purified by a Ni-NTA column, which yielded highly purified LysoPLA I (>96%) in a relatively small volume (15 ml). To remove the minor high molecular weight contaminations and to exchange the enzyme into a low salt buffer in which it is more stable, LysoPLA I isolated from the Ni-NTA column was further purified using a gel filtration column. The LysoPLA I thus obtained was essentially free of contamination on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels and possessed a specific activity of 1.09 ± 0.02 μmol/min·mg (Fig. 2). After the removal of the His·Tag at the N terminus of the protein by thrombin, the specific activity of LysoPLA I remained the same. Previously, the Ser-119 residue in the conserved GXSXG motif of LysoPLA I was found to be essential for protein function (18Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that LysoPLA I may be a new member of the serine hydrolase superfamily, the catalytic mechanism of which generally involves a catalytic triad composed of a nucleophile (Ser), an acid (Asp/Glu), and a base (His). While the serine residue in the catalytic triad can often easily be identified by the conserved GXGXG motif, the sequences around the acid and the base are generally much less conserved. Identification of the acid and the base residues is made even more difficult by the fact that the three catalytic residues often occur far apart in the amino acid sequence, and the order of their appearance in the primary sequence also varies from enzyme to enzyme (25Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol.

As a result, the candidates for the acid and the base residues are often identified by comparison with other proteins based on either amino acid sequences or secondary/tertiary structures (13Pickard R.T.

As shown in Fig. 3, the predicted secondary structure of LysoPLA I resembles those of the α/β-hydrolase fold, especially in the C-terminal half of the sequence. α/β-Hydrolases constitute a family of enzymes with different phylogenetic origins and catalytic functions but share a common protein structure (termed α/β-hydrolase fold) and a conserved catalytic mechanism (the catalytic triad) for activity (26Ollis D.E. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). Both the sequence (namely a nucleophile, followed by an acid and then a base) and the topological position (all on loops formed between a β-strand and an α-helix) of the catalytic triad are highly conserved in the α/β-hydrolase family. In addition, when the amino acid sequence of LysoPLA I is compared with several other esterases or putative esterases that share more than 25% homology to LysoPLA I, only one acid residue, Asp-174, is conserved among all of them (Fig. 3 B). More importantly, this Asp-174 occurs on a loop between β-strand 7 and helix E, the site conserved for the acid residue in the α/β-hydrolases (Fig. 3 A). Three His residues, His-28, His-170, and His-208, are also conserved among all the listed proteins (Fig. 3). However, only His-208 has the features of the catalytic base residue in the α/β-hydrolases; it occurs downstream of Asp-174 and is on a loop between β-strand 8 and helix F. The previously identified Ser-119 also occupies the conserved site termed the “nucleophile elbow” between β-strand 5 and helix C (Fig. 3). Therefore, LysoPLA I appears to be a new member of the α/β-hydrolases with Ser-119, Asp-174, and His-208 composing its catalytic triad. To verify that the Asp-174 and His-208 in LysoPLA I are indeed the components of the catalytic triad, each residue was changed to an Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, His-28 was also mutated to an Ala to examine how important it is for LysoPLA I activity. E. coli cells transformed with the vectors harboring the mutant genes expressed the mutant proteins (D174A, H208A, and H28A) at about the same level as that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). However, lysophospholipase activity in theE. coli homogenate expressing either the D174A or the H208A mutant was at the same level as the control, more than 35-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1). In contrast, the E. coli homogenate expressing the H28A mutant retained more than 40% activity of the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, when the mutant proteins were purified and assayed for activity, it was found that mutation at Asp-174 and His-208 abolished the activity of these two purified proteins (Fig. 2). The H28A mutant, on the other hand, had a specific activity of 0.500 ± 0.007 μmol/min·mg (∼50% wild-type enzyme activity), indicating that His-28 is not absolutely required for LysoPLA I activity (Fig. 2). To exclude the possibility that the loss of the enzyme activity in the mutant proteins was due to conformational changes in the mutants, CD spectra were taken for each of the purified mutants as well as the wild-type protein. As shown in Fig. 4, the CD spectra of all the proteins were essentially identical, demonstrating that the decreased enzyme activity, whether a 100% loss for D174A and H208A or a 50% loss for H28A, is not the result of misfolding or global conformational changes in the mutants. To explore the regiospecificity of LysoPLA I, 31P NMR was used to monitor the hydrolysis of both natural regioisomers (1PGPC and 2PGPC) under conditions in which acyl migration was minimized. As shown in Fig. 5 A, LysoPLA I readily processed both isomers at similar rates. As the substrate concentration (10 mm) used in the NMR measurements was much higher than the KM value (22 μm) reported previously (19Zhang Y.Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9965-9972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a linear time course was expected if the reaction was not complicated by substrate/product inhibition or activation. However, examination of the time courses for the consumption of both isomers as well as the production of glycerophosphocholine revealed that the reaction had two zero-order phases (Fig. 5 B), an early slower phase for up to 25 min and a later faster phase for up to 40 min. The data points after 40 min became non-zero order, reflecting the much smaller concentrations of substrates remaining. Similar reaction profiles were observed with secretary PLA2s (29Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11099-11106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the complex time courses were attributed to changes in the interface resulting from the fatty acid produced initially in those reactions. However, as fatty acids inhibit the LysoPLA I (19Zhang Y.Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9965-9972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains unclear what causes this complex time course. It is apparent, however, that LysoPLA I can function equally well as either a LysoPLA1 or a LysoPLA2. LysoPLAs have been identified in many mammalian tissues and cells and are considered to be the major route by which lysophospholipids are degraded. The substrate used in lyso-PLA I activity assays is known to exist as a 9:1 equilibrium mixture of 1PGPC and 2PGPC, with the fatty acid predominantly at the sn-1 position (22Plückthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The Dole extraction, however, is unable to distinguish which isomer is hydrolyzed. To examine whether LysoPLA I has a preference for one isomer over the other, we have followed the hydrolysis of both isomers by 31P NMR. Remarkably, the results show that LysoPLA I processes both regioisomers at almost identical rates. These findings were obtained at 20 °C, and similar results were also obtained at 40 °C (data not shown). These observations are in contrast to what was found for the lysophospholipase activity of the Group IV Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2, which exhibited a strong preference for 1PGPC over 2PGPC (30Loo R.W. Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ability of LysoPLA I to efficiently hydrolyze both regioisomers suggests that Lyso-PLA I may function as both a LysoPLA1and a LysoPLA2 in vivo, controlling lysophospholipids produced by both PLA1 and PLA2 (Scheme I). In addition, LysoPLA I may also play a role in arachidonic acid release and signal transduction since the arachidonic acid that occurs predominantly in the sn-2 position of phospholipids could also be cleaved by the sequential actions of a PLA1 and LysoPLA I. Interestingly, the enzyme's activity does not appear to be affected by the aggregation state of the substrate. Its activity does not vary dramatically as the substrates' concentration increases above its critical micelle concentration suggesting that interfacial activation does not play the same role in lysophospholipase activity as it does in phospholipase A2 activity (31Stafford R.E. Zhang Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). By structural comparison to other esterases and α/β-hydrolase, we have identified two putative catalytic residues Asp-174 and His-208 that, together with the previously identified Ser-119, may form the catalytic triad in LysoPLA I. This hypothesis is supported by the site-directed mutagenesis studies, which showed that mutations of either residue rendered the enzyme completely inactive, although the D174A and H208A mutants retained the same protein global conformation as that of the wild-type enzyme. These results are in strong contrast to that observed for another mutant, H28A. Even though His-28 is also highly conserved, mutation of it to Ala retained 50% activity of the wild-type enzyme. Taken together with the previous results, we have herein demonstrated that Ser-119, Asp-174, and His-208 are essential for LysoPLA I activity, and LysoPLA I appears to function by a mechanism involving a catalytic triad. Structural prediction for LysoPLA I was achieved based on the predicted secondary structure of LysoPLA I and the known crystal structure of acetylcholinesterase, a member of the α/β-hydrolase family (23Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the three catalytic residues Ser-119, Asp-174, and His-208, although far apart in the primary sequence, come together and orient in such a way that they could form the charge-relay network. Similar results were obtained using another α/β-hydrolase (dielelactone hydrolase) as template and agree with the notion that through divergent evolution the three-dimensional configuration of the triad and therefore the catalytic mechanism are highly conserved in many hydrolases (26Ollis D.E. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A.

The structural model obtained here provides a valuable tool for the design of studies to determine the function and regulation of this enzyme. The validity of this structural model, however, awaits x-ray structural studies for the enzyme, which are currently underway. In summary, we have established an improved protein expression/purification procedure to quickly purify a large amount of active enzyme and demonstrated that LysoPLA I represents a new member of the serine hydrolase family with the catalytic triad composed of Ser-119, Asp-174, and His-208. LysoPLA I hydrolyzes both 1PGPC and 2PGPC equally well and may play an important role in controlling the level of lysophospholipids produced by both PLA1 and PLA2. We thank Dr. Joseph Noel at the Salk Institute for introducing us to the PET28a(+) expression system, Dr. Murray Goodman for use of the CD spectrometer, and Dr. Alan Deese for considerable help with the NMR experiments."

Thus FepA is a TonB-dependent, energy-dependent, ligand-gated porin: its surface loops open in response to ligand binding and TonB action, to internalize FeEnt (6Jiang X. Payne M.A. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Feix J.B. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The siderophore FeEnt and the cytotoxins ColB and ColD differ in size, structure, and uptake mechanism, yet all three require FepA and TonB for passage into the periplasm (7Davies J.K. Reeves P. J.

The fifth proposed surface loop of FepA (PL5), bounded by residues 255–336, interacts with all three ligands during their passage through the OM (9Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Newton S.M.C. Allen J.S. Cao Z. Qi Z. Jiang X. Sprencel C. Igo J.D. Foster S.B. Payne M.A. Klebba P.E. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and convert FepA into a general porin through which sugars, antibiotics, and other small molecules may enter the cell (5Liu J. Rutz J.M. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10653-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Colicins are tripartite cytotoxins: their central, N- and C-terminal domains participate in ligand binding, translocation, and bacterial killing, respectively (13Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385 (see comment in Nature (1997) 385, 390–391): 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). ColB and D are homologous in their translocation and binding domains, but divergent in their C termini, consistent with their different killing modes: ColB kills by forming a pore in the Escherichia coli inner membrane, whereas ColD acts as a ribonuclease in the cytoplasm. Colicins may traverse the OM through porin channels (14Lazdunski C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This idea originates in part from experiments on a colicin-resistant mutant of OmpF (G119D) with an occluded channel (15Jeanteur D. Schirmer T. Fourel D. Simonet V. Rummel G. Widmer C. Rosenbusch J.P. Pattus F. Pages J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10675-10679Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Colicins A and E1 bind to external loops of OmpF and BtuB, respectively, and contain N-terminal determinants that confer pore specificity (16Benedetti H. Frenette M. Baty D. Lloubles R. Knibiehler M. Pattus F. Lazdunski C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that after adsorption they interact with the underlying transmembrane channels. However, no direct physical evidence exists to prove the passage of colicin polypeptides through OM porins. We examined the mechanism of ColB binding to FepA in vivowith an 125I-colicin binding assay and in vitrowith a flourescent derivative of FepA. In both conditions the siderophore and the colicins showed complex binding kinetics. A rapid phase occurred first, followed by a slower step, and both steps were independent of energy and TonB. FeEnt bound about 10-fold faster than ColB during the second stage. The high affinity binding equilibria between ColB and FepA facilitated purification of the receptor and its mutants, by affinity chromatography with immobilized ColB. We isolated ColB from E. coli DM1187/pCLB1 (obtained from M. A. McIntosh) and ColD from E. coli CA23 (17Timmis K. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 12-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The former strain constitutively expresses ColB, and we induced the latter to ColD overexpression by incubation of mid-log cultures with mitomycin C (2 μg/ml; Sigma) for 2 h in the dark. We purified both toxins by selective precipitations and chromatography (17Timmis K. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 12-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pugsley A.P. Reeves P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1977; 11: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using specific killing activity and SDS-PAGE as measures of purity. Bacteria (20 g) were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and lysed by 4 min of sonication in 30-s bursts, with cooling below <10 °C. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and nucleic acids were precipitated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine (Polymin P, Sigma) and removed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 30 min. ColB or ColD in the supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (between 28 and 55% for ColB, and between 41 and 49% saturation for ColD) and collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in, and dialyzed against, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, then chromatographed on DE52 cellulose (Whatman). Colicin was eluted with a 0.0 to 0.5m gradient of NaCl. Peak fractions of interest were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (55% for ColB and 49% for ColD) and purified over Sephacryl S-300-HR (110 × 1.0 cm) in the same buffer. FepA was purified by differential extraction with Triton X-100 (19Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 553-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ion exchange chromatography (20Fiss E.H. Stanley-Samuelson P. Neilands J.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4517-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or by affinity chromatography on ColB-Sepharose, synthesized by coupling ColB to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose 4B (21Oudega B. Oldenziel-Werner W.J. Klaasen-Boor P. Rezee A. Glas J. de, G. F.K. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22). Crude or partially purified FepA was loaded on the column, which was washed with 10 volumes of TTE buffer (2% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and FepA was eluted with a gradient of 0 to 2.5 m NaCl in TTE. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We regenerated the column with a reverse urea gradient (6.0 to 0.0 m in TTE). Rabbits were immunized weekly for 1 month with purified FepA, emulsified with complete (first immunization) or incomplete (subsequent immunizations) Freund's adjuvant. Rabbits were bled in week 5 and thereafter. The IgG fraction of the resulting α-FepA serum was purified and conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (22). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), modified for accuracy in the presence of Triton X-100 (24Wang C. Smith R.L. Anal.

The concentration of ColB was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 62,160 m−1cm−1, calculated from its primary sequence (26Mende J. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 59Fe-Enterobactin was prepared and purified as described previously (27Rutz J.M. Abdullah T. Singh S.P. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5964-5974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified colicin was serially diluted in LB broth in microtiter plates, from 10−1 to 3.2 × 10−9, and transferred with a sterile CloneMasterTM (Immusine Corp., San Leandro, CA) to an LB plate containing ampicillin (10 μg/ml), seeded with the tester strain. Colicin titers were measured after overnight incubation, as the inverse of the highest dilution that cleared the bacterial lawn. ColB was iodinated with IODO-BEADs (Pierce). Six beads were rinsed with 500 μl of MOPS-buffered saline (MBS; 40 mm MOPS, 0.9% NaCl, pH 6.9), dried, and incubated with 1.0 mCi of Na125I in 300 μl of MBS for 5 min. 2.8 mg of ColB in 3.9 ml of MBS was added for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by removing the beads, and unreacted125I was eliminated by chromatography over Sephadex G-50 in MBS. The site-directed mutant FepA protein E280C was utilized for introduction of fluorescent probes onto the receptor. This mutant protein has been extensively studied and manifests a wild-type phenotype, even when covalently modified at the E280C site (6Jiang X. Payne M.A. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Feix J.B. Newton S.M.C.

Its structural integrity in vivowas assessed with a battery of tests including accessibility to monoclonal antibodies, expression levels, binding and transport of ferric enterobactin, and binding and killing by colicins B and D. Purified FepAE280C-fluorescein bound ferric enterobactin with aKd almost identical to the wild type FepA, providing good evidence that the overall structure of E280C-Fl was intact. We cannot completely rule out that fluorescent labeling may have some impact on the binding of ligands, but based on the above studies, we believe it is minimal. FepAE280C-Fl fluorescence was recorded with an SLM 8000C fluorimeter upgraded to 8100 functionality (SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY), equipped with a 450-watt xenon light source and a cooled photomultiplier tube housing and operated in photon-counting mode. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 490 and 520 nm, respectively. The ratio F/F0 was calculated for each experimental point by dividing the net fluorescence (F) by the net fluorescence intensity at the beginning of an experiment (F0).

Bacteria were grown to mid-log in minimal MOPS medium, and 2 × 108 cells were suspended in 50 μl of MBS. 10 μl of125I-ColB (varied from 0.075 to 2.0 μm, final concentration) were added and incubated 10 min, the reaction mixture was diluted to 560 μl, and the cells were pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 2 min and counted in a Beckman gamma counter. Statistical analyses were performed by nonlinear least squares methods using Grafit (28Leatherbarrow, R. J. (1992) Grafit Version 3.0, Erathicus Software Ltd., Staines, UK.Google Scholar). For ColB binding, data were analyzed by the bound versus total equation. For fluorescence titrations, a form of the bound versus total equation was used that accounts for dilution of the fluorescent protein and the ligand due to sequential additions of ligand. Fluorescence time course data were fitted with both single and double exponential decay models, for increasing or decreasing functions. FepA in RWB1860/pITS449, cultured under iron stress in MOPS medium, bound FeEnt with a Kd of 24 ± 8 nm to a capacity 103,000 molecules/cell (Fig. 1). The siderophore reached equilibrium with FepA within 1 min. The affinity of the receptor for colicins was somewhat lower; it bound ColB with a Kd of 185 ± 45 nm, to a capacity of 96,000 molecules/cell (Fig. 1). Measurements of FepA expression in 125I-protein A Western blots (75,000 monomers/cell; data not shown) were consistent with the observed siderophore and ColB binding capacities, indicating approximately 1:1 stoichiometry for the binding of either ligand to the FepA monomer. FepA bound ColD, under the same experimental conditions, with aKd of 560 ± 130 nm, to a capacity of 33,000 molecules/cell, 3-fold lower than ColB (Fig. 1). Colicin binding experiments were incubated from 10 min to 3 h with no significant change in the parameters (data not shown), indicating that the reactions were at or near equilibrium. A 10-min preincubation of bacteria with saturating FeEnt (8.2 μm), or inclusion of saturating siderophore in the125I-ColB binding assay, prevented ColB binding (Fig. 2 A). These data reiterate that FeEnt protects E. coli from ColB killing by occupancy of a common binding site on FepA (29Guterman S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Wayne R. Frick K. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 7-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 10-fold lower affinity of ColB for FepA predicted a faster off-rate for the toxin, but if ColB was added first and excess FeEnt subsequently, almost no colicin dissociation occurred (Fig. 2 B), despite the ability of the siderophore to exclude toxin binding. This discrepancy suggested an unaccountably slow dissociation of the ColB·FepA complex, and that ColB adsorption was effectively irreversible in vivo, even at 4 °C. To further study the slow release of ColB from FepA, we used conditions that prevented its readsorption, saturating FeEnt. We equilibrated bacteria with 3.5 μm125I-ColB, then diluted, pelleted, and resuspended the cells in buffer with 10 μmFeEnt. From the radioactivity of the pellet, measured at intervals, we calculated koff for ColB, 4.7 × 10−5 s−1, a half-life (t½) of 4 h. The rate of 59FeEnt release under the same conditions was 6.9 × 10−4s−1, a half-life of about 20 min. While the slow off-rates explained the ligand competition results, they were inconsistent with a one-step binding mechanism; assuming single-step ColB binding and akon of 108m−1 s−1 (an order of magnitude slower than the diffusion limit for small molecules), the measuredKd of 185 nm predicted a dissociationt½ of less than 1 s. The slower observed ligand dissociation rates suggested that the measuredKd values contained rate constants for more than one binding step. The simplest explanation was that ColB bound in two steps, a rapid initial phase and a second phase that locked the receptor and ligand into a slow dissociating complex.

The fluorescence intensity of FepAE280C-Fl also decreased upon binding of ColB, but only about 15%, indicating that the siderophore and toxin interact differently with the labeled site (Figs. 3 and4). As seen in vivo, ColB and FeEnt competed for binding to FepA in vitro; FeEnt excluded ColB, and vice versa (Fig. 3)Figure 4Time course of ligand binding in vitro. FepAE280C-Fl was diluted to 50 nm in 50 mm Mops, pH 6.9, containing 60 mm NaCl and 1.0 mm dodecyl maltoside.

Raw data (•) were fitted to the theoretical time course for a two-component exponential model (solid line).

Convergence did not occur with a single exponential decay model. Fluorescence decreased during FeEnt binding (Fig. 4 B) with an initial rapid phase (k1; 1.8 × 10−2 ± 8 × 10−4 s−1; see “Discussion” for rate constant nomenclature) and a second slower phase (k3; 2.1 × 10−3 ± 2 × 10−4 s−1). ColB binding also followed biphasic kinetics (Fig. 4 A) with faster initial (k5; 2.1 × 10−2 ± 1 × 10−3 s−1) and a slower secondary (k7; 3 × 10−4 ± 1 × 10−4 s−1) components. Thus FeEnt and ColB both exhibited complex binding and a similar rate of initial adsorption to purified FepA in DM; their secondary, slower binding components differed by about 10-fold. We also saw slow dissociation of ColB from purified FepA, demonstrating that the long lived complex depends solely on the receptor and ligand; other OM components or FepA localization in the OM were not required. When FepAE280C-Fl·ColB was incubated with excess FeEnt over an extended period, a further decrease in fluorescence gradually occurred (Fig. 5) that followed a simple exponential decay. It was slower (k10; 6.7 × 10−4 ± 4 × 10−6 s−1,t½ = 17 min; Fig. 5) than the predicted off-rate, but 10-fold faster than ColB release in the absence of FeEnt in vivo. This decrease in fluorescence reflected the conversion of the FepA·ColB complex to the FepA·FeEnt complex. It occurred slower than the rate of FeEnt binding and probably approximateskoff for ColB in vitro. Likewise, addition of excess ColB to FepAE280C-Fl·FeEnt slowly increased fluorescence intensity (Fig. 6), again by a first order exponential process (k9; 3.9 × 10−3 ± 6 × 10−5 s−1,t½ = 3 min; Fig. 6) that reflected the conversion of FepA·FeEnt to FepA·ColB.Figure 6Ligand exchange; ColB binding to FepA·FeEnt. The FepA·FeEnt complex was generated in DM, as in Fig. 4, by addition of FeEnt to 0.50 μm, and ColB was added to 2.0 μm at t = 0. Fluorescence intensity was monitored, and the raw data (•) were fitted to the theoretical time course for a single exponential model (solid line).

Nevertheless, the fluorescence of FepAE280C-Fl in Triton X-100 decreased approximately 30% upon the addition of FeEnt, consistent with the results in DM, and the antagonistic behavior of the two ligands in Triton X-100 was the same as was seen in DM. The rates of fluorescence changes in Triton X-100 were very similar to those measured in DM (Table I), and in both detergents ligand binding was clearly a two-component process (see SchemeFS1).Table ISummary of rate constantsRate constantDodecyl maltosideTriton X-100ValueS.E.t1/2ValueS.E.t1/2s −1s −1mink11.8 × 10−28 × 10−40.65 min6.4 × 10−33 × 10−41.8k32.1 × 10−32 × 10−45.5 min1.15 × 10−37 × 10−610.0k52.1 × 10−21 × 10−30.55 min8.9 × 10−35 × 10−41.3k73 × 10−41 × 10−439 min1.09 × 10−33 × 10−510.6k93.9 × 10−36 × 10−53 min2.1 × 10−36 × 10−65.5k106.7 × 10−44 × 10−617 min8.6 × 10−42 × 10−613.4koffFeEnt1-aDetermined in 40 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, containing 0.9% NaCl, 2.0 μm nonradioactive FeEnt, and no detergent, 0 °C.6.9 × 10−4ND1-bND, not determined.17 min(3 min)1-cExtrapolated to 25 °C.koff ColB1-dDetermined in 40 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, containing 0.9% NaCl, 10 μm FeEnt, and no detergent, 0 °C.4.7 × 10−5ND 1-bND, not determined.4.1 hr(43 min)1-cExtrapolated to 25 °C.Rate constants determined from in vitro fluorescence time courses are summarized for the various interconversions in Scheme FS1.

ColB-Sepharose purified FepA from Triton X-100-solubilized OM fractions of RWB18–60/pFepAE280C (Fig. 7 A). It was more effective than immunoaffinity chromatography (Fig. 7 B), because 81K* (32Hollifield Jr., W.C. Neilands J.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1922-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the OmpT-generated degradation product of FepA, stuck tightly to anti-FepA-Sepharose, but not to ColB-Sepharose. Second, a mild salt gradient released FepA from ColB-Sepharose, while only high concentrations of the chaotropic agent trichloroacetate eluted the receptor from the immunoadsorbent, and these harsh conditions also released antibodies from the resin that contaminated the FepA product. Affinity purification of siderophore receptors by binding to their antagonistic ligands, bacteriocins, was reported by Oudega et al. (21Oudega B. Oldenziel-Werner W.J. Klaasen-Boor P. Rezee A. Glas J. de, G. F.K. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who used cloacin DF13-Sepharose to purify an OM protein later recognized as the ferric aerobactin receptor, IutA (33Carbonetti N.H. Williams P.H. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 7-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reproduced this technique with ColB-Sepharose, permitting large scale, rapid purification of FepA or mutant FepA proteins; 20 ml of the affinity adsorbent isolated 5–10 mg of the receptor in 1–2 days. Guterman (29Guterman S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Guterman S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) discovered two mutations, exbA andexbB, that resulted in ColB resistance and hyperexcretion of a diffusible inhibitor of ColB killing. exbA was later recognized as tonB (35Guterman S.K. Dann L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which creates OM transport deficiencies resulting in ColB resistance. exbB also produces colicin uptake defects, and the soluble factor was identified as FeEnt. tonB and exbB mutants secrete enterobactin because they are unable to transport iron, making them chronically iron-deficient (36Wang C.C. Newton A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2147-2151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later experiments showed that metal chelates (30Wayne R. Frick K. Neilands J.B. J.

J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 497-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) block colicin (and bacteriophage) killing by competitive binding to common surface receptors. FeEnt, ColB, and ColD, for example, adsorb to a common site in FepA PL5 (10Newton S.M.C. Allen J.S. Cao Z. Qi Z. Jiang X. Sprencel C. Igo J.D. Foster S.B. Payne M.A. Klebba P.E. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We measured the affinities and kinetics of these binding reactions in vivoand in vitro. The siderophore bound more tightly to FepA than ColB or ColD, suggesting that its significant overall charge (−3) and aromaticity outweigh the potential for multivalent charge interactions between the colicins and the receptor. FeEnt may bind in a pocket of the receptor surface that is optimized to accept it in a complementary configuration. The colicins also use this site, but apparently as part of a broader surface area that creates weaker overall interactions. The lower capacity of FepA for ColD, relative to that observed for ColB and FeEnt, suggests that the larger colicin may bind as 1 ColD molecule per FepA trimer, as opposed to 1 molecule per FepA monomer, seen for ColB and FeEnt. In the two nonionic detergents we employed FeEnt and ColB engendered spectroscopically distinct states in FepA upon binding, suggesting that the siderophore and colicins induce different effects when they complex FepA. Conformational changes in FepA were previously observed in the presence of FeEnt, by analysis of nitroxide probes attached at E280C (12Liu J. Rutz J.M. Klebba P.E. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13274-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The close proximity of E280C to the FepA ligand binding domain (12Liu J. Rutz J.M. Klebba P.E. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13274-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the large reduction in intensity caused by the ferric siderophore results from chemical quenching instead of conformational changes in the receptor. However, both FeEnt and ColB exhibited biphasic binding kinetics to FepA, which strongly suggests a conformational change in the receptor during their adsorption. Analyses of the two-component pseudo-first order decay of fluorescent probes attached in PL5 (Table I) revealed several possible equilibria (Scheme FS1). In DM the initial, fast binding component was similar for both ligands (approximately 0.02 s−1), and the secondary, slow component was about 10-fold faster for FeEnt (2.1 × 10−3 s−1) than ColB (3 × 10−4 s−1). In Triton X-100 the binding of both ligands was also biphasic, but the initial stages were slower (approximately 0.006 s−1), and we did not observe rate differences in the second stages of FeEnt and ColB binding (Table I). These data suggest a detergent effect on the binding reaction (see also below). The mutual exclusion of one ligand by the binding of the other allowed us to measure their dissociation rates from FepA. In contrast to the biphasic association kinetics observed for FeEnt and ColB, their dissociation rates in the presence of the other followed single-component first order decays. The release of the siderophore and the binding of the colicin, or vice versa, may follow one of two pathways. In a microscopically reversible model, the two-stage FeEnt binding pathway may simply revert to release the siderophore and free FepA for ColB binding. In this case the rate constant for release of FeEnt in the presence of ColB (k9) reflects the reversal of the steps leading to FeEnt binding (k4 and k2) followed by the forward progress of ColB binding (k5 andk7). Then k9 reflects the rate-limiting step among k4,k2, k5, andk7. If the ligand exchange reaction proceeds along this sequential pathway, then the individual steps must occur as rapidly as the overall dissociation rate (i.e. k4, k2,k5, and k7 must be ≥k9). This condition was met in Triton X-100, but not in DM (k7 was ≪k9). A possible explanation for this difference is that in DM the rapid release of FeEnt from FepA (k9) results from an active solubilization of the siderophore off the surface of the receptor by the detergent. For release of ColB in the presence of FeEnt, k10reflects the rate-limiting step among k8,k6, k1, andk3. In this case the individual steps occurred as rapidly as the observed dissociation rate (k6, k8,k1, and k3 were >k10), in both DM and Triton X-100. Thus, the microscopically reversible pathway accounts for the dissociation kinetics of both ligands in Triton X-100, and the release of ColB in DM, and is the most likely explanation of the observed dissociation kinetics in both detergents. An alternative mechanism for the rapid release of FeEnt in the presence of ColB involves the binding of the toxin to FepA·FeEnt, creating a ternary complex (FepA·FeEnt·ColB) that dislodges the siderophore. Our data tends to exclude this mechanism, because no ColB binding was seen in the presence of FeEnt. Neither did we obtain evidence of a ternary complex in vivo, in [59Fe]Ent binding experiments in the presence of saturating ColB (data not shown). Thus, our results are most consistent with full release of one ligand before binding of another. One or more intermediate states must exist in the transport mechanism of a ligand-gated channel like FepA, in which the solute initially binds to an external region of the receptor. Our results show the existence of a second phase in the initial adsorption stage, that is energy- and TonB-independent, and precedes the TonB-dependent internalization of ligands. The likely explanation is that a conformational change occurs in FepA as a second step of binding, as previously suggested by site-directed spin labeling of FepA in vitro (12Liu J. Rutz J.M. Klebba P.E. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13274-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Such an intermediate complex also explains the discrepancy between the Kd of FeEnt binding (20 nm) and the Km of FeEnt transport (200 nM) (10Newton S.M.C. Allen J.S. Cao Z. Qi Z. Jiang X. Sprencel C. Igo J.D. Foster S.B. Payne M.A. Klebba P.E. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); when an initial rapid binding occurs, followed by other intermediate steps, the Kmdeviates from the Kd according to the rate constants for formation and collapse of the intermediates. In subsequent stages the conformation of FepA surface loops change to “open” the receptor, and the ligand enters the underlying channel (6Jiang X. Payne M.A. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Feix J.B. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This internalization reaction, which may itself contain numerous distinct steps, ultimately requires energy expenditure and the participation of TonB to reach completion. Like the siderophore, transport of the colicin occurs in two stages: binding to the cell surface, and passage through the OM bilayer. Again, our data address the energy-independent, biphasic first stage of adsorption to FepA. The steps after binding remain ill defined. FepA·ColB dissociates more slowly than FepA·FeEnt; this slow dissociating complex likely results from conformational changes in the receptor and/or the ligand that hold the proteins together. The progression of ligand binding to this tight complex did not require TonB or other OM components. Subsequent, TonB-dependent conformational changes in FepA likely trigger uptake after binding, by initiating colicin passage through the FepA channel (6Jiang X. Payne M.A. Cao Z. Foster S.B.

These latter mutations have so far not been found separately except for the rarele 59–202-1067 allele (24Elmgren A. Börjeson C. Svensson L. Rydberg L. Larson G.

Vox Sang. 1996; 70: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acid is located in the transmembrane region of Fuc-TIII, and may modify the anchoring of the enzyme on the Golgi membrane (21Mollicone R. Reguigne I. Kelly R.J. Fletcher A.

By making chimeric FUT3 constructs and transfecting COS-7 cells, it was possible to show that the Fuc-TIII enzyme with the isolated amino acid substitution Trp68 → Arg, was only able to synthesize less than 1% of the fucosylated structures made by the FUT3 wild type under the same conditions. This demonstrates that the T202C alteration is the major inactivating point mutation of the le 202–314allele.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the le 202–314 allele either in homozygous or in heterozygous state in conjunction with an additional le allele, for the appearance of the Le(a−b−) phenotype on erythrocytes was originally demonstrated in a Swedish population (24Elmgren A. Börjeson C. Svensson L. Rydberg L. Larson G. Vox Sang. 1996; 70: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This has also recently been observed in studies on French individuals from the Reunion island. 2P. Fernandez-Mateos, A. Cailleau, A. Elmgren, L. Svensson, G. Larson, B. E. Samuelsson, R. Oriol, and R. Mollicone, submitted for publication. The significance of this allele was recently confirmed in expression and enzymatic studies on transfected COS-7 cells (38Ørntoft T.F. Vestergaard E.M. Holmes E. Jakobsen J.S. Grunnet N. Mortensen M. Johnson P. Bross P. Gregersen N. Skorstengaard K. Jensen U.B. Bolund L. Wolf H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32260-32268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), where some of our own unpublishedFUT3-primers were used for PCR amplifications. It was hypothesized in this latter study that the C314T mutation of thele 202–314 allele might be the more important of the two mutations for introducing the Lewis negative phenotype on erythrocytes.In an earlier study the acceptor specificities of Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI were shown to be dependent on the variation of 11 amino acid residues in a region corresponding to the Fuc-TIII amino acids 103–153 (39Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Fuc-TIII amino acid Thr105 is indeed located in this region but it was not identified as one of these 11 amino acids affecting the enzyme substrate specificity. A more recent study using truncated forms of Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV demonstrated that only constructs containing amino acids 62–361 of Fuc-TIII and 76–374 of Fuc-TV were active, whereas shorter forms of the enzymes were inactive (40Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This supports the results of the present study that amino acid Trp68 of Fuc-TIII (and the corresponding Trp81 of Fuc-TV) are indeed amino acids necessary for enzymatic activity of these fucosyltransferases.We have in parallel cloned and sequenced the correspondingFUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 genes of the chimpanzee 3M. Costache, P. A. Apoil, A. Cailleau, A. Elmgren, G. Larson, S. Henry, A. Blancher, D. Jordachescu, R. Oriol, and R. Mollicone, manuscript in preparation. and the bovinefutb gene (35Oulmouden A. Wierinckx A. Petit J.-M. Costache M. Palcic M.M. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Julien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8764-8773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and aligned these sequences with the humanFUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 sequences. The tryptophan residue at position 68, which is affected by the T202C mutation of human Fuc-TIII, is conserved in the corresponding positions of the three human, three chimpanzee, and bovine Fuc-Ts. In contrast, the threonine residue at position 105, affected by the C314T mutation of human Fuc-TIII, is only found in the chimpanzee Fuc-TIII, but not in the human or chimpanzee Fuc-TVs or Fuc-TVIs, nor in the bovine Futb enzyme where an alanine residue was identified at the corresponding positions.By using chimeric FUT3 constructs, separating the T202C mutation from the C314T mutation, we have now shown that the former mutation (T202C) is the essential one for the Le(a−b−) phenotype on transfected COS-7 cells and most probably also on human erythrocytes. The T → C mutation at nucleotide 202 induces a major amino acid change, tryptophan to arginine at amino acid position 68. This Trp68 position of the Fuc-TIII enzyme is in a highly hydrophobic area (10Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 39Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: vii-xiiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a shift to a charged hydrophilic amino acid such as Arg in this position may induce changes in the folding of the protein which might be responsible for the dramatic decrease of the Vmax of the mutated enzyme. The relative significance of the two substitutions at amino acids 68 and 105 versus the wild type enzyme are illustrated in the Hopp and Woods hydropathicity plots in Fig. 1(42Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). From these plots it is obvious that the Trp68 → Arg has a major effect while the Thr105 → Met has only a minor effect on this character of the Fuc-TIII enzyme. However, it is also worth noticing that the naturally occurring allele,le 202–314, in our extended enzymatic studies encodes for a protein that was about 20 times less active than that encoded for by the 202 mutated construct and more than 200 times less active than the wild type enzyme. Thus, there seems to be a synergistic negative effect on the protein activity of these two mutations which contrasts to the single point mutation at nucleotide 1067 resulting in a protein without any measurable enzyme activity. The molecular explanation for these results will have to await experimental data on the three-dimensional structure of the human Lewis Fuc-TIII enzyme and its interaction with the Golgi membrane, neighboring proteins, GDP-fucose, and the acceptor substrates.

The corresponding amino acid is located in the transmembrane region of Fuc-TIII, and may modify the anchoring of the enzyme on the Golgi membrane (21Mollicone R. Reguigne I. Kelly R.J. Fletcher A.

The aim of this study was to examine which of the FUT3mutations, T202C or C314T, was responsible for inactivating the Fuc-TIII enzyme. By making chimeric FUT3 constructs and transfecting COS-7 cells, it was possible to show that the Fuc-TIII enzyme with the isolated amino acid substitution Trp68 → Arg, was only able to synthesize less than 1% of the fucosylated structures made by the FUT3 wild type under the same conditions. This demonstrates that the T202C alteration is the major inactivating point mutation of the le 202–314allele. DISCUSSIONThe importance of the le 202–314 allele either in homozygous or in heterozygous state in conjunction with an additional le allele, for the appearance of the Le(a−b−) phenotype on erythrocytes was originally demonstrated in a Swedish population (24Elmgren A. Börjeson C. Svensson L. Rydberg L. Larson G. Vox Sang. 1996; 70: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This has also recently been observed in studies on French individuals from the Reunion island. 2P. Fernandez-Mateos, A. Cailleau, A. Elmgren, L. Svensson, G. Larson, B. E. Samuelsson, R. Oriol, and R. Mollicone, submitted for publication. The significance of this allele was recently confirmed in expression and enzymatic studies on transfected COS-7 cells (38Ørntoft T.F. Vestergaard E.M. Holmes E. Jakobsen J.S. Grunnet N. Mortensen M. Johnson P. Bross P. Gregersen N. Skorstengaard K. Jensen U.B. Bolund L. Wolf H. J. Biol.

It was hypothesized in this latter study that the C314T mutation of thele 202–314 allele might be the more important of the two mutations for introducing the Lewis negative phenotype on erythrocytes.In an earlier study the acceptor specificities of Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TV, and Fuc-TVI were shown to be dependent on the variation of 11 amino acid residues in a region corresponding to the Fuc-TIII amino acids 103–153 (39Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Fuc-TIII amino acid Thr105 is indeed located in this region but it was not identified as one of these 11 amino acids affecting the enzyme substrate specificity. A more recent study using truncated forms of Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV demonstrated that only constructs containing amino acids 62–361 of Fuc-TIII and 76–374 of Fuc-TV were active, whereas shorter forms of the enzymes were inactive (40Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This supports the results of the present study that amino acid Trp68 of Fuc-TIII (and the corresponding Trp81 of Fuc-TV) are indeed amino acids necessary for enzymatic activity of these fucosyltransferases.We have in parallel cloned and sequenced the correspondingFUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 genes of the chimpanzee 3M. Costache, P. A. Apoil, A. Cailleau, A. Elmgren, G. Larson, S. Henry, A. Blancher, D. Jordachescu, R. Oriol, and R. Mollicone, manuscript in preparation. and the bovinefutb gene (35Oulmouden A.

The tryptophan residue at position 68, which is affected by the T202C mutation of human Fuc-TIII, is conserved in the corresponding positions of the three human, three chimpanzee, and bovine Fuc-Ts. In contrast, the threonine residue at position 105, affected by the C314T mutation of human Fuc-TIII, is only found in the chimpanzee Fuc-TIII, but not in the human or chimpanzee Fuc-TVs or Fuc-TVIs, nor in the bovine Futb enzyme where an alanine residue was identified at the corresponding positions.By using chimeric FUT3 constructs, separating the T202C mutation from the C314T mutation, we have now shown that the former mutation (T202C) is the essential one for the Le(a−b−) phenotype on transfected COS-7 cells and most probably also on human erythrocytes. The T → C mutation at nucleotide 202 induces a major amino acid change, tryptophan to arginine at amino acid position 68. This Trp68 position of the Fuc-TIII enzyme is in a highly hydrophobic area (10Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: vii-xiiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a shift to a charged hydrophilic amino acid such as Arg in this position may induce changes in the folding of the protein which might be responsible for the dramatic decrease of the Vmax of the mutated enzyme. The relative significance of the two substitutions at amino acids 68 and 105 versus the wild type enzyme are illustrated in the Hopp and Woods hydropathicity plots in Fig. 1(42Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). From these plots it is obvious that the Trp68 → Arg has a major effect while the Thr105 → Met has only a minor effect on this character of the Fuc-TIII enzyme. However, it is also worth noticing that the naturally occurring allele,le 202–314, in our extended enzymatic studies encodes for a protein that was about 20 times less active than that encoded for by the 202 mutated construct and more than 200 times less active than the wild type enzyme. Thus, there seems to be a synergistic negative effect on the protein activity of these two mutations which contrasts to the single point mutation at nucleotide 1067 resulting in a protein without any measurable enzyme activity. The molecular explanation for these results will have to await experimental data on the three-dimensional structure of the human Lewis Fuc-TIII enzyme and its interaction with the Golgi membrane, neighboring proteins, GDP-fucose, and the acceptor substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2101515831,"T lineage-specific activation antigen 1 (TLiSA1) antigen was initially described as a T lineage-specific activation antigen involved in the differentiation of human cytotoxic T cells. Subsequently, the antigen was identified on platelets and was shown to be involved in platelet activation, hence it was renamed platelet and T cell antigen 1 (PTA1), although identity between the two antigens was not established. In the present study we have cloned the cDNA encoding TLiSA1 from Jurkat cells and show it to be a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with the unusual structure of two V domains only. Identity between TLiSA1 and platelet PTA1 is established by immunological criteria, by internal peptide sequences obtained from the purified platelet glycoprotein and by sequencing the platelet transcript after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In Jurkat cells, TLiSA1/PTA1 mRNA and surface protein expression is greatly stimulated by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester, but the T cell proliferative signal of phorbol ester and ionophore combined greatly reduces or abrogates this response, and this suppressive effect of the ionophore is not reversed by incorporating FK506 to inhibit calcineurin. Together with the known signaling role of PTA1, these data substantiate the notion that this molecule is implicated in T cell differentiation, perhaps by engagement of an adhesive ligand.

Over 70 molecules are known to be specifically regulated during the process of T cell activation and differentiation (1Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Many of these are up-regulated or expressed de novo on the surface of activated T cells, and detailed study of the structure and function of such activation antigens has been instructive toward an understanding of the immune response. In many cases elucidation of the regulation of expression and, in particular, the structure of activation antigens has led to the identification of a ligand or counter receptor, frequently expressed as an activation antigen on a non-T cell (reviewed in Refs.2Weiss A. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 467-504Google Scholar, 3Linsley P.S. Ledbetter J.A. Annu. Rev.

Engagements between counter receptors are now established as crucial events during thymic differentiation and in the activation and proliferative response of T cells to antigenic stimulation (2Weiss A. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 467-504Google Scholar). In addition, transfection studies with such counter receptors has greatly facilitated analyses of the biochemical signaling pathways that drive T cell proliferation. More elusive has been the elucidation of the processes that drive the differentiation of precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (pCTL) 1The abbreviations used are: pCTL, precursor cytotoxic lymphocyte(s); CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; TLiSA1, T lineage-specific activation antigen 1; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PTA1, platelet and T cell antigen 1; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TGF, transforming growth factor; IgSF, immunoglobulin superfamily; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TCR, T cell receptor. into mature CTL effector cells. In particular, it is not resolved whether the signals that drive proliferation also promote maturation and differentiation or whether discrete signals are required (reviewed in Ref. 5Berke G. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, New York1993: 965-1014Google Scholar). Certainly there is evidence to suggest that primed pCTL may be able to undergo differentiation in the absence of further proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 6Mescher M.F. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 177-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One activation antigen, termed T lineage-specific activation antigen 1 (TLiSA1), has provided data pertinent to this question. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) termed Leo A1 and F(ab1)2 fragments of this mAb and of a polyclonal antibody to TLiSA1 inhibited the differentiation of human pCTL into effector cells when present during mixed lymphocyte culture but had no effect on cell proliferation or cytolytic function (7Burns G.F. Triglia T. Werkmeister J.A. Begley C.G. Boyd A.W. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). The mAb also inhibited the interferon-induced differentiation of human pCTL clones into cytotoxic effector cells, an effect that did not involve blocking of interferon binding (9Chen L. Tourvieille B. Burns G.F. Back F.H. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Bensussan A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The function of this antigen is not known, but a possible role in transmembrane signaling was suggested with the identification of apparently the same glycoprotein antigen on the surface of platelets (10Scott J.L. Dunn S.M. Jin B. Hillam A.J. Walton S. Berndt M.C. Murray A.B. Krissansen G.W. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13475-13482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LeoA1 mAb directly induced persistent platelet aggregation independent of granule secretion in an Fc receptor-dependent process thought to involve the activation of protein kinase C, and during activation the platelet antigen, termed platelet and T cell antigen 1 (PTA1), itself became phosphorylated (10Scott J.L. Dunn S.M. Jin B. Hillam A.J. Walton S. Berndt M.C. Murray A.B. Krissansen G.W. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13475-13482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zuzel M. Walton S.

Platelets. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a previous study we demonstrated that the expression of TLiSA1 on the surface of mixed lymphocyte culture or PHA-generated T cell blasts could be regulated with cytokines (8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen expression was up-regulated with added interleukin-2 or tumor necrosis factor α, and down-regulated with transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 (8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, Ranges et al. (13Ranges G.E. Figari I.S. Espevik J. Palladino M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) have reported that TGFβ1, added from the beginning of mixed lymphocyte culture, inhibited the development of murine CTL, a finding confirmed with human T cells in our study (8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of TGFβ1 was partially reversed by the addition of tumor necrosis factor α (8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ranges G.E. Figari I.S. Espevik J. Palladino M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and it was also found that this cytokine prevented the suppressive effect of TGFβ1 on TLiSA1 expression (8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of further studies to investigate the mechanism of such regulation, we made the unexpected finding that phorbol ester (TPA) up-regulated TLiSA1 surface expression, but this effect of TPA on Jurkat cells was abolished by co-induction with the calcium ionophore, A23187. Because the dual signal of TPA plus ionophore is an absolute requirement for the transcriptional activation of interleukin-2 and is necessary for interleukin-2-dependent T cell proliferation (1Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), whereas phorbol ester used alone can induce growth arrest and differentiation of HL60 cells and also the differentiation of sensitized splenic T cells into CTL effector cells (14Nathan C.F. Brukner L.H. Silverstein S.C. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 84-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 15Munger W.E. Lindquist R.R. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 5023-5029PubMed Google Scholar), such unusual regulation of expression may be of significance for the functional role of TLiSA1. Clearly, further understanding of the function of TLiSA1 requires knowledge of its primary structure, its regulation of expression, and its relationship to PTA1 of platelets. In this report we show that the structure of TLiSA1 predicted from cDNA cloning is that of an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) member, related to other IgSF members with adhesive function but with the unusual structure of two V domains and no C domains. The antigenic identity between TLiSA1 and PTA1 is confirmed with a mAb raised against the platelet protein and substantiated by extensive peptide sequencing of the PTA1 molecule and nucleotide sequencing of the platelet mRNA. Together, these data strongly suggest that TLiSA1/PTA1 is a signaling molecule, likely triggered by engagement of an extracellular ligand or cellular counter receptor. Intriguingly, the unusual regulation of expression of TLiSA1 antigen on the surface of stimulated Jurkat cells is shown to occur at the transcriptional level; TLiSA1 mRNA is induced with the phorbol ester, TPA, but this induction is abrogated or greatly reduced with the combined signal of TPA plus ionophore. However, the effect of ionophore does not appear to be mediated through calcineurin because it is not reversed in the presence of FK506. These results may facilitate further understanding of the processes involved in CTL differentiation. The preparation and specificity of the LeoA1 mAb against TLiSA1 have been described previously (7Burns G.F. Triglia T. Werkmeister J.A. Begley C.G. Boyd A.W. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The second generation anti-PTA1 mAb, NEWE1, was prepared by standard fusion techniques after immunizing BALB/c mice with immunopurified platelet PTA1 antigen. Antigen purification using LeoA1 mAb coupled to Sepharose CL-4B was by a batch procedure from platelet lysate as described (10Scott J.L. Dunn S.M. Jin B. Hillam A.J. Walton S. Berndt M.C. Murray A.B. Krissansen G.W. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13475-13482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified PTA1 antigen. After subcloning the mAb was purified from ascites fluid by DEAE chromatography and NEWE1 was typed as IgG1κ. Phorbol ester, TPA, A23187, biotinamidocaproae N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, lactoperoxidase, apyrase, prostaglandin E1, 2-mercaptoethanol, neuraminidase, and the detergent Nonidet P-40 were purchased from Sigma, and PHA was from Wellcome (Dartford, UK). Nitrocellulose for immunoblotting was from Sartorious (Goettingen, Germany). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were from NEN Life Science Products. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Na125I was purchased from Australian Radioisotopes (Sydney, Australia). Streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase and hyperfilm-MP were from Amersham Corp. All other chemicals were from Ajax Chemicals (Auburn, Australia) or BDH (Kilsyth, Australia). FK506 was kindly donated by the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company (Osaka, Japan). The c-myc and c-juncDNA were provided by Dr. Suzannae Cory (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). PHA-T lymphoblasts were generated by culturing freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 3–10 days in the presence of 2 μg/ml PHA in tonsil-conditioned medium. Tonsil-conditioned medium was prepared by culturing single cell suspensions of tonsil and teasing freshly isolated tissue through a wire mesh in tissue culture medium containing 5 μg/ml PHA for 18 h. Tonsil-conditioned medium was recovered by centrifugation at 350 × g for 5 min, filter sterilized, and stored at −20 °C. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium (Cytosystems, Sydney, Australia) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Washington, DC), 1% glutamine, 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 μ/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in air. Prior to stimulation, Jurkat cells in the logarithmic growth phase or PHA blasts prepared as above were harvested, washed, and resuspended to 2–5 × 106cells/ml. Unless stated otherwise, the phorbol ester, TPA, was added at 50 ng/ml, PHA at 2 μg/ml, ionophore A23187 at 0.3 μm, and FK506 at 10 ng/ml, and where combinations were used these were added together at the same concentrations as above. Except in time-course experiments, the cells were treated for 12 h before harvest for binding assays or Northern blot analysis. The binding of 125I-LeoA1 antibody to resting and pharmacologically activated PHA-induced blasts and Jurkat cells was assessed as described (8Jin B. Scott J.L. Vada S.M.A. Burns G.F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of the data was performed using a LIGAND and EBDA program modified for microcomputers. TLiSA1 cDNA was inserted into the XbaI site of the EF-BOS expression vector (16Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) and used to transfect by electroporation COS-7 epithelial and unstimulated Jurkat T cells. At 72 h post-transfection cells were harvested and stained with LeoA1 mAb and analyzed for TLiSA1 expression on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Cells transfected with EF-BOS vector alone were used as a control. Fresh human platelets from consenting adult donors were isolated from 3.13% sodium citrate anticoagulated venous forearm blood (1:9 v/v) collected through a 19 G needle after discarding the initial 10 ml of the transfusion. The whole blood samples were spun at 120 × g for 10 min to prepare platelet-rich plasma. Prostaglandin E1 (1 μm) was added to the platelet-rich plasma, and the platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 15 min. Platelet pellets were washed in buffer A (138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) plus 2 μm prostaglandin E1 and 0.2 units/ml apyrase before resuspension into phosphate-buffered saline for subsequent surface iodination. Jurkat cells were prepared as described above and stimulated with TPA for 12 h prior to harvest. Surface proteins on platelets and Jurkat cells were labeled using lactoperoxidase catalyzed iodination as described previously (10Scott J.L. Dunn S.M. Jin B. Hillam A.J. Walton S. Berndt M.C. Murray A.B. Krissansen G.W. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13475-13482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following labeling, cells and platelets were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mmiodoacetamide, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) for 60 min on ice. COS-7 and unstimulated Jurkat cells transfected with either TLiSA1 cDNA in pEF-BOS or with pEF-BOS vector alone were surface labeled by biotinylation. Briefly, 2.107 transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended into 3.0 ml of borate buffer (10 mmNa2B4O7, pH 8.8, 150 mmNaCl). Biotinamidocaproae N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was added to 50 μg/ml, and the cells stood at room temperature for 15 min. Ammonium chloride was added to 10 mm to stop the reaction, and the cells were washed in buffer A before lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 60 min on ice. After lysis whole cell lysates were spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Soluble lysates were precleared with rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled to Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Antigen was precipitated by addition of a primary precipitating mAb to the precleared lysate. Immunoprecipitation was completed by the addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG Sepharose-4B beads 30 min prior to completion of the procedure. All antigen-bead conjugates were washed with two consecutive cycles of RIPA buffer 1 (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS) and RIPA buffer 2(25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Tritox X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate) before analysis of SDS-PAGE. Biotinylated samples were additionally electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose for visualization. Radiolabeled and biotinylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Radiolabeled PTA1 antigen to be treated with neuraminidase was eluted from Sepharose beads in 0.1% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and dithiothreitol added to a concentration of 1 mm. Nonidet P-40 was added to 19%, and PTA1 protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were then solubilized by boiling in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, diluted to 500 μl with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2% CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and digested with 100 milliunits neuraminidase for 4 h at 37 °C. A further 100 milliunits of neuraminidase was added, and the digestion continued for an additional 12 h. Prior to analysis by O'Farrell two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the digested protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in sample buffer. Modified PTA1 antigen was visualized by autoradiography. PTA1 antigen from platelets was purified by affinity chromatography of platelet lysate in a batch procedure with LeoA1 mAb directly coupled to Sepharose 4B beads as described previously (10Scott J.L. Dunn S.M. Jin B. Hillam A.J. Walton S. Berndt M.C. Murray A.B. Krissansen G.W. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13475-13482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the amino-terminal sequence, purified antigen (5 μg/track) was electroblotted from an 11–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in a transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 10 mm glycine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was visualized by staining with 0.2% Amido Black and excised, and the amino-terminal sequence was determined as described (17Aebersold R.H. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4229-4238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The internal amino acid sequence of purified platelet PTA1 antigen was obtained similarly (18Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J.

A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) except that the protein was analyzed by nongradient SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.1% SDS. A cDNA library prepared from the Jurkat T cell line in the vector pCDM8 was expressed in COS-7 cells and screened by panning with the monoclonal antibody LeoA1 (7Burns G.F. Triglia T. Werkmeister J.A. Begley C.G. Boyd A.W. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as described previously (19Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 20Simmons D.L. Satterthwaite A.B. Tenen D.G. Seed B. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 267-271PubMed Google Scholar). Episomal DNA was recovered from the selected cells by the Hirt procedure and transformed into Escherichia coli MC1061/p3 (19Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 20Simmons D.L. Satterthwaite A.B. Tenen D.G. Seed B. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 267-271PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA insert of approximately 1.4 kilobases was subcloned from the recovered pCDM8 into pBluescript for sequencing by dideoxy chain termination (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (Amersham Corp.). The clone was restriction mapped, and specific fragments plus randomly selected HaeIII and Sau3A1 fragments were subcloned and sequenced in both orientations with multiple coverage. Oligonucleotides were designed from relevant regions of the sequence during compilation, and these were used as sequencing primers to close gaps along with automated sequencing. mRNA was purified from platelets, prepared as described above, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline using oligo(dT)-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, UK) after lysis with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 280 mm NaCl, 10 mm Kcl, 2% Nonidet P-40. The beads were recovered, and the mRNA was reverse transcribed in situ with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and then subjected to 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase (Promega) and oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides −66 to −42 and 1084 to 1108 of the sequence as shown in Fig. 1 A. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into pTAg (Ingenius) and sequenced as above. The sequences were assembled using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis package (22Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). Homology searches of sequence data bases were made with the BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar) for protein sequences and FASTA (24Pearson W. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar) for nucleic acids. Sequence alignments and structural predictions were made using the facilities of either the GCG program (22Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Madison, WI.Google Scholar) or the UK human genome mapping project on-line computing service (25Rysavy F.R. Bishop M.J. Gibbs G.P. Williams G.W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were treated for varying lengths of time with either TPA alone, a combination of either TPA and A23187 or a combination of TPA, A23187, and FK506, and total RNA isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction as described previously (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). RNA was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde slab gel and transferred in 20 × SSC to Hybond N (Amersham Corp.) membrane. Following UV-cross-linking and baking at 80 °C for 2 h, RNA filters were incubated in prehybridization/hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, and 100 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA (Promega Corp.) for 2–6 h at 42 °C. Filters were incubated for 12 h at 42 °C in the presence of TLiSA1 cDNA radiolabeled overnight at room temperature using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and then added to the prehybridization/hybridization solution. Following the 12-h incubation filters were washed at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30–60 min in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Following autoradiography the filters were reprobed for c-myc, c-jun, and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Immunoscreening a T cell cDNA library transiently expressed in COS-7 cells with the mAb LeoA1 resulted in the isolation of a plasmid containing a 1.4-kilobase insert (pCDM8-TLiSA1) (Fig. 1). COS-7 cells, unstimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2), and C32 melanoma cells (data not shown) transfected with this cDNA, in the EF-BOS expression vector (16Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar), bound to the mAb LeoA1, providing confirmation of its origin. The smaller than expected size of the antigen immunoprecipitated from transfected COS cells (Fig. 2) may reflect glycosylation differences between the cell types. The sequence of the cDNA was determined after subcloning in pBluescript (Fig. 1 A). The presence of the amino-terminal peptide sequence and the internal peptides derived from protein microsequencing, see below (Table I), within the predicted protein sequence, provided additional evidence that the cDNA encodes the TLiSA1/PTA1 protein. Translation of the derived cDNA sequence in all six possible reading frames revealed an open reading frame of 336 amino acids from nucleotide positions 1 to 1008 (Fig. 1 A).Table IAmino acid sequence of PTA1 antigen purified from plateletsAmino terminus1-aPTA1 antigen was affinity purified from platelets and sequenced as described previously (10).

Their substitution with lysine residues markedly decreased aminotransferase activity. Thekcat values with l-aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate as substrates under steady-state conditions at 25 °C were 0.5, 2.0, and 0.03 s−1 for the R292K, R386K, and R292K/R386K mutations, respectively, kcat of the wild-type enzyme being 220 s−1. Longer dicarboxylic substrates did not compensate for the shorter side chain of the lysine residues. Consistent with the different roles of Arg292 and Arg386 in substrate binding, the effects of their substitution on the activity toward long chain monocarboxylic (norleucine/2-oxocaproic acid) and aromatic substrates diverged. Whereas the R292K mutation did not impair the aminotransferase activity toward these substrates, the effect of the R386K substitution was similar to that on the activity toward dicarboxylic substrates. All three mutant enzymes catalyzed as side reactions the β-decarboxylation of l-aspartate and the racemization of amino acids at faster rates than the wild-type enzyme. The changes in reaction specificity were most pronounced in aspartate aminotransferase R292K, which decarboxylated l-aspartate tol-alanine 15 times faster (kcat = 0.002 s−1) than the wild-type enzyme. The rates of racemization of l-aspartate, l-glutamate, andl-alanine were 3, 5, and 2 times, respectively, faster than with the wild-type enzyme. Thus, Arg → Lys substitutions in the active site of aspartate aminotransferase decrease aminotransferase activity but increase other pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent catalytic activities. Apparently, the reaction specificity of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes is not only achieved by accelerating the specific reaction but also by preventing potential side reactions of the coenzyme substrate adduct.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) constitute a few families of evolutionarily related enzymes (2Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The member enzymes of such a family use the same protein scaffold to catalyze quite diverse reactions. Apparently, subtle structural differences underlie their catalytic specificity.Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) is probably the most extensively studied PLP-containing enzyme. It catalyzes the reversible transamination of the dicarboxylic l-amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, and the corresponding 2-oxo acids, oxalacetate and 2-oxoglutarate. During the catalytic cycle, the cofactor shuttles between the PLP and the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) forms. High resolution x-ray crystallographic analyses (3Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C.

Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have elucidated the role of several active-site residues. The specificity for dicarboxylic amino acids appears to be based mainly on two active-site arginine residues (Fig. 1). Arg386 of the small domain binds the α-carboxylate group of the substrate, and Arg292 of the large domain of the adjacent subunit interacts with the distal carboxylate group. The spatial orientation of these key residues is determined by steric constraints and polar interactions. The van der Waals contacts of the guanidino nitrogens of Arg386 with the side chain carbonyl of Asn194and the aromatic ring of Phe360 effectively delimit the conformational space available to Arg386. The guanidino nitrogens of Arg292 are within hydrogen bonding distance from the carboxylate group of Asp15, the side chain amide of Asn142, and the hydroxy group of Ser296 of the adjacent subunit. The side chain of Arg292 is thus maintained in an extended configuration, which favors interaction with the distal carboxylate group of the incoming substrate (15Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. 3. Wiley, New York1987: 187-285Google Scholar, 12Almo S.C. Smith D.L. Danishefsky A.T. Ringe D. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Arg386 is invariant in all known aminotransferase sequences. Arg292 is conserved in most AspAT sequences, and other aminotransferases have variable residues at position 292 (16Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).In an attempt to explore the mechanisms responsible for the reaction specificity of AspAT, we re-engineered the substrate-binding site of the enzyme by substituting the substrate-binding Arg292 and Arg386 with lysine residues. This conservative substitution was expected not to abolish the catalytic apparatus of the enzyme, but to alter the electron repartition and certain bond angles in the coenzyme-substrate adduct, both important determinants of catalytic specificity.DISCUSSIONArg → Lys substitutions are generally considered conservative alterations in protein structure. In AspAT R292K, AspAT R386K, and the double-mutant enzyme, absorption and CD spectra as well as determination of the pKa ′value of the internal aldimine indeed did not reveal changes in the active-site geometry. Nevertheless, both single mutations reduced the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for transamination of C4 and C5 dicarboxylic substrates by at least 3 orders of magnitude (Table I). Similar results with AspAT R386K have been reported previously (7Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Inoue K. Kagamiyama H. Hiromi K. Tanase S. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9673-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2Hayashi, H., Kuramitsu, S., Inoue, Y., Tanase, S., Morino, Y., and Kagamiyama, H. (1989) Posters 357 and 358 presented at Protein Engineering '89, August 20–25, (1989) (Protein Eng. 2, 357–358). A decrease by 6 orders of magnitude was brought about by the double mutation. Substitution of Arg292 with aspartate (26Cronin C.N. Kirsch J.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), valine, and leucine (27Hayashi H. Kuramitsu S. Inoue Y. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has been found to have the same effect. Replacement of Arg386with tyrosine, phenylalanine (8Danishefsky A.T. Onuffer J.J. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1980-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or alanine (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J.

Thus, irrespective of whether Arg292 or Arg386 is substituted and irrespective of the nature of the new side chain, the catalytic efficiency is decreased by at least 3 orders of magnitude.On the basis of chemical modification studies, it was suggested early on that anionic substrates of enzymes are bound by arginine residues (28Riordan J.F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13451-13462Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) has confirmed this prediction. The preference for arginine in AspAT and many other enzymes may be explained by the peculiar strength of the guanidinium-carboxylate interaction due to the resonance-stabilized ion pair underlying the two hydrogen bonds that can be formed (30Hwang J-K. Warshel A. Nature. 1988; 334: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Mitchell J.B.O. Thornton J.M. Singh J. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, arginine is a poor proton donor because of resonance stabilization and hence would probably not function as a general acid catalyst. Evolutionary selection of arginine thus minimizes nonspecific hydrolysis of substrates (28Riordan J.F. McElvany K.D. Borders Jr., C.L. Science. 1977; 195: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The greater number of possible hydrogen bonds not only with carboxylate groups of the substrates but also with other polar active-site residues endows the guanidinium-carboxylate interaction with a more strictly defined geometry than could be achieved with lysine. The crucial role of arginine-carboxylate interactions, both for substrate binding and efficient catalysis, is borne out by our results.Wild-type AspAT shows an inverse relationship betweenkcat/Km values and the side chain length of dicarboxylic amino acids (Table I), as has also been shown in another study (32Onuffer J.J. Ton B.T. Klement I. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The side chain of lysine is shorter than that of arginine, the Cα–N distance being 5.64 and 6.50 Å, respectively. However, the Arg → Lys substitution cannot be compensated by longer dicarboxylic substrates. Neither of the substituted arginine residues directly participates in the covalency changes catalyzed by AspAT. Apparently, the loss in enzymic activity is due to modes of binding of the substrates that do not allow the catalytic apparatus to become fully effective. Indeed, all Arg → Lys mutant AspATs show a decrease in catalytic competence with increasing length of the dicarboxylic substrates, although the binding of dicarboxylic reversible inhibitors is independent of their length (Table IV). Arginine residues that are responsible for the formation of catalytically competent enzyme-substrate complexes and cannot be replaced by lysine without substantial loss in catalytic activity have also been found in enzymes other than AspAT (33Hart W.H. Clarke A.R. Wigley D.B. Waldman A.D.B. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Jones J.B. Holbrook J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Yan H.

Arg292 binds the distal carboxylate group of dicarboxylic substrates, and its substitution hardly impairs the catalytic competence toward monocarboxylic and aromatic substrates. In contrast, substitution of Arg386, which binds the proximal carboxylate group, decreases the activity toward all types of substrates (Tables I and III).The introduction of a lysine residue at position 292, which is situated on the re face of the coenzyme-substrate adduct (Fig. 1), increases the rate of racemization of l-aspartate,l-glutamate, and l-alanine 2–3-fold (Table II). A somewhat greater effect was observed when Trp140 on the re face of PLP was replaced by histidine (Table V; Ref. 13Vacca R.A. Christen P. Malashkevich V.N. Jansonius J.N. Sandmeier E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reprotonation of the coenzyme-substrate adduct at Cα from the reinstead of the si side is a rare event in wild-type AspAT due to the absence of polar residues at the re face and to the almost total exclusion of water in the closed conformation of the substrate-liganded enzyme (24Kochhar S.

Open table in a new tab The R292K mutation increases not only the racemase activity but also enhances the l-aspartate β-decarboxylase activity 15-fold in comparison with the wild-type enzyme (Table II). For efficient β-decarboxylation, a proton donor has to operate in close proximity to the position of the leaving carboxylic group (25Gallagher T. Snell E.E. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12737-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accelerated β-decarboxylation observed with AspAT R292K may be explained, at least in part, by the presence of Lys292, which is a much better proton donor than arginine and might, assisted by an intervening water molecule, protonate the carbanion intermediate 5(Scheme FS1) produced by β-decarboxylation. The reaction pathways of transamination, β-decarboxylation, and racemization diverge only after deprotonation at Cα of the external aldimine 2 has formed the quinonoid intermediate 3. In transamination, reprotonation of this intermediate at C4′ produces the ketimine intermediate 4. In the wild-type enzyme, despite its much higher transaminase activity, both removal of CO2from Cβ and reprotonation at Cα from there side to give the aldimine intermediate 6 are slower than in the mutant enzymes.Figure FS1Intermediates in the reactions of aspartate catalyzed by wild-type and mutant AspATs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conclusion, neither of the two substrate-binding arginine residues of E. coli AspAT can be replaced by lysine without a marked decrease in the affinity for dicarboxylic substrates and an even larger decrease in the catalytic activity toward these substrates. The exact positioning of the substrate moiety, the additional hydrogen bonds of the guanidinium group to other active-site residues, and the specific electrostatic potential due to the guanidinium groups are all factors that conceivably contribute to efficient catalysis. The present data and earlier results (Table V) provide unequivocal experimental evidence that the reaction specificity of PLP-dependent enzymes is not only achieved by accelerating the specific reaction but also by preventing the occurrence of potential side reactions. Most changes in the delicately poised catalytic machinery of AspAT have indeed resulted not only in a decrease in rate of the specific reaction,i.e. transamination, but also in an acceleration of the side reactions, i.e. β-decarboxylation and racemization.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) constitute a few families of evolutionarily related enzymes (2Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The member enzymes of such a family use the same protein scaffold to catalyze quite diverse reactions. Apparently, subtle structural differences underlie their catalytic specificity. Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) is probably the most extensively studied PLP-containing enzyme. It catalyzes the reversible transamination of the dicarboxylic l-amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, and the corresponding 2-oxo acids, oxalacetate and 2-oxoglutarate. During the catalytic cycle, the cofactor shuttles between the PLP and the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) forms. High resolution x-ray crystallographic analyses (3Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C.

Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have elucidated the role of several active-site residues. The specificity for dicarboxylic amino acids appears to be based mainly on two active-site arginine residues (Fig. 1). Arg386 of the small domain binds the α-carboxylate group of the substrate, and Arg292 of the large domain of the adjacent subunit interacts with the distal carboxylate group. The spatial orientation of these key residues is determined by steric constraints and polar interactions. The van der Waals contacts of the guanidino nitrogens of Arg386 with the side chain carbonyl of Asn194and the aromatic ring of Phe360 effectively delimit the conformational space available to Arg386. The guanidino nitrogens of Arg292 are within hydrogen bonding distance from the carboxylate group of Asp15, the side chain amide of Asn142, and the hydroxy group of Ser296 of the adjacent subunit. The side chain of Arg292 is thus maintained in an extended configuration, which favors interaction with the distal carboxylate group of the incoming substrate (15Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. 3. Wiley, New York1987: 187-285Google Scholar, 12Almo S.C. Smith D.L. Danishefsky A.T. Ringe D. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Arg386 is invariant in all known aminotransferase sequences. Arg292 is conserved in most AspAT sequences, and other aminotransferases have variable residues at position 292 (16Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In an attempt to explore the mechanisms responsible for the reaction specificity of AspAT, we re-engineered the substrate-binding site of the enzyme by substituting the substrate-binding Arg292 and Arg386 with lysine residues. This conservative substitution was expected not to abolish the catalytic apparatus of the enzyme, but to alter the electron repartition and certain bond angles in the coenzyme-substrate adduct, both important determinants of catalytic specificity. DISCUSSIONArg → Lys substitutions are generally considered conservative alterations in protein structure. In AspAT R292K, AspAT R386K, and the double-mutant enzyme, absorption and CD spectra as well as determination of the pKa ′value of the internal aldimine indeed did not reveal changes in the active-site geometry. Nevertheless, both single mutations reduced the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for transamination of C4 and C5 dicarboxylic substrates by at least 3 orders of magnitude (Table I). Similar results with AspAT R386K have been reported previously (7Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Inoue K. Kagamiyama H. Hiromi K. Tanase S. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9673-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2Hayashi, H., Kuramitsu, S., Inoue, Y., Tanase, S., Morino, Y., and Kagamiyama, H. (1989) Posters 357 and 358 presented at Protein Engineering '89, August 20–25, (1989) (Protein Eng. 2, 357–358). A decrease by 6 orders of magnitude was brought about by the double mutation. Substitution of Arg292 with aspartate (26Cronin C.N. Kirsch J.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), valine, and leucine (27Hayashi H. Kuramitsu S. Inoue Y. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has been found to have the same effect. Replacement of Arg386with tyrosine, phenylalanine (8Danishefsky A.T. Onuffer J.J. Petsko G.A. Ringe D.

The present data and earlier results (Table V) provide unequivocal experimental evidence that the reaction specificity of PLP-dependent enzymes is not only achieved by accelerating the specific reaction but also by preventing the occurrence of potential side reactions. Most changes in the delicately poised catalytic machinery of AspAT have indeed resulted not only in a decrease in rate of the specific reaction,i.e. transamination, but also in an acceleration of the side reactions, i.e. β-decarboxylation and racemization. Arg → Lys substitutions are generally considered conservative alterations in protein structure. In AspAT R292K, AspAT R386K, and the double-mutant enzyme, absorption and CD spectra as well as determination of the pKa ′value of the internal aldimine indeed did not reveal changes in the active-site geometry. Nevertheless, both single mutations reduced the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for transamination of C4 and C5 dicarboxylic substrates by at least 3 orders of magnitude (Table I). Similar results with AspAT R386K have been reported previously (7Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Inoue K. Kagamiyama H. Hiromi K. Tanase S. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9673-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2Hayashi, H., Kuramitsu, S., Inoue, Y., Tanase, S., Morino, Y., and Kagamiyama, H. (1989) Posters 357 and 358 presented at Protein Engineering '89, August 20–25, (1989) (Protein Eng. 2, 357–358). A decrease by 6 orders of magnitude was brought about by the double mutation. Substitution of Arg292 with aspartate (26Cronin C.N. Kirsch J.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), valine, and leucine (27Hayashi H. Kuramitsu S. Inoue Y. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has been found to have the same effect. Replacement of Arg386with tyrosine, phenylalanine (8Danishefsky A.T. Onuffer J.J. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1980-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or alanine (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reduced the catalytic efficiency by 4 orders of magnitude. Thus, irrespective of whether Arg292 or Arg386 is substituted and irrespective of the nature of the new side chain, the catalytic efficiency is decreased by at least 3 orders of magnitude. On the basis of chemical modification studies, it was suggested early on that anionic substrates of enzymes are bound by arginine residues (28Riordan J.F. McElvany K.D. Borders Jr., C.L. Science. 1977; 195: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the case of AspAT, determination of the crystal structure of enzyme-substrate analog complexes (3Kirsch J.F. Eichele G.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13451-13462Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) has confirmed this prediction. The preference for arginine in AspAT and many other enzymes may be explained by the peculiar strength of the guanidinium-carboxylate interaction due to the resonance-stabilized ion pair underlying the two hydrogen bonds that can be formed (30Hwang J-K. Warshel A. Nature. 1988; 334: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Mitchell J.B.O. Thornton J.M. Singh J. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, arginine is a poor proton donor because of resonance stabilization and hence would probably not function as a general acid catalyst. Evolutionary selection of arginine thus minimizes nonspecific hydrolysis of substrates (28Riordan J.F. McElvany K.D. Borders Jr., C.L. Science. 1977; 195: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The greater number of possible hydrogen bonds not only with carboxylate groups of the substrates but also with other polar active-site residues endows the guanidinium-carboxylate interaction with a more strictly defined geometry than could be achieved with lysine. The crucial role of arginine-carboxylate interactions, both for substrate binding and efficient catalysis, is borne out by our results. Wild-type AspAT shows an inverse relationship betweenkcat/Km values and the side chain length of dicarboxylic amino acids (Table I), as has also been shown in another study (32Onuffer J.J. Ton B.T. Klement I. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The side chain of lysine is shorter than that of arginine, the Cα–N distance being 5.64 and 6.50 Å, respectively. However, the Arg → Lys substitution cannot be compensated by longer dicarboxylic substrates. Neither of the substituted arginine residues directly participates in the covalency changes catalyzed by AspAT. Apparently, the loss in enzymic activity is due to modes of binding of the substrates that do not allow the catalytic apparatus to become fully effective. Indeed, all Arg → Lys mutant AspATs show a decrease in catalytic competence with increasing length of the dicarboxylic substrates, although the binding of dicarboxylic reversible inhibitors is independent of their length (Table IV). Arginine residues that are responsible for the formation of catalytically competent enzyme-substrate complexes and cannot be replaced by lysine without substantial loss in catalytic activity have also been found in enzymes other than AspAT (33Hart W.H. Clarke A.R. Wigley D.B. Waldman A.D.B. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Jones J.B. Holbrook J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Yan H.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with the different roles of Arg292 and Arg386 in substrate binding, the effects of their substitution on the activity toward long-chain monocarboxylic (norleucine/2-oxocaproic acid) and aromatic substrates diverge. Arg292 binds the distal carboxylate group of dicarboxylic substrates, and its substitution hardly impairs the catalytic competence toward monocarboxylic and aromatic substrates. In contrast, substitution of Arg386, which binds the proximal carboxylate group, decreases the activity toward all types of substrates (Tables I and III). The introduction of a lysine residue at position 292, which is situated on the re face of the coenzyme-substrate adduct (Fig. 1), increases the rate of racemization of l-aspartate,l-glutamate, and l-alanine 2–3-fold (Table II). A somewhat greater effect was observed when Trp140 on the re face of PLP was replaced by histidine (Table V; Ref. 13Vacca R.A. Christen P. Malashkevich V.N. Jansonius J.N. Sandmeier E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reprotonation of the coenzyme-substrate adduct at Cα from the reinstead of the si side is a rare event in wild-type AspAT due to the absence of polar residues at the re face and to the almost total exclusion of water in the closed conformation of the substrate-liganded enzyme (24Kochhar S. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Kochhar S. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the R292K substitution interferes with the substrate-induced closure of the active site. The R292K mutation increases not only the racemase activity but also enhances the l-aspartate β-decarboxylase activity 15-fold in comparison with the wild-type enzyme (Table II). For efficient β-decarboxylation, a proton donor has to operate in close proximity to the position of the leaving carboxylic group (25Gallagher T. Snell E.E. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12737-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accelerated β-decarboxylation observed with AspAT R292K may be explained, at least in part, by the presence of Lys292, which is a much better proton donor than arginine and might, assisted by an intervening water molecule, protonate the carbanion intermediate 5(Scheme FS1) produced by β-decarboxylation. The reaction pathways of transamination, β-decarboxylation, and racemization diverge only after deprotonation at Cα of the external aldimine 2 has formed the quinonoid intermediate 3. In transamination, reprotonation of this intermediate at C4′ produces the ketimine intermediate 4. In the wild-type enzyme, despite its much higher transaminase activity, both removal of CO2from Cβ and reprotonation at Cα from there side to give the aldimine intermediate 6 are slower than in the mutant enzymes. In conclusion, neither of the two substrate-binding arginine residues of E. coli AspAT can be replaced by lysine without a marked decrease in the affinity for dicarboxylic substrates and an even larger decrease in the catalytic activity toward these substrates. The exact positioning of the substrate moiety, the additional hydrogen bonds of the guanidinium group to other active-site residues, and the specific electrostatic potential due to the guanidinium groups are all factors that conceivably contribute to efficient catalysis.

The light chain of factor X consists of an NH2-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, followed by a few helical hydrophobic residues and the two epidermal growth factor-like domains, whereas the heavy chain contains the serine protease domain. In this study, native factor X was found to contain three classes of Ca2+-binding sites: two high affinity (Kd 100 ± 30 μm), four intermediate affinity (Kd 450 ± 70 μm), and five to six low affinity (Kd2 ± 0.2 mm). Decarboxylated factor X in which the Gla residues were converted to Glu retained the two high affinity sites (Kd 140 ± 20 μm). In contrast, factor X lacking the Gla domain as well as a part of the helical hydrophobic residues (des-44-X) retained only one high affinity Ca2+-binding site (Kd 130 ± 20 μm). Moreover, a synthetic peptide composed of residues 238–277 (58–97 in chymotrypsinogen numbering) from the protease domain of factor X bound one Ca2+ with high affinity (Kd 150 ± 20 μm). From competitive inhibition assays for binding of active site-blocked factor Xa to factor Va in the prothrombinase complex, theKd for peptide-Va interaction was calculated to be ∼10 μm as compared with 30 pm for factor Xa and ∼1.5 μm for decarboxylated factor Xa. A peptide containing residues 238–262(58–82) bound Ca2+ with reduced affinity (Kd ∼600 μm) and did not inhibit Xa:Va interaction. In contrast, a peptide containing residues 253–277(73–97) inhibited Xa:Va interaction (Kd ∼10 μm) but did not bind Ca2+. In additional studies, Ca2+ increased the amidolytic activity of native and des-44-Xa toward a tetrapeptide substrate (benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide) by approximately 1.6-fold. The half-maximal increase was observed at ∼150 μm Ca2+ and the effect was primarily on the kcat. Ca2+ also significantly protected cleavage at Arg-332-Gln-333(150–151) in the protease domain autolysis loop.

Factor X is a vitamin K-dependent multidomain protein that participates in the middle phase of blood coagulation (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 10363-10370Crossref Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Factor X is essential for hemostasis since a reduction in its functional activity results in a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder known as Stuart-Prower factor deficiency (2Graham J.B. Barrow E.M. Hougie C. J. Clin. Invest. 1957; 36: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The human protein is synthesized in the liver as a precursor molecule of 488 amino acids (3Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5098-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal 40 amino acids constitute the prepro leader sequence, which is removed prior to secretion of the molecule. Additionally, during biosynthesis, the protein undergoes several posttranslational modifications including glycosylation, γ-carboxylation (of the first 11 glutamic acid residues), β-hydroxylation (of Asp-63), and removal of a tripeptide (Arg-Lys-Arg) between Arg-139 and Ser-143 (3Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5098-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The resulting mature protein is a zymogen of serine protease factor Xa and consists of a light chain (amino acids 1–139) and a heavy chain (amino acids 143–448) held together by a single disulfide bond between Cys-132 and Cys-302.Gene arrangement, amino acid sequence, and modular structure of factor X strongly suggest that the protein is organized into several distinct domains (3Leytus S.P.

In all cases, the activation results from the cleavage of the Arg-194–Ile-195(15–16) bond in the heavy chain of factor X and release of a 52-residue activation peptide; the light chain remains unaltered during this process (3Leytus S.P.

Factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin in the coagulation cascade; for a physiologically significant rate, this reaction requires Ca2+, PL, and factor Va (8Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ plays an important role both in the activation of factor X and in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa.Ca2+ binding to human factor X has been studied by Monroeet al. (9Monroe D.M. Deerfield D.W., II Olson D.L. Stewart T.N. Treanor R.E. Roberts H.R. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 633-640PubMed Google Scholar). The authors reported that the protein contains one high affinity Gla-independent and 19 weak Gla-dependent Ca2+-binding sites (9Monroe D.M. Deerfield D.W., II Olson D.L. Stewart T.N. Treanor R.E. Roberts H.R. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 633-640PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we have extensively investigated the Ca2+-binding properties of native, decarboxylated, and Gla domainless (des-44-X) human factor X. The data strongly indicate that the Gla domain contains four intermediate and five to six low affinity Ca2+-binding sites, whereas the EGF1 and the protease domains each contains one high affinity Ca2+-binding site. Further, proteolysis in the autolysis loop of the catalytic domain results in a virtual loss of amidolytic activity without affecting the S1 binding site. Autolysis loop-cleaved factor Xa (Xaγ) also has ∼10-fold reduced affinity for factor Va. Importantly, Ca2+ protects the proteolytic cleavage in the autolysis loop, thereby stabilizing this domain for maximal biologic activity. An initial account of this work has been presented in abstract form (10Sabharwal A.K. Welsh W.J. Saini R. Gorka J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Blood. 1993; 82 (Abstr. 245): 64aGoogle Scholar).

The resulting mature protein is a zymogen of serine protease factor Xa and consists of a light chain (amino acids 1–139) and a heavy chain (amino acids 143–448) held together by a single disulfide bond between Cys-132 and Cys-302. Gene arrangement, amino acid sequence, and modular structure of factor X strongly suggest that the protein is organized into several distinct domains (3Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W.

The Gla domain is followed by a short hydrophobic stack (residues 40–45) and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (residues 46–84 (EGF1) and residues 85–128 (EGF2)). The amino terminus of the heavy chain of factor X contains the activation peptide region of 52 amino acids (residues 143–194) followed by the serine protease domain of 254 amino acids (residues 195–448), which features the active site triad of His-236(57), 2For comparison, factor X amino acid numbering system has been used.

During physiologic hemostasis, factor X can be activated by factor IXa, requiring Ca2+, phospholipid (PL), and factor VIIIa or factor VIIa requiring Ca2+ and tissue factor (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In all cases, the activation results from the cleavage of the Arg-194–Ile-195(15–16) bond in the heavy chain of factor X and release of a 52-residue activation peptide; the light chain remains unaltered during this process (3Leytus S.P.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Factor Xaα is factor Xa consisting of a light chain (L, amino acids 1–139) and a heavy chain (Hα, amino acids 195–448). Factor Xaβ is factor Xaα lacking the ∼4 kDa fragment from the COOH terminus of the Hα chain. Factor Xaγ is factor Xaβ in which proteolysis has occurred in the autolysis loop in the Hβ chain. Factor Xaβγ is a mixture of factors Xaβ and Xaγ.3The nomenclature used for factor Xa is that of Di Scipio et al. (6Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W.

Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin in the coagulation cascade; for a physiologically significant rate, this reaction requires Ca2+, PL, and factor Va (8Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ plays an important role both in the activation of factor X and in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa. Ca2+ binding to human factor X has been studied by Monroeet al. (9Monroe D.M. Deerfield D.W., II Olson D.L. Stewart T.N. Treanor R.E. Roberts H.R. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 633-640PubMed Google Scholar). The authors reported that the protein contains one high affinity Gla-independent and 19 weak Gla-dependent Ca2+-binding sites (9Monroe D.M. Deerfield D.W., II Olson D.L. Stewart T.N. Treanor R.E. Roberts H.R. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 633-640PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we have extensively investigated the Ca2+-binding properties of native, decarboxylated, and Gla domainless (des-44-X) human factor X. The data strongly indicate that the Gla domain contains four intermediate and five to six low affinity Ca2+-binding sites, whereas the EGF1 and the protease domains each contains one high affinity Ca2+-binding site. Further, proteolysis in the autolysis loop of the catalytic domain results in a virtual loss of amidolytic activity without affecting the S1 binding site. Autolysis loop-cleaved factor Xa (Xaγ) also has ∼10-fold reduced affinity for factor Va. Importantly, Ca2+ protects the proteolytic cleavage in the autolysis loop, thereby stabilizing this domain for maximal biologic activity. An initial account of this work has been presented in abstract form (10Sabharwal A.K. Welsh W.J. Saini R. Gorka J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Blood. 1993; 82 (Abstr. 245): 64aGoogle Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2060174475,"The oxidation of heme to biliverdin IXα by heme oxygenase involves regiospecific α-meso-hydroxylation followed by extrusion of the α-meso-carbon as CO. In an earlier study, enzymatic oxidation of the fourmeso-methylmesoheme isomers suggested that the reaction regiospecificity is sensitive to the electronic properties of themeso-methyl group (Torpey, J. W., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26067–26073), although we could not exclude the possibility that the altered reaction regiochemistry was due to perturbation of the porphyrin structure by the meso-substituent. To examine this possibility, we have synthesized the fourmeso-formylmesoporphyrin isomers and have examined their oxidation by heme oxygenase. The meso-formyl andmeso-methyl substituents differ in that the former is electron withdrawing and the latter is electron donating. In contrast to α-meso-methylmesoheme, which is exclusively oxidized at the methyl-substituted position, α-meso-formylmesoheme is exclusively oxidized at a non-formyl-substitutedmeso-carbon. The finding that the methyl and formyl groups channel the reaction regiospecificity in opposite directions establishes that the regiochemistry of the heme oxygenase reaction is primarily under electronic rather than steric control. It also confirms that the oxidation involves electrophilic addition of the oxygen to the porphyrin ring.

Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, a powerful antioxidant that is highly lipophilic and, under conditions of impaired excretion, can reach concentrations at which it becomes neurotoxic (1Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 203-266Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide, the second product of the heme oxygenase reaction, is a putative physiological messenger akin to nitric oxide (2Verma A.

Human HO-1, a 32-kDa protein, is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum via a C-terminal lipophilic domain (5Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Müller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Removal of the 23 C-terminal amino acids by mutation of the cDNA coding for the protein, followed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, yields a truncated human HO-1 (hHO-1) that is both soluble and fully active (6Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An active and soluble rat heme oxygenase without the 26 C-terminal amino acids and with mutations in the last two amino acids (S262R,S263L) has been independently reported (7Ishikawa K. Sato M. Ito M. Yoshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The first step of the reaction catalyzed by heme oxygenase is the NADPH-, cytochrome P-450-reductase-, and O2-dependent oxidation of heme to α-meso-hydroxyheme (see Fig. 1) (8Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reaction that results in extrusion of the hydroxylated α-meso-carbon as CO with the concomitant formation of verdoheme (Fig. 1). Finally, in the third step, heme oxygenase catalyzes the formation of biliverdin from verdoheme in a reaction that also requires NADPH, cytochrome P-450 reductase, and O2 (10Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Yoshida T. Noguchi M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 96: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The heme oxygenase reaction is highly regiospecific and exclusively produces biliverdin IXα, the isomer resulting from oxidation of the α-meso-carbon (13Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The central role of α-meso-hydroxylation in the oxidation of heme by heme oxygenase led us earlier to synthesize the four possible meso-methylmesoheme isomers and to examine their enzyme-catalyzed oxidation (14Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, α-meso-methylmesoheme is still oxidized to mesobiliverdin IXα. The reaction does not result in the formation of CO, however, in accord with the fact that normal α-meso-hydroxylation is impossible due to the presence of the methyl substituent. Equally surprising was the finding that γ-meso-methylmesoheme, despite the presence of an unsubstituted α-meso position, is oxidized exclusively at the γ-meso position to give γ-mesobiliverdin (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). δ-meso-Methylmesoheme was similarly oxidized at the δ-meso position to give δ-mesobiliverdin, but oxidation at the unsubstituted meso positions to give a mixture of methyl-substituted biliverdin isomers was also observed. The finding that the electron donating methyl group enhances reaction at the substituted carbon suggests that the oxidation reaction involves electrophilic addition of the activated oxygen to the mesocarbon. An electrophilic oxidation mechanism is also suggested by the earlier finding that the oxidation of heme by heme oxygenase in the presence of ethylhydroperoxide rather than NADPH and P-450 reductase produces α-meso-ethoxyheme (16Wilks A. Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results argue that the regiochemistry of the heme oxygenase reaction is controlled not by steric orientation of the oxidizing species as previously suggested (17Brown S.B. Chabot A.A. Enderby E.A. North A.C.T. Nature. 1981; 289: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but rather by changes in the frontier orbital electron density at the meso positions of the heme group. However, the possibility that the effect of the meso-methyl group was due to deformation of the heme structure rather than to an electronic effect could not be excluded. To further test the hypothesis that the regiochemistry of the heme oxygenase reaction is governed by electronic rather than steric effects, we have synthesized the four possible isomers ofmeso-formylmesoheme and examined their oxidation by heme oxygenase. The formyl group is an electron-withdrawing substituent and should exert an effect opposite to that of a methyl group if the reaction regiochemistry is electronically controlled. On the other hand, the effects of the methyl and formyl substituents on the reaction regiochemistry should be parallel if they stem from a deformation of the heme structure or a steric interaction of themeso-substituent with the protein. The finding that the formyl and methyl substituents channel the reaction regiochemistry in opposite directions provides persuasive evidence that the regiochemistry of the heme oxygenase reaction is electronically rather than sterically controlled. Human heme oxygenase truncated of its 23 C-terminal amino acids (hHO-1) was expressed in E. coli and purified as reported (6Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome P-450 reductase was kindly provided by Prof. B. S. S. Masters (University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, TX). Mesoheme was prepared from mesoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT), and the individual meso-formylmesohemes were prepared from the corresponding synthetic meso-formyl mesoporphyrin IX dimethyl esters as described previously (14Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatography was done on silica gel GF (250 micron) plates (Analtech, Newark, DE). HPLC was performed on a Varian 9010 solvent delivery system equipped with a Hewlett Packard 1040A detector and a reverse-phase Whatman analytical (4.6 × 250 mm) Partisil 10-mm ODS-3 column. The mobile phase was either 100% Solvent A (acetone/0.1% aqueous formic acid, 50:50) monitored at 374 nm and referenced at 474 nm or 100% Solvent B (acetonitrile/water/AcOH, 55:40:10) monitored at 404 nm and referenced at 550 nm. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were obtained by (+)LSIMS on a Kratos Concept instrument using a 1:1 (1% trifluoroacetic acid) glycerol-thioglycerol matrix. 1H NMR spectra were measured in deuterated chloroform (porphyrin concentration 3–4 mg/ml) on a General Electric QE 300-MHz instrument. 13C NMR spectra were acquired on the same 300-MHz instrument and are completely decoupled. The meso-formylmesoheme isomers were individually reconstituted into hHO-1 in a 2:1 heme to enzyme ratio, and the resulting mixtures were purified over a Bio-Rad HTP column to give the 1:1 complexes in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (6Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regioisomeric meso-hydroxymethyl mesoporphyrin IX dimethyl esters were synthesized as previously reported (14Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The meso-hydroxymethyl substituent was oxidized to the meso-formyl by dissolving themeso-(hydroxymethyl)-mesoporphyrin IX isomers (α = 16 mg, 25.6 μmol; β = 14 mg, 22.4 μmol; γ = 5 mg, 8.0 μmol; δ = 42 mg, 67.3 μmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 ml) and pyridine (5 ml) containing three equivalents of pyridinium chlorochromate. After standing overnight at room temperature in the dark, the reaction was partitioned between 1.0 n HCl (300 ml) and CH2Cl2 (50 ml). The organic phase was then washed with water (400 ml) and concentrated under vacuum. Thin layer chromatography of the reaction mixture with diethyl ether yielded themeso-formylmesoporphyrin dimethyl ester product (Rf = 0.88). The meso-formyl porphyrins were purified on silica gel columns with hexanes-diethyl ether (30:70) as the eluting solvent. The four isomers were oxidized in the same manner, yielding the α (6.0 mg, 9.6 μmol, 38%), β (9.3 mg, 15.0 μmol, 67%), γ (4.0 mg, 6.4 μmol, 80%), and δ (11 mg, 17.7 μmol, 26%) meso-formylmesoporphyrins. The spectroscopic and analytical data for the isomers are as follows: α isomer, λmax (CH3Cl) 404, 504, 538, 576 nm;1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.69 (t, 2H,J = 7.3 Hz), 1.76 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.23 (t, 4H, J = 6.5 Hz), 3.34 (s, 3H), 3.52 (s, 3H), 3.56 (s, 3H), 3.58 (s, 3H), 3.63 (s, 3H), 3.64 (s, 3H), 3.79 (m, 2H) 3.98 (m, 2H), 4.31 (m, 4H), 9.94 (s, 1H), 10.01 (s, 2H), 12.72 ppm (s, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 11.6, 15.2, 16.0, 16.7, 17.5, 18.5, 19.8, 21.7, 29.7, 36.8, 51.8, 98.4, 113.6, 115.2, 137.9, 138.6, 142.2, 143.1, 143.4, 144.0, 144.1, 145.1, 145.5, 150.2, 173.5, 197.6 ppm; HRMS m/z 622.3163, calculated for C37H42N4O6 622.3155; β isomer, λmax (CH3Cl) 404, 506, 538, 574 nm; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.79 (brd m, 2H),1.81 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.21 (m, 4H), 3.37 (s, 3H), 3.51 (s, 3H), 3.54 (s, 3H), 3.55 (s, 3H), 3.62 (s, 3H), 3.66 (s, 3H), 3.82 (m, 2H), 4.00 (m, 2H), 4.33 (m, 4H), 9.93 (s, 1H), 10.01 (s, 1H), 10.07 (s, 1H), 12.73 ppm (s, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 11.6, 14.1, 17.6, 19.6, 21.7, 22.0, 22.7, 27.4, 31.9, 36.8, 51.7, 97.2, 948.0, 98.5, 113.6, 114.4, 128.7, 135.1, 135.7, 136.2, 138.5, 140.7, 142.0, 142.9, 143.4, 144.7, 146.0, 146.2, 173.5, 174.0, 197.8 ppm; HRMS m/z 622.3149, calculated for C37H42N4O6 622.3155; γ isomer, λmax (CH3Cl) 406, 504, 538, 574 nm; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.81 (t, 6H,J = 9.0 Hz), 2.33 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.11 (brd t, 2H), 3.53 (, 3H), 3.54 (s, 3H), 3.55 (s, 3H), 3.56 (s, 3H), 3.63 (m, 2H), 3.72 (s, 3H), 3.73 (s, 3H), 3.99 (t, 2H,J = 9.0 Hz), 4.12 (t, 2H, J = 9.0 Hz), 4.29 (m, 2H), 9.92 (s, 1H), 10.02 (s, 2H), 12.73 ppm (s, 1H);13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 11.4, 11.9, 17.5, 19.7, 24.4, 29.7, 35.5, 51.8, 98.5, 98.6, 98.8, 136.9, 139.7, 142.9, 143.1, 143.2, 143.8, 145.2, 173.4, 173.5, 196.0 ppm; HRMSm/z 622.3142, calculated for C37H42N4O6 622.3155; δ isomer, λmax 434, 574, 628 (CH3Cl) nm;1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.77 (t, 2H,J = 7.5 Hz), 1.81 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.18 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.24 (t, 2H,J = 7.5 Hz), 3.37 (s, 3H), 3.38 (s, 3H), 3.55 (s, 3H), 3.57 (s, 3H), 3.63 (s, 3H), 3.65 (s, 3H), 3.98 (q, 4H,J = 7.5 Hz), 4.34 (m, 4H), 9.94 (s, 1H), 10.01 (s, 1H), 10.07 (s, 1H), 12.73 ppm (s, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 11.4, 11.5, 16.5, 16.7, 17.5, 19.7, 21.7, 29.7, 36.8, 51.7, 98.1, 98.3, 98.6, 129.2, 133.9, 135.7, 136.6, 138.8, 141.3, 142.4, 142.8, 143.2, 144.1, 144.7, 144.9, 145.3, 173.4, 174.0, 198.1 ppm; HRMS m/z 622.3151, calculated for C37H42N4O6622.3155. P-450 reductase (12 μg, 0.15 nmol) and NADPH (100 nmol) were added to a 1-ml cuvette containing, in a final 1-ml volume, a solution of one of the meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complexes (α-CHO, 0.29 mg, 9.8 nmol; β-CHO, 0.37 mg, 12.2 nmol; γ-CHO, 0.23 mg, 7.8 nmol; and δ-CHO, 0.41 mg, 13.8 nmol) in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The solution was presaturated with CO by bubbling with the gas before addition of the P-450 reductase and NADPH. The progress of the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically by monitoring both the appearance of the Fe(II)mesoverdoheme-CO complex at λmax 616 nm and the loss of the Soret band of the starting complex. H2O2 (one equivalent) was added to a cuvette containing, in a final 1-ml volume, one of the meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complexes (pH 7.4) (α-CHO, 0.27 mg, 9.1 nmol; β-CHO, 0.46 mg, 15.2 nmol; γ-CHO, 0.23 mg, 7.8 nmol; δ-CHO, 0.33 mg, 11.11 nmol) in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer. The progress of the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by the appearance of the Fe(III)mesoverdoheme absorption at 600–700 nm and the decrease in the intensity of the Soret absorbance of the starting complex. P-450 reductase (900 μg, 13.4 nmol) and NADPH (83.3 mg, 120 μmol) were added to a solution of the α-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complex (81.0 mg, 2.7 μmol) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The final incubation volume was 40 ml. The reaction was allowed to stand at 25 °C for 60 min and was then extracted and analyzed as described below. The products formed in the reactions of the other threemeso-formyl isomers were similarly obtained in smaller scale to determine their absorption spectra and HPLC properties. To the α-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 reaction mixture was added concentrated HCl (1 drop) and acetic acid (1 ml) before the solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 ml), and the organic phase was washed with brine (50 ml). The concentrate was dissolved in 100% Solvent A and analyzed by HPLC at a flow rate of 1.0 ml·min−1. The UV-visible absorption spectrum was acquired, and the mesobiliverdin was dissolved in 50 ml of 5% H2SO4 in MeOH (v/v) and left at room temperature for 8 h. The mesobiliverdin dimethyl ester was extracted into the organic phase after adding CHCl3 (50 ml) and water (50 ml), and the organic phase was washed with water (100 ml) and concentrated under vacuum. The electron impact mass spectrum of the α-meso-formylmesobiliverdin dimethyl ester was then determined. To a 1-ml solution of the α-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complex (1.6 mg, 54.0 nmol) was added P-450 reductase (0.24 mg, 3.1 nmol) and NADPH (0.42 mg, 500 nmol). The tube was immediately sealed with a rubber septum. After 15 min at 25 °C, the solution had turned green. By injection with a syringe through a septum, 525 μl of ferrous deoxymyoglobin (0.45 mg, 27 nmol) was added to the α-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 reaction mixture. The solution was shaken, the septum was removed, and the UV-visible spectrum was recorded. The ferrous deoxymyoglobin used to detect CO was prepared by adding sodium dithionite (5 mg) to 2 ml of a solution of horse skeletal muscle myoglobin (1.7 mg, 100 nmol) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). CO assays were similarly performed by sealing the tubes after adding cytochrome P-450 reductase (6.0 μg, 78 pmol) and NADPH (167 μg, 200 nmol) to 1-ml solutions (final volume) of the othermeso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complexes (β-CHO, 0.27 mg, 9.1 nmol; γ-CHO, 0.21 mg, 7.0 nmol; δ-CHO, 0.26 mg, 8.6 nmol). After 5 min at 25 °C, the reactions had turned green, and freshly prepared ferrous deoxymyoglobin (88 μg, 5 nmol) was injected through a septum. The solutions were mixed, the septa were removed, and the UV-visible spectra were recorded. In separate experiments, quantitative CO assays were repeated with 0.5 ml of a solution of the α-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complex (α-CHO = 1.1 mg, 35 nmol) to which were added cytochrome P-450 reductase (0.24 mg, 3.1 nmol) and NADPH (0.42 mg, 500 nmol). The sealed reaction tubes were allowed to stand for 15 min at 25 °C. Freshly prepared ferrous deoxymyoglobin (0.73 mg, 32 nmol) was then injected via syringe, the solutions were mixed, the septa were removed, and the UV-visible spectra were recorded. The four meso-formylmesoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester regioisomers were synthesized by pyridinium chlorochromate oxidation of the corresponding regioisomericmeso-hydroxymethylmesoporphyrin IX dimethyl esters (Fig. 2). Themeso-hydroxymethylmesoporphyrin IX dimethyl esters were obtained by Vilsmeier formylation of the dimethyl ester of copper mesoporphyrin followed by reduction of the formyl to the hydroxymethyl group, as previously reported (14Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Reduction of the formyl to the hydroxymethyl group was required to separate the four regioisomeric products because the alcohols are readily separated by chromatography but the formyl precursors are not. The position of the substitution in each of the meso-hydroxymethyl isomers was established by NMR in the earlier studies (14Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Reoxidation of the separated hydroxymethyl isomers provides the individual, regiochemically defined, meso-formyl isomers. The synthesis of the requisitemeso-formylmesoheme regioisomers is completed by ester hydrolysis and insertion of the iron atom (14Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Incubation of the α-, β-, γ-, and δ-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complexes with NADPH and P-450 reductase under an atmosphere of O2 and CO causes a decrease in the intensity of the Soret band and the accumulation of an intermediate with an absorption maximum at λmax = 616 nm (Fig. 3). The absorption spectrum of the intermediate resembles that of the Fe(II)mesoverdoheme-CO complex formed under similar conditions in incubations of Fe(III)mesoheme with hHO-1 (18Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1981; 90: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Lagarias J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The CO arrests the reaction at the spectroscopically convenient mesoverdoheme stage by chelating to the iron and thus preventing conversion of the mesoverdoheme to the final mesobiliverdin product. The Soret band changes, involving a broadening and decrease in the absorbance maximum with a small shift to lower wavelengths (from 400 to 396 nm), are similar in the reactions of the α- (Fig. 3 A), β- (Fig. 3 B), and δ-meso-formyl (Fig. 3 D) isomers. However, for the γ-formyl isomer, the decrease in the Soret band intensity is associated with a marked red shift from 396 to 424 nm (Fig. 3 C). The reason for the different spectroscopic change observed with the γ-isomer is unclear but may be due to an interaction of the γ-formyl group with the flanking propionic acid side chains. Earlier studies have shown that H2O2 can substitute for O2 and NADPH-P-450 reductase in the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of heme to verdoheme but not in the subsequent conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin (6Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H2O2-dependent reaction can therefore be monitored without adding CO because the reaction is automatically arrested at the Fe(III)mesoverdoheme stage. As shown in Fig. 4, one equivalent of H2O2 similarly supports conversion of themeso-formylmesohemes to mesoverdohemes. For all fourmeso-formyl regioisomers, the reaction with H2O2 brings about a decay in the intensity of the Soret maximum at 400 nm without changing its position. This change is associated with the appearance of a broad absorbance with a maximum at 642 nm. These changes are similar to those reported for the H2O2-dependent oxidation of heme by hHO-1 (6Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regiospecificity of the oxidation of α-meso-formylmesoheme by hHO-1 was examined with the NADPH-P-450 reductase system. For these studies, the incubations were carried out in the absence of exogenous CO, and the final biliverdin product was isolated and characterized by HPLC, absorption spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Oxidation of the α-meso-formylmesoheme by NADPH-P-450 reductase followed by HPLC of the product yields a single broad mesobiliverdin-like peak (Fig. 5). A single product peak with a similar retention time is also obtained when each of the othermeso-formylmesoheme isomers is oxidized by heme oxygenase. However, the HPLC system readily separates the four biliverdin regioisomers derived from heme and the methyl-substituted regioisomers from the unsubstituted mesobiliverdins, but it only partially separates the methyl-substituted mesobiliverdin regioisomers from each other (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because its ability to resolve the meso-formylmesoheme regioisomers has not been independently established, it cannot be inferred from the observation of a single peak in the chromatograms that a single isomer is formed. The HPLC retention times do show, however, that the products are not unsubstituted biliverdins and therefore that the biliverdin products retain the formyl group. The absorption and mass spectra of the product obtained from α-meso-formylmesoheme confirm that it is a mesobiliverdin that retains the α-meso-formyl group. The maxima in the absorption spectrum (λmax 364, 640 nm) are slightly shifted with respect to those of authentic mesobiliverdin IXα (λmax 366, 636) (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the product expected if the α-meso-carbon and the attached formyl group were eliminated in the reaction. The mass spectrum does not give a molecular ion peak but yields fragments that (a) confirm that the product retains the formyl function and (b) tentatively identify the axis along which the molecule fragments. Previous mass spectrometric studies have demonstrated that biliverdins fragment at the meso-carbon directly opposite the site of the original oxidative cleavage when subjected to electron impact ionization (20Bonnett, R., and McDonagh, A. F. (1973) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 881–888.Google Scholar). The two fragments that are formed allow one to distinguish between, for example, biliverdin IXα and biliverdin IXβ but not biliverdin IXα and biliverdin IXγ. When the HPLC-purified mesobiliverdin dimethyl ester obtained from reaction of the α-meso-formylmesoheme-hHO-1 complex with NADPH-P-450 reductase was subjected to electron impact ionization, prominent fragments appeared in the mass spectrum at m/z273 and 370 (Fig. 6). The sum of the two fragments is 643, a value close to that of the mass of the parent mesoformylmesoheme (642), in agreement with the earlier finding that the sum of the fragments gives a value that differs by 1–3 mass units from that of the parent molecule (20Bonnett, R., and McDonagh, A. F. (1973) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 881–888.Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ions are most consistent with fragmentation of the molecule along the β-δ axis to give structures similar to those shown in Fig. 7, although the fragment ion at 370 requires a dehydrogenation of the structure shown in the figure. Dehydrogenation reactions that occur in the ion source have been observed in related molecules (24Lightner D.A. Moscowitz A. Petryka Z.J. Jones S. Weimer M. Davis E. Beach N.A. Watson C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 131: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fragmentation along the β-δ axis indicates that the parent porphyrin is oxidized by heme oxygenase either at the β- or δ-meso carbon. Thus, in contrast to the α-meso-methyl analogue (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), α-meso-formylmesoheme is oxidized at one or more non-formyl-substituted meso positions rather than at the normally favored α-meso carbon.Figure 7Proposed structures for the principal ions observed in the electron impact mass spectrum of the mesobiliverdin isolated from oxidation of α-meso-formylmesoheme by hHO-1, P-450 reductase, and NADPH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The affinity of ferrous deoxymyoglobin for CO has been used to assay the formation of CO in the NADPH-P-450 reductase-dependent oxidation of α-meso-formylmesoheme by hHO-1. The assay is based on the shift of the Soret band of ferrous deoxymyoglobin at 434 nm to that of the CO-complex at 422 nm. Addition of deoxymyoglobin to the incubation mixture after completion of the reaction in a sealed tube resulted in immediate formation of the ferrous myoglobin-CO complex. For technical reasons, a substoichiometric amount (0.90 equivalents) of deoxymyoglobin was added in these studies, and all of the deoxymyoglobin was converted to the ferrous-CO complex. The same results are obtained with unsubstituted mesoheme, the control substrate. In view of our earlier demonstration that oxidation of the substituted position in meso-methylmesohemes does not produce CO (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the extent of CO formation observed must be due to the nearly quantitative oxidation of unsubstituted positions in the α-meso-formylmesoheme. α-meso-Hydroxylation, the first step in the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of heme (Fig. 1), does not proceed normally if a substituent is attached to the α-meso carbon. Earlier studies demonstrated that α-meso-methylmesoheme, despite the α-meso-substituent, is enzymatically oxidized at the α-meso-carbon to give mesobiliverdin IXα, but the reaction proceeds without the concomitant formation of CO (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the α-meso-carbon and the attached methyl group are eliminated by a mechanism that does not converge on the normal α-meso-hydroxymesoheme intermediate. The excised two-carbon fragment is not released as acetaldehyde or acetic acid (21Torpey, J. (1997) Mechanistic Studies of Home Oxygenase.Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California at San Francisco.Google Scholar), but the identity of the fragment remains unknown. The methyl-substituted position is also exclusively (γ) or preferentially (δ) oxidized in enzymatic turnover of the γ- or δ-meso-methylmesoporphyrin isomers, giving rise to the corresponding unsubstituted mesobiliverdins (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As found for the α-meso-methyl isomer, no CO is detected in the enzymatic oxidation of γ-meso-methylmesoheme (21Torpey, J. (1997) Mechanistic Studies of Home Oxygenase.Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California at San Francisco.Google Scholar). A methyl substituent thus favors oxidation of the methyl-substitutedmeso-carbon, albeit by a mechanism that diverges from that which leads to formation of the normal meso-hydroxy intermediate. The regiochemistries of the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidations of α-meso-formyl- and α-meso-methylmesoheme are diametrically opposed in that the former results exclusively in oxidation of the substituted position and the latter in oxidation of an unsubstituted position. A single biliverdin-like product peak is observed when the α-meso-formylmesoheme reaction product is analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5). The retention time and the absorption and mass spectra of the product clearly identify it as a formyl-substituted mesobiliverdin. Although a molecular ion is not observed in the mass spectrum (Fig. 6), the two principal peaks observed atm/z 273 and 370 are consistent with fragmentation of a formyl-substituted mesobiliverdin with a molecular mass of 642. Earlier studies showed that biliverdins fragment to give ions such as those observed here (Fig. 7) (20Bonnett, R., and McDonagh, A. F. (1973) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 881–888.Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the fragments are consistent with fragmentation of the parent mesobiliverdin at either the β- or δ-meso position, which implies that the heme oxygenase reaction occurred at one of these two positions rather than at the formyl-substituted α-meso position. Independent evidence for oxidation at the unsubstituted positions is provided by the finding that CO is formed in amounts (>90%) approaching those expected for quantitative oxidation of the unsubstituted rather than the formyl-substituted, mesopositions. The results unambiguously establish that ameso-formyl substituent, in contrast to a methyl substituent, directs the oxidation away from the substituted carbon toward the unsubstituted positions. The opposite effects of the formyl and methyl groups could be due to the differences in their steric or electronic properties. In steric terms, a formyl group is more compact and therefore presents a smaller steric profile than a methyl group. A value for the steric parameter Es is not available for a formyl group, but the value for the slightly more compact cyano group is −0.51. The corresponding value for methyl group is −1.24 (22Hansch C. Leo A. Exploring QSAR. Fundamentals and Applications in Chemistry and Biology. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1995: 1-96Google Scholar). Steric effects therefore cannot be used to rationalize the opposite effects on the reaction regiospecificity of the meso-methyl andmeso-formyl substituents, particularly when the substituent is at the normally favored α-meso carbon. However, the changes in regiospecificity are readily rationalized by the differences in the electronic effects of the two substituents. A methyl is electron donating (Hammett ςp = −0.17), whereas a formyl substituent is electron withdrawing (Hammett ςp = +0.42) (22Hansch C. Leo A. Exploring QSAR. Fundamentals and Applications in Chemistry and Biology. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1995: 1-96Google Scholar). The opposite effects of meso-formyl andmeso-methyl substituents on the heme oxygenase reaction regiochemistry indicate that electron donating substituents promote oxidation of the substituted carbon, whereas electron-withdrawing substituents disfavor it. A corollary of this inference is that the regioselectivity of the heme oxygenase reaction is primarily determined by electronic rather than steric features of the active site. A second corollary is that the reaction involves electrophilic attack at themeso carbon, because electron donation facilitates the reaction, whereas electron withdrawal impedes it. Electrophilic attack is consistent with the finding that the ethylhydroperoxide-dependent oxidation of heme by hHO-1 produces α-meso-ethoxyheme (16Wilks A. Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the1H NMR spectrum of the hHO-1-heme complex suggests that the distribution of electron density in the highest occupied porphyrin molecular orbital is similar to that seen when the heme bears an electron donating or withdrawing meso-substituent (23Hernández G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the normal heme substrate does not have such a substituent, the results suggest that the protein favors α-meso-hydroxylation by causing an analogous asymmetry in the heme electronic structure. A comparison of the enzymatic oxidation of the meso-methyl and meso-formyl hemes reveals two additional significant differences. The oxidation of the β-meso-methylmesoheme regioisomer was unusual in that it was particularly slow and provided low to negligible yields of mesobiliverdin-like products (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, β-meso-formylmesoheme is oxidized just as readily as the other meso-formyl isomers and gives similar amounts of mesoverdoheme-like products (Fig. 5). This difference is presumably due to the fact that oxidation of the β-meso-formyl substrate disfavors the β-meso-carbon, whereas the β-meso-carbon is favored in the case of the β-meso-methyl substrate. The β-formyl result clearly shows that a substituent at the β position does not cause a general perturbation that abrogates the normal catalytic mechanism. This conclusion strengthens our earlier suggestion (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that a specific steric interaction prevents oxidation of the β-meso position, an interaction that does not come into play in the case of the β-meso-formyl heme because oxidation occurs at other positions. The second anomaly is provided by the finding that the H2O2-dependent heme oxygenase reaction proceeds normally with the α-meso-formyl substrate, whereas no reaction was observed earlier with the α-meso-methyl substrate (15Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This difference is again rationalized by the fact that an α-meso-formyl substituent directs the oxidation to the β- or δ-unsubstituted mesopositions, whereas an α-meso-methyl favors oxidation of the α-meso carbon. Thus, a specific interaction that blocks the H2O2-dependent oxidation of the α-meso-substituted carbon would not interfere in the case of the α-meso-formyl substrate, which channels the oxidation to the other meso positions. The key finding of this study is that meso-methyl andmeso-formyl substituents have opposite effects on the regiospecificity of the heme oxygenase reaction, the former favoring oxidation of the substituted position and the latter oxidation of an unsubstituted position. This finding leads to two conclusions: (a) that the regiochemistry of the reaction is primarily under electronic rather than steric control and (b) that oxidation involves electrophilic addition to the heme. The normal α-meso regiospecificity of the heme oxygenase reaction thus appears to be enforced by interactions of active site residues with the heme that selectively enrich the frontier orbital electron density at the α-meso carbon.

https://openalex.org/W2078408947,"Inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. IMPDH converts IMP to xanthosine 5′-monophosphate with concomitant conversion of NAD+ to NADH. All IMPDHs characterized to date contain a 130-residue “subdomain” that extends from an N-terminal loop of the α/β barrel domain. The role of this subdomain is unknown. An IMPDH homolog has been cloned fromBorrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease (Margolis, N., Hogan, D., Tilly, K., and Rosa, P. A. (1994)J. Bacteriol. 176, 6427–6432). This homolog has replaced the subdomain with a 50-residue segment of unrelated sequence. We have expressed and characterized the B. burgdorferi IMPDH homolog. This protein has IMPDH activity, which unequivocally demonstrates that the subdomain is not required for catalytic activity. The monovalent cation and dinucleotide binding sites of B. burgdorferi IMPDH are significantly different from those of human IMPDH.

This reaction is the rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, and is therefore a target for numerous chemotherapeutic agents (1Weber G. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3466-3492PubMed Google Scholar). IMPDH inhibitors are used clinically in antiviral (ribavirin) and immunosuppressive therapies (mycophenolate mofetil and mizoribine) (2Smith R.A. Kirkpatrick W. Collier L.H. Oxford T.

Tsuijino M. Yoshigaiva M. Mizuno K. Haynao K. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IMPDH inhibitors have anti-tumor and antibiotic activity (5Robins R.

Mammalian and bacterial IMPDHs have significantly different kinetic properties and inhibitor sensitivities, which suggests that species-specific IMPDH inhibitors can be developed that will be useful in treating bacterial and parasitic infections (7Hupe D.J. Azzolina B.A. Behrens N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8363-8369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Verham R. Meek T.D. Hedstrom L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem.

Davis J.P. Science. 1982; 216: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). This disease is transmitted by ticks of theIxodes ricinus complex and is found worldwide. The genes encoding GMP synthase (guaA) and IMPDH (guaB) are located on a 26-kb circular plasmid (cp26) in B. burgdorferi(15Margolis N. Hogan D. Tilly K. Rosa P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes carried by plasmids generally confer selective advantage in a particular environmental niche. The unique plasmid location of these housekeeping genes in B. burgdorferi may be related to their role in the transmission cycle between ticks and mammals. In ticks, guanine is the major nitrogenous waste product and therefore accumulates to high levels. However, in mammals, purine levels are low and limiting for bacterial growth. Therefore expression of thegua genes would be unnecessary for the survival of B. burgdorferi in ticks, but critical for survival in a mammalian host. Consistent with an adaptive role of cp26 in the mammalian environment, the gua genes are linked with ospC, which is induced during tick feeding. ospC encodes a protein that appears on the outer surface of the spirochete immediately preceding transmission to the mammal (16Schwan T.G. Piesman J. Golde W.T. Dolan M.C. Rosa P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2909-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The identity of B. burgdorferi guaA was confirmed by complementation of GMP synthase-deficient Escherichia coli(15Margolis N. Hogan D. Tilly K. Rosa P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the guaB homolog did not complement IMPDH-deficient E. coli. The failure to observe complementation by B. burgdorferi guaB most likely results from incompatible promoters or unstable protein. Alternatively, theguaB homolog may not encode an active IMPDH. Indeed, theguaB homolog, with a predicted molecular mass of 44 kDa, is 10 kDa smaller than typical IMPDHs. This difference in size results from the loss of 130 residues (residues 110–244, Chinese hamster IMPDH numbering) in the middle of IMPDH. These residues have been replaced with 50 residues of unrelated sequence (15Margolis N. Hogan D. Tilly K. Rosa P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of IMPDH provides little information about the role of this missing region (17Sintchak M.D. Fleming M.A. Futer O. Raybuck S.A. Chambers S.P. Caron P.R. Murcko M. Wilson K.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). IMPDH is an α/β barrel protein, with the active site located in the loops on the C-terminal ends of the β sheets. Residues 100–244 form an unusual insertion in a loop on the N-terminal end of the α/β barrel. Therefore, this “subdomain” is on the opposite end of the α/β barrel from the active site. The subdomain is present in all of the IMPDHs characterized to date, although the subdomain of the guaB1homolog from Mycobacterium leprae is missing 90 residues (GenBankTM accession no. U00015). This region is also absent in the homologous enzyme GMP reductase (18Andrews S. Guest J. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A recent report claims that activity is retained when the subdomain is deleted from Chinese hamster IMPDH, although the experimental details were not presented (17Sintchak M.D. Fleming M.A. Futer O. Raybuck S.A. Chambers S.P. Caron P.R. Murcko M. Wilson K.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The subdomain has no sequence or structural similarities to proteins other than IMPDH. Thus the role of the subdomain in IMPDH is unknown. Intriguingly, the subdomain is also found in the guaB homolog from the relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia hermsii, 2P. Rosa, unpublished data. which suggests a species-specific modification of IMPDH in Lyme disease spirochetes. We have expressed the B. burgdorferi guaB homolog inE. coli. This protein has IMPDH activity, which demonstrates that the subdomain is not required for IMPDH activity. B. burgdorferi IMPDH has significantly different kinetic properties from human IMPDH. Therefore, B. burgdorferi IMPDH may be a target for the development of new treatments for Lyme disease. IMP, NAD+, Trizma base, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. 5-Ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide 5′-monophosphate was the generous gift of Dr. Akira Matsuda (Hokkaido University). Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Brandeis Oligonucleotide Facility. Plasmid p68, containing the guaB gene ofB. burgdorferi B31, was previously isolated from a genomic library constructed in the vector λZapII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (15Margolis N. Hogan D. Tilly K. Rosa P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was used to insert convenient restriction sites at the beginning and end of the guaB gene. The following oligonucleotides were used (mutations are underlined, restriction sites are in bold lettering): TGA-CT C-A TA(1)-TGC-CAA-ATA-AGA-TAA-CAA-AAG-AAG-CTT-TAA-C, inserts an NdeI site at the 5′ end; TGT-T C T-GCA- G TT-TTA-TGT-TAT-GCT-AAA-AAC-ATC-GTG-AGG, inserts a PstI site in the 3′-noncoding region. TheguaB coding sequence was amplified with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using 30 cycles of the following protocol: 1-min denaturation at 92 °C, 1-min annealing at 45 °C, 4-min extension at 60 °C. The PCR reaction (100 μl) contained 200 μmdeoxynucleoside triphosphates, 4 mm MgSO4, 2 ng of p68, 1.25 μm of each oligonucleotide, and 2 units of polymerase. The PCR product was digested with NdeI andPstI and ligated to the NdeI/PstI fragment of pTactac (19Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The resulting construct is designated pB9. The guaB coding sequence of pB9 was completely sequenced using a PRISM Dyedeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit (ABI) and an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer at the Brandeis DNA Facility. No unwanted mutations were introduced in the PCR reaction. pB9 was transformed into E. coli strain H712, which contains a partial deletion of the E. coli guaB gene (20Nijkamp H.J.J. De Haan P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 145: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of cells was diluted 200-fold into fresh LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After 1 h at 37 °C, 1 mmIPTG was added to induce expression of IMPDH. The cells were harvested after 13 h by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and frozen at −20 °C. All of the following manipulations were performed at 4 °C. The cells were thawed and disrupted by sonication. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 25 min. The supernatant was applied to a Cibacron blue Sepharose column previously equilibrated in buffer A. IMPDH was eluted in a linear gradient of 0 to 2 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing IMPDH activity were pooled and diluted 4-fold with buffer A. IMP resin was added to the enzyme solution until no activity remained in the supernatant. The resin was then poured into a column and washed with buffer A. IMPDH was eluted with 1 mm IMP, 500 mm KCl in buffer A (IMPDH does not elute in the absence of KCl). Table I summarizes the purification. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad assay with IgG as a standard. Active sites were titrated with 5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide 5′-monophosphate (9Wang W. Papov V.V. Minakawa N. Matsuda A. Biemann K. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Tufts Medical School Protein Sequencing Facility. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy was performed by the Harvard University Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory.Table IPurification of recombinant B. burgdorferi IMPDHStepTotal unitsTotal proteinSpecific ActivityYieldμmol min −1mgμmol min −1 mg −1%Crude extract256000.042100Blue Sepharose column221100.5988IMP affinity column35420.83160Details of the purification are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzyme was assayed in 250 μm IMP, 500 μm NAD, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 3 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 °C.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. The rotor speed was 9000 rpm and the temperature was 20 °C. Samples contained 0.2–1.5 mg/ml enzyme, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 μmdithiothreitol in the presence and absence of 0.1 m KCl. Data were fit to the following equation, which describes the sedimentation of a single component system, using Origin Technical Graphics and Data Analysis (MicroCal):A=A0exp[M(1­νρ)ω2(r2−r02)/2RT]Equation 1 where A0 and A are the absorbance at the meniscus (r0) and radiusr respectively, M is the molecular weight, ν is the partial specific volume of IMPDH, ρ is solvent density, ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, andT is temperature. The partial specific volume = 0.75 for B. burgdorferi IMPDH was calculated from the amino acid sequence. Assays were performed in 100 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Activity was routinely assayed in the presence of 250 μmIMP and 500 μm NAD at 25 °C. The production of XMP was monitored in crude extracts by absorbance at 290 nm (ε = 5.4 mm−1 cm−1). The production of NADH was monitored at 340 nm for purified enzyme assays (ε = 6.2 mm−1 cm−1). Initial velocity data were fit to the following equations using KinetAsyst and Kaleidagraph software, Michaelis-Menten equationν=Vm[S]/(Km+[S])Equation 2 Substrate inhibition equationv=Vm[S]/(Km+[S]+[S]2/Kii)Equation 3 Competitive inhibition equationv=Vm[S]/(Km(1+[I]/Kis)+[S])Equation 4 Uncompetitive inhibition equationν=Vm[S]/{Km+[S](1+[I]/Kii)}Equation 5 where v is the initial velocity,Vm is the maximal velocity, S is substrate, I is inhibitor, Km is the Michaelis constant, andKii and Kis are the intercept and slope inhibition constants, respectively. PCR was used to insert convenient restriction sites into the B. burgdorferi guaB gene, NdeI at the start site andPstI in the 3′-noncoding region, and the gene was cloned into pTactac (19Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The guaB gene was sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced during PCR. This construct, pB9, was transformed into E. coli strain H712, which lacks endogenous IMPDH activity (20Nijkamp H.J.J. De Haan P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 145: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). H712 cells carrying pB9 could grow on minimal medium, while cells carrying the parent plasmid, pTactac, cannot grow (data not shown). This result demonstrates that pB9 can complement the IMPDH deficiency of H712 cells and indicates that pB9 expresses a functional IMPDH. Recombinant B. burgdorferi IMPDH was purified from H712 cells carrying pB9; expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG. The purification was accomplished in two steps and high yield, using Cibacron blue Sepharose and IMP affinity resins (Table I). Purification of B. burgdorferi IMPDH closely resembled the purification of human type II and E. coli IMPDHs (9Wang W. Papov V.V. Minakawa N. Matsuda A. Biemann K. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Farazi T. Leichman J. Harris T. Cahoon M. Hedstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 961-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the exception that 0.5m KCl is required in addition to 500 μm IMP to elute the enzyme from the IMP resin. This observation suggests that the B. burgdorferi enzyme may have a different requirement for monovalent cations than other IMPDHs. The purified enzyme is >95% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The N-terminal sequence of purified IMPDH is Pro-Asn-Lys-Ile-Thr-Lys as determined by Edman degradation. This sequence corresponds to the predicted N-terminal sequence of B. burgdorferi IMPDH after removal of the first Met. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified IMPDH shows a single band at 44 kDa (Fig. 1), consistent with the molecular mass of 43,637 Da calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. This molecular mass confirms that the IMPDH activity derives from the expression ofB. burgdorferi guaB because IMPDHs typically have a molecular mass of ∼55,000 Da (22Gilbert H. Lowe C. Drabble W. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A single species with a molecular mass of 43,660 Da is observed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (Fig. 2), which further confirms the identity of B. burgdorferi IMPDH. Fig. 3 shows equilibrium sedimentation data for B. burgdorferi IMPDH. These data were fit to an equation describing the sedimentation of a single ideal species with a molecular mass of 43,660 Da (monomer), 87,320 Da (dimer), or 174,640 Da (tetramer). Reasonable fits could not be obtained to monomeric and dimeric species; the fit to a tetrameric species appears to be good (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the residuals of the tetrameric fit display a nonrandom distribution, which can indicate an associating system. This fit could not be improved by including terms for monomer-tetramer, dimer-tetramer, or monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibria. The fit could be improved slightly by including a tetramer-octamer equilibrium. Such higher order aggregates have been observed in IMPDHs from other species (22Gilbert H. Lowe C. Drabble W. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Heyde E. Morrison J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). No difference in sedimentation behavior was observed at different enzyme concentrations (0.2 to 1.5 mg/ml) or in the presence of 0.1 m KCl. These results indicate that B. burgdorferi IMPDH is a tetramer like other IMPDHs (22Gilbert H. Lowe C. Drabble W. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Carr S.F.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2193-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and may form higher order aggregates as also observed for other IMPDHs. Initial velocity data were collected at varying concentrations of IMP (7 to 980 μm) and NAD (125 to 5000 μm). The initial velocityversus IMP plots at fixed concentrations of NAD follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, substrate inhibition is observed at high NAD concentrations (Fig. 4 B). Such substrate inhibition is commonly observed in IMPDHs and suggests that product dissociation follows an ordered mechanism where NADH is the first product released. Steady state parameters were derived by first determining the apparent values of Vm for the initial velocity versus IMP plots (as in Fig. 4 A) and replotting these values against NAD concentration. These data were fit to Equation 3, which describes uncompetitive substrate inhibition:kcat = 2.6 ± 0.3 s−1,Km (NAD) = 1100 ± 160 μm andKii (NAD) = 2300 ± 390 μm. The value of Km (IMP) was derived by first determining the apparent values of Vm for the initial velocity versus NAD plots using Equation 3 (as in Fig. 4 B) and replotting these values against IMP concentration. These data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation:Km (IMP) = 29 ± 8 μm. These values are comparable to those reported for other bacterial IMPDHs (22Gilbert H. Lowe C. Drabble W. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,26Heyde E. Nagabhushanam A. Vonarx M. Morrison J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus B. burgdorferi guaB encodes an IMPDH with typical kinetic properties. This observation demonstrates that the subdomain is not required for IMPDH activity. B. burgdorferi IMPDH is inactive in the absence of K+ (<1% activity). High concentrations of K+ (>300 mm) inhibit the enzyme. As shown in Table II, NH4+ and K+ are interchangeable, while Cs+ is a much less effective activator.

While monovalent cation dependence is commonly observed among IMPDHs, the monovalent cation specificity varies significantly among IMPDHs. K+, NH4+, Na+, Tl+, and Rb+ activate human IMPDH, while Li+ has no effect on this enzyme (27Xiang B. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1435-1440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). K+, but not NH4+, activates cowpea IMPDH (28Atkins C. Shelp B. Storer P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), while Bacillus subtilis IMPDH will utilize K+, NH4+, Na+, Cs+, Li+, Tl+, and Rb+ (29Wu T. Scrimgeour K.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1973; 51: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to these enzymes, Tritrichomonas foetus IMPDH does not require monovalent cations; this IMPDH retains 80% of its activity in the absence of K+ (8Verham R. Meek T.D. Hedstrom L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the monovalent cation binding site is a potential target for species specific inhibitors. XMP and GMP are competitive inhibitors with respect to IMP, Kis = 85 and 6 μm, respectively. The value of Kis for XMP is similar to those reported for other IMPDHs. In contrast, theKis for GMP is approximately 15-fold lower than those usually observed for IMPDHs from both mammalian and bacterial sources (8Verham R. Meek T.D. Hedstrom L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem.

Specialized recombinases catalyze exchanges between pairs of specific short DNA sequences which share little sequence homology. DNA cleavage, strand exchange, and rejoining of the DNA strands are catalyzed by four recombinase molecules in the absence of exogenous high energy cofactors, and proceed through a series of transient recombinase-DNA covalent complexes. This differentiates site-specific recombination from other types of genetic recombination, and relates site-specific recombinases to topoisomerases, the other class of enzymes with nicking-closing activity on DNA (3Wang J.C.

Recombinational exchanges between pairs of plasmid sites (e.g. the cer site of ColE1 or the psi site of pSC101) requires additional sequences and proteins whose role is to ensure that recombination is preferentialy intramolecular, and converts multimers to monomers (10Summers D.K.

This family is characterized by the conservation of two motifs which contain four invariant residues (the RHRY tetrad), all of which have been implicated in catalysis (21Abremski K.E. Hoess R.H. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The tyrosine (Y) serves as the attacking nucleophile on the scissile phosphodiester bond of the DNA. This attack generates a 5′ hydroxyl end and a 3′ phosphotyrosyl-protein intermediate which is released upon ligation with the recombining partner (22Pargellis C.A. Nunes-Duby S.E.

The three other residues (Arg, His, and Arg) are thought to be involved in activation of phosphodiester and phosphotyrosyl bonds during cleavage and rejoining reactions (24Parson R.L. Prasad P.V.

Despite the novelty of being catalyzed by two different recombinases, the biochemical steps of Xer recombination appear to be similar to those described for others systems of the λ integrase family (1Nash H.A.

McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Each protein specifically cleaves one of the DNA strands at the position which separates its binding arm from the central region (Fig. 1; Refs. 26Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J.

Strand exchanges at plasmid sites occur in a sequential manner. XerC catalyzes the first pair of strand exchanges to form a Holliday junction-containing intermediate which is eventually resolved by XerD to generate the recombination products (12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the characterization of a site-specific topoisomerase activity of both XerC and XerD. We show that XerC and XerD relax supercoiled plasmids containing the dif sitein vitro. Relaxation occurs in the absence of the partner recombinase and appears not to require contact between distant recombinase-DNA complexes. Formation of a XerC-XerD-difcomplex results in reciprocal inhibition of XerC and XerD relaxation activities. Plasmids used as substrates have been described previously (9Blakely G. May G.

Chloroquine was from Sigma, SYBR-Green from Flowgen, and bovine serum albumin from New England Biolabs. DNA purification and manipulation, gel electophoresis, staining, and photography involved standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Agarose gels were first stained with SYBR-green and scanned in a Molecular Dynamics FluoroImager 575. Quantitative analysis was performed using ImageQuaNT software. After destaining, gels were restained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Standard relaxation reactions contained 300 ng of supercoiled plasmid substrate in a final volume of 20 μl of “relaxation buffer” (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm spermidine, 0.25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 40% (v/v) glycerol) and 1 μl of protein in their respective dilution buffers (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1 m urea, and 50% (v/v) glycerol for XerC; and 125 mm imidazole, 5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.O, and 50% glycerol (v/v) for XerD). Final concentrations of the proteins are 1.1 μm for XerC and 0.125 μm for XerD. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, DNA was ethanol-precipitated and analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels (0.5 V/cm, 16 h). Plasmid pMIN33 topoisomers were separated on a 1% agarose gel (Sea Kem GTG-agarose from Bioproducts) containing 2 μg/ml chloroquine. The gel was run for 16 h in TAE buffer containing 2 μg/ml chloroquine and stained with ethidium bromide. Bands corresponding to single topoisomers were excised from the gel on a 365-nm UV transilluminator. DNA was extracted from the gel slices by electroelution, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 20 μl of water. 5 μl was used for each relaxation reaction. The E. coli chromosomal site dif exhibits no recombination activity in vitro on duplex recombination sites contained within supercoiled plasmids, under conditions where the plasmid sitespsi and cer recombine efficiently (12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, prolonged incubation of the plasmid, pMIN33, containing a singledif site, with either purified XerC or XerD led to the appearance of new DNA forms (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 6). These new forms comigrated with relaxed topoisomers of the substrate obtained by partial treatment withE. coli topoisomerase I (Fig. 2, lane 7). Phenol extraction of the reactions, whether or not preceeded by treatment with proteinase K, did not alter this pattern of bands indicating that the novel species were not DNA-protein covalent complexes (data not shown). We conclude that the new forms are relaxed topoisomers of the substrate formed by XerC- and XerD-mediated catalysis. For both pMIN33 and pSDC124, a plasmid containing two dif sites in direct repeat, the restriction enzyme digestion patterns of the substrates were not changed during incubation (data not shown). Therefore relaxation is not proceeding through recombination. Relaxation depends on the presence of the recombination site on the substrate as the cloning vector, pUC18, is not relaxed by either XerC or XerD (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3). We therefore conclude that XerC and XerD can act as site-specific topoisomerases ondif-containing substrates. Both XerC and XerD relaxation activities increased with added glycerol and showed an optimal efficiency at a KCl concentration of 50 mm (data not shown). Titration of either protein in relaxation reactions showed that both are present in saturating amounts in standard reactions (see “Materials and Methods”). Even under these optimal conditions, relaxation by either XerC or XerD appears to be a slow process when compared with recombination at plasmid sitesin vitro (12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Products were barely detectable after 1 h and increased up to 8 h of incubation at which time 30 to 40% of the substrate was processed (data not shown). Mutants in three residues of the RHRY tetrad of XerD (R148K, R247Q, and Y279F) and of the catalytic tyrosine of XerC (Y275F), are defective in the cleavage step of catalysis (9Blakely G. May G.

Arciszewska, I. Grainge, P. A. Wigge, and D. J. Sherratt, unpublished data. These mutants were also defective in relaxation (Fig. 3), suggesting that cleavage during relaxation and recombination involve the same residues and mechanism. XerDH244L is mutated for the conserved histidine of the RHRY tetrad of XerD. Like its counterpart in the Flp recombinase (25Pan G. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12397-12399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), XerDH244L cleaves Holliday junction-containing DNA substrates efficiently, but religates the cleaved DNA strands poorly, resulting in the accumulation of protein-DNA covalent complexes. 4L. K. Arciszewska, S. D. Colloms, P. A. Wigge, and D. J. Sherratt, unpublished data. This failure to religate DNA leads to the accumulation of a nicked form of the substrate to which XerDH244L is covalently bound. No new DNA species or increase in the intensity of the open circle band was detectable in relaxation reactions with XerDH244L, even after release of possible protein-DNA covalent complexes by treatment of the reaction with proteinase K (Fig. 3 and data not shown). XerDH244L is therefore defective in cleavage in relaxation reactions but not in recombination reactions, that require exchange of strands with a partner duplex within a complex containing two bound XerC molecules and two bound XerD molecules. The reasons for this difference may reside in the structure of the nucleoprotein recombination complex and/or in the conformation of the DNA substrate, since XerD resolves Holliday junction-containing DNA molecules during recombination whereas the substrates used in relaxation are unbranched. Catalysis by XerD on linear and X-shaped DNA substrates may therefore involve different catalytic residues within a given recombinase protomer. Topoisomerases have been classified into type I or type II topoisomerases on the basis of whether they change the linking number of the DNA substrate in steps of one (type I), or two (type II) (3Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 4Rocca J. Trends Biochem. 1995; 20: 156-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To investigate whether XerC and XerD are type I or II topoisomerases, relaxation reactions were performed using a purified single topoisomer of pMIN33 as substrate (Fig. 4). XerC- and XerD-mediated relaxation of this substrate yielded the same band pattern as the substrate containing a mixture of topisomers (Fig. 4 B). Since this behavior is expected only from a type I enzyme, XerC and XerD are site-specific type I topoisomerases. For XerD- and XerC-mediated relaxation, proccessed DNA molecules appear to be almost completely relaxed whereas the majority of the substrate has not been proccessed (Fig. 2). Absence of extensive relaxation of the species running as fully supercoiled DNA has been confirmed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (data not shown). In addition, the relative distribution of the relaxed topoisomers bands did not vary with varying reaction efficiency, for example, during time courses, protein titrations, or glycerol ranges (data not shown). This suggests that relaxation by XerC and XerD occurs in one of two ways. First, only one supercoil could be relaxed per cleavage event, the recombinase remaining bound to the site after religation and being strongly prone to continue relaxing the same DNA molecule. Second, the cleaved DNA strand could be free to rotate about the intact one a large number of times before religation, leading to a large number of supercoils relaxation per cleavage event. This second mechanism seems the most plausible because it correlates better with what XerC and XerD topoisomerase activities may reflect, i.e. aberrant behavior of enzymes displaced from their normal catalytic environment (see below). Furthermore, if relaxation was processive, changes in the reaction conditions such as salt concentration might modify the behavior of the recombinases by changing their dissociation rate from the DNA thus favoring their turnover between different DNA molecules. No change in the relative quantities of the topoisomers were observed when the KCl concentration was varied between 25 and 200 mmin the reactions (data not shown). This would argue against the processive relaxation hypothesis. The relaxation activities of XerC and XerD show that either recombinase can catalyze strand cleavage and rejoining in the absence of its partner. However, catalysis may require interactions between protomers of the same recombinase bound to two distant sites. This question was investigated by performing a series of relaxation reactions at different recombinase/DNA-substrate ratios. If any interaction between distant sites was require for catalysis, the efficiency of the reaction should decrease as a second order function with respect to the substrate concentration under saturating protein conditions. Reaction efficiency should not vary with substrate concentration if interactions between sites are not required. Substates carrying one or two dif sites were also compared, reasoning that the effect of substrate dilution on relaxation efficiency should be far less dramatic for a plasmid containing two sites in the eventuality of a dependence on synapsis. For both types of substrates, no significant variation in XerD relaxation efficiency over a 5-fold dilution of the substrate was observed (Fig. 5). For XerC, a slight decrease of activity with substrate dilution was noted (Fig. 5). However, this dependence is not a second order dependence and is equally detectable on substrates containing one dif site (pMIN33) or twodif sites either in direct or in inverted orientation (pSDC124 and pGB105, respectively, Fig. 5). The observed decrease in XerC activity is therefore unlikely to reflect a requirement for an interaction between distant sites. This is supported by the observation that cleavage by XerC on linear substrates shows a linear decrease with respect to protein concentration, as would be predicted if no synapsis is required (27Blakely G.W.

Therefore, XerD and XerC relaxation activities are not likely to require synapsis between distant recombination sites. Plasmid relaxation by either XerC or XerD is observed when only one of the two recombinases is present in the reaction. Addition of the partner recombinase results in a total inhibition of either XerC or XerD topisomerase activity (Fig. 6). This reciprocal inhibition does not require the catalytic activity of the inhibiting partner since the catalytically inactive mutants XerCY275F and XerDY279F inhibit the wild type XerD and XerC, respectively (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and6). A series of relaxation reactions on plasmids containing only the left half (XerC-binding site, pGB206) or the right half (XerD-binding site, pGB205) of the dif site (9Blakely G. May G. McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) was performed to assess whether inhibition is dependent on binding to the core sequence. pGB205 is relaxed by XerC but not by XerD and vice versa for pGB206 (Fig. 6, lanes 8, 9, 12, and 13). Thus, relaxation does not require the presence of the binding site for the absent recombinase and a given recombinase can only mediate relaxation when it interacts with its own binding site; if there is any weak interaction with the partner recombinase-binding site it does not lead to relaxation. Reciprocal inhibition no longer occurs on pGB205 and pGB206 (Fig. 6, lanes 10 and 14), showing that it only occurs within a complex where both recombinases are bound to the core sequence (note the partial inhibition of XerD relaxation activity by XerC in lane 14 when compare with lane 13 which is consistent with the weak binding of XerC to the mutated dif site present in pGB205 in presence of XerD, Ref.9Blakely G. May G. McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that reciprocal inhibition proceeds through XerC-XerD interactions across the core sequence. No inhibition of XerD-mediated relaxation upon binding of two XerD protomers to a mutated dif site in which the XerC-binding site has been changed to an XerD-binding site was observed (data not shown). This confirms that specific XerC-XerD interactions are required for inhibition. During a complete recombination reaction, site-specific recombinases catalyze two pairs of DNA strand exchanges between two recombination sites (1Nash H.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Brooks Low K. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biologie. 2nd Ed.

In this process, recombinases catalyze both the cleavage and the rejoining steps, using covalent protein-DNA complexes as intermediates, a property shared by topoisomerases. Consistent with this, most of the well studied recombinases have been shown to act as topoisomerases in vitro by relaxing supercoiled DNA without recombining it (5Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Abremski K. Wierzbicki A. Frommer B. Hoess R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we characterize the topoisomerase activities of E. coli XerC and XerD and indicate how recombinase-recombinase interactions may be important in controlling the topoisomerase activity of site-specific recombinases. Relaxation of supercoiled plasmids by either XerC or XerD occursin vitro providing that the plasmid substrate contains their respective DNA recognition sequence. It occurs in the absence of the recombinase partner and is unlikely to require any contact between distant recombinase-bound sites. This supports a simple “swivel” type mechanism in which a single recombinase protomer bound to its DNA recognition sequence cleaves one of the two DNA strands which is then free to rotate about the intact one before being resealed. The pattern of topoisomers formed upon relaxation by either XerC or XerD suggests that relaxation occurs in a process in which a single cleavage event can lead to loss of a large number of supercoils before rejoining. This view is supported by the observation that a wide range of reaction conditions, which would be expected to influence recombinase binding, did not change the pattern of relaxation. The swivel mechanism has been proposed to account for relaxation by eucaryotic type I-3′ topoisomerases, that also use a 3′-phosphotyrosine DNA-protein covalent complex as a reaction intermediate (4Rocca J. Trends Biochem. 1995; 20: 156-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Pargellis C.A. Nunes-Duby S.E. Moitoso de Vargas L. Landy A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18504-18510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental evidence has shown that XerC and XerD cleave the phosphodiester bonds adjacent to their respective binding sites and do so independently of the catalytic activity of the partner recombinase (Fig. 1) (12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This eliminates models in which either recombinase would be implicated in cleavage of the phosphodiester bond activated by its partner. The fact that relaxation occurs in the absence of the partner recombinase is consistent with that. The observation that relaxation is unlikely to require contact between recombinase-DNA complexes also indicates that single protomers of either XerC or XerD do not need to interact with a second molecule of the same recombinase to catalyze cleavage and rejoining, at least in a reaction which leads to relaxation. Whether XerC and XerD are catalytically autonomous in all stages of a complete recombination reaction remains to be clarified. Relaxation is inefficient when compared with the relatively fast rate of strand exchange observed for in vitro recombination reactions (12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Under most experimental conditions, strand exchange mediated by XerC or XerD require the partner recombinase be present (9Blakely G. May G. McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T. Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,11Blakely G. Sherratt D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although on linear nicked “suicide” substrates a low level of XerD-independent XerC-mediated cleavage was observed (27Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This suggest that catalysis during a recombination reaction requires binding of both recombinase for the activation of each of their catalytic activities (a phenomenon referred to as “cross-core stimulation” in the case of λ integrase; Ref. 30Nunes-Duby Tirumalai R.S. Dorgai L. Yagil E. Weisberg R.A. Landy A. EMBO J. 1995; 13: 4421-4430Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The relaxation activities we observe are probably residual low activities that may not have any biological significance. However, these activities provide a powerful tool for study the catalytic functions of the recombinases and recombinases interactions when bound on DNA. An interesting observation is that XerD relaxes cercontaining plasmids, albeit less efficiently than difcontaining substrates (data not shown). This was unexpected since cleavage or strand exchange by XerD on cer containing substrates has never been detected in vitro using different recombination assays (12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, XerD catalytic activity is not required for recombination at cer in vivo(12Colloms S.D. McCulloch R. Grant K. Neilson L. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recent experiments point out that XerD-mediated strand exchange on dif containing Holliday junctions depends on the spatial configuration of the four DNA strands forming the junction (20Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is proposed that cer containing Holliday junctions adopt an unappropriate configuration for XerD catalysis to occur. XerD-mediated catalysis on unbranched substrates in the absence of XerC could been released from this topological constrain. The reciprocal inhibition of XerC and XerD relaxation activities by the partner recombinase requires the presence of the DNA recognition sequence for the inhibiting partner and is therefore mediated by XerC-XerD interaction through the core sequence of dif. This highlights the importance of cooperative interactions between recombinases in the control of their catalytic activities. Inhibition of relaxation could occur at the level of cleavage, cleavage not being allowed until a synaptic complex competent for recombination is correctly assembled. Assembly of the synaptic complex would then couple cleavage to strand exchange. Alternatively, XerC-XerD interactions could prevent rotation of the cleaved strand about the intact one, or could stimulate the rejoining step which would then always occurs without providing an opportunity for rotation. How are XerC and XerD relaxation activities and reciprocal inhibition related to the topoisomerase activities displayed by others systems of the λ integrase family? Two other members of the family have been shown to relax supercoiled plasmids in vitro using a type I topoisomerase activity: λ integrase itself and the Cre recombinase of bacteriophage P1. In both cases relaxation is by far less efficient than strand exchange and the pattern of topoisomers obtained after relaxation resembles those obtained with XerC and XerD (5Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Abremski K. Wierzbicki A. Frommer B. Hoess R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, Cre-mediated relaxation was only observed on a substrate containing a mutated recombination site in which 1 bp had been removed from the central region (7Abremski K. Wierzbicki A. Frommer B. Hoess R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reduces the spacing between the two Cre recognition sequences and might modify or impair the interaction between the two Cre protomers resulting in reciprocal inhibition release. Relaxation by λ integrase occurs with the same efficiency on substrates with or without a recombination site (5Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This has been proposed to occur upon recognition of “pseudo half-recombination sites” present on the substrates (31Craig N.L. Nash H.A. Cell. 1983; 35: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fact that relaxation is not improved by the presence of a bona fide recombination site on the substrate suggest that binding of two λ integrase protomers to the recombination site results in reciprocal inhibition in this system too. Taken together, these data suggest that the relaxation mechanism of XerC and XerD, and the way in which it is controlled, is similar to that of other members of the family. Perhaps significantly, the only well studied recombinase of the family for which no relaxation activity has been described so far is Flp, for which, all of the evidence suggests, needs two protomers to form a single active site capable of cleavage and rejoining (29Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to TcR or to the receptor-associated CD3 molecule can mimic effects of antigen recognition in the presence of monocytes (1Meuer S.C. Hodgdon J.C. Hussey R.E.

However, proliferation of highly purified T cells requires a second signal, provided by the engagement of the T cell accessory molecule CD28 with its cognate ligand B7 expressed on antigen presenting cells (reviewed in Refs.2June C.H.

In addition to costimulating the antigen-dependent pathway, CD28 can act in concert with the CD2 adhesion molecule, which is present on nearly all T lymphocytes, to up-regulate T cell responsiveness. As for the CD28 pathway, T cell activation via CD2 can be mimicked by the in vitro use of mAbs (5Pierres A. Lopez M. Cerdan C. Nunes J. Olive D. Mawas C. Eur. J.

The CD2 pathway, although not physically linked to the CD3·TcR complex, is metabolically related to it, in that modulation of the receptor complex abrogates the effects of anti-CD2 antibodies (7Meuer S.C.

In combination with CD2, or with CD3 mAb, CD28 mAb induces a high-level, long-lasting, IL-2-dependent and monocyte-independent T cell stimulation which is sustained by persistent high-level expression of the IL-2 high-affinity receptor (9Cerdan C.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar). T cell proliferation is also associated with the prolonged secretion of high levels of various cytokines known to be normally synthesized by accessory cells, namely IL-1α, CSF-1, and GM-CSF (11Costello R. Cerdan C. Pavon C. Brailly H. Hurpin C. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All these up-regulations correlate with increased levels of corresponding mRNA pools, resulting from increased mRNA stability and transcriptional activity (9Cerdan C. Martin Y. Courcoul M. Brailly H.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14179-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD28RE motifs, also termed cytokine 1 (CK-1), are distinct from, but related to, κB elements in that they bind to, and can be activated by, proteins of the Rel/NF-κB family (16Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, the IL-2 promoter, as well as several other lymphokine or growth factor promoters including those of GM-CSF and CSF-1, contains a consensus κB site in the vicinity of the CD28RE. Although the enhancer role of this κB motif has been controversial, it seems that, in normal T cells, the κB and CD28RE sites are not a redundant pair since mutation of the κB site cannot be compensated for by a functional CD28RE (20Hughes C.C.W. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5369-5377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CD28 costimulation also activates transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long-terminal repeat (21Gruters R.A. Otto S.A. Al B.J. Verhoeven A.J. Verweij C.L. Van-Lier R.A.

The predominant role of Rel/NF-κB factors in the regulation of the expression of genes crucial for immune functions has been further demonstrated by studies of knock-out mice lacking different functional Rel/NF-κB genes (reviewed in Ref. 25Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice deficient for the c-Rel protooncogene exhibited defects in production of IL-2, IL-3, GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ cytokines, but displayed unaltered expression of IL-2Rα, as well as a number of other cell surface receptors (26Kontgen, F., Grumont, R.

Rel-related proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid amino-terminal domain (Rel homology domain) that encompasses sequences required for their dimerization, nuclear targeting, and binding to DNA and IκB regulators. In addition, c-Rel, p65, and RelB all contain carboxyl-terminal transcriptional transactivation domains. The p50 and p52 proteins are derived from the NH2-terminal half of p105 and p100 precursors, respectively, by proteolytic cleavage. In most types of resting cells, the majority of Rel complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes associated with the IκB family of ankyrin motif-rich inhibitory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 29Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Vanantwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 31Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The ankyrin domains appear to interact with Rel subunit dimerization domains, thus hindering the nuclear localizing sequence. IκB proteins include IκBα, -β, -γ, -ε, and -R proteins. p105 and p100 proteins, the COOH-terminal half of which also contains repeats of ankyrin domains, behave as Rel inhibitors as well. The molecular processes involved in the stimulation-induced release of Rel/NF-κB proteins have best been defined for IκBα. Activators of NF-κB induce rapid phosphorylation of IκBα followed by its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome complex. The Rel/NF-κB/IκB system forms an interregulated network. Thus, following activation by inducers such as tumor necrosis factor-α, PMA, or IL-1, resynthesis of IκBα, p105, and p100 proteins is up-regulated by the NF-κB factor, itself, via κB motifs present in the promoter of the IκB genes (reviewed in Ref. 31Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This ensures the transient activation of the factor and the replenishment of the cytoplasmic pools. CD28 costimulation appears to be distinct from the above stimuli in that it causes a sustained down-regulation of IκBα (33Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been assumed that this continued down-regulation leads to CD28 enhanced nuclear translocation of c-Rel (35Bryan R.G. Li Y.G. Lai J.H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which, in turn, causes sustained up-regulation of IL-2 gene expression. However, there has been no search for evidence of a physical association between IκBα and c-Rel to validate this hypothesis.In this study, using a combination of immunoblotting, metabolic labeling/coimmunoprecipitation, and EMSA analyses with a large panel of anti-Rel/NF-κB subunit antibodies, we have defined the major Rel complexes operating in resting human primary T lymphocytes, as well as in cells activated via CD2+CD28. We focused on the modifications specifically induced by costimulation, in comparison to those observed after CD3-mediated stimulation, and examined the consequences of these modifications on the in vitro binding activity of the corresponding complexes to the IL-2Rα and GM-CSF κB or CK-1 sites. Specific activation of T lymphocytes is initiated by the engagement of the clonotypic T cell receptor (TcR) 1The abbreviations used are: TcR, T cell receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IL-2, interleukin-2; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; CD28RE, CD28 response element; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.1The abbreviations used are: TcR, T cell receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IL-2, interleukin-2; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; CD28RE, CD28 response element; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. by antigenic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules at the surface of antigen presenting cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to TcR or to the receptor-associated CD3 molecule can mimic effects of antigen recognition in the presence of monocytes (1Meuer S.C. Hodgdon J.C. Hussey R.E. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, proliferation of highly purified T cells requires a second signal, provided by the engagement of the T cell accessory molecule CD28 with its cognate ligand B7 expressed on antigen presenting cells (reviewed in Refs.2June C.H.

In addition to costimulating the antigen-dependent pathway, CD28 can act in concert with the CD2 adhesion molecule, which is present on nearly all T lymphocytes, to up-regulate T cell responsiveness. As for the CD28 pathway, T cell activation via CD2 can be mimicked by the in vitro use of mAbs (5Pierres A. Lopez M. Cerdan C. Nunes J. Olive D. Mawas C. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1988; 18: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CD2 pathway, although not physically linked to the CD3·TcR complex, is metabolically related to it, in that modulation of the receptor complex abrogates the effects of anti-CD2 antibodies (7Meuer S.C. Hussey R.E. Fabbi M. Fox D. Acuto O. Fitzgerald K.A. Hodgdon J.C. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L.

In combination with CD2, or with CD3 mAb, CD28 mAb induces a high-level, long-lasting, IL-2-dependent and monocyte-independent T cell stimulation which is sustained by persistent high-level expression of the IL-2 high-affinity receptor (9Cerdan C.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar). T cell proliferation is also associated with the prolonged secretion of high levels of various cytokines known to be normally synthesized by accessory cells, namely IL-1α, CSF-1, and GM-CSF (11Costello R. Cerdan C. Pavon C. Brailly H. Hurpin C. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All these up-regulations correlate with increased levels of corresponding mRNA pools, resulting from increased mRNA stability and transcriptional activity (9Cerdan C. Martin Y. Courcoul M. Brailly H. Mawas C. Birg F. Olive D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2255-2261PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lindstein T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B.

Med. 1991; 173: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). CD28 costimulation is thought to activate lymphokine gene transcription through unique motifs, initially characterized as the CD28 response element (CD28RE) in the IL-2 promoter, and found conserved within several lymphokine genes (14Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 15Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14179-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD28RE motifs, also termed cytokine 1 (CK-1), are distinct from, but related to, κB elements in that they bind to, and can be activated by, proteins of the Rel/NF-κB family (16Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, the IL-2 promoter, as well as several other lymphokine or growth factor promoters including those of GM-CSF and CSF-1, contains a consensus κB site in the vicinity of the CD28RE. Although the enhancer role of this κB motif has been controversial, it seems that, in normal T cells, the κB and CD28RE sites are not a redundant pair since mutation of the κB site cannot be compensated for by a functional CD28RE (20Hughes C.C.W. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5369-5377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CD28 costimulation also activates transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long-terminal repeat (21Gruters R.A. Otto S.A. Al B.J. Verhoeven A.J. Verweij C.L. Van-Lier R.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5060-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) through their respective κB elements. The predominant role of Rel/NF-κB factors in the regulation of the expression of genes crucial for immune functions has been further demonstrated by studies of knock-out mice lacking different functional Rel/NF-κB genes (reviewed in Ref. 25Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice deficient for the c-Rel protooncogene exhibited defects in production of IL-2, IL-3, GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ cytokines, but displayed unaltered expression of IL-2Rα, as well as a number of other cell surface receptors (26Kontgen, F., Grumont, R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3405-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, Rel/NF-κB proteins are homo- and heterodimers encoded by a small multigene family including NFKB1(p50/p105), NFKB2 (p52/p100), RelA (p65),RelB, and c-Rel genes (reviewed in Refs. 25Baeuerle P.A.

Rel-related proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid amino-terminal domain (Rel homology domain) that encompasses sequences required for their dimerization, nuclear targeting, and binding to DNA and IκB regulators. In addition, c-Rel, p65, and RelB all contain carboxyl-terminal transcriptional transactivation domains. The p50 and p52 proteins are derived from the NH2-terminal half of p105 and p100 precursors, respectively, by proteolytic cleavage. In most types of resting cells, the majority of Rel complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes associated with the IκB family of ankyrin motif-rich inhibitory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 29Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Vanantwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 31Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The ankyrin domains appear to interact with Rel subunit dimerization domains, thus hindering the nuclear localizing sequence. IκB proteins include IκBα, -β, -γ, -ε, and -R proteins. p105 and p100 proteins, the COOH-terminal half of which also contains repeats of ankyrin domains, behave as Rel inhibitors as well.

We report here that baculovirus-expressed recombinant NIPP-1 displays RNA-binding properties, as revealed by North-Western analysis, by UV-mediated cross-linking, by RNA mobility-shift assays, and by chromatography on poly(U)-Sepharose. NIPP-1 preferentially bound to U-rich sequences, including RNA-destabilizing AUUUA motifs. NIPP-1 also associated with single-stranded DNA, but had no affinity for double-stranded DNA. The binding of NIPP-1 to RNA was blocked by antibodies directed against the COOH terminus of NIPP-1, but was not affected by prior phosphorylation of NIPP-1 with protein kinase A or casein kinase-2, which decreases the affinity of NIPP-1 for protein phosphatase-1. The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 did not bind to poly(U)-Sepharose, but it bound very tightly after complexation with NIPP-1. These data are in agreement with a function of NIPP-1 in targeting protein phosphatase-1 to RNA.

PP-1 is particularly abundant in the nucleus, where it is involved in the regulation of both transcription and mRNA processing. As for the latter, PP-1 has a demonstrated role in the subnuclear distribution of pre-mRNA splicing factors, spliceosome assembly, and (alternative) pre-mRNA processing, which has been explained by dephosphorylation of components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), such as the “SR” proteins, by PP-1 (3Mistelli T.

The SR splicing factors share a common motif of Ser-Arg repeats that is reversibly phosphorylated in vivoand is essential for spliceosome assembly and function. All known species of PP-1 are dimeric or trimeric enzymes (1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2DePaoli,-Roach A.A.

They contain an isoform of the same catalytic subunit (PP-1C), but differ in the regulatory subunits. In addition to an activity-controlling and substrate-specifying function, the regulatory subunits also have a “targeting” role. This multifunctional role is best understood for the “G” subunit that anchors PP-1 to glycogen and promotes the dephosphorylation of glycogen-associated proteins like glycogen synthase (6Hubbard M.J.

Other noncatalytic subunits of PP-1 (e.g. inhibitor-2, NIPP-1, and sds22) are known to affect the activity and/or substrate specificity of PP-1 in vitro, but it is unclear at present whether they also have a targeting role (1Bollen M.

The latter protein was named Ard-1, for “activator of RNA decay,” since it restored deficient RNA processing in the bacterialrne mutants (15Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The complementation by Ard-1 is not easily understood at the molecular level, since the rne gene encodes a multifunctional protein that not only displays an endoribonuclease E (RNase E) activity, but also contains domains that have been implicated in RNA binding, in macromolecular transport and in the maintenance of the cytoskeleton. The established role of PP-1 in RNA-processing and the structural similarities between NIPP-1 and known RNA-processing enzymes have prompted us to investigate the potential RNA-binding properties of NIPP-1. We report here that NIPP-1 binds with high affinity to RNA, in particular to U-rich sequences. By analogy with the anchoring role of other regulatory subunits of PP-1, we propose that NIPP-1 targets PP-1 to RNA-associated substrates. NIPP-1 from bovine thymus was expressed in insect Sf9 cells under control of the polyhedrin promotor, using the baculovirus expression system. 3V. Vulsteke, manuscript in preparation. 48–72 h after infection of the Sf9 cells with the recombinant virus, NIPP-1 could be detected as a major polypeptide in the cell extracts. The recombinant NIPP-1 was purified until homogeneity by successive chromatographies on heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and Poros HQ (Perseptive Biosystems) columns. The spontaneous and trypsin-revealed phosphorylase phosphatase activities were measured as described by Jagiello et al.(10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Protein concentrations were measured according to Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Endoribonuclease activities, using AU4 and 9 S RNA as substrates, were measured as detailed in Wennborg et al. (17Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The homoribopolymers poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U) were purchased from Sigma. The following oligoribonucleotides were obtained from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium): AG1, 5′-CUCUAGAGGAUGCAGGUAAGCUUGGGUACCG-3′; AU1, 5′-CUCUAGAGGAUGCAUUUAAGCUUGGGUACCG-3′; AU2, 5′-CUAGAGGAUGCAUUUAUUUAAGCUUGGGUAC-3′; AU4, 5′-AGGAUGCAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAAGCUUGG-3′; and AUMYC, 5′-CUUUAACAGAUUUGUAUUUAAGAAUUGUUUUUAAAAAAUUUUAAGAUUUACACA-3′ (17Wennborg A.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using a Cyclone DNA synthetizer (New Brunswick): dAT4, 5′-AGGATGCATTTATTTATTTATTTAAGCTTGG-3′ and dTA4, 5′-CCAAGCTTAAATAAATAAATAAATGCATCCT-3′. dAT4 and dTA4 were annealed by incubation of both oligos (each at 0.5 mg/ml) in 10 mmTris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mmMgCl2 during 10 min at 95 °C, followed by a slow acclimatization to room temperature. E. coli 9 S RNA and mRNA encoding outer membrane protein A (ompA) were transcribed from 2 μg of theHaeIII-linearized plasmids pTH90 and p106B-64, respectively, using the in vitro transcription kit from Stratagene and [α32P]CTP (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the DNA templates were removed by incubation (30 min at 37 °C) with 400 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Pharmacia) in the presence of 600 units/ml RNase inhibitor RNAsin (Promega). The labeled probes were extracted with a mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with 70% (v/v) ethanol and 10 mm sodium acetate, and purified on 8% urea-PAGE. The labeled RNA was visualized by autoradiography and extracted with 10 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5 and 1 mm EDTA. The probes were once more extracted and precipitated as detailed above, lyophilized, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5 and 1 mm EDTA. The oligoribonucleotides AG1, AU1, AU2, AU4, and AUMYC were labeled at the 5′-end by phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) during 45 min at 37 °C, according to the manufacturer's instructions, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and 600 units/ml RNAsin. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified on 20% urea-PAGE and extracted as detailed above for RNA. NIPP-1 (5 μg/ml) or bovine serum albumin (25 μg/ml) were incubated in 10 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 8.5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm EDTA with 5′-end-labeled AU4 (2 μCi/ml), or the 5′-untranslated region of the ompA mRNA (1 μCi/ml), or else 9 S RNA (1 μCi/ml) as described previously (17Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 20 μl were exposed to UV light (254 nm at 250 mJ for 1 min) in a Stratalinker UV apparatus. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to 7.5% Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were exposed for autoradiography. NIPP-1 was subjected to 7.5% Tricine-SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Corp.) Prehybridization was performed for 90 min at 44 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, and 150 μg/ml preheated (10 min at 100 °C followed by an incubation at 0 °C) salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). The hybridization was done for 2 h at 44 °C in the same buffer supplemented with in vitro transcribed 9 S RNA (0.2 μCi/ml) or 5′-end-labeled AG1 or AU4 (0.4 μCi/ml). Subsequently, the membranes were washed four times for 10 min in 10 mmTris/HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Various proteins (1–25 μg/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 8.5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, and one of the 5′-end-labeled oligoribonucleotides, or in vitro transcribed 9 S RNA, or else the 5′-untranslated region of the ompA mRNA (1–2 μCi/ml). Electrophoresis was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C at 200 V using 5% native PAGE in 0.1 m Tris plus 0.1 m glycine. The dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. The present study was performed with bovine thymus NIPP-1 that was expressed in insect Sf9 cells, using the baculovirus expression system, and purified until homogeneity (Fig. 1,left panel). The properties of the isolated recombinant inhibitor were similar to those of native NIPP-1 (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and of the NIPP-1 fragments that were previously isolated from bovine thymus (8Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with respect to the specificity and potency of its inhibition of PP-1C, and the decreased inhibitory potency after its phosphorylation by protein kinase A and casein kinase-2 (not illustrated). Since it has been reported that the COOH-terminal third of NIPP-1 can substitute for some functions of the bacterial RNase E (see Introduction), we have initially focused on known substrates of this endoribonuclease to investigate putative RNA-binding properties of NIPP-1. These substrates include “9 S RNA” (the bacterial precursor of 5 S ribosomal RNA), the ompA mRNA, and the oligoribonucleotides AG1, AU1, AU2, and AU4, containing 0, 1, 2, or 4 copies, respectively, of the destabilizing AUUUA motif. Using these RNAs, NIPP-1 was identified as an RNA-binding protein by several independent criteria. Thus, North-Western analysis showed a binding of denatured NIPP-1 to bacterial 9 S RNA and to the oligoribonucleotides AU4 and AG1 (Fig. 1, left panel). We were also able to obtain a UV-mediated cross-linking of native NIPP-1 to AU4 (Fig. 1,right panel), and to ompA and 9 S RNA (not shown). Following cross-linking of NIPP-1 to AU4, a radioactive band of 50 ± 1 kDa (n = 4) was detected, which corresponds to the combined masses of NIPP-1 (38.5 kDa) and AU4 (10 kDa). In addition, a radioactive band of 130 ± 4 kDa (n = 4) was detected, which might represent a cross-linked AU4-NIPP-1 dimer. No cross-linking was obtained under identical conditions when bovine serum albumin was used instead of NIPP-1 (Fig. 1, right panel). A binding of NIPP-1 to RNA could also be reproducibly demonstrated by assays of RNA-mobility shifts in native gels, as is illustrated forompA, 9 S RNA, and AU4 in Fig. 2. Under the same conditions, no RNA band shifts were seen with the control proteins casein, myelin basic protein, bovine serum albumin, and PP-1C (not illustrated). The specificity of the interaction between NIPP-1 and AU4 is also illustrated by the effects of NIPP-1 antibodies and of the antigenic peptide on the mobility shift (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by protein kinase A or casein kinase-2, which decreases its potency as an inhibitor of PP-1C (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), had no effect on its ability to induce RNA-mobility shifts (not shown). Since NIPP-1 is associated with PP-1C in the nucleus (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it appeared important to determine whether the complex (PP-1NNIPP-1) also displayed RNA-binding properties. In Fig. 3 A, it is shown that PP-1C did not bind to poly(U)-Sepharose. In contrast, free NIPP-1 (Fig. 3 B) as well as an in vitroreconstituted heterodimeric complex of NIPP-1 and PP-1C(Fig. 3 C) was completely retained by the affinity column. The binding of NIPP-1 and PP-1NNIPP-1 to poly(U)-Sepharose was very strong, since they were not eluted at NaCl concentrations up to 1.5 m. NIPP-1 and PP-1NNIPP-1 could subsequently be eluted, however, with 3 m KSCN. The nonlabeled ribohomopolymers showed a different potency in competing for the binding of NIPP-1 to 5′-end-labeled AU4 at 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Indeed, while poly(G) was not a competitor at concentrations up to 2.5 μg/ml, poly(U) at only 0.02 μg/ml nearly completely prevented the binding of NIPP-1 to AU4. Poly(A) and poly(C) were less potent. At the same concentrations and specific radioactivities, the AUUUA-containing oligoribonucleotides AU1, AU2, and AU4 bound more NIPP-1 than did AG1, where the AUUUA motif is altered into AGGUA (Fig. 5, upper panel). We did not observe a difference in the affinities for AU1, AU2, and AU4, indicating that their binding to NIPP-1 was not affected by the number of the AUUUA motifs. These findings were corroborated by competition assays with nonlabeled probes, showing that AU2 and AU4 were 5–10 times better than AG1 as competitors for binding of NIPP-1 to AU4 (Fig. 5, lower panel). Combined with the data of Fig. 4, this suggests that NIPP-1 preferentially binds to U-rich RNA. We have also compared RNA and DNA as competitors for binding of NIPP-1 to AU2 at 0.15 μg/ml. In Fig. 6it is shown that the oligoribonucleotide AU4 and the corresponding deoxyribonucleotide dAT4 were equally efficient competitors. However, the complementary strand of dAT4, i.e. dTA4, was 5–10 times less efficient and the double-stranded dAT4/dTA4 was completely inefficient at concentrations up 2.5 μg/ml. The above experiments were all performed with bacterial RNAs or with designed synthetic oligonucleotides. However, we found that NIPP-1 bound with similar affinity to AU4 and to AUMYC, which comprises the destabilizing AUUUA-repeat motif of the 3′-untranslated region of c-myc mRNA (17Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), as determined by UV-mediated cross-linking, by AUMYC-mobility shift assays, and by competition for the binding of NIPP-1 to AU4 (not shown). Since the carboxyl-terminal third of NIPP-1 (Ard-1) has been shown to restore the RNase E functions in some rne mutants in E. coli (see Introduction) and since NIPP-1, like bacterial RNase E (15Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), has RNA-binding properties (this work), we have investigated whether NIPP-1 also displays an endoribonuclease activity. All tested preparations of purified recombinant NIPP-1 displayed a weak Mg2+-dependent RNase activity toward AU4 and 9 S RNA (not shown), which are known substrates for RNase E (15Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, this RNase-E-like activity could be detected only at NIPP-1 concentrations above 250 nm (10 μg/ml), i.e.three orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of NIPP-1 that are routinely used for its assay as an inhibitor of PP-1. Moreover, this RNase-E-like activity could be separated from NIPP-1 by gel filtration on Superdex-75. These data indicate that NIPP-1 itself is not an RNase, but co-purifies with trace amounts of an RNase-E-like activity from Sf9 cells. We report here several independent lines of evidence indicating that NIPP-1 is an RNA-binding protein. Thus, NIPP-1 was able to induce RNA-mobility shifts (Figs. 2,4, 5, 6) and could be covalently bound to RNA by UV-mediated cross-linking (Fig. 1). An interaction of NIPP-1 with RNA could also be demonstrated by NorthWestern analysis (Fig. 1) and by affinity chromatography on poly(U)-Sepharose (Fig. 3). Moreover, the RNA binding was shown to be due to a protein with the same size as NIPP-1 (Fig. 1) and was blocked by NIPP-1-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). AU4 and dAT4 were equally efficient competitors for the binding of NIPP-1 to AU2 (Fig. 6), suggesting that NIPP-1 has the same affinity for RNA and single-stranded DNA. On the other hand, NIPP-1 showed a clear preference for U-rich oligonucleotides and displayed no affinity for double-stranded nucleic acids (Figs. 4 and 6). Analysis of the primary structure of NIPP-1 did not reveal the presence of known RNA-binding motifs such as the “RNP” motif, the arginine-rich motif, the RGG box, or the KH motif (18Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). However, it is striking that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal thirds of NIPP-1 are very basic (pI 9–10) and are not needed for the interaction with PP-1C(13Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate on an electrostatic interaction between nucleic acids and the basic extremities of NIPP-1. However, it is clear that additional binding determinants must exist to account for the specificity of the interaction of NIPP-1 with nucleic acids. It is also important to note that the binding of NIPP-1 to both PP-1C (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and to RNA (Fig. 1) could still be observed after SDS-PAGE and blotting of NIPP-1, indicating that the RNA- and PP-1C-binding domains resist denaturing procedures. Since both NIPP-1 and PP-1NNIPP-1 (but not PP-1C) bind to RNA (Fig. 3), we propose that NIPP-1 functions as an RNA-anchoring subunit of PP-1 and enables the phosphatase to dephosphorylate RNA-associated substrates. The activity of PP-1NNIPP-1 would be regulated through phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by protein kinase A and casein kinase-2, which decrease its affinity for PP-1C (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but has no effect on its association with RNA (present work). The proposed association of PP-1NNIPP-1 with RNA agrees with our findings that the holoenzyme is associated with the nuclear insoluble fraction (8Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and can be solubilized by the mere incubation of this fraction with ribohomopolymers.2 The targeting model of PP-1NNIPP-1 is also strikingly similar to that of glycogen-associated PP-1 (PP-1G). Indeed, the latter holoenzyme consists of PP-1C and a glycogen-anchoring G-subunit and the interaction between both polypeptides is controlled by reversible phosphorylation of the G subunit (1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2DePaoli,-Roach A.A. Park I.-K. Cerovsky V. Csortos C. Durbin S.D. Kuntz M.J. Sitikov A.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The RNA-anchoring hypothesis implies that PP-1NNIPP-1 is a physiologically active enzyme. At first glance, this contrasts with findings that NIPP-1 is inhibitory to PP-1C (8Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it is well known that the effects of the regulatory subunits of PP-1 are substrate-dependent. Thus, the G subunit endows PP-1C with synthase phosphatase activity but decreases its phosphorylase phosphatase activity (1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that inhibitor-2 blocks the dephosphorylation of most, but not all substrates of PP-1C (19Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that intact NIPP-1 inhibits the dephosphorylation of all five tested substrates of PP-1C, albeit to a different extent (10Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Also, a 16-kDa fragment of NIPP-1 was inhibitory to the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase, but actually enhanced the dephosphorylation of histone IIA (8Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, it is possible that NIPP-1 is not a true inhibitor of PP-1, but rather acts as a “substrate-specifying” subunit in vivo. The effects of phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by protein kinase A or casein kinase-2 may have to be reinterpreted along the same lines. Indeed, phosphorylation of NIPP-1 reduces its affinity for PP-1C but, depending on the physiological role of NIPP-1, such phosphorylation may cause an activation or inactivation of PP-1NNIPP-1. Among the most likely substrates of PP-1NNIPP-1 are the SR-splicing factors, which have been shown to be dephosphorylated by PP-1C in vitro and to reverse the inhibition of spliceosome assembly by PP-1C (3Mistelli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the described effects of PP-1C on spliceosome assembly and splicing in cell extracts and in permeabilized cells were all obtained at rather high concentrations of the phosphatase (3Mistelli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which may indicate a requirement for a substrate-specifying and -anchoring subunit. It will be interesting to investigate whether NIPP-1 might promote the dephosphorylation of SR proteins by PP-1C. NIPP-1 displayed a particularly high affinity for AUUUA sequences (Fig. 5). These are destabilizing motifs in the 3′-end of short-lived mRNAs encoding human (proto)-oncogenes and growth factors (20Shiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar). The same sequences have recently also been identified as destabilizing motifs in snRNAs (21Fan X.C. Myer V.E. Steitz J.A. Abstracts of the RNA'96, First Annual Meeting of the RNA Society, University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 28–June 2. 1996; : 208Google Scholar). The AUUUA motif is specifically cleaved by RNase E from E. coli as well as from mammalian cells (17Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). InE. coli, RNase E is part of a large RNA-degradation complex, called the degradosome (22Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We speculate therefore that PP-1NNIPP-1 takes part in the control of RNA processing in mammalian cells by the dephosphorylation of polypeptides, like RNase E, that are part of a putative mammalian degradosome. It is also important to point out here that, while NIPP-1 is highly enriched in the nucleus, both cell fractionation (13Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and immunofluorescence studies2 show the existence of a cytoplasmic pool of NIPP-1. Thus, NIPP-1 could control RNA-processing in the cytoplasmic as well as the nuclear cell compartment. V. Feytons, N. Sente and P. Vermaelen are acknowledged for expert technical assistance. We thank Drs. D. Angerer and Dr. J. Kaszuba (Vienna) for helpful advice in setting up the initial RNA-binding experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2075848737,"Approximately 90% of human U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) contains uridine cyclic phosphate (U>p) at its 3′-end (Lund, E., and Dahlberg, J. E. (1992) Science 255, 327–330). We studied the formation of U>p at the 3′ end of human U6 snRNA using an in vitro system where uridylic acid residues are added from UTP precursor and U>p is formed. Analysis of U6 snRNAs with varying number of uridylic acid residues showed that each of these species contains U>p where the phosphate originated from α-phosphate of UTP precursor. The cyclic phosphate formation occurred on U6 snRNA in extracts where essential spliceosomal snRNAs were specifically degraded, thereby indicating that U>p formation is not coupled to pre-mRNA splicing. A subpopulation of human signal recognition particle and mitochondrial RNA processing RNAs isolated from HeLa cells also contained cyclic phosphates at their 3′ ends. These data suggest that U>p in U6 snRNA is unlikely to be related to its participation in splicing of pre-mRNAs. It appears that cyclic phosphate is an intermediate product in the metabolism of these small RNAs. Approximately 90% of human U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) contains uridine cyclic phosphate (U>p) at its 3′-end (Lund, E., and Dahlberg, J. E. (1992) Science 255, 327–330).

A subpopulation of human signal recognition particle and mitochondrial RNA processing RNAs isolated from HeLa cells also contained cyclic phosphates at their 3′ ends. These data suggest that U>p in U6 snRNA is unlikely to be related to its participation in splicing of pre-mRNAs. It appears that cyclic phosphate is an intermediate product in the metabolism of these small RNAs. Many small RNAs are known to participate in important cellular functions. U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) 1The abbreviation used is: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; SRP, signal recognition particle; MRP, mitochondrial RNA processing.1The abbreviation used is: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; SRP, signal recognition particle; MRP, mitochondrial RNA processing. are required co-factors for splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs (1Steitz J.A.

RNA. 1995; 1: 869-885PubMed Google Scholar). RNaseP, U7 RNA, and many snRNAs are necessary for the site-specific cleavage of pre-tRNA (5Stark B.C. Kole R. Bowman E.J. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3717-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), histone pre-mRNA (6Schaufele F. Gilmartin G.M. Bannwarth W. Birnstiel M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), respectively. SRP particles that contain 7SL RNA recognize the signal peptide of the secretory proteins and participate in the secretion of these proteins (9Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). MRP RNA is found mostly in the nucleolus and is required for the accurate 5′ end formation of the ribosomal 5.8 S RNA (10Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4615-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Lygerou Z. Allmang C. Tollervey D. Seraphin B. Science. 1996; 272: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, there are many other small RNAs that are believed to play important roles in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (1Steitz J.A. Black D. Gerke V. Parker K.A. Kramer A. Frendeway D. Keller W. Birnstiel M. Structure and Function of Major and Minor snRNPs. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 115-154Google Scholar, 12Reddy R. Singh R. Prog. Mol. Subcell.

Most RNAs undergo post-transcriptional modifications at their 3′ ends. These modifications include polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNAs (14Edmonds M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and -CCA addition/turnover on tRNAs (15Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic small RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III, such as ribosomal 5 S, U6, SRP, MRP, RNaseP, 7SK, and plant U3 RNA, terminate with 4–5 uridylic acid residues. Although some of them, like 5 S RNAs, retain their 3′ ends and are found in the functional ribosomes with -UUUU-OH or -UUUUU-OH, several others are processed at their 3′ ends and contain sequences slightly different from the original transcripts. Rinke and Steitz (16Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2617-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) identified a small fraction (∼10%) of the total U6 snRNAs that has longer 3′ ends with multiple uridylic acid residues and associates with La protein. Studies in our lab showed that the 3′ end of U6 snRNA in snRNPs specifically get labeled in vitro when [α-32P]UTP is added to the cell extracts (17Reddy R. Henning D. Das G. Harless M. Wright D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 75-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 3′-uridylation of U6 snRNA has also been studied by Hirai et al. (18Hirai H. Lee D.K. Natori S. Sekimizu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 104: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Lund and Dahlberg (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and Tazi et al. (20Tazi J. Forne T. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lund and Dahlberg (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showed that about 90% of the U6 snRNA in human cells contains U>p at its 3′ end, and Brunel and co-workers concluded that this U>p formation is coupled to its involvement in splicing of pre-mRNAs (20Tazi J. Forne T. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Forne T. Labournier E. Rossi F. Gallouzi I. Cathala G. Tazi J. Brunel C. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition to U6 snRNA, many RNAs are known to contain 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate structures. The autolytic products of the hammerhead cleavage of the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (22Prody G.A. Bakos J.T. Buzayan J.M. Schneider I.R. Bruening G. Science. 1986; 231: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and avocado sunblotch viroid RNA (23Hutchins C.J. Rathjen P.D. Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3627-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 24Forster A.G. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 50: 9-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) contain 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates. Several other autolytic motifs, such as hairpin, also cleave to give 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (25Long D.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cleavage of pre-tRNA by an endonuclease results in a 5′ half-molecule containing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (26Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Greer C.L. Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J.

The self-excision of a plant pre-tRNA also results in RNAs containing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (29Weber U. Beier H. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2212-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Shumyatsky et al. (30Shumyatsky G.P. Tillib S.V. Kramerov D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6347-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) analyzed Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (mouse) cell RNAs fractionated on sucrose density gradients and analyzed poly(A)+ RNA isolated from light, intermediate, and heavy fractions. Cyclic phosphates (pC>p and pU>p) were found in the poly(A)+ fraction obtained from the intermediate fraction. The synthesis of these cyclic phosphate-containing RNAs was inhibited by low concentrations of α-amanitin, indicating that cyclic phosphate may be present at the 3′ end of mRNAs. Nilsen and his colleagues studied the human pre-rRNA processing in vitro and found 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate cleavage intermediates (31Hannon G.J. Maroney P.A. Branch A.B. Benenfield B.J. Robertson H.D. Nilsen T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4422-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data show that the formation of cyclic phosphate in RNA is widespread in nature. In this study, we further characterized the formation of cyclic phosphate at the 3′ end of U6 snRNA. We also report that cyclic phosphate is present at the 3′ end of other small RNAs. In addition, the U>p appears to be an intermediate after the removal of a nucleoside from RNAs containing 3′-OH by an exonuclease. Fine chemicals, including nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates, were obtained from Sigma. [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]CTP, and [α-32P]UTP were obtained from Amersham Corp., and [32P]orthophosphate was obtained from ICN. For preparation of uniformly labeled RNAs, HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C with [32P]orthophosphate for 16 h in phosphate-free medium (32Reddy R. Tan E.M. Henning D. Nohga K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1383-1386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 4–8 S RNA was prepared by centrifugation of the whole cell RNA on a sucrose density gradient and pooling the fractions corresponding to 4–8 S RNAs (33Reddy R. Li W.-Y. Henning D. Choi Y.C. Nohga K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNAs were fractionated and purified on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea. DNA dot hybridizations were carried out as described by Kafatos et al. (34Kafatos F.C. Jones C.W. Etstratiadis A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). 5 μg each of cloned DNA was immobilized on nitrocellulose discs and hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h with uniformly 32P-labeled HeLa 4–8 S RNAs. Hybridization solution contained 50% formamide, 80 mmTris, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1.5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.01% SDS, and 5 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The filters were washed at 42 °C with 3 × SSC, 1.5 × SSC, and 0.5 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The hybridized RNAs were eluted with sterile water at 100 °C for 5 min., precipitated in presence of carrier yeast tRNA, and electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The RNAs were digested with nuclease P1 at a 1:1500 (w/w) enzyme to substrate ratio at 37 °C for 30 min. Usually, 30 μg of RNA was digested with 20 ng of nuclease P1 in 25 μl of 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The digests were either spotted on DEAE-cellulose paper and subjected to electrophoresis or spotted on cellulose plate and subjected to chromatography. Digestion with T1 RNase was done in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, at a 1:10 (w/w) enzyme to substrate ratio at 37 °C for 60 min. Labeled standard pU>p was prepared by labeling U>p with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The RNase H digestion of U1 or U2 snRNAs was done according to Black et al. (35Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in this study were 5′-TGCCAGGTAAGTAT-3′ (complementary to U1 snRNA nucleotide 1–14) and 5′-GAACAGATACTACACTTGA-3′ (complementary to U2 snRNA nucleotide 27–45). Electrophoresis on 57–80-cm-long DEAE-cellulose paper was carried out at 500 V for 4–5 h in Savant high voltage electrophoresis unit using 5% acetic acid/ammonium hydroxide buffer, pH 3.5. Chromatography on cellulose plates was performed as described by Silberklang et al.(36Silberklang M. Gillum A.M. Raj Bhandary U.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59B: 58-109Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The first dimension solvent was isobutyric acid/water/ammonium hydroxide (66:33:1, v/v/v), and the second dimension solvent was 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8/ammonium sulfate/n-propanol (100:60:2, v/w/v). In some cases, only the second dimension was performed for the separation of pU and pU>p. As shown earlier by Lund and Dahlberg (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), U6 snRNA from HeLa cells labeled in vivowith [32P]orthophosphate contained pU>p (Fig. 1 D). Incubation of HeLa cell extract with [α-32P]UTP resulted in rapid labeling of U6 snRNA, which was the major labeled RNA (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). The labeled U6 snRNA was then digested with different enzymes and subjected to chromatography. Digestion with nuclease P1 yielded pU and pU>p (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), and digestion with nuclease P1 followed by alkaline phosphatase resulted in Pi and U>p (Fig. 1 B,lane 4). When the nuclease P1 digest was fractionated by two-dimensional chromatography, radioactivity was observed in pU>p, pU, and pUp (Fig. 1 C). In several independent experiments, the amount of pU>p and pUp were 10–30 and 1–2% of the total radioactivity, respectively. The isolation and subsequent digestion of pU>p with alkaline phosphatase yielded two labeled spots corresponding to Pi and U>p (data not shown). These data show that some of the U6 snRNA 3′ ends formed in vitro contain U>p; in addition, these data show that both the 5′- and 3′-phosphate residues in pU>p originated from the labeled α-phosphate of the precursor UTP. Addition of [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP to HeLa cell extract resulted in labeling of tRNA 3′ ends (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). Digestion of labeled tRNA with nuclease P1 yielded only pC or pA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2), and no detectable cyclic phosphate was found. These data show that formation of cyclic phosphate is specific to U6 snRNA and does not occur in all cases where nucleotides are added to the 3′ end of RNAs. Previous data showed that there are multiple U6 snRNAs differing in the number of uridylic acid residues at the 3′ end (16Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2617-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Das G. Henning D. Wright D. Reddy R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When labeled U6 snRNA was fractionated on a short polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), multiple U6 snRNA species did not separate. To facilitate separation of U6 snRNA differing in number of uridylic acid residues at the 3′ end, the U6 snRNA labeled in vitro (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) was digested with T1 RNase to completion and then fractionated by electrophoresis on a long 20% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). A U6 snRNA T1 RNase digestion fragment corresponding to the 3′ end with four U residues was electrophoresed to serve as a standard (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). The position of this fragment was designated as 0, because this fragment with four uridylic acid residues represents the U6 snRNA transcript as transcribed by RNA polymerase III (37Das G. Henning D. Wright D. Reddy R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 38Sakonju S. Bogenhagen D. Brown D.D. Cell. 1980; 19: 13-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 39Kunkel G.R. Maser R. Calvet J. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8575-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thirteen labeled bands were visualized with varying intensities; these fragments correspond to seven additional U residues to five deleted nucleotides when compared with U6 snRNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III. These labeled RNA fragments were purified and analyzed for the presence of cyclic phosphate. Both longer and shorter U6 snRNA forms contained U>p (Fig. 2 B). These data show that the presence of U>p is not restricted to mature U6 snRNA with 4–5 uridylic acid residues. Taziet al. (20Tazi J. Forne T. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) studied the formation of U>p at the 3′ end of U6 snRNA and concluded that U>p formation is coupled to an event arising during splicing. Complementary oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage was employed to degrade U1 or U2 snRNAs, which are essential for splicing of pre-mRNAs (35Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the analysis of snRNAs after targeted degradation. There was no detectable intact U1 snRNA when oligonucleotide complementary to U1 snRNA was added (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), and a similar result was obtained when U2 snRNA was targeted (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). These data show that essential snRNAs were effectively degraded by this procedure. Next, the U1 and U2 snRNA depleted extracts were used for 3′ end labeling of U6 snRNA in vitro (Fig. 3 B). The labeled U6 snRNAs from the control (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) and snRNA-depleted extracts (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3) were purified and analyzed for the presence of U>p. There was U>p formation in each case, and the amounts of pU>p in the control, U1, and U2 oligonucleotide-treated extracts were 29, 23, and 22% of total radioactivity, respectively (Fig. 3 C,lanes 1–3). These data show that the formation of U>p at the 3′ end of U6 snRNA does not require its participation in the splicing of pre-mRNAs. Because the cyclic phosphate formation is occurring in RNP particles, the marginal reduction in pU>p formation upon U1 and U2 oligonucleotide treatment may be due to nonobligate linkage of cyclic phosphate formation to pre-mRNA splicing (see “Discussion”). HeLa cell 4–8 S RNA uniformly labeled with [32P]orthophosphate was fractionated on a 50-cm-long polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 4 A). Two distinct bands of roughly equal intensity were observed for SRP RNA (also known as 7SL RNA), the RNA component of the SRP. The faster migrating band was designated SRP-1 RNA, and the slower band was designated SRP-2 RNA. Similar results were obtained with MRP RNA (also known as 7SM or 7–2 RNA). There were two bands of similar intensity where one was designated MRP-1 RNA and the other was designated MRP-2 RNA. Hybrid selection was carried out to confirm that these four distinct bands correspond to SRP or MRP RNAs. Human SRP DNA immobilized on nitrocellulose paper hybrid-selected both SRP-1 and SRP-2 RNAs (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), and human MRP DNA hybrid-selected both MRP-1 and MRP-2 RNAs (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). These data provide evidence for the identity of these RNAs. Under similar experimental conditions, U6 snRNA also fractionated into two major bands and several slower migrating bands of less intensity (Fig. 4 B, lane 4), whereas 7SK RNA electrophoresed as one band (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). The SRP and MRP RNAs were purified, digested with nuclease P1, and fractionated on a DEAE-cellulose paper. The SRP RNA is not known to contain any modified nucleotides (33Reddy R. Li W.-Y. Henning D. Choi Y.C. Nohga K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, only pppG and mononucleotides were expected. However, in addition to pppG and mononucleotides, another labeled compound comigrating with pU>p was observed. This spot was more prominent in the SRP-1 RNA species than SRP-2 RNA (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained when MRP-1 and MRP-2 RNAs were analyzed after nuclease P1 treatment. The faster migrating MRP-1 RNA species contained significantly greater quantities of pU>p than MRP-2 RNA (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2). As controls, human U6 snRNA and ribosomal 5 S RNA were also analyzed after nuclease P1 digestion. As expected, a spot consistent with pU>p was observed in U6 snRNA (Fig. 4 C, lane 6), whereas there was no detectable pU>p in 5 S RNA (Fig. 4 C, lane 5). The nuclease P1 digests of SRP-1 RNA and MRP-1 RNA were also subjected to two-dimensional chromatography, and in both cases pU>p was observed (Fig. 5, A and B). These data show that in addition to U6 snRNA, a subset of SRP and MRP RNAs also contain U>p. The main findings of this study are: 1) U>p is not restricted to mature U6 snRNA with 4–5 uridylic acid residues because longer and shorter U6 snRNA species contain U>p; 2) Splicing is not required for the formation of U>p at the 3′ end of U6 snRNA. These data and data from other investigators are consistent with a mechanism shown in Fig. 6 where trimming and addition of uridylic acid residues to the 3′ end of U6 snRNA is constantly occurring in a dynamic equilibrium. In addition, this mechanism also implies that U>p is an intermediate in the trimming process. The evidence for this mechanism is as follows. This mechanism (Fig. 6) predicts three populations of U6 snRNA: 3′-OH, 3′-p, and 2′,3′>p. These products are formed in vitro and have been identified by us in this study and also by other investigators (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Tazi J. Forne T. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because [α-32P]UTP is the source of the radioactivity and is added to the 3′-OH of U6 snRNA, the necessary RNA substrates with 3′-OH should be present in vitro. These substrates varied from 1 to 10 U residues (see Fig. 2 A, lane 2). We found that the 3′-p in pU>p was also labeled (Fig. 1 B, lane 4); and this is possible only by the addition of UMP and the subsequent removal of a nucleoside. Therefore, these data provide evidence for a trimming reaction in vitro involving deletion of a nucleoside. Though the yield was rather low (1–2%), we also found pUp (Fig. 1 C), which is a result of decyclization of U>p. Removal of the 2′,3′-cyclization is required to make the 3′-OH group available for the elongation reaction. The fact that U6 snRNAs-1 to -5 species were found to be labeled in vitro (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) shows that the U6 snRNAs where nucleotides are deleted are also used for elongation in vitro. These data are also consistent with the observation of Lund and Dahlberg (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), who showed that the terminal nucleotides of U6 snRNA are turning over in a nontemplate-dependent manner. The predicted intermediates with 3′-OH, 3′-p, and 2′,3′>p are also found in vivo. The identification of U6 snRNA with up to about 20 U residues (16Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2617-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) shows that necessary U6 snRNA substrates for the addition of uridylic acid residues are available in vivo. Because only RNAs with 3′-OH are substrates for the addition of uridylic acids, different sizes of these U6 snRNAs must be present in vivo. We also prepared cDNAs of U6 snRNA obtained from immunoprecipitates of La antibodies and sequenced them. Some of the resulting cloned cDNAs contained more as well as less than 4–5 U residues as predicted from mature and predominant form of human U6 snRNA. 2Y. Chen and R. Reddy, unpublished data. U6 snRNA with 3′-p was also found in several species in vivo (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In yeast U6 snRNA, the 3′-p containing population was predominant. In fruit fly, the 3′-OH, 3′-p, and 2′,3′>p populations were present at a ratio of 1:1:1. Therefore, the U6 snRNA in vivo has three populations with 3′-OH, 3′-p, and 2′,3′>p. These data are consistent with the proposed mechanism shown in Fig. 6. The enzymes involved in the trimming and elongation of the 3′ end of U6 snRNA are not known. An enzymatic activity capable of forming cyclic phosphate at the 3′ end of RNAs has been characterized from HeLa cells (40Filipowicz W. Vincente O. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the RNA substrate for this enzyme requires a 3′-phosphate, which is then converted into a cyclic phosphate. In the case of U6 snRNA, the 3′-cyclic phosphate originates from the 5′-α-phosphate of the pppU used as the precursor. Therefore, enzymes involved in the cyclic phosphate formation in U6 snRNA should be different from this enzyme characterized by Filipowicz and Vincente (40Filipowicz W. Vincente O. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). There are many instances where an endonuclease or self-cleavage of RNA results in RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate at the 3′ ends (see Introduction). In fact, any time the ester bond between 3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl group in an RNA molecule is cleaved, the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate is the initial product. However, the cyclic phosphate formation in U6 snRNA 3′ end could not be due to the action of an endonuclease. Because our data identified a series of cyclic phosphate-containing U6 snRNAs that differ by one nucleotide in length, it appears that an exonuclease deletes a terminal nucleoside with a cleavage of the ester bond between 3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl resulting in the formation of cyclic phosphate. Data from our lab (17Reddy R. Henning D. Das G. Harless M. Wright D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 75-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other groups (20Tazi J. Forne T. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown that this 3′ end modification is occurring in RNP particles, and it is likely that the enzymes responsible for 3′ end modification in U6 snRNA recognize one or more proteins associated with U6 snRNA. It would be necessary to reconstitute U6 snRNPs in vitro for characterization and eventual purification of the various enzymes involved in this modification. Tazi et al. (20Tazi J. Forne T.

Our data show that the formation of spliceosome and U6 snRNA participation in the splicing are not required for the U>p formation at its 3′ end. The 3′ end turnover and U>p formation of U6 snRNA may be occurring within the spliceosome; however, our data indicate that it may be incidental to U6 snRNA being present, and U>p formation is not coupled to its participation in splicing. The observation of Lund and Dahlberg (19Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that U6 snRNA in some species has very little U>p at its 3′ end is also indicative that U>p is not likely to be functionally relevant or coupled to a step in splicing of pre-mRNAs. In addition, the presence of U>p at the 3′ ends of SRP and MRP RNAs, whose function is unrelated to splicing of pre-mRNAs, also suggests that U>p formation is more likely to be related to the metabolism of these small RNAs.

Separation of reverse transcriptase (RT) into polymerase and RNase H domains yields an active RNase H from murine leukemia virus (MuLV) but an inactive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNase H. The “handle region” present in E. coliRNase HI but absent in HIV RNase H contributes to the binding to its substrate and when inserted into HIV RNase H results in an active enzyme retaining some degree of specificity. Here, we show MuLV protein containing the C-terminal 175 amino acids with its own handle region or that of E. coli RNase HI has the same specific activity as the RNase H of RT, retains a preference for Mn2+ as the cation required for activity, and has association rate (KA) 10% that of E. coli RNase HI. However, with model substrates, specificities for removal of the tRNAPro primer and polypurine tract stability are lost, indicating specificity of RNase H of MuLV requires the remainder of the RT. Differences in KA, while significant, appear insufficient to account for the differences in specific activities of the bacterial and viral RNases H.

Reverse transcriptases (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase(s); AKR-MuLV: murine leukemia virus from the AKR strain of mice; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PPT, polypurine tract; nt, nucleotide(s); PBS, primer binding site; AEA, C-175-AkR-RNase H withE. coli handle region.1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase(s); AKR-MuLV: murine leukemia virus from the AKR strain of mice; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PPT, polypurine tract; nt, nucleotide(s); PBS, primer binding site; AEA, C-175-AkR-RNase H withE. coli handle region. are enzymes responsible for copying the retroviral genomic RNA into double-stranded DNA by a process involving both the polymerase and RNase H of the RT (1). For human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), RT comprises a heterodimeric protein consisting of p66 and p51 subunits (2di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S.

The p51 polypeptide is derived from p66 by proteolysis, removing the C-terminal (p15) RNase H domain. Both polymerase and RNase H catalytic sites are contributed by p66, with p51 acting primarily as a structural polypeptide (5Le Grice S.F. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Hostomsky Z. Hostomska Z. Fu T.B. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3179-3182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated p51 protein has very poor polymerase activity and, of course, no RNase H activity. Linker-scanning mutations in HIV-1 RT (7Prasad V.R. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4440-4452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RT of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) differs from that of HIV-1 RT in that it is isolated as a single polypeptide chain of 76 kDa (11Herr W. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 471-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to form dimers when bound to nucleic acids (12Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, MuLV RT can be divided into two separate polypeptides; the N-terminal two-thirds portion of the protein has very good polymerase activity and a protein from the C-terminal one-third is reported to be an active RNase H (14Tanese N. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). RNase H activity is essential for retroviral replication (15Mizrahi V. Usdin M.T.

In vivo studies demonstrate that inactivation of RNase H results in production of noninfectious virions (24Repaske R. Hartley J.W. Kavlick M.F. O'Neill R.R. Austin J.B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schatz O. Cromme F. Naas T. Lindemann D. Mous J. Le Grice S.F.J.

Amino acid sequence comparison shows that HIV and MuLV retroviral RNases H share about 25% of their sequence with Escherichia coli RNase HI (27Johnson M.S. McClure M.A. Feng D.-F. Gary J. Doolittle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7648-76527Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Much greater similarity is found when comparing the three-dimensional structures of E. coli RNase HI (28Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.J. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 29Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M. Matsushima M. Ishikawa M. Kanaya S. Ikehara M. Matsuzaki T. Morikawa K.

Jordan S. Mathews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A significant exception to the structural similarity is the presence of an additional handle region in E. coli RNase HI (helices αB, αC, and αD) not found in the corresponding region of HIV-1 p15, which contains only helices αB and αD. Several studies demonstrate that αC is rich in basic amino acids and contributes significantly to binding to RNA-DNA hybrids (31Kanaya S. Katsuda-Nakai C. Ikehara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11621-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Haruki M. Noguchi E. Kanaya S. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22015-22022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One construct ofE. coli RNase HI was made in which the handle region is missing and in which enzymatic activity is lost due, in part, to a decrease in binding to RNA-DNA hybrids by more than 3 orders of magnitude (32Haruki M. Noguchi E. Kanaya S. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22015-22022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In another case, an E. coli RNase HI protein with a different connection of the αB and αD helices retains some enzymatic activity but only in the presence of Mn2+ ions (33Keck J.L. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A protein containing only the p15 domain has no RNase H activity (34Becerra S.P. Clore G.M.

Moomaw W.W. Nodes B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or part of the connection region (37Smith J.S. Gritsman K. Roth R.M.J. J.

Wingfield P.T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and (iii) inserting the αC region from the E. coli RNase HI (39Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Vikic-Topic S.

A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One somewhat surprising result obtained with the active HIV-1 RNase H proteins is their ability to cleave model tRNA primer substrates at the same site as intact RT, suggesting that at least some of the specificity elements for cleavage are present in these polymerase minus RNases H (37Smith J.S. Gritsman K. Roth R.M.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5721-5729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4037-4049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D.

A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of MuLV RNase H has not yet been elucidated, but amino acid sequence alignment predicts that this RNase H has a handle region, consisting of αB, αC, and αD, similar to E. coliRNase HI (28Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.J. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 29Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M. Matsushima M. Ishikawa M. Kanaya S. Ikehara M. Matsuzaki T. Morikawa K. Nature. 1990; 347: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Compared with E. coli RNase HI, MuLV reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H activity is very low, whether associated with the polymerase domain or not. Furthermore, the RNase H activity of MuLV RT prefers Mn2+, and MuLV RT cleaves replication intermediates essential for retroviral replication at specific sites that are different from those E. coli RNase HI cleaves (21Champoux J.J. Gilboa E. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 686-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Smith J.K. Cywinski A. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 314-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the biochemical properties of the C-terminal RNase H of MuLV RT. To further our understanding of retroviral RNases H, we have examined the C-terminal 175 amino acid portion of MuLV RT (C175-AKR-RNase H) for its activity, its binding to RNA-DNA hybrids, and its specificity of cleavage. For specificity studies, we have used a model tRNA primer site, the polypurine tract (PPT), a fragment of mRNA for ovalbumin annealed to a complementary DNA oligonucleotide, and a homopolymeric poly(rA)·poly(dT). The E. coli strain MIC1066 (rnhA-339::cat recB270(TS)) (41Cerritelli S.M. Shin D.Y. Chen H.C. Gonzales M. Crouch R.J. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1993; 75: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was used to over-produce the C175-AKR-RNase H (AKR is the strain of mice from which the virus was isolated), AEA (C175-AKR-RNase H with the E. coli RNase HI “handle region”), in addition to E. coli RNase HI. Bacterially expressed AKR-MuLV reverse transcriptase and a polyclonal antibody against N-terminal AKR-MuLV RNase H were kind gifts from Dr. Judith Levin at NICHD, National Institutes of Health (42Post K. Guo J. Kalman E. Uchida T. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5508-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Mega RNA transcription kit was from Ambion. Expression vectors pET15b(+) and pET21a(+), biotinylated protease thrombin, streptavidin-agarose, and His-Bind® resin were from Novagen. The Western Light™ chemiluminescent detection system was from Tropix, Inc. RNA36 oligonucleotide (5′)-biotin-GGGAUCAGUGGUUCCCAUAUCCCGGACGAGCCCCCA-(3′) was synthesized by Oligos Etc. Inc. A partially complementary DNA36(TGGGGGCTCTGCCGGGATATGGGAACCACTGATCCC) was from BioServe. The ultrapure Sequagel sequencing system was from National Diagnostics, and 6 and 8% gel mix were from Life Technologies, Inc. The sensor chip CM5, Tween P20, and amine coupling kit were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Streptavidin and biotin were from Pierce. The DNA segment encoding Met1 to Val155 of E. coli RNase HI and Leu496 to Leu671 of the pol gene of AKR-MuLV (11Herr W. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 471-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was modified by adding restriction sites (NdeI and EspI) and cloned either into the pET15b(+) vector, which expresses a His6-tag at the N terminus of the target proteins, or into the pET21a(+) vector for expression of proteins without His6-tag. The AEA plasmid carries the DNA of AKR-MuLV encoding amino acids Leu496 to Tyr581, the E. coli RNase HI sequence for Thr69 to His114, followed by AKR-MuLV Arg629 to Leu671. Four-liter cultures of MIC1066 harboring the C175-AKR-RNase H, chimeric RNase H (AEA), or E. coli RNase HI plasmids were grown at 32 °C to anA600 value about 0.8 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 32 °C. Cells were harvested and sonicated in loading buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-micron filter and loaded on a 1-ml His-Bind® resin. The column was washed with 10 ml of loading buffer and 10 ml of washing buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The His6-tagged C175-AKR-RNase H, AEA, and E. coli RNase HI were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After dialysis against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), samples were applied to consecutively connected high performance liquid chromatography columns of TSK gels DEAE-5PW (7.5 × 75 mm) and SP-5PW (7.5 × 75 mm). The His6-tagged C175-AKR-RNase H was present in the flow-through fraction, and the His6-tagged E. coli RNase HI bound to the SP column, eluting at about 150 mm NaCl from a 50 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient, and the chimeric AEA RNase H bound to the SP column, eluting in a manner similar to the E. coli protein. The proteins of interest were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a filtron device (cutoff, 10 kDa). Enzymes were stored at −70 °C in a solution containing 45% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Removal of His6tag was performed by treating 100 μg of His6-tagged proteins with 1 unit of biotinylated thrombin protease at 25 °C for several hours. His-Bind® resin was added to the reaction mixture and mixed for 30 min at room temperature. After spinning, the supernatant containing the protein without His6-tag was further mixed with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose slurry for another 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer A. RNase H activity with α-32P-labeled poly(rA)·poly(dT) as substrate was determined essentially as described (43Dirksen M.-L. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11569-11573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by measuring trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. In situ renaturation gel assays were performed as described (44Carl P.L. Bloom L. Crouch R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 28-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four different substrates were used to determine differences in products generated by the various enzymes. Details of the conditions of the assays are given in the figure legends for each substrate. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the products was performed according to Zhan et al. (45Zhan X. Tan C.-K. Scott W.A. Mian A.M. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The substrate for minus-strand primer removal assay was prepared according to Smith and Roth (38Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4037-4049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Stahlet al. (39Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Vikic-Topic S. Crouch R.J. Wingfield P.T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The uniformly [α-32P]CTP-labeled polypurine substrate was synthesized according to Guo et al. (13Guo J. Wu W. Yuan Z.Y. Post K. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5018-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and uniformly [α-32P]CTP-labeled ovalbumin mRNA160was prepared as described by Oyama et al. (46Oyama F. Kikuchi R. Crouch R.J. Uchida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18808-18817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Postet al. (42Post K. Guo J. Kalman E. Uchida T. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5508-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The final products were visualized after electrophoresis on a 6 or 8% sequencing gel by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat film or were exposed to a phosphor screen and quantified using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). The 5′-biotinylated RNA36oligonucleotide was annealed to its complementary DNA36oligonucleotide at a ratio 1:20 in the diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated HBS buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween P20, a non-ionic detergent). A sensor chip with streptavidin-modified surface was first immobilized with 20 μl of RNA-DNA hybrid and then blocked with biotin (for details see Ref. 32Haruki M. Noguchi E. Kanaya S. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22015-22022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 45 μl of four different concentrations of RNase H, which were dialyzed against to HBS buffer before analysis, were injected onto the RNA-DNA surface at 20 μl/min. The surface was regenerated with one injection of 10 μl of 2 m NaCl. The sensorgrams were analyzed by subtracting sensorgrams obtained from the control surface, in which a sensor chip is loaded with streptavidin followed by biotin but not with RNA-DNA. Kinetic constants were calculated using BIAcore™ evaluation software (see also Ref. 32Haruki M. Noguchi E. Kanaya S. Crouch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22015-22022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar for details). RNases H of E. coli, C175-AKR-RNase H, and chimeric AEA were purified from E. coli MIC1066 (rnhA-339::cat recB270(TS)) to ensure that only the overexpressed proteins contribute to the activity observed. Versions of both proteins with or without an N-terminal His6-tag were studied. Purification of the His6-tagged proteins was facilitated by affinity chromatography using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns. Results of analysis of the purified proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are shown in Fig. 1 as follows: a shows a Coomassie-stained gel, and bshows a renaturation gel assay for RNase H activity. E. coliRNase H labeled with the His6-tag purified essentially as it would without the His6-tag. Expression of the C175-AKR-RNase H enzyme is relatively poor, and therefore, we purified the His6-tagged version of this protein and, in some studies, removed the His6-tag by proteolysis with thrombin. C175-AKR-RNase H is found in the flow-through of both DEAE and SP columns, in contrast to the E. coli protein, which flows through the DEAE column but binds to the SP column, eluting at around 150 mm NaCl. Some preparations of the C175-AKR-RNase H contain small amounts of a 12-kDa protein corresponding to the N-terminal portion of C175-AKR-RNase H, as judged by its binding to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and its interaction with antisera directed against the N-terminal portion of the RNase H region. This fragment probably results from cleavage at a site previously shown to be susceptible to proteolysis in E. coli when AKR-MuLV reverse transcriptase is expressed and purified (47Levin J.G. Crouch R.J. Post K. Hu S.C. McKelvin D. Zweig M. Court D. Gerwin B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4376-4380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect any contribution of this AKR-MuLV fragment to RNase H activity or to binding to RNA-DNA hybrids. The chimeric AEA RNase H purifies in a similar manner to C175-AKR-RNase H and appears to be homogeneous (data not shown). For simplicity in the presentation in the figures, the C175-AKR-RNase H is designated as A, E. coliRNase HI as E, and the chimeric RNase H asAEA. Previous studies of MuLV RNase H have been more qualitative than quantitative but demonstrate clearly that this domain has RNase H activity (14Tanese N. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One rather novel feature of MuLV reverse transcriptase is a strong preference for Mn2+ (2.5 mm) rather than Mg2+ (5 mm) as the divalent cation when assaying for either polymerization or RNase H activity. To examine activity and metal ion preference, we assayed the C175-AKR-RNase H using poly(rA)·poly(dT) as substrate. The purified soluble C175-AKR-RNase H degrades RNA, preferring Mn2+ over Mg2+ as the divalent cation (Table Iand Fig. 2). Products of C175-AKR-RNase H digestion of poly(rA)·poly(dT) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and quantified using Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant (Table I). The specific activity of the C175-AKR-RNase H is very similar to MuLV reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H activity with a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ (about 10–20-fold) but differs significantly from that of E. coliRNase HI, which prefers Mg2+ over Mn2+ more than 150-fold.Table ISpecific activities using magnesium and manganeseEnzymeMg2+Mn2+Mg2+/Mn2+E. coli RNase HI7.25 × 104401180C175-AKR RNase H28.95200.06AKR MuLV RT261920.14RNase H activity was assayed in 20 μl using 5 pmol32P-labeled poly(rA)·poly(dT) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of either 5 mm Mg2+ or 2.5 mmMn2+. Products were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and quantified using ImageQuant. Specific activities are nmol of product migrating at <20 nt/mg of RNase H in 10 min. Open table in a new tab RNase H activity was assayed in 20 μl using 5 pmol32P-labeled poly(rA)·poly(dT) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of either 5 mm Mg2+ or 2.5 mmMn2+. Products were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and quantified using ImageQuant. Specific activities are nmol of product migrating at <20 nt/mg of RNase H in 10 min. The size distribution of products obtained with poly(rA)· poly(dT) as substrate differs markedly depending on the enzyme (Fig. 2). Since the specific activity of each enzyme is different, various amounts of RNase H were added, and the samples were removed at various times and products analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. The distribution of products in either Mg2+ or Mn2+ is very similar when AKR-MuLV RT provides the RNase H activity with the most abundant products at 10 min being 17- and 18-mer. At later times, when little or no initial substrate remains, smaller products accumulate. E. coli RNase HI products are significantly smaller than those seen with AKR-MuLV RT using Mg2+ as cation and are even smaller when Mn2+ is present in the reaction. C175-AKR-RNase H (A in Fig. 2) generates a very different set of products from RT in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ with a long ladder of oligomers of increasing length at 30 min (lane 3) and products ranging from monomers to 14-mers at 150 min (lane 4). In contrast to E. coli RNase HI, C175-AKR-RNase H gives larger products in the presence of Mn2+, almost as large as those seen with AKR-MuLV RT (lanes 4). To examine cleavage of a well characterized mRNA substrate for E. coli and MuLV RNases H, we used a portion of the ovalbumin mRNA (RNA160) annealed to a 20-mer DNA primer, which starts 2 nt away from the 3′-end of the RNA (Fig. 3). Experiments performed with this and subsequent substrates used Mg2+ as the divalent cation, since it is thought to be the relevant ion in vivo. From previous studies (42Post K. Guo J. Kalman E. Uchida T. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5508-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 46Oyama F. Kikuchi R. Crouch R.J. Uchida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18808-18817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is known that cleavage of RNA160 is due to binding of the polymerase active site at the 3′-OH of the d20-mer, placing the RNase H active site 15 base pairs from the 3′-OH giving an RNA product of 153 nucleotides (5- and 10-min time points for RT in Fig. 3). Incubation for longer times yielded additional products resulting from 3′-OH-independent cleavages (40-min RT in Fig. 3). E. coli RNase HI degrades this substrate very differently from RT-RNase H with some products arising from hydrolysis as close as three base pairs from the 3′-OH of the d20-mer. C175-AKR-RNase H gives products very similar to E. coliRNase HI; particularly notable is the absence of the 153-nt product seen with RT. The primer of minus-strand DNA of RT of MuLV is from a tRNAPro annealed to a site some 145 nt from the 5′-end of the genomic RNA of MuLV. Synthesis of the first strand of DNA is followed by initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis at the polypurine tract (PPT). Replication of the tRNAPro-primer yields an RNA-DNA hybrid that is cleaved by RT-RNase H removing the tRNAPro. To test for C175-AKR-RNase H specificity, we used a model substrate tRNAPro, similar to those used by Smith and Roth (38Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4037-4049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Stahl et al. (39Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Vikic-Topic S. Crouch R.J. Wingfield P.T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), to analyze tRNALys3 removal by the RNase H of HIV-1. This substrate is a synthetic d69-mer with a primer binding site sequence (PBS) at its 3′-terminus to which is annealed an 18-mer RNA containing the 3′-terminal tRNAPro sequence complementary to the PBS. The Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I is used to synthesize and label (using [α-32P]dGTP) the model substrate (Fig. 4). This defined substrate has an RNA-DNA hybrid with an RNA-DNA covalent junction similar to the natural in vivo substrate. RNase H of MuLV reverse transcriptase cleaves similar substrates to produce two products, one with a single ribonucleotide A attached to the DNA and a second which has the ribonucleotide A removed, resulting from hydrolysis at the RNA-DNA junction (48Schultz"

When cells are stimulated with supramaximal concentrations of ATP, although the initial [Ca2+]i increase is similar over a range of 30, 100, and 300 μm ATP, the rate of the return to basal [Ca2+]i level is faster in cells treated with higher concentrations of ATP. This probably results from differences in Ca2+ influx rather than Ca2+release, since the influx of the unidirectional Ca2+surrogates Ba2+ and Mn2+ also exhibit similar responses. Furthermore, while 300 μm ATP had an inhibitory effect on the thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry, 30 μm ATP potentiated the response. However, the inhibitory action of 300 μm ATP was blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, such as GF 109203X and chelerythrine, and the potentiating action of 30 μmATP was blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors H89 and Rp-cAMPS. The PKC inhibitors also slowed the decay rate of the Ca2+response induced by 300 μm ATP, and the PKA inhibitors increased it when induced by 30 μm ATP. In the measurements of PKA and PKC activity, 30 μm ATP activates only PKA, while 300 μm ATP activates both kinases. Taken together, these data suggest that the changes in the ATP-induced Ca2+ response result from differential modulation of ATP-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry by PKC and PKA in HL-60 cells.

Taken together, these data suggest that the changes in the ATP-induced Ca2+ response result from differential modulation of ATP-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry by PKC and PKA in HL-60 cells. Extracellular ATP evokes many physiological effects such as platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, inflammation, and muscle contraction in numerous cell types (1Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). These various effects of ATP are mediated by plasma membrane P2 purinergic receptors (2Dubyak G.R. Cowen D.S. Meuller L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18108-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Six subtypes of P2 purinergic receptors, P2X, P2Y, P2D, P2T, P2Z, and P2U, were identified in pharmacological and functional studies and supported by cloning data (3Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that in HL-60 cells extracellular ATP increases the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+concentration; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel; fura-2/AM, fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); Rp-cAMPS, 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphothioate.via plasma membrane P2U and P2X1 type receptors (4Dubyak G.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2659-2664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that extracellular ATP elevates cAMP through a novel type of receptor (6Choi S.Y. Kim K.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The P2U receptor is functionally coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) through pertussis toxin-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. The IP3 produced increases the [Ca2+]i by mobilizing Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+stores. This Ca2+ mobilization activates the plasma membrane Ca2+ influx pathway through Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC) and is termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 8Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The degree of Ca2+ entry is determined by the filling status of the intracellular Ca2+ store. The P2X1 receptor triggers entry of cations; however, it has been shown that the activity is very weak in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Thus, ATP increases intracellular Ca2+ in HL-60 cells by mobilizing it from the intracellular stores and by influx from the extracellular space. We observed a different rate of decrease in the Ca2+ response, while the peak level remained the same, when HL-60 cells were stimulated with supramaximal concentrations of ATP. There are several mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ removal from the cytosol after the elevation of the [Ca2+]i. These mechanisms include sequestering of Ca2+ into intracellular stores, binding to various Ca2+-binding proteins, and actions by the Ca2+ pump and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (9Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1897; 56: 395-433Crossref Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Among these, the Ca2+ pump, which transports ions across the plasma membrane and into intracellular stores, plays a critical role in reducing the elevated [Ca2+]i. The plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger also plays an important role in the control of the intracellular free Ca2+concentration, exchanging three Na+ for one Ca2+. It appears to have a lower affinity for Ca2+ than the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump and a high capacity for removing increased Ca2+. Thus it operates efficiently when [Ca2+]i is increased beyond 10−8m. A number of Ca2+-binding proteins are also involved in buffering the cytosolic Ca2+concentration. We studied the mechanism by which the different patterns of decrease in Ca2+ occur upon stimulation with supramaximal concentrations of ATP in HL-60 cells. Our results suggest that this difference is not due to the cytosolic Ca2+removal system, but that it is instead mainly due to changes in capacitative Ca2+ entry by actions of PKA and PKC, which are differentially activated by ATP itself.

Fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and [3H]IP3 and [γ-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products. PMA, chelerythrine, Rp-cAMPS, GF 109203X, KN62, and benzamil were obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA), and 1.4-dithiothreitol was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). H89 was purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan), and P81 phosphocellulose paper was purchased from Whatman. Nonidet P-40 was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) plus 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i level was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 as reported previously (10Suh B.C. Kim K.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were incubated with 3 μmfura-2/AM in complete medium at 37 °C with stirring for 60 min. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in the incubation medium was 0.3%. After the loading, cells were washed twice with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 2.2 mmCaCl2, 5.6 mm KCl, 5.0 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) to remove extracellular dye. Sulfinpyrazone was added to the washing solution to a final concentration of 250 μm to prevent dye leakage (11Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The fluorescence ratio was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and at an emission wavelength of 500 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to Grynkiewiczet al. (12Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In Ca2+-free experiments, cells were bathed in Ca2+-free Locke's solution (156.2 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 5.0 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) instead of Ca2+-containing Locke's solution. Cells loaded with fura-2/AM as described above were stimulated with ATP in the presence of 2 mm Mn2+, and fluorescence quenching was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, which is an isosbestic wavelength, and at an emission wavelength of 500 nm (13Sage S.O. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). IP3mobilization was determined by competition assay with [3H]IP3 in binding to IP3-binding protein as described previously (14Suh B.C. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine IP3production, 2 × 106 cells per sample were harvested and stimulated with ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mmEGTA. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was obtained. The trichloroacetic acid was removed by three extractions with diethyl ether. The final extract was neutralized with 200 mm Trizma base and its pH adjusted to about 7.4. 20 μl of the cell extract was added to 20 μl of assay buffer (0.1m Tris buffer containing 4 mm EDTA) and 20 μl of [3H]IP3 (0.1 μCi/ml). Finally, 20 μl of binding protein solution was added. The IP3-binding protein was prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Challiss et al. (15Challiss R.A. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of water and 1 ml of scintillation mixture were added to the pellet to measure the radioactivity. The IP3concentration of the sample was determined by comparison with a standard curve and expressed as picomoles/mg of protein. The total cellular protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method after sonication of 2 × 106 cells. Intracellular cAMP was determined by measuring the formation of [3H]cAMP from [3H]adenine nucleotide pools as we have described previously (16Suh B.C. Lee C.O. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in complete medium and loaded with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml) for 24 h. After the loading, cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then stimulated with agonist. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 1 μm cold cAMP. [3H]cAMP and [3H]ATP were separated by sequential chromatography on Dowex AG50W-X4 (200–400 mesh) cation exchanger and neutral alumina column. The increase in intracellular cAMP was calculated as [3H]cAMP/([3H]ATP + [3H]cAMP) × 103. PKA activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into the PKA-specific peptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), using a procedure described previously (17Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 18Davies W.A. Berghorn K.A. Albrecht E.D. Pepe G.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2491-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, HL-60 cells (1 × 107 cells/tube) were harvested and treated with inhibitor mixture containing 1 μm GF 109203X and 1 μm KN62, inhibitors of PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, respectively, for 5 min. They were then stimulated with 30 or 300 μm ATP for 3 min. After the stimulation, the cells were washed twice with Locke's solution within another 2 min, then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer I containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 μm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved as the PKA fraction and used for in vitro PKA activity measurements. All of the following procedures were performed on ice unless stated otherwise. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of cell extract to the 30 μl of a test mixture consisting of 10 μl of Mg2+/ATP mixture containing 75 mm MgCl2, 500 μmATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 10 μl of 500 μm Kemptide, and 10 μl of inhibitor mixture containing 0.02 μm GF 109203X, 0.9 μm KN62. 10 μm cAMP were added to the reaction mixture with Kemptide for a positive control, and 10 μl of buffer II instead of Kemptide was added to determine the endogenous PKA substrate. All assay components were prepared by using buffer II that contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was gently vortexed and placed in a 30 °C water bath for 10 min. Then 25 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to 1 × 3-cm P81 phosphocellulose strips, which were immediately immersed into 0.75% phosphoric acid. The strips were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and then dehydrated in 95% ethanol, air-dried, and placed into liquid scintillation vials. The radioactivity was quantified in a Beckman LS 8000 liquid scintillation counter. PKC activity was measured by determining the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into histone IIIS as described previously (17Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 19Noland Jr., T.A. Dimino M.J. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 35: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with some modifications. HL-60 cells were harvested and treated with inhibitor mixture containing 10 μm H89 and 1 μm KN62 and then stimulated with 30 or 300 μm ATP and 100 nm PMA. After the stimulation, the cells were washed three times with Locke's solution and then resuspended in 200 μl of buffer I, which is described in the PKA assay. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellet was saved as the membrane fraction and then was solubilized with the above buffer I containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of solubilized membrane fraction to the 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μl of 500 μm histone IIIS, 10 μl of inhibitor mixture containing 2 μm PKI, PKA inhibitor peptide and 0.9 μm KN62, 10 μl of 500 nm PMA, and 10 μl of the Mg2+/ATP mixture containing 75 mm MgCl2, 500 μmATP, and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. All assay components were prepared using buffer II described in the assay of PKA. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and 25 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to the P81 phosphocellulose strips. The strips were immersed into the 0.75% phosphoric acid and washed three times for 10 min. After washing, they were rinsed in 95% ethanol, air-dried, and quantified by measuring the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Data are summarized as the means ± S.E. EC50 was calculated with the AllFit program (20De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We considered differences significant at p < 0.05. In HL-60 cells, ATP increased the [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal and half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) seen at approximately 10 μm and 85 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 Billustrates the typical changes in [Ca2+]iobserved in fura-2-loaded HL-60 cells stimulated with maximal concentrations of ATP. Initially, the [Ca2+]iincreased rapidly to a peak level and then completely returned to the basal Ca2+ level, even if the stimulant remained present. Notably, the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ exhibited a different desensitization pattern in response to supramaximal concentrations of ATP as compared with the lower concentrations. Although the peak levels were similar, the rate of return to the basal [Ca2+]i level was faster in cells treated with the higher concentration of ATP. This phenomenon is clearly seen in Fig. 1 C. We measured the time from peak response of the Ca2+ signal to the 70% desensitized [Ca2+]i level as indicated in theinset of Fig. 1 C. The data show that the times for return to 30% of the peak level became less in stimulations with increasing concentration of ATP. In other words, the higher the ATP concentration, the faster the return rate. We further analyzed whether changes in the desensitization rate are elicited by Ca2+release from intracellular stores or Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, since ATP increases [Ca2+]ivia both pathways. To measure Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores, cells were stimulated with ATP in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Subsequently, 3 mm Ca2+ was introduced to the medium to assess the activity of the Ca2+ influx. As shown in Fig. 2 A, when cells were stimulated with 30, 100, and 300 μm ATP in Ca2+-free medium, there were no significant differences in Ca2+release, but large differences occurred in Ca2+ influx between the different ATP concentrations. Ca2+ influx stimulated by 300 μm ATP was 62.5% less than when stimulated with 30 μm ATP. The data indicate that the differences in the falling state of the Ca2+ responses caused by the supramaximal concentration of ATP resulted from changes in Ca2+ influx. Since the amount of Ca2+release was small, it is possible that undetectable differences could exist between those stimulations. Thus, we measured the IP3production of cells stimulated with ATP. Fig. 2 B shows the time course for IP3 production when cells were stimulated with 30 and 300 μm ATP. At both concentrations, maximal IP3 generation was obtained after 15 s. At that time, 300 μm ATP generated approximately 2.3 times the amount of IP3 than 30 μm ATP. Furthermore, the intracellular IP3 level was more sustained in the stimulation with 300 μm as compared with the stimulation with 30 μm. Thus, from the result of IP3production, it seems likely that 300 μm ATP stimulation can cause more Ca2+ release than 30 μm ATP or, at least, can trigger the release of a similar amount of Ca2+ from the internal stores, while IP3produced by 30 μm ATP is enough to maximally mobilize Ca2+. Therefore, we conclude that the 300 μmATP-induced Ca2+ release is not less than the 30 μm ATP-induced one and that the difference detected in the Ca2+ decay rate is due to changes in the Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. To test whether differences in the falling state of the Ca2+ response are due to modulation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and Ca2+/ATPase activity, we measured Mn2+ and Ba2+ influx after the addition of ATP. Mn2+ and Ba2+ are good Ca2+ surrogates, since they are not pumped out of the cell, so they can be considered as selective tracers for entry (21Suh B.-C. Song S.-K. Kim Y.-K. Kim K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32753-32759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mn2+ uptake was estimated by the quenching of the fura-2 fluorescence when excited at the 360-nm wavelength, which is an isosbestic wavelength and insensitive to variations in Ca2+ concentration. Ba2+ uptake was estimated by the increase in the fura-2 fluorescence ratio when excited at the 340- and 380-nm wavelength. Fig. 3 A shows the fluorescence quenching by Mn2+ influx when cells were stimulated with 30, 100, and 300 μm ATP. As 2 mmMn2+ was applied to the medium, it entered the cell slowly. Subsequent stimulation of the cells with 30 μm ATP accelerated the Mn2+ entry as compared with the untreated control (dotted trace). 100 μm ATP also accelerated the entry, however, with a slower rate than 30 μm ATP. In contrast, 300 μm ATP stimulation had little effect on fluorescence quenching in comparison with the untreated control. The data indicate that the lower concentration of ATP activates the divalent cation influx. This result was also supported by the Ba2+ uptake. To measure Ba2+influx, cells were stimulated with ATP in the absence of external Ca2+. When the Ba2+ was added to the medium, it caused an increase in the fluorescence intensity reflecting Ba2+ uptake. The influx of Ba2+ elicited by ATP shows a concentration-dependent pattern with the higher concentrations of ATP triggering less Ba2+ uptake. This is similar to the result of Ca2+ influx as shown in Fig. 2 A. These results suggest that ATP regulates the amount of Ca2+ influx, but does not modulate the activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and Ca2+/ATPase. To investigate the involvement of CRAC, we tested the effect of various metal ions on ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling, because metal ions are known to block CRAC. Cells were treated with 30 μm La3+, Cd2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ for 1 min and then stimulated with ATP in Ca2+-containing medium. The difference between the 30 and 300 μm ATP-induced Ca2+ signals disappeared in the presence of 30 μm La3+, whereas the other metal ions had little or negligible effects (data not shown). The data, thus, suggested that changes in CRAC activity could be the main cause for the rapid desensitization of the Ca2+ response induced by higher concentrations of ATP. In the above experiments, we found that different Ca2+ decay rates were caused by changes in Ca2+ influx. ATP induces capacitative Ca2+entry through CRAC, which is stimulated by a Ca2+ influx factor liberated from the depleted intracellular Ca2+stores by action of IP3. To study the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry, we used thapsigargin, which depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibiting the microsomal Ca2+/ATPase and induces Ca2+ influx (23Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in Ca2+ influx could also be demonstrated when we measured the effect of ATP pretreatment on thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry. As shown in Fig. 4, cells were incubated with 100 nm thapsigargin in a Ca2+-free medium, which resulted in a transient [Ca2+]i elevation. After reaching a peak, the [Ca2+]i decreased slowly to the basal level, which reflects the emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. The subsequent addition of 3 mmCa2+ to the medium induced a marked and sustained Ca2+ rise (dotted trace). Treatment with 300 μm ATP for 1 min prior to the extracellular Ca2+ application significantly diminished the thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry by 25.7% as compared with the untreated control (dotted trace). 100 μm ATP had also a slightly inhibitory effect. However, 30 μm ATP substantially potentiated the thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry to 152.8% over the control cells. These results indicate that ATP has a biphasic effect on the thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry linked to its concentration. Therefore, we speculated that ATP itself might potentiate and inhibit capacitative Ca2+ entry that it evokes, forming both a positive and a negative feedback loop. At 30 μm, ATP potentiates Ca2+ influx, which slows down the desensitization of the [Ca2+]i. Whereas, at 300 μm, ATP inhibits Ca2+ influx, which speeds up the desensitization of the [Ca2+]i. ATP activates PLC and produces IP3 and diacylglycerol, which subsequently activates PKC. We have also shown that extracellular ATP triggers elevation of cAMP in HL-60 cells (6Choi S.Y. Kim K.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of PKC and PKA in modulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry, we used inhibitors specific for those kinases. GF 109203X and chelerythrine, selective PKC inhibitors, were used to characterize the inhibitory or stimulatory effect of ATP on the capacitative Ca2+ entry. Fig. 5 A shows what effect pretreatment with protein kinase inhibitors has on the Ca2+transient elicited by thapsigargin. 300 μm ATP has a substantial inhibitory effect on thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry as seen in Fig. 4. This inhibitory action was antagonized by pretreatment with 1 μm GF 109203X, and Ca2+ influx was even potentiated in the presence of GF 109203X. Similar effects were obtained when 1 μmchelerythrine was used in place of GF 109203X. The results suggest that PKC, when activated by 300 μm ATP, inhibits thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry. The involvement of PKA in the 30 μm ATP-induced potentiation of capacitative Ca2+ entry was investigated by testing the effect of the PKA inhibitors H89 and Rp-cAMPS. Fig. 5 B shows the effect that H89 and Rp-cAMPS has on the enhancement of the thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+entry by 30 μm ATP. In cells treated with H89, this potentiation was blocked. The potentiation also disappeared in 20 μm Rp-cAMP-treated cells. These results suggest the involvement of PKA in the 30 μm ATP-induced enhancement of the capacitative Ca2+ entry. The effects of protein kinase inhibitors on ATP activity in the desensitization pattern of [Ca2+]i were also investigated. Inhibition of PKA by pretreatment with 2 μmH89 significantly accelerated the decay rate of the 30 μmATP-induced [Ca2+]i level with little effect on the peak Ca2+ level (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, pretreatment with 1 μm GF 109203X slowed the decay rate induced by 300 μm ATP, resulting in a Ca2+ response similar to the 30 μm ATP-evoked response (Fig. 6 B). The inhibitory action of 300 μm ATP was slightly enhanced in the presence of PKA inhibitors, while the potentiating effect of 30 μm ATP became even more activated in the presence of PKC inhibitors (data not shown). Thus, the slower decay rate of the 30 μm ATP-induced Ca2+ signal may be the result of the potentiating action of PKA as it increases the capacitative Ca2+ entry induced by ATP, whereas the rapid decay rate in the 300 μm ATP-induced Ca2+ signal might be the result of an inhibitory action by PKC as it blocks the ATP-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry. Taken together, the different desensitization rates of the ATP-induced Ca2+ signals after peak level could be the result of an interplay between inhibition by PKC and activation by PKA of the capacitative Ca2+entry. Since it has been shown that P2U receptors were present and coupled to PLC in HL-60 cells, we treated the cells with UTP and measured the return rate of the [Ca2+]i level. Fig. 7 A illustrates the times for return to 30% of the peak level in response to supramaximal concentrations of UTP: the higher the UTP concentration, the faster the return rate. However, although the phenomenon was similar to that of ATP, the rate of the return to the basal [Ca2+]ilevel was not as remarkable compared with that induced by ATP in Fig. 1 C. We further analyzed whether changes in the desensitization rate involve PKC and PKA in the modulation of the UTP-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry using kinase inhibitors. Fig. 7 B shows that pretreatment with GF 109203X slowed the decay rate induced by 300 μm UTP. However, inhibition of PKA by pretreatment with H89 had no effect on the return rate of the 30 μm UTP-induced [Ca2+]i level (data not shown). The difference in the desensitization pattern between ATP and UTP might result from different activations of effector enzymes, such as PLC and adenylyl cyclase. In HL-60 cells, UTP has no effect on cAMP production (6Choi S.Y. Kim K.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results suggest that the effect of PKA increasing the capacitative Ca2+ entry is not involved in UTP-treated cells and that PKC alone acts in the desensitization of the UTP-induced Ca2+ response. To assess agonist concentration-dependent differential activation of PKC and PKA, we measured the production of cAMP and IP3. Fig. 8 shows the production of cAMP and IP3 induced by various concentrations of ATP. The maximal increase of cAMP was obtained with 300 μm ATP. The EC50 value was 19.2 μm. Particularly, for 30 and 300 μm ATP, respectively, the cAMP levels reached 137.2 ± 9.3 and 190.2 ± 7.7 over the basal cAMP level of 25.3 ± 4.2. The amounts of IP3 caused by 30 and 300 μm ATP were 27.7 ± 5.7 and 67.0 ± 5.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively, while the basal IP3 level was 18.0 ± 3.1. There was only a slight increase in the IP3 level in the response to 30 μm ATP, whereas the cAMP level was already significantly increased at that concentration. On the other hand, during stimulation with 300 μm ATP, cAMP was produced maximally, and IP3was also"

The tag in either the IDH1 or IDH2 subunit permits one-step affinity purification from yeast cellular extracts of catalytically active and allosterically responsive holoenzyme. This expression system was used to investigate subunit-specific contributions of residues with putative functions in adenine nucleotide binding. The primary effect of simultaneous replacement of the adjacent Asp-279 and Ile-280 residues in IDH1 with alanines is a dramatic loss of activation by AMP. In contrast, alanine replacement of the homologous Asp-286 and Ile-287 residues in IDH2 does not alter the allosteric response to AMP, but produces a 160-fold reduction in Vmax due to a 70-fold increase in the S0.5 value for NAD+. These results suggest that the targeted aspartate/isoleucine residues may contribute to regulator binding in IDH1 and to cofactor binding in IDH2, i.e. that these homologous residues are located in regions that have evolved for binding the adenine nucleotide components of different ligands. In other mutant enzymes, an alanine replacement of Asp-191 in IDH1 eliminates measurable catalytic activity, and a similar substitution of the homologous Asp-197 in IDH2 produces pleiotropic catalytic effects. A model is presented for the primary function of IDH2 in catalysis and of IDH1 in regulation, with crucial roles for these single aspartate residues in the communication and functional interdependence of the two subunits.

The oxidative decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by mitochondrial NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1The abbreviation used is: IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase. is believed to be a rate-limiting step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The enzyme isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been described as responsive to energy charge due to allosteric activation by AMP and inhibition by ATP and NADH (1Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian enzymes exhibit similar regulatory properties, but utilize ADP as a positive regulator (2Chen R.F. Plaut G.W.E. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The catalytically active form of IDH from yeast is an octamer composed of two subunits in a 1:1 ratio (3Illingworth J.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independent nuclear genes encoding the IDH1 and IDH2 subunits have been cloned, and gene disruption studies show that both subunits are essential for catalytic activity (5Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of either or both of the IDH1and IDH2 genes results in an inability to grow with acetate as a carbon source, a phenotype shared with several other tricarboxylic acid cycle mutants in yeast (7Kim K. Rosenkrantz M.S. Guerente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1936-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences and amino-terminal sequence analyses indicate that the mature IDH1 and IDH2 polypeptides contain 349 and 354 amino acid residues, respectively, and share 42% residue identity. The yeast polypeptides share ∼32% sequence identity with Escherichia coliNADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (9Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a homodimeric enzyme analyzed in several crystallographic studies (10Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H.

Biochemistry. 1971; 11: 4322-4328Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) conducted with purified yeast IDH led to the characterization of four binding sites for the substrate isocitrate, two for the cofactor NAD+, and two for the positive allosteric regulator AMP. Two possible models of subunit function and interaction were proposed based on these results. The individual subunits may have specialized functions in catalysis or regulation, with each containing complete independent binding sites. Alternatively, both subunits may contain half-binding sites, with interactions between IDH1 and IDH2 required to form complete binding pockets. Recent results from limited mutagenesis studies (15Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) favor the former model. In that work, evolutionarily conserved serine residues in each subunit were replaced with alanine residues. The homologous residue in bacterial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase is the site for phosphorylation and inactivation in vivo (9Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and replacement with aspartate produces a catalytically inactive enzyme (16Dean A.M. Lee M.H.I. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An S98A replacement in IDH2 was found to produce a 60-fold reduction in Vmax, but no effect on cooperativity with respect to isocitrate or on AMP binding, whereas an S92A replacement in IDH1 produces only a 6-fold decrease inVmax, with complete loss of activation by AMP and a 2-fold decrease in cooperativity. These results suggested a primary role for IDH2 in catalysis and for IDH1 in regulating the catalytic properties of IDH2. In this study, we extend analyses of subunit function in yeast IDH with the goal of modifying allosteric properties. Mutagenesis is based on homology to cofactor binding determinants in bacterial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase and other decarboxylating dehydrogenases with the idea that adenine nucleotide binding is involved in both cofactor and regulator affinity. Also, we examine the role of a conserved aspartate residue identified by Huang and Colman (17Huang Y.-C. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12208-12214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by chemical modification of pig heart NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase with an adenine nucleotide analogue. TheΔIDH1ΔIDH2 disruption mutant used in this study was previously constructed (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using deletion/disruption methods with yeast strain S173-6B (MATa leu2-3,112 his3-1 ura3-52 trp1-289) (18Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1979; 9: 12-24Google Scholar). Transformations were conducted using the lithium acetate method of Ito et al. (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains were cultivated in rich YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) or in minimal YNB medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 6.0) with appropriate supplements of 20 μg/ml each to satisfy auxotrophic requirements for growth. Carbon sources were glucose, glycerol plus lactate, or acetate added to 2%. DNA manipulations including ligation, amplification, purification, mutagenesis, and sequence analysis followed the methods described by Sambrook et al.(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To obtain histidine-tagged IDH enzymes, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce five sequential histidine codons to precede the termination codon in IDH1 or IDH2genes carried on plasmid pRS316 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This centromere-based plasmid (designated pIDH1/IDH2) has been shown to produce normal cellular levels of IDH1 and IDH2 in ΔIDH1ΔIDH2transformants (22Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10347-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The template for mutagenesis was single-stranded pIDH1/IDH2, and the oligonucleotides were a 52-mer for IDH1(5′-CAACAAATTATCTACCATGCATCACCATCACCATTAATGAAAACAATTCCCC) and a 56-mer for IDH2(5′-GCAGTCATCAAGAGATTACATCACCATCACCATTAATAAAAGTCCTATTCTTTTCC). Colony hybridization was used to identify E. colitransformants containing plasmids with the inserted histidine codons, and the designed sequence changes were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The resulting plasmids were designated pIDH1 His /IDH2 and pIDH1/IDH2 His (see Fig. 1, set I). Similar mutagenesis strategies were used to introduce specific codon changes into IDH1 or IDH2 genes. The targeted residue changes and corresponding oligonucleotides were as follows: D191A in IDH1 (5′-GAAGTTAGGTGCTGGTCTGTTC), D197A in IDH2 (5′-GATTAGCTGCCGGTTTATTCG), D279A/I280A in IDH1 (5′-CATGTTGGTTTAGCTGCTAAAGGCCAAAATG), and D286A/I287A in IDH2 (5′-CTCTGCCCCTGCCGCCGCCGGTCAAG). Colony hybridization was used to identify transformants containing altered plasmids. To restrict nucleotide sequence analysis and to ensure introduction of only the desired mutations, 495-base pair EcoRI/PflMI fragments containing the mutations in IDH1 were sequenced and initially subcloned into the authentic gene on a pBS−plasmid containing EcoRI and PflMI as unique restriction sites. The entire genes contained on 4.0-kilobase pairXbaI fragments were used to replace IDH1 in pIDH1/IDH2 (see Fig. 1). For IDH2 mutations, the coding regions in 1.6-kilobase pair BglII/HindIII fragments containing the oligonucleotide-generated codon changes were sequenced, and the fragments were cloned into the authentic gene in pIDH1/IDH2. These manipulations generated the second set of plasmids indicated in Fig. 1. Further subcloning was conducted to construct plasmids for coexpression of each mutant subunit with the other subunit containing a histidine tag. For tagging of IDH2, the BglII/HindIII fragment containing the polyhistidine codon insertion from pIDH1/IDH2 His was used to replace the corresponding restriction fragments in pIDH1 D191A /IDH2and pIDH1 D279A,I280A /IDH2. For tagging of IDH1, the BglII/HindIII fragments containingIDH2 mutations were removed from pIDH1/IDH2 D197A and pIDH1/IDH2 D286A,I287A and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pIDH1 His /IDH2. These manipulations generated the third set of plasmids indicated in Fig. 1. For small-scale procedures, whole cell protein extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis of harvested yeast cells as described previously (8McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). For purification of histidine-tagged enzymes, yeast strains were cultivated in 500 ml of YP medium with glycerol plus lactate as carbon sources. The cells were harvested at a culture density of A600 nm = 1.8–2.0 and lysed with glass beads as described previously (8McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular protein extracts (10 ml) were diluted with an equal volume of buffer A (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 40 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. The diluted extract was combined with 0.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin (QIAGEN Inc.) and rocked at 24 °C for 30–60 min. The mixture was loaded onto a 1 × 5-cm column, and the flow-through fraction was collected. The column was washed three times with 3 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and binding proteins were eluted with 1 ml of buffer A containing 200 mmimidazole, pH 7.5. The eluate was diluted 10-fold with buffer A, and the column absorption/elution procedure was repeated. The eluate from the second column was the source of purified protein used for kinetic and electrophoretic analyses. NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (4Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocities are expressed as units/mg, with 1 unit of activity defined as the isocitrate-dependent production of 1 μmol of NADH/min at 24 °C.Vmax values are the maximal rate/mg of purified IDH and were obtained by Hanes plot analyses (24Hanes C.S. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 1406-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Deleted in proofDeleted in proof.Google Scholar) of primary data. For measurements of isocitrate S0.5, assays contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm NAD+, and dl-isocitrate at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mm(d-isocitrate concentrations were calculated as 50% of the total isocitrate). Assays of AMP activation contained 100 μm AMP. For measurements of NAD+S0.5, assays contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdl-isocitrate, 100 μm AMP, and NAD+ at concentrations ranging from 0 to as high as 10 mm for some mutant enzymes. All assays were conducted at 24 °C and were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Previous kinetic analyses of wild-type and mutant forms of S. cerevisiae IDH were performed using enzymes purified from whole cell or mitochondrial extracts by several column chromatography steps (3Illingworth J.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barnes L.D. Kuehn G.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To expedite and simplify purification, we have adapted an affinity column method based on histidine tagging (27Hengen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 285-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since IDH is an octamer containing four each of the IDH1 and IDH2 polypeptides, we have introduced histidine tags into each subunit. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” independent oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis steps were conducted using a centromere-based pRS316 plasmid carrying both complete genes (pIDH1/IDH2) (Fig. 1) and a yeast URA3 gene for selection. This plasmid was previously shown to produce normal cellular levels of expression following transformation of mutants carrying chromosomal IDH1 andIDH2 gene disruptions (22Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10347-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were designated pIDH1 His /IDH2 and pIDH1/IDH2 His (Fig. 1, set I). Immunochemical levels of both IDH subunits and cellular specific activities were found to be similar in extracts from the parental strain and from a ΔIDH1ΔIDH2 disruption strain transformed with pIDH1/IDH2, pIDH1 His /IDH2, or pIDH1/IDH2 His (data not shown). Thus, the addition of a histidine tag to either subunit does not appear to affect expression, stability, or catalytic activity. In addition, wild-type rates of growth (6–7-h doubling times) with acetate as a carbon source are restored by transformation with pIDH1/IDH2, pIDH1 His /IDH2, or pIDH1/IDH2 His, whereas no growth is measurable for the nontransformed disruption mutant. This indicates that the histidine-tagged forms of IDH perform normal metabolic functionsin vivo. Affinity purification of IDH1His/IDH2 and IDH1/IDH2His enzymes using nickel-charged columns was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With this procedure, we routinely obtain yields of 65–70% of the initial cellular activity, purifications of 200–280-fold, and ∼200 μg of pure protein from each 500-ml culture. The specific activities measured for the affinity-purified enzymes are 13.5 units/mg for IDH1His/IDH2 and 11.8 units/mg for IDH1/IDH2His, 2Values of measured specific activities differ slightly from Vmax values in Table I, which were calculated from kinetic plots.values similar to that obtained for IDH purified by conventional methods (4Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barnes L.D. Kuehn G.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue staining following electrophoresis (Fig. 2) illustrates the enrichment of the affinity-purified IDH1/IDH2His enzyme (lane 3) relative to proteins in the whole cell extract (lane 1) and to proteins in the first flow-through fraction (lane 2). The IDH1His/IDH2 enzyme (lane 6) exhibits similar purity following elution from the nickel-charged column. The slower migration of histidine-tagged subunits is apparent in comparison oflanes 3 and 6. To determine if the introduction of histidine tags alters catalytic or allosteric parameters, several kinetic analyses were performed using the affinity-purified enzymes. As summarized in Table I, in the absence of AMP, S0.5 values for isocitrate of 0.62 and 0.76 mmwere measured, and corresponding Hill coefficients of 3.85 and 3.93 were calculated for the IDH1His/IDH2 and IDH1/IDH2His enzymes, respectively. These are similar to previously published values for IDH purified from yeast (1Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating that the apparent affinity for isocitrate and the high cooperativity of substrate binding are preserved in the affinity-purified enzymes. More important, for the experiments below, allosteric activation by AMP is also retained. In the presence of 100 μm AMP, the S0.5 values for isocitrate decrease ∼9-fold for both IDH1His/IDH2 and IDH1/IDH2His enzymes, comparable to 5–6-fold decreases reported for the conventionally purified enzyme (1Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also, previous studies indicated that activation by AMP produced a slight decrease in cooperativity, with a reduction of the Hill coefficient to 2.5 (26Barnes L.D. Kuehn G.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The decrease in cooperativity is negligible for the histidine-tagged enzymes (Table I), perhaps due to conformational stability afforded by rapid purification. These results show that this expression/purification system is appropriate for analyses of mutant enzymes with residue replacements designed to alter catalytic or regulatory properties.Table IKinetic properties of wild-type and mutant forms of yeast IDH enzymesEnzymeVmaxIsocitrateNAD+S0.5 −AMP/+AMPHill coefficient −AMP/+AMPS0.5Hill coefficientunits/mgmmmmIDH1His/IDH214.510.62 /0.073.85 /3.740.141.01IDH1/IDH2His12.280.76 /0.093.93 /3.920.141.03IDH1D191A/IDH2HisIDH1His/IDH2D197A1.110.67 /0.681.42 /1.420.911.04IDH1D279A,I280A/IDH2His5.001.03 /0.793.88 /3.830.141.06IDH1His/IDH2D286A,I287A0.090.45 /0.063.96 /3.9210.01.10Values were calculated from the data presented in Fig. 6. Open table in a new tab Values were calculated from the data presented in Fig. 6. With the goal of identifying and altering residues involved in allosteric regulation by AMP, we based strategies for mutagenesis on two different considerations. First, using the approach of chemical modification, Huang and Colman (17Huang Y.-C. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12208-12214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a tryptic peptide containing a covalently modified aspartate residue following treatment of pig heart NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase with an adenine nucleotide analogue, 2-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)adenosine 5′-diphosphate. The amino acid sequence around the modified aspartate is conserved in several other adenine nucleotide-binding proteins (28Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar,29Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and in the IDH1 and IDH2 polypeptides (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the homologous aspartate residues of the yeast subunits in positions 191 and 197, respectively, were targeted for replacement with alanine residues. Second, crystallographic studies of NAD+- and NADP+-specific dehydrogenases have indicated that many of the residues interacting with these cofactors are similar, with striking exceptions, as expected, being residues that interact with the ribose 2′-phosphate in the NADP+-specific enzymes. The adjacent Lys-344 and Tyr-345 residues with this function in E. coli NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (12Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8670-8678Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar) align with adjacent aspartate and isoleucine residues in the otherwise highly homologous cofactor-binding site of NAD+-specific 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (30Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Also, K344D and Y345I are two of seven residue replacements introduced into NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase to change cofactor specificity from NADP+ to NAD+ (31Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the amino acid sequences of the yeast IDH1 and IDH2 subunits are highly homologous to that of NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase in a region containing several residues (underlined) involved in cofactor binding in the bacterial enzyme. Several of these residues are conserved in IDH2, and fewer in IDH1. In this region, both IDH subunits contain adjacent aspartate and isoleucine residues characteristic of NAD+ specificity at positions occupied by Lys-344 and Tyr-345 of NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase. Reasoning that these residues could be informative about NAD+ binding or, alternatively, could be part of a region adapted during evolution for binding the adenine nucleotide moiety of an allosteric regulator, Asp-279 plus Ile-280 in IDH1 and Asp-286 plus Ile-287 in IDH2 were targeted for replacement by adjacent alanine residues. Codon changes in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Small restriction fragments containing the desired mutations were completely sequenced and used to replace the corresponding restriction fragments in pIDH1/IDH2. Four plasmids, each containing one altered subunit gene and the other unaltered gene, were constructed and designated pIDH1 D191A /IDH2, pIDH1/IDH2 D197A, pIDH1 D279A,I280A /IDH2, and pIDH1/IDH2 D286A,I287A. This set of plasmids (Fig. 1,set II) provides controls to assess effects on the cellular specific activity of IDH in cells containing only the desired mutation. For purification and kinetic analyses, another set of four plasmids (Fig. 1, set III) was constructed by subcloning. These plasmids contain each mutant subunit allele in combination with the histidine-tagged but otherwise wild-type version of the other subunit allele. They are designated pIDH1 D191A /IDH2 His, pIDH1 His /IDH2 D197A, pIDH D279A,I280A /IDH2 His, and pIDH1 His /IDH2 D286A,I287A. Both sets of plasmids were transformed into theΔIDH1ΔIDH2 disruption mutant. Resulting Ura+transformants were isolated and cultivated in rich medium with glycerol plus lactate as a permissive carbon source. Immunoblot analysis conducted with whole cell protein extracts demonstrates equivalent cellular levels of expression of IDH1 and IDH2 in all transformants (data not shown). Enzymatic activities are measurable for all of the cellular extracts from transformants except those containing the IDH1D191A enzyme. Specific activities associated with the IDH1D279A,I280A enzymes are 3–4-fold lower and activities associated with the IDH2D197A or IDH2D286A,I287A enzymes are ∼20-fold lower than control values for histidine-tagged wild-type enzymes. These values for cellular activity were found to roughly correlate with restoration of growth on plates with acetate as a carbon source (data not shown),i.e. little or no growth is observed for strains expressing mutant IDH2 enzymes or the IDH1D191A enzyme, whereas slow growth relative to control transformants expressing the wild-type enzyme is observed for strains expressing the IDH1D279A,I280A enzyme. In all cases, levels of activity and growth with acetate are very similar for strains transformed with plasmid pairs encoding either tagged or nontagged wild-type subunits, indicating no impact of the carboxyl-terminal histidine extensions on these properties. For kinetic analyses, the four histidine-tagged mutant enzymes were purified from extracts of yeast transformants using nickel-charged columns as described under “Experimental Procedures” and “Construction and Expression of Mutant Forms of IDH.” The purities obtained were similar to those for wild-type enzymes containing either histidine-tagged subunit; however, overall yields of the mutant enzymes were lower, ranging from 24 to 42%. Denaturing electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2) resolved two major bands in each purified mutant enzyme, with reduced migration of the IDH2 subunits in the IDH1D191A/IDH2His and IDH1D279A,I280A/IDH2His enzymes (lanes 4and 5, respectively) and of the IDH1 subunits in the IDH1His/IDH2D197A and IDH1His/IDH2D286A,I287A enzymes (lanes 7and 8, respectively). The IDH2 band in the purified IDH1His/IDH2D197A enzyme (lane 7) migrated slightly faster than other forms of IDH2, presumably due to the specific amino acid substitution. Initial enzyme assays of purified mutant enzymes were performed with saturating concentrations of substrates and cofactor. The values forVmax presented in Table I were found to vary only slightly with different preparations of purified enzymes. A particular objective at this point was to determine if the IDH1D191A/IDH2His enzyme exhibits any activity after enrichment. It was found that a trace of activity could be measured, but only with high concentrations of enzyme and after allowing the reaction to proceed for several hours. This trace activity suggests that the enzyme may be structurally intact, but precludes further kinetic analysis. The corresponding replacement in the IDH1His/IDH2D197A enzyme produced a less severe 13-fold reduction in Vmax compared with that measured for IDH1His/IDH2. In contrast, the aspartate/isoleucine replacements in IDH1D279A,I280A/IDH2His produced a 2.5-fold reduction and in IDH1His/IDH2D286A,I287A a 160-fold reduction in Vmax relative to the corresponding histidine-tagged wild-type enzymes. Thus, replacement of these adjacent residues has a much greater effect on contributions of IDH2 than of IDH1 to activity. Three of the four purified mutant enzymes retain catalytic activity. To more precisely evaluate effects of specific residue substitutions, the catalytic parameters were compared with those for the corresponding histidine-tagged wild-type enzymes. Initial experiments examined activity as a function of isocitrate concentration in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of AMP (Fig. 4 and Table I). The single aspartate to alanine substitution in either subunit produces a dramatic effect on activity. As stated above, the IDH1D191A/IDH2His enzyme is effectively inactive. The activity of the IDH1His/IDH2D197Aenzyme is also reduced, with a 13-fold decrease inVmax relative to that measured for the IDH1His/IDH2 enzyme. The isocitrate S0.5 in the absence of AMP is not altered in this mutant enzyme. However, the D197A substitution in IDH2 nearly eliminates cooperativity in the presence or absence of AMP and produces a complete loss of activation by AMP. These results suggest that the targeted aspartate residues are critical for function, with Asp-191 in IDH1 being essential for catalytic activity and Asp-197 in IDH2 being crucial for allosteric regulation (cooperativity and AMP activation) of the holoenzyme. Substitutions of adjacent aspartate/isoleucine residues with alanine residues in IDH1 and IDH2 produce very different effects on catalytic properties. The D279A/I280A substitutions in IDH1 result in an ∼2.5-fold reduction in Vmax. The isocitrate S0.5 in the absence of AMP is only slightly affected, increased ∼30% relative to that for the IDH1/IDH2Hiscontrol enzyme, and cooperativity is unaffected. However, there is a dramatic reduction in AMP activation, with a modest 23% decrease for the mutant enzyme as compared with an 8.4-fold decrease in the isocitrate S0.5 for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 100 μm AMP. These results suggest, in contrast to those obtained for the enzyme containing a D197A substitution in IDH1, that cooperativity and allosteric regulation by AMP are separable catalytic properties. The D286A/I287A substitutions in IDH2 produce the most dramatic measurable effect on catalytic capacity, with a reduction inVmax of 160-fold relative to the wild-type control. However, regulatory properties including cooperativity and AMP activation are not dramatically altered. The mutant enzyme exhibits a slightly reduced isocitrate S0.5 in the absence of AMP (73% that of the wild-type enzyme), and this S0.5 value decreases 7.5-fold relative to 9-fold for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of AMP. Thus, the decrease in Vmaxcannot be attributed to effects on binding of either the substrate isocitrate or the regulator AMP. One of our initial postulates was that adenine nucleotide-binding sites may independently evolve to accommodate both cofactor NADH and regulator AMP binding. Since the D279A/I280A substitutions in IDH1 primarily affect AMP activation, S0.5 values for NAD+ were measured for mutant and wild-type enzymes to determine if parallel D286A/I287A substitutions in IDH2 show a possible effect on cofactor binding. Activity was assessed as a function of NAD+ concentration in the presence of saturating concentrations of isocitrate (10 mm) and AMP (100 μm). As shown in Table I, the S0.5 for NAD+ is not altered by the D279A/I280A substitutions in IDH1, but the S0.5 value is increased a dramatic 70-fold by D286A/I287A substitutions in IDH2. Thus, the reduction in catalytic capacity for the latter enzyme is primarily due to effects on cofactor affinity. These results suggest that these adjacent aspartate/isoleucine residues in IDH2 are functionally equivalent to conserved residues involved in cofactor binding in other NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases. The S0.5 for NAD+ is also increased 6.5-fold by the D197A substitution in IDH2, indicating pleiotropic effects on cofactor affinity as well as on cooperativity and AMP activation. Using the cloned genes for the IDH1 and IDH2 subunits of NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from S. cerevisiae, we have introduced histidine codons and have shown that holoenzyme can be purified using affinity chromatography with carboxyl-terminal tags on either subunit. We have utilized this approach to examine potential adenine nucleotide-binding sites in yeast IDH. The most informative mutant enzymes constructed in this study contain adjacent alanine substitutions for Asp-279 and Ile-280 in IDH1 or similar substitutions for homologous Asp-286 and Ile-287 in IDH2. The rationale for these substitutions is the similar positioning of adjacent aspartate/isoleucine residues within regions known to participate in cofactor binding in other NAD+-specific dehydrogenases (30Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with participation of adjacent aspartate/isoleucine residues in both IDH subunits in adenine nucleotide binding. However, the effects of alanine substitutions are quite distinct. The substitutions in IDH1 produce an enzyme that is not responsive to activation by AMP, but that apparently retains full cofactor affinity. In contrast, the substitutions in IDH2 dramatically reduce the apparent affinity for NAD+ and consequentlyVmax, but have no effect on allosteric activation. Thus, the adjacent aspartate/isoleucine residues in IDH1 may contribute to affinity for the adenine nucleotide moiety in AMP, whereas the homologous residues in IDH2 may contribute to affinity for the adenine nucleotide moiety in NAD+. These results are consistent with the previous assignment of subunit function based on mutagenesis to replace highly conserved serine residues in IDH1 and IDH2 (15Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which correspond to Ser-113 of theE. coli enzyme, a residue with a critical function in binding isocitrate at the active site (10Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Previous and current results suggest that IDH1 contains residues necessary for cooperative binding of isocitrate and AMP and thus appears to be the primary contributor to regulatory functions. IDH2, in contrast, appears to contribute primarily to catalytic binding of isocitrate and NAD+. A schematic model for the distribution of binding sites is shown in Fig. 5. Several elements of this simple model supported by current and previous studies are as follows. (a) Most of the structural subunit interactions in the holoenzyme involve heterologous subunit interactions. This is suggested by the apparent monomeric state of either IDH1 or IDH2 isolated from yeast mutants lacking the other subunit (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, preliminary results from the yeast two-hybrid system indicate strong interactions between IDH1 and IDH2, but no detectable interactions between identical subunits. 3W.-N. Zhao, E. Panisko, and L. McAlister-Henn, unpublished observations. (b) The substrate and cooperative binding sites for isocitrate are separable by mutagenesis, as are the adenine nucleotide-binding sites for the regulator and cofactor. (c) In addition, the properties of AMP activation and cooperativity assigned as functions of IDH1 are separable by mutagenesis (IDH1D279A,I280A/IDH2His enzyme) (Table I), as are the properties of isocitrate and NAD+ binding assigned to IDH2 (IDH1His/IDH2D286A,I287A enzyme) (Table I). Although these data and this model indicate independent functions for the subunits in the basic heterodimer structure, it is clearly necessary that regulatory functions of IDH1 be communicated to catalysis by IDH2. A possible interpretation of other results obtained in this study, as illustrated in Fig. 5, is that Asp-191 in IDH1 and the corresponding Asp-197 in IDH2 may contribute to the interdependence of subunit function. These residues were targeted for alanine replacement based on previous reports that a homologous residue in the enzyme from pig heart can be specifically labeled with an adenine nucleotide analogue (17Huang Y.-C. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12208-12214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Huang Y. Bailey J.M. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14100-14107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both replacements in the yeast enzyme have significant effects, with loss of activity for the D191A replacement in IDH1 and pleiotropic effects on all kinetic parameters except isocitrate affinity for the D197A replacement in IDH2. These effects cannot simply be attributed to major alterations in structure since subunit assembly and holoenzyme purification are apparently unchanged. Assuming the location of the yeast residues to be near adenine nucleotide-binding sites, as suggested by the study of Huang and Colman (17Huang Y.-C. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12208-12214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that our basic model for subunit-specific functions is correct, the loss of activity obtained with a D191A replacement in the “regulatory” subunit IDH1 could be due to a critical role for this residue in NAD+ affinity at the active site of IDH2. Similarly, the loss of AMP activation and the dramatic reduction in cooperativity observed following a D197A replacement in IDH2, the presumed catalytic subunit, could be due to a crucial role for this residue in the regulatory regions of IDH1 or in a region essential for communication between the subunits. While this is a highly speculative argument, there is some supportive structural information: Asp-191 and Asp-197 in the IDH subunits correspond in aligned sequences to Glu-238 of the homodimeric E. coliNADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase, a residue near Lys-230 that contributes to hydrogen bonding of isocitrate in the active site formed otherwise by residues of the other subunit (10Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Future tests of these ideas will involve more conservative replacements of Asp-191 and Asp-197 and replacement of lysine residues in IDH1 and IDH2 corresponding to NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase Lys-230. The metabolic contributions in vivo by mutant forms of IDH have, to date, only been assessed as a function of growth rate with acetate, a nonpermissive carbon source for yeast strains lacking IDH1 and/or IDH2. However, we have designed our expression system to obtain normal cellular levels of mutant enzymes. This establishes the basis for future work to examine effects of altered allosteric and catalytic properties on adaptation to changes in growth conditions and on respiratory mitochondrial functions.

Mounting evidence indicates that perturbation of the cellular thiol-disulfide redox potential activates gene expression.

Dithiothreitol (DTT), 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; DTTox, oxidized dithiothreitol; TFEC,S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine. a powerful disulfide reducing agent, is toxic to LLC-PK1 cells and activates both grp78 and gadd153 (20Whelan S.A. Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Halleck M.M. Holbrook N.J. Skinner J. Liu H. Stevens J.L. Cell Stress and Chaperones. 1997; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In preliminary structure-activity studies we found that the nontoxic intramolecular disulfide form of DTT,trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane (DTTox), also inducedgadd153 and grp78 mRNA. Since both genes are activated by thiol-induced reductive stress (20Whelan S.A. Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Halleck M.M. Holbrook N.J. Skinner J. Liu H. Stevens J.L. Cell Stress and Chaperones. 1997; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it was surprising that DTTox, an intramolecular disulfide with a very high reduction potential, was a good inducer. Herein, we show that reduction of DTTox by cellular oxidoreductases mediates transcriptional activation ofgadd153 and grp78 as well as induction of cellular tolerance to chemical toxicants. In a related study, we show that induction of cellular tolerance by DTTox depends on its ability to activate an endoplasmic reticulum stress response and to increase expression of chaperone proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (34Liu H.

Thus, DTTox is a novel activator of stress-gene expression and will be useful in probing the role of the thiol/disulfide redox status in the cellular and molecular responses to stress. LLC-PK1 cells (27Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Tissue Type Culture (Rockville, MD) and were used between passages 205 and 215. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc. or Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air in a humidified 37 °C incubator. Cells (1.25 × 106) were plated in 100-mm dishes 5 days prior to experimental treatment. The medium was routinely changed 3 days after seeding. Confluent cultures of LLC-PK1 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with DTTox or TFEC prepared fresh in Earle's balanced salt solution (1.8 mmCaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.7 mmMgSO4, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mmglucose, and 25 mm HEPES). Actinomycin D was dissolved in absolute ethanol at a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml, and 1 μl of the ethanol stock solution was added to 1 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution to achieve a final working concentration of 5 μg/ml. Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAzol supplied by Cinna/Biotecx (Houston, TX). Poly(A)+RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose, a standard technique. Northern analysis was performed on blots on which either total RNA (40 μg) or poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg) had been size separated by electrophoresis in 1.4% agarose denaturing gels. After prehybridization, blots were hybridized (21Chen Q. Yu K. Holbrook N.J. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8207-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) overnight with cDNA probes for gadd153 (35Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) or grp78 (36Lee A.S. Delegeane A.M. Baker V. Chow P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a gift of Dr. Amy Lee, and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (37Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar) using a kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Blots were allowed to decay before reprobing with a 200-base pair cDNA insert for mouse β-actin cDNA excised from pMACTE4, an SK-based plasmid (a gift of Dr. D. Eisinger). Bands were visualized by autoradiography using DuPont Cronex film and an intensifying screen and were quantitated using a BioImage Densitometer (Ann Arbor, MI). To correct for differences in gel loading, integrated optical densities were normalized to β-actin. Since gadd153 mRNA is barely detectable in untreated cells, the optical density values determined for gadd153 andgrp78 expression after 10 mm DTTox or 10 mm DTT treatment were arbitrarily designated as the 100% response, and all other values were expressed as a percent of that value. Following treatment, cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and nuclei were stored at −70 °C in 40% glycerol (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991: 4.10.1-4.10.4Google Scholar). Newly transcribed RNA, labeled with [α-32P]UTP and purified by the method of Celanoet al. (39Celano P. Berchtold C. Casero R.A.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 942-943PubMed Google Scholar), was hybridized to linearized plasmids that had been UV cross-linked to nylon filters. Plasmids containing cDNAs for β-actin and hsp70 (plasmid pAT125, American Type Culture Collection) served as internal controls, and pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to assess nonspecific binding. Run-on transcription was quantitated using a BioImage Densitometer. The run-on data presented in the results are a summary of three separate experiments but were not normalized to β-actin since DTTox and cycloheximide both perturbed β-actin transcription somewhat. Protein and nonprotein thiols were determined spectrophotometrically using Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) (40Sedlak J. Lindsay R. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (6592) Google Scholar) as described previously (41Chen Q. Stevens J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Intracellular GSH was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography method of Reed et al. (42Reed D.J. Babson J.R. Beatty P.W. Brodie A.E. Ellis W.W. Potter D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Nonprotein thiol values measured with Ellman's reagent were very similar to GSH values measured directly by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Pyridine nucleotides were determined using the enzymatic cycling assay of Passonneau and Lowry (43Passonneau J.V. Lowry O. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 2059-2075Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine IgG as the standard. DTTox reduction to DTT was determined by measuring the nonprotein thiols in the medium. Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium as described (44Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled or 35S-labeledS-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine (TFEC) were synthesized as before (45Hayden P.J. Stevens J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 468-476PubMed Google Scholar). When covalent binding of reactive TFEC metabolites was determined as an indication of uptake and activation, cells were treated for 2 h with [35S]TFEC, and then binding of 35S-metabolites was determined as described (44Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of variance followed by the Scheffe F test for multiple comparisons was used to compare means of three or more groups. The level of significance was set atp < 0.05. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that DTT treatment induced both grp78 and gadd153 mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells (21Chen Q. Yu K. Holbrook N.J. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8207-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Halleck M.M. Holbrook N.J. Skinner J. Liu H. Stevens J.L. Cell Stress and Chaperones. 1997; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since DTT and DTTox differ only in their thiol oxidation state, we first characterized the induction ofgadd153 and grp78 mRNA by DTTox and then compared the data to induction by DTT (Fig. 1). DTTox induced both gadd153 and grp78 mRNA expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. At 10 mm, DTT and DTTox were equally effective inducers ofgadd153 and grp78 mRNA. However, DTT was effective at lower concentrations and at earlier times compared with DTTox. We also tested analogues of DTTox (Fig. 2). trans-1,2-Cyclohexanediol lacks the intramolecular disulfide bond and was ineffective. 2-Hydroxyethyl disulfide, the ring-open intermolecular disulfide analogue of DTTox, proved to be extremely toxic but inducedgrp78 and gadd153 only modestly. However, 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide was a potent inducer of hsp70because of its ability to deplete cellular glutathione (see below), a known stimulus for hsp70 transcription (1Liu H. Lightfoot D.L. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Freeman M.L. Borrelli M.J. Syed K. Senisterra G. Stafford D.M. Lepcock J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 16: 356-366Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the intramolecular disulfide was a necessary functional group for activation of grp78 and gadd153 by DTTox.Figure 2Structure of DTTox analogues. Each analogue was tested as an inducer of grp78,gadd153, or hsp70 mRNA. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of inducer and poly(A)+or total RNA prepared for Northern blot analysis. The results of Northern analysis from at least three independent experiments (n = 3) are summarized for each compound with regard to the potency as an inducer of grp78, gadd153, orhsp70. A strong inducer indicates that there was at least a 10-fold induction in each experiment, whereas a weak inducer caused only a 2–5-fold increase. Induction of less than 2-fold was deemed no induction (none). The qualitative summary is derived from data collected in three separate experiments (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if DTTox treatment transcriptionally activated gadd153 and grp78 in LLC-PK1 cells, nuclear run-on analyses were performed (Fig. 3). Since hsp70 is more responsive to oxidative than reductive stress (20Whelan S.A. Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and is not activated by DTT (22Halleck M.M. Holbrook N.J. Skinner J. Liu H. Stevens J.L. Cell Stress and Chaperones. 1997; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Chen Q. Yu K. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also analyzed hsp70 transcription. Basalgrp78 transcription was much higher than gadd153; however, treatment with 10 mm DTTox transcriptionally activated grp78 and gadd153 16 ± 9- and 9 ± 4-fold, respectively (n = 3), but failed to activate hsp70 transcription. DTT also increased transcription of gadd153 and grp78 markedly, 13 ± 6- and 18 ± 14-fold, respectively (n = 3). There was also a significant and reproducible decrease in β-actin transcription in cells treated with DTTox, but the mechanism underlying this effect is not clear at present. Transcriptional activation can be classified as a primary or secondary response based on cycloheximide sensitivity (46Herschman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide treatment caused only a modest inhibition of DTT-mediated induction ofgadd153 and grp78 mRNA (Fig. 4). In contrast, cycloheximide completely blocked induction of gadd153 and grp78 (94% inhibition) by DTTox. Similar results were obtained by nuclear run-on analysis; cycloheximide blocked DTT-mediated transcriptional activation of gadd153 and grp78 by 58 and 21%, respectively, whereas transcriptional activation induced by DTTox was completely blocked by cycloheximide for both genes (Fig. 3). These results indicate that transcriptional activation of grp78and gadd153 by DTTox is dependent on protein synthesis. Although DTTox induction of gadd153 and grp78mRNA appeared to be due in part to transcriptional activation, run-on experiments do not exclude effects on posttranscriptional processes (47Jackman J. Alamo I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5656-5662PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, to examine the contribution of mRNA stability togrp78 or gadd153 mRNA accumulation. Actinomycin D blocked the induction of both mRNAs by DTT (Fig. 5) or DTTox (data not shown). When we first induced grp78 with DTT and then added actinomycin D to prevent further transcription, there was no observable decrease ingrp78 mRNA in the presence of actinomycin D alone or actinomycin plus DTTox (data not shown), indicating thatgrp78 mRNA was extremely stable (t½ >18 h). However, gadd153 mRNA was very unstable (t½ = 2 h) in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 5); DTTox dramatically increasedgadd153 mRNA stability (t½ >18). Thus, posttranscriptional processes contribute to the increase ingadd153 but not grp78 mRNA after DTTox treatment. Exogenous disulfides are reduced by GSH- and/or NAD(P)H-dependent cellular reductase systems (48Reed D.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As a consequence, disulfides can induce oxidative stress by depleting cellular GSH and NAD(P)H. Although the redox potential of DTTox does not favor reduction (49Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7944-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), LLC-PK1 cells reduced DTTox in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion (Figs. 6 and 7). The concentration dependence for DTTox reduction correlated with induction of grp78 and gadd153 mRNA (Fig. 7). However, DTTox treatment did not alter the levels of GSH or protein thiols (Table I). The only significant change was in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate pool where a modest, yet significant, decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio indicated that reducing equivalents were consumed by DTTox reduction (Table I). Although 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide was a poor inducer of grp78 and gadd153, it was reduced to a much greater extent than DTTox (666 ± 155versus 174 ± 66 nmol/h for 10 mm2-hydroxyethyldisulfide and DTTox, respectively). Accordingly, the NADPH/NADP+ ratio dropped dramatically after 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide treatment as did GSH (Table I), consistent with a severe oxidative stress. Severe GSH depletion activates the heat shock response (1Liu H. Lightfoot D.L. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Freeman M.L. Borrelli M.J. Syed K. Senisterra G. Stafford D.M. Lepcock J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 16: 356-366Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide was a strong inducer of hsp70 transcription (Fig. 2).Figure 7Comparison of the concentration dependence for DTTox reduction and induction of grp78 andgadd153 mRNA by LLC-PK1 cells. The concentration dependence for reduction of DTTox in LLC-PK1 cells and expression ofgadd153 or grp78 mRNA is shown. Cells were treated with various concentrations of DTTox for 5 h at which time the nonprotein thiol (NPSH) concentrations in the medium were measured, as a measure of DTTox reduction, and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared for Northern analysis.

In the plot of Tm versus the number of the cis double bond, some characteristic profiles were observed for the various series of PEs. For instance, if the cis double bond was first introduced into the sn-2-acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE at the Δ5-position, the Tm was observed to reduce drastically. Subsequent stepwise additions of up to fivecis double bonds at the methylene-interrupted positions toward the methyl end resulted in a progressive yet smaller decrease inTm. If, on the other hand, the cisdouble bonds were introduced sequentially at the Δ11-, Δ11,14-, and Δ11,14,17-positions along thesn-2-acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE, theTm profile in the Tm versus the number of the cis double bond showed a down-and-up trend. Most interestingly, for positional isomers of C(20):C(20:3Δ5,8,11)PE, C(20):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE, and C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE, an inverted bell-shapedTm profile was detected in the plot ofTm against the position of the ω-carbon for these isomers. Similar Tm profiles were also observed for C(18):C(20)PE, C(20):C(18)PE, and their unsaturated derivatives. This work thus demonstrated that both the positions and the numbers ofcis double bonds in the sn-2 acyl chain could exert noticeable influence on the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition behavior of the lipid bilayer. Finally, a molecular model was presented, with which the behavior of the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition observed for lipid bilayers composed of varioussn-1-saturated/sn-2-unsaturated lipids can be rationalized. In an attempt to examine the effects of different numbers and positions of cis double bonds in thesn-2-acyl chain of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the bilayer's melting behavior, 21 molecular species of PE were first semisynthesized, and their Tm and ΔHvalues were subsequently determined by high resolution differential scanning calorimetry. In the plot of Tm versus the number of the cis double bond, some characteristic profiles were observed for the various series of PEs. For instance, if the cis double bond was first introduced into the sn-2-acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE at the Δ5-position, the Tm was observed to reduce drastically. Subsequent stepwise additions of up to fivecis double bonds at the methylene-interrupted positions toward the methyl end resulted in a progressive yet smaller decrease inTm. If, on the other hand, the cisdouble bonds were introduced sequentially at the Δ11-, Δ11,14-, and Δ11,14,17-positions along thesn-2-acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE, theTm profile in the Tm versus the number of the cis double bond showed a down-and-up trend. Most interestingly, for positional isomers of C(20):C(20:3Δ5,8,11)PE, C(20):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE, and C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE, an inverted bell-shapedTm profile was detected in the plot ofTm against the position of the ω-carbon for these isomers. Similar Tm profiles were also observed for C(18):C(20)PE, C(20):C(18)PE, and their unsaturated derivatives. This work thus demonstrated that both the positions and the numbers ofcis double bonds in the sn-2 acyl chain could exert noticeable influence on the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition behavior of the lipid bilayer. Finally, a molecular model was presented, with which the behavior of the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition observed for lipid bilayers composed of varioussn-1-saturated/sn-2-unsaturated lipids can be rationalized. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence suggesting the existence of a close correlation between some vital functions of cells and the various degrees of unsaturation in the sn-2-acyl chains of membrane phospholipids (1Borkman M.

Consequently, detailed and systematic investigation of the properties ofsn-1-saturated/sn-2-unsaturated phospholipids in the organized membrane structure such as the lipid bilayer should be recognized and pursued. Furthermore, now is the time for studying unsaturated phospholipids, since sophisticated computer-based molecular modeling techniques from the hardware and the software fields have come together to provide valuable structural and energetic information about self-assembled biomolecules within a reasonable time frame. Results obtained with experimental and modeling studies ofsn-1-saturated/sn-2-unsaturated phospholipids could eventually help illuminate the specific roles played by various natural phospholipids in many membrane-related cell functions or diseases. The first detailed and systematic studies of the thermotropic phase behavior of phospholipids containing various numbers of cisdouble bonds in their sn-2-acyl chains were performed by Keough and co-workers (4Keough K.M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Coolbear K.P. Berde C.B. Keough K.M.W.

By using two series of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; C(X):C(Y)PE, saturated PE with Xcarbons in the sn-1- and Y carbons in thesn-2-acyl chain; C(X):C(Y:1Δ n)PE, monounsaturated PE with a saturated sn-1-acyl chain containing Xcarbons and a monounsaturated sn-2-acyl chain containingY carbons with a cis-carbon–carbon double bond (Δ n) at the nth carbon atom from the carboxyl end; C(X):C(Y:2Δ n, n+ 3)PE: a mixed chain PE with a saturated sn-1-acyl chain and a dienoic sn-2-acyl chain in which two methylene-interruptedcis double bonds are at the n and (n + 3) carbon atoms from the carboxyl end; similarly, C(X):C(Y:3Δ n, n+ 3, n+ 6)PE, C(X):C(Y:4Δ n, n+ 3, n+ 6, n+ 9)PE, and C(X):C(Y:5Δ n, n+ 3, n+ 6, n+ 9, n+ 12)PE refer to mixed chain PEs in which the sn-2-acyl chains have 3, 4, and 5 cis double bonds at Δ n, n+ 3, n+ 6, Δ n, n+ 3, n+ 6, n+ 9, and Δ n, n+ 3, n+ 6, n+ 9, n+ 12positions, respectively; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MM, molecular mechanics; Tm, phase transition temperature; ΔH, transition enthalpy; ΔS, transition entropy.and by applying the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques, they have shown that the introduction of a cis double bond into the sn-2-acyl chain at or near the center of the chain has a marked reducing effect on the phase transition temperature (Tm) associated with the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition of the lipid bilayer. A second cis double bond incorporated at the methylene-interrupted position toward the methyl end also reduces the Tm, but by a smaller amount. Interestingly, the introduction of a third cisdouble bond between the second cis double bond and the methyl end can cause a slight increase in Tm. This calorimetric work has been confirmed more or less by other investigators using PCs with different chain lengths (7Sanchez-Migallon M.P. Aranda F.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Niebylski C.D. Salem Jr., N. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2387-2393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, we have studied systematically the effect of different positions of single cis double bond in thesn-2-acyl chain on the phase transition behavior of lipid bilayers composed of sn-1 saturated/sn-2-monounsaturated PCs or phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) by high resolution DSC and computer-based molecular mechanics (MM) simulations (9Wang Z.

The position of the single cis double bond (Δ n) is found in both lipid classes to exert a characteristic influence on the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature. Specifically, in the plot of Tm versus Δ n, an inverted bell-shaped profile is observed, and the minimumTm occurs when the single cis double bond is positioned at or near the center of the linear segment of thesn-2-acyl chain. Furthermore, based on the results of MM simulations, we have developed a molecular model that can explain the characteristic Tm profile observed for monoenoic phospholipids (10Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2014-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Wang G. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22738-22746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we now extend our previous work by investigating the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions of one-component lipid bilayers prepared from 21 molecular species of PE; these lipids contain 0–5 cis double bonds at different positions in thesn-2-acyl chain. Specifically, we have examined the influence of the positions of the cis double bonds, in addition to the numbers of the cis double bond, on the phase transition temperature of the lipid bilayer by high resolution DSC techniques. In the plot of Tm versus the number of the cis double bond, some characteristic profiles are observed for the various series of PEs with different positions ofcis double bonds. Most interestingly, two parallel inverted bell-shaped Tm profiles are detected in the plot ofTm versus the position of the ω-carbon for two sets of positional isomers ofsn-1-saturated/sn-2-triunsaturated PEs. In addition, we have codified and analyzed the publishedTm values for lipid bilayers composed of varioussn-1-saturated/sn-2-unsaturated PCs. TheTm dependence of the numbers and positions of thecis double bonds in the sn-2-acyl chains of these PCs shows a similar characteristic profile that parallels the behavior of the corresponding PEs used in this study. This work thus demonstrates that both the positions and the numbers of cisdouble bonds in the sn-2-acyl chain can exert distinct influence on the chain melting behavior of the PE and PC bilayers. Moreover, we now expand the simple molecular model proposed earlier for monoenoic lipids with different positions of the single cisdouble bond in the sn-2-acyl chain. In particular, this expanded molecular model takes the rigidity of multiple cisdouble bonds into consideration, and it can be used to explain adequately the characteristic chain melting behavior of lipid bilayers containing various numbers and positions of cis double bonds in the sn-2-acyl chains. In this study, 21 molecular species of PE were semisynthesized. Three of them were saturated PE, and seven of them were eithersn-1-saturated/sn-2-monounsaturated PE orsn-1-saturated/sn-2-diunsaturated PE. The semisynthesis of these 10 lipids were carried out using the established procedures as published previously (9Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xu H. Stephenson F.A. Lin H. Huang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Wang G. Li S. Lin H-n. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The other 11 molecular species were sn-1-saturated/sn-2-polyunsaturated PE containing three, four, and five cis double bonds at different positions in the sn-2-acyl chain. Initially, 11 molecular species of the correspondingsn-1-saturated/sn-2-polyunsaturated PC were semisynthesized and purified by established procedures (14Lin H. Wang Z. Huang C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7063-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with a modified condition that all procedures were carried out as far as possible in an O2-free, N2 atmosphere to minimize autoxidation. This precautious step was also applied to the rest of the PE synthesis. The purified PCs (purity is greater than 98%) were then converted to PEs by transphosphatidylation with phospholipase D in the presence of excess amounts of ethanolamine hydrochloride, at pH 5.6, according to the procedure of Comfurius and Zwall (15Comfurius P. Zwall R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 488: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) as previously published (12Xu H. Stephenson F.A. Lin H. Huang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The products were purified and separated by silica gel column chromatography, with which a mixture of CHCl3, CH3OH, 5% NH4OH (175:35:4, v/v/v) was used as the eluant. Only a single spot was observed for each of the PE synthesized, after about 1 μmol/sample was loaded on the thin layer plate. Possible oxidation of unsaturated fatty acyl chains was checked routinely as described earlier (13Wang G. Li S. Lin H-n. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). DSC studies were performed on a Microcal MC-2 microcalorimeter with a DA-2 digital interface and data acquisition utility for automatic collection (Microcal, Inc., Northampton, MA), or a Hart 7708 differential scanning calorimeter (Hart Scientific, Pleasant Grove, UT). In all experiments, a constant heating scan rate of 15 °C/h was used, and samples were scanned a minimum of three times with at least 60–90 min of equilibration at low temperatures between scans. As in our previous studies (9Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2014-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Wang G. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22738-22746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature and transition enthalpy were obtained from the second DSC heating curve. Specifically, the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase temperatures (Tm) were taken from the transition peaks at the maximum peak height positions, and transition enthalpies (ΔH) were calculated from the peak areas using software provided by Microcal or Hart Inc. We have examined calorimetrically the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition behavior of aqueous lipid dispersions prepared individually from C(20):C(20)PE and its eight unsaturated derivatives. These nine lipid species have a common structural feature; both thesn-1- and sn-2-acyl chains contain 20 carbon atoms. The structural difference among the nine lipid species lies in the numbers and/or positions of the cis double bonds in their sn-2-acyl chains. Fig. 1illustrates the first and the immediate second DSC heating curves obtained with the aqueous lipid dispersions prepared individually from these nine lipid species. It is evident that some lipid samples exhibit thermal history-dependent phenomena. An example is demonstrated by the C(20):C(20)PE sample. Initially, two endothermic peaks centered at 66.3 and 82.7 °C are observed in the first DSC heating scan as shown in Fig. 1. In general, the formation of phospholipid bilayers in the crystalline state requires a pronounced incubation time at temperatures considerably belowTm. In our studies, phosphatidylethanolamines constituting the bilayers in the aqueous dispersion are always preincubated in the cold room (0 °C) for a minimum of 24 h. Hence, the lipid bilayers in the aqueous dispersion have already transformed into the highly ordered crystalline state prior to the first DSC heating scan. As a result, the low and high temperature peaks observed for C(20):C(20)PE in the first DSC heating scan correspond to the crystalline-to-gel and gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions, respectively (16Seddon J.M. Cevc G. Kaye R. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2634-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). On immediate reheating, only the high temperature peak at 82.5 °C is observed calorimetrically for the same C(20):C(20)PE sample. Subsequent repeated reheatings result in, again, a single endothermic transition at 82.5 °C, indicating that the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition of the C(20):C(20)PE bilayer is reproducible, and the crystalline-to-gel phase transition is irreversible under the present experimental conditions. Another example pertaining to the thermal history dependence of the phase transition behavior is observed for the aqueous dispersion of C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE. In the first DSC heating scan, a single, relatively sharp transition peaked at 26.4 °C is observed; however, the same sample exhibits a broader transition centered at 22.4 °C upon immediate reheating (Fig. 1). A similar thermal history-dependent phase transition behavior is also exhibited by the sample of C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE with a single, sharp transition centered at 27.2 °C in the first DSC heating scan and a broader transition peaked at 23.3 °C in the second DSC heating scan (Fig. 1). In fact, such a thermal history-dependent behavior has been observed previously for bilayers composed of saturated mixed chain PE (17Huang C. Wang Z. Lin H. Brumbaugh E.E. Li S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or saturated identical chain PE containing short fatty acyl chains (18Chang H. Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Mantsch H.H. Hsi S.C. Butler K.W. Cameron D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Based on the DSC results of these earlier studies, the single, sharp endotherm detected in the initial DSC heating scan of the C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE and C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE dispersions shown in Fig. 1 can be ascribed to the crystalline-to-liquid crystalline phase transition, and the broad low-temperature transition observed in the immediate second and subsequent DSC heating scans shown in the same figure can be assigned as the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. Because of the reproducible nature of the endothermic peak exhibited by the lipid sample in the second and subsequent DSC heating scans, only the values of the phase transition temperature (Tm) and the transition enthalpy (ΔH) associated with the single endotherms observed in the second DSC scans for various lipid samples were measured; these experimentally determined values are summarized in Table I.Table IThe thermodynamic parameters associated with the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition of lipid bilayers prepared from various phosphatidylethanolaminesLipidTmΔHΔS°Ckcal/molcal/mol/KC(20):C(20)PE82.512.535.2C(20):C(20:1Δ5)PE58.28.325.1C(20):C(20:1Δ11)PE43.38.125.6C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE22.44.515.2C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE23.36.020.2C(20):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE15.65.519.1C(20):C(20:3Δ5,8,11)PE23.05.819.6C(20):C(20:4Δ5,8,11,14)PE6.6∼5.2∼18.6C(20):C(20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17)PE3.55.720.6C(20):C(18)PE75.811.232.1C(20):C(18:1Δ9)PE33.97.022.8C(20):C(18:2Δ9,12)PE7.23.111.1C(20):C(18:3Δ9,12,15)PE10.44.716.6C(20):C(18:4Δ6,9,12,15)PE3.95.519.5C(18):C(20)PE79.111.532.7C(18):C(20:1Δ11)PE39.57.423.7C(18):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE18.53.913.4C(18):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE21.05.418.4C(18):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE11.75.117.9C(18):C(20:3Δ5,8,11)PE19.85.217.8C(18):C(20:4Δ5,8,11,14)PE1.3∼4.5∼16.4 Open table in a new tab The effects of numbers and positions of cis double bonds in the sn-2-acyl chain of C(20):C(20)PE on the phase transition temperature are illustrated in Fig. 2. When the first cis double bond is introduced near the carboxyl end of the sn-2-acyl chain at the Δ5position, the Tm value is greatly reduced from 82.5 to 58.2 °C with respect to the Tm of the saturated counterpart (Fig. 2 A). When three cisdouble bonds are present at the Δ5,8,11 positions, theTm is decreased by 35.2 °C from 58.2 to 23 °C. As methylene-interrupted cis double bonds are further introduced sequentially into the sn-2-acyl chain of C(20):C(20:3Δ5,8,11)PE on the methyl side of the newly added cis double bond, the Tm value is observed to decrease continuously, but by diminishing incremental changes, from 23 to 6.6 and then to 3.5 °C (Fig. 2 A). A similar ΔH-lowering trend caused by each additional unsaturation is also observed for this series of lipids (Table I). It should be noted that in this series of PE, the first cisdouble bond of all unsaturated sn-2-acyl chains begins at a common position of Δ5 near the carboxyl end, and all subsequent cis double bonds are introduced into the chain segment located between the existing double bond and the methyl terminus of the sn-2-acyl chain. In the second series of C(20):C(20)PE derivatives presented in Fig. 2 B, the first cis double bond is inserted at the Δ14 position in the sn-2-acyl chain. In contrast to the unsaturated lipids shown in Fig. 2 A, second and subsequent cis double bonds are always introduced into the chain segment located in between the existing double bond and the carboxyl end. Hence, the sn-2-acyl chains of this series of unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines belong to the ω-6 (orn-6) family. The Tm value is shown in Fig. 2 B to decrease steadily with increasing numbers ofcis double bonds; however, the incremental change of theTm becomes progressively smaller. For comparison, the Tm values of C(20):C(20)PC, C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PC, and C(20):C(20:4Δ5,8,11,14)PC reported by Keough et al. (6Keough K.M.W. Griffin B. Kariel N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are also plotted against the number of cisdouble bonds as indicated by the dotted curve in Fig. 2 B. Most interestingly, the Tm-lowering effect of each additional unsaturation appears remarkably similar to each other for the ω-6 PE and ω-6 PC series of lipids. In Fig. 2 B, the Tm values for C(20):C(20:1Δ14)PC and C(20):C(20:1 Δ14)PE bilayers, 26.9 and 46.1 °C, respectively, are calculated from equations derived previously for monoenoic PC and PE (20Huang C. Li S. Lin H. Wang G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). OtherTm values of the various ω-6 PEs are experimentally obtained as listed in Table I. The enthalpy change (ΔH) of the phase transition as a function of numbers ofcis double bonds follows a general trend similar to that observed for Tm. The values of bothTm and ΔH are summarized in Table I. A third series of PEs is presented in Fig. 2 C. The firstcis double bond of all unsaturated PEs in this series of lipids is positioned near the center of the sn-2-acyl chain at the Δ11 position. Second and subsequent thirdcis double bonds are added on the methyl side of the existing double bond. As shown in Fig. 2 C, theTm of the C(20):C(20:1Δ11)PE bilayer is 39.2 °C lower than that of its saturated counterpart. A further decrease of 20.9 °C in Tm is observed in going from the C(20):C(20:1Δ11)PE bilayer to the C(20):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE bilayer. In contrast, a slight increase in Tm (0.9 °C) is detected as the thirdcis double bond is subsequently added into the dienoicsn-2-acyl chain on the methyl end of the Δ14double bond. The Tm values of C(20):C(20)PC and its various unsaturated derivatives have been determined calorimetrically by Keough et al. (6Keough K.M.W. Griffin B. Kariel N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the Tmvalues of C(18):C(18)PC and its unsaturated derivatives with the firstcis double bond located near the center of thesn-2-acyl chain at the Δ9 position have been reported recently by Sanchez-Migallon et al. (7Sanchez-Migallon M.P. Aranda F.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These two sets of calorimetric data obtained with PCs are connected bydotted lines in Fig. 2 C. Clearly, these twodotted curves are strikingly similar in shape to thesolid curve determined in the present study using PEs. These excellent agreements indicate that within this series of unsaturated lipids the Tm value of the ω-3-unsaturated lipid with three cis double bonds is noticeably higher than that of the ω-6-unsaturated lipid with two cis double bonds, regardless of the nature of the lipid's head group. Since the general trends of the variations in Tm as a function of the numbers of cis double bonds are different for the various series of lipids shown in Fig. 2, A, B, andC, it is thus concluded that the positions of cisdouble bonds, in addition to the numbers of cis double bonds, can influence the chain melting behavior of the lipid bilayer. To further substantiate the influence of the positions ofcis double bonds in the sn-2-acyl chains of PEs on the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition behavior of the PE bilayer, the Tm and ΔH values of bilayers composed of C(20):C(20:3Δ5,8,11)PE, C(20):C(20:3Δ8,11,14)PE, and C(20):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE are compared in Fig. 3. These three lipids species are positional isomers; their numbers of carbon atoms and numbers ofcis double bonds are equal. The positions of the threecis double bonds in the sn-2-acyl chain, however, are different, and the difference can be represented by the position of the first olefinic carbon counting from the methyl end (or the ω-carbon). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the Tmvalues of these positional isomers have an inverted bell-shaped dependence on the position of the ω-carbon, with the minimalTm of 15.6 °C occurring at the ω-6-position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an inverted bell-shaped curve has been observed for the Tmvalues of lipid bilayers composed of positional isomers of polyunsaturated phospholipids. Previously, it has been shown that theTm values ofsn-1-saturated/sn-2-monounsaturated PCs and PEs with different positions of the single cis double bond exhibit inverted bell-shaped profiles in the plot ofTm versus the position of the singlecis double bond in the sn-2-acyl chain (9Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2014-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Tm profile shown in Fig. 3 B thus demonstrates that, like monoenoic lipids, the melting behavior of trienoic lipids is influenced in a distinctive manner by the position of multiple cis double bonds along the sn-2-acyl chain. In Fig. 1, the two acyl chains of various PEs all have 20 carbon atoms. To further investigate the influence of the introduction of increasing numbers of cis double bonds into the sn-2-acyl chain with a common position of the firstcis double bond, we have utilized the high resolution DSC techniques to investigate the phase transition behavior of mixed chain C(18):C(20)PE, C(20):C(18)PE, and their unsaturated derivatives. In these mixed chain PEs, the two acyl chains are of unequal numbers of carbons; however, C(18):C(20)PE and C(20):C(18)PE are positional isomers in which the numbers of carbons in the sn-1 andsn-2-acyl chains of the first lipid species are equal to those in the sn-2- and sn-1-acyl chains, respectively, of the second lipid species. Like the unsaturated derivatives of C(20):C(20)PE shown in Fig. 1, lipid bilayers prepared from some of the unsaturated derivatives of mixed chain PE also exhibit different phase transition behavior in the first and the second DSC heating scans (data not shown). For instance, the C(18):C(20:2Δ11,14)PE bilayer exhibits a single, narrower endotherm peaked at 24.2 °C in the first DSC heating scan, and this we ascribe to the crystalline-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. Upon reheating, this taller endotherm is replaced by a broader transition centered at 18.5 °C, and this is assigned as the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. Similarly, we find that the single transition peak corresponding to the crystalline-to-liquid crystalline phase transition of the C(20):C(18:2Δ9,12)PE bilayer is narrower, with a Tm of 12.4 °C in the initial DSC heating scan. Upon immediate reheating, the same bilayer exhibits a broader gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition withTm of 7.2 °C. The bilayer composed of trienoic ω-3 lipids such as C(18):C(20:3Δ11,14,17)PE or C(20):C(18:3Δ9,12,15)PE also shows a similar thermal history-dependent behavior. Nevertheless, the single transition that appears in the second DSC heating scan is always reproducible upon repeated reheatings, and we assign it as the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. In Table I, theTm and ΔH values of C(18):C(20)PE, C(20):C(18)PE, and their unsaturated derivatives are obtained from the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions that appeared in the second DSC heating scans. Fig. 4 A depicts the plot ofTm versus the increasing numbers ofcis double bonds in the sn-2-acyl chain of C(18):C(20)PE. In this series of unsaturated PE, the commoncis double bond in the sn-2-acyl chains is located at the Δ14 position, and the additional double bonds are on the carboxyl side of the existing double bond; hence, this series of unsaturated lipids belongs to the ω-6 family. The data shown in Fig. 4 A demonstrate clearly theTm-lowering effect of each additional unsat"
https://openalex.org/W2052917885,"Ricin is a heterodimeric protein toxin. The ricin A chain is able to cross the membrane of intracellular compartments to reach the cytosol where it catalytically inactivates protein synthesis. It is linked via a disulfide bond to the B chain, a galactose-specific lectin, which allows ricin binding at the cell surface and endocytosis. To examine the potential of ricin A to carry proteins into the cytosol and the requirement for unfolding of the passenger protein, we connected mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to ricin A by gene fusion via a spacer peptide. DHFR-ricin A expressed inEscherichia coli displayed the biological activities of the parent proteins and associated quantitatively with ricin B to form DHFR-ricin. The resulting toxin was highly cytotoxic to cells (4–8-fold less than recombinant ricin). DHFR-ricin cytotoxicity was inhibited by methotrexate, a DHFR inhibitor stabilizing DHFR-ricin A in a folded conformation. The DHFR moiety of DHFR ricin bound to the plasma membrane. Although methotrexate prevented this binding, it did not significantly affect DHFR-ricin endocytosis, which proceeded via ricin B chain. Intoxication kinetics data and a cell-free translocation assay demonstrated that protection of cells from DHFR-ricin cytotoxicity resulted from a selective inhibition by methotrexate of DHFR-ricin A translocation. We conclude that ricin A is a potential carrier of proteins to the cytosol, provided that the passenger protein is able to unfold for transmembrane transport. Ricin is a heterodimeric protein toxin.

Toxins such as ricin and diphtheria toxin (DT), 1The abbreviations used are: DT, diphtheria toxin; DTA, diphtheria toxin A chain; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MTX, methotrexate; RTA, ricin A chain; rRTA, recombinant RTA; RTB, ricin B chain; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate buffered saline. which have intracellular targets, are able to cross particular biological membranes. Both ricin and DT are heterodimeric proteins comprising an A chain bearing the catalytic activity responsible for the arrest of protein synthesis and a B chain enabling the toxin to bind at the plasma membrane (1Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Robertus J.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 2Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Frankel A.E. Immunotoxins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York1988: 39-73Google Scholar). Whereas DT recognizes a specific receptor (3Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), the lectin activity of ricin B chain (RTB) enables interaction with terminal galactose residues present on both glycoproteins and glycolipids. Ricin is then endocytosed, and electron microscopic studies revealed significant routing to endosomes and to thetrans-Golgi network (2Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Frankel A.E. Immunotoxins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York1988: 39-73Google Scholar). Expression of mutant GTPases involved in regulating vesicular transport steps early in the secretory pathway protects cells against ricin toxicity, suggesting that this toxin may be further transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (4Simpson J.C. Dascher C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20078-20083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At some point during ricin intracellular routing, the A chain is translocated across a membrane into the cytosol where protein synthesis is inhibited. This translocation step is rate-limiting for cytotoxicity (5Hudson T.H. Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16484-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a number of potential translocation sites are reported in the literature, namely the endosome (6Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the trans-Golgi network/Golgi apparatus (7Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), or the endoplasmic reticulum (4Simpson J.C. Dascher C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20078-20083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a direct assay for ricin translocation is available only in the endosome system (6Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unfolding requirement for protein translocation has essentially been studied using mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which once fused to the appropriate targeting sequence, could be transported across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli (8Arkowitz R.A. Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), imported into mitochondria (9Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 229-232Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar), or into the ER lumen (10Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Such transport processes are blocked by methotrexate (MTX), a folate analogue that stabilizes the native conformation of DHFR, thereby preventing the unfolding deemed necessary for the membrane translocation of most polypeptides (8Arkowitz R.A. Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 229-232Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, when DHFR was targeted to the chloroplast (11Guéra A. America T. van Waas M. Weisbeek P.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or the glycosome (12Häusler T. Stierhof Y.-D. Wirtz E. Clayton C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), import was not affected by MTX or its analogue, aminopterin. In the former case at least, this is due to a potent unfolding activity associated with the chloroplast surface (13Walker D. Chaddock A.M. Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4082-4085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutant DT A chain (DTA) and ricin A chain (RTA) with introduced disulfides were either not or poorly translocated (14Falnes P. Choe S. Madshus I.H. Wilson B.A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8402-8407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Argent R.H. Roberts L.M. Wales R. Robertus J.D. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26705-26710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that toxin A chains must also unfold to cross membranes. Bacterial toxins such as Pseudomonas exotoxin A (16Donnely J.J. Ulmer J.B. Hawe L.A. Friedman A. Shi X.-P. Leander K.R. Shiver J.W. Oliff A.I. Martinez D. Montgomery D. Liu M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3530-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and DTA (17Wieldocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4835-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) can transport foreign proteins into the cytosol. This transfer also requires unfolding of the passenger protein as shown for DTA with both acidic fibroblast growth factor (17Wieldocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4835-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and DHFR (18Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using heparin and MTX, respectively, to stabilize the folded structure of the passenger protein and arrest translocation. Nothing is known concerning the potential of RTA to deliver foreign proteins to the cytosol. Ultimately, however, enzymatically inactive ricin, like DT, is a potential carrier of antigenic peptides (19Yewdell J.W. Bennick J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This is of special interest since an initial step in the presentation of antigens by the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules requires peptide processing in the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (20Germain R.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Ricin may thus be used for cytosolic delivery of such peptides or even of whole proteins for subsequent processing, cell surface presentation and induction of a protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response (16Donnely J.J. Ulmer J.B. Hawe L.A. Friedman A. Shi X.-P. Leander K.R. Shiver J.W. Oliff A.I. Martinez D. Montgomery D. Liu M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3530-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Yewdell J.W. Bennick J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this study, we genetically fused DHFR to RTA and demonstrated the ability of RTA to introduce fused DHFR into the cytosol. This import was blocked by MTX, indicating that DHFR must unfold in order for it to translocate with RTA. This finding has obvious implications for the use of RTA as a carrier of cellular epitopes. All enzymes needed for DNA manipulations were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. or Pharmacia. Taq DNA polymerase for polymerase chain reaction, plasmid miniprep purification system, DNA silver sequencing kit, and reticulocyte lysates were from Promega. Most of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Pure RTB (without any detectable RTA) was purchased from Inland Biologicals, Austin, TX, whereas recombinant RTA (rRTA) was provided by Zeneca (UK). Western blotting detection kit and radiochemicals were from Amersham. AnEcoRI-PstI DHFR fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length coding sequence of the mouse DHFR in pDS5/3 vector (21Stuber D. Ibrahimi I. Cutler D. Dobberstein B. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3143-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as a template. The sense primer (CTAAG↓AATTCATGGTTCGACCATTG) was used to introduce anEcoRI site (↓) immediately upstream of the initiation codon. The antisense primer (CTTACTGCA↓GGTCTTTCTTCTCGTA) provided aPstI cleavage site (↓) immediately before the natural stop codon. The full-length RTA-coding sequence (22O'Hare M. Roberts L.M. Thorpe P.E. Watson G.J. Prior B. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in pKK 223.3 (Pharmacia) was used as a template to prepare by polymerase chain reaction an PstI-HindIII RTA fragment. The sense primer (GATCTCTGCA↓GATATTCCCCAAACAA) provided a PstI site (↓) before the second codon of RTA and the antisense primer (TTACCA↓AGCTTTCAAAACTGTGACGA) provided a HindIII site (↓) after the stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction products were gel-isolated after restriction and ligated in a stepwise manner into pKK 223.3. Preliminary experiments showed that the fusion protein prepared without any spacer was inactive in several assays for biological or biochemical activities (data not shown). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an internal BamHI site and coding for a spacer peptide (His-Ala-Ser-Thr-Pro-Glu-Pro-Asp-Pro-Val) was thus inserted using thePstI site. This peptide linker is similar to the flexible hinge region of a monoclonal antibody (23Brinkman U. Buchner J. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3075-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified plasmids were restricted with PstI before transformation of E. coli TG2. Clones were screened for acquisition of theBamHI restriction site, and DNA sequencing enabled the assessment of its orientation. The resulting protein is denoted DHFR-RTA. A 1.5-liter culture of E. coli TG2 containing the DHFR-RTA plasmid was grown at 30 °C. Expression was induced at anA595 ∼ 0.4 using 1 mmisopropylthiogalactoside. After 2 h at 30 °C, E. coli lysates were prepared by sonication, clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g (22O'Hare M. Roberts L.M. Thorpe P.E. Watson G.J. Prior B. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A) before loading (at 0.2 ml/min) onto a 5-ml MTX-agarose column (Sigma). After washing with 45 ml of buffer A and 60 ml of buffer A supplemented with 1 mKCl, DHFR-RTA was eluted with 1 mm MTX in buffer A and stored sterile at −80 °C, after adding 15% glycerol. The final yield of purified protein was greater than 10 mg/liter of culture. DHFR activity was measured as described previously (24Pastore E.J. Plante L.T. Kisliuk R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 34: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ability of RTA to inhibit protein synthesis was assayed using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (25Pelham H.R. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar) supplemented with globin mRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.). The two proteins (20 μm each) were mixed in PBS in the presence of 8 mm GSH. After 3 h at room temperature and overnight dialysis at 4 °C against PBS, the mixture was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Recombinant ricin (rRTA-RTB) was prepared using the same protocol. We experienced that 125I labeling of isolated RTA impaired subsequent association with RTB (data not shown). DHFR-RTA, as well as rRTA, used as a control throughout this study, was thus radiolabeled with 125I (26Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) after association with RTB. Transferrin and DHFR-ricin were conjugated with FITC, and ricin was complexed to colloidal gold as described elsewhere (27Beaumelle B. Hopkins C.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Endocytosis efficiency of radiolabeled DHFR-RTA-RTB (DHFR-ricin) by mouse BW5147 lymphocytes was measured using recombinant ricin as a control. Washes with 0.1 m lactose were used to displace plasma membrane-bound molecules (6Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 121: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The assay for toxin translocation from purified lymphocyte endosomes is described elsewhere (6Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-Transferrin, as a membrane-bound tracer, and 125I-horseradish peroxidase, as a soluble maker, were used as negative controls in all translocation experiments to monitor the integrity of endosomes. BW5147 cells were labeled with DHFR-ricin for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.15 mg/ml low density lipoproteins/ml, before lactose-scraping to displace membrane-bound ligand, ricin-gold binding, and lysis under hypotonic conditions. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation, and crude membranes collected by ultracentrifugation. They were then layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (40%/30%/20% sucrose). After 2 h at 100,000 ×g, endosomes were obtained from the 30%/20% interface, washed, and finally resuspended in translocation buffer (110 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Pipes, pH 7.1, supplemented with ATP except when otherwise indicated). Translocation was assayed for 2 h at 37 °C and was stopped by chilling on ice. The medium was then separated from endosomes by ultracentrifugation (160,000 ×g for 5 min) on a 17% sucrose cushion. Translocated proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and separated by reducing SDS-PAGE before autoradiography. Quantification was performed by densitometric analysis of films exposed within their linear range of detection. Direct γ counting of sliced gels was occasionally used to follow 125I-rRTA or125I-RTB translocation and gave identical results. When translocation of unlabeled DHFR-ricin and recombinant ricin was examined, Western blots (29Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) of translocated proteins were quantified using a Storm apparatus (Molecular Dynamics). Exponentially growing BW5147 cells were washed, then labeled with DHFR-ricin-FITC and ricin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/bovine serum albumin/low density lipoprotein (see above). After lactose scraping, cells were fixed for 15 min at 2 °C in PBS containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde before quenching for 15 min using 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. They were then washed with PBS, mounted in PBS supplemented with 2.5% 1,4-diacylbicyclo(2,2,2)octane, and examined under a Leica confocal microscope using a 63× lens and medial optical sections. Bleed through from one channel to the other was negligible. In preliminary experiments transferrin-FITC and an anti-mouse CD45 (clone I3/2) labeled with Cy5 were used as endosomal and plasma membrane markers, respectively (27Beaumelle B. Hopkins C.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells (18,000 BW5147 in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum or 6,000 L929 in RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum) were seeded in 96-well plates. Toxin solutions were added immediately (BW5147) or after 2 h at 37 °C to allow cell adherence (L929). After 24 h at 37 °C [35S]methionine (0.25 μCi) was added, and cells were incubated for a further 12–18 h. Precipitation with trichloroacetic acid was then performed either directly (BW5147) or following solubilization with 0.1 nNaOH after aspiration of the medium (L929). Proteins were collected onto glass fiber filters, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, then dried for radioactivity determination. Background incorporation was obtained from cells treated with 1 mm cycloheximide. To examine the kinetics of protein synthesis inactivation by recombinant ricin and DHFR-ricin the above protocol was modified. The cell number was increased to 70,000/well (BW5147) or 15,000/well (L929). A pulse incorporation of [35S]methionine (1 h) was performed at various times after the start of intoxication. Radiolabeled toxin (5 nm of125I-DHFR-ricin or 125I-recombinant ricin) was added to BW5147 cells (106/3 ml of RPMI/fetal calf serum) in the presence or absence of 50 nm MTX. After 0–24 h at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, then lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40) (30Shackelford D.A. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8334-8341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 20 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min). This step and the rest of the experiment were performed at 4 °C. The cleared lysate received 2 μl of sheep anti-RTA antibody and was mixed for 1 h on a rotating wheel before adding 7 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma). After 1 h on the wheel, the immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 3 min), washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, then once with PBS, and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer (30Shackelford D.A. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8334-8341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were exposed to storage phosphor screens that were analyzed using a Storm apparatus. All experiments were done at least in triplicate and repeated twice. Errors are expressed as S.E. Both DHFR (18Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and RTA (31O'Hare M. Brown A.N. Hussain K. Gebhard A. Watson G. Roberts L.M. Vitetta E.S. Thorpe P.E. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have been fused directly with a targeting protein to prepare biologically active hybrids. To obtain a biologically active DHFR-RTA chimera, we found it necessary to insert a linker peptide including three prolines (23Brinkman U. Buchner J. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3075-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) between the N terminus of recombinant RTA and the C terminus of DHFR (data not shown). The fusion protein was expressed inE. coli. A major band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of 50 kDa and reacting to both anti-RTA and anti-DHFR sera was observed on the gel of proteins from bacteria where expression was induced (Fig. 1). The DHFR-RTA fusion was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using immobilized MTX (MTX-agarose), as ascertained by protein staining and Western blotting using antisera against both DHFR and RTA (Fig. 2). In particular, cross-reactive material observed in E. coli sonicates using anti-DHFR sera was eliminated by this single chromatographic step (compare lane 4 in Fig. 1 and lane 3 in Fig. 2). A typical yield was greater than 10 mg/liter of culture. Since DHFR-RTA was purified using its affinity for MTX, it is clear that the DHFR portion of the chimera recognizes MTX. This binding is known to stabilize the folded conformation of DHFR (9Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 229-232Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The high protease resistance of DHFR-RTA, probably due to the well documented resistance of the RTA moiety of the chimera to proteases (13Walker D. Chaddock A.M. Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4082-4085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), prevented us from monitoring the folding of the DHFR moiety using protease protection experiments, as conventionally performed (8Arkowitz R.A. Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 229-232Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,18Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Biochem.

After purification, DHFR-RTA was tested on rabbit reticulocyte lysates for its ability to inactivate protein synthesis. The resulting IC50 (30 ± 10 nm) is similar to that of rRTA (15 ± 7 nm). DHFR-RTA also exhibited a DHFR activity (2.5 108 units/mol), which is virtually identical to the catalytic activity of native mouse DHFR (2.7–2.8 108 units/mol) (11Guéra A. America T. van Waas M. Weisbeek P.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that connection of DHFR to the N terminus of rRTA did not affect enzymatic activity of either of the parent proteins. Mixing equimolecular amounts of the DHFR-RTA with RTB and 8 mm GSH before dialysis generated homogenous DHFR-RTA-RTB (DHFR-ricin) as seen by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, lane 6). This shows that the chimera, DHFR-RTA, interacts as efficiently as rRTA with the B chain. Formation of RTB dimers is observed only when the A chain is absent from the mixture (lane 4). Recombinant ricin (rRTA-RTB, lane 1) was generated using the same procedure. This toxin was used as a control throughout the rest of this study. Recombinant ricin migrated slightly faster (lane 1) than native ricin (shown in lane 2) due to the absence of oligosacharides on the A chain. To examine the ability of rRTA to bring DHFR in the cytosol we first investigated intoxication of various cell types by DHFR-ricin. The results of these tests are summarized in Table I. The isolated chains of ricin were essentially nontoxic, whereas DHFR-RTA surprisingly showed moderate cytotoxicity, indicating that fused DHFR somehow promotes more efficient RTA uptake. Nevertheless, since association of DHFR-RTA with RTB to produce DHFR-ricin increased toxicity by 150–650-fold (Table I), DHFR-mediated internalization was not significantly involved in DHFR-ricin cytotoxicity as compared with uptake via the B chain (see below). DHFR-ricin is only 4-fold less toxic than ricin to L929 fibroblasts. It is also highly toxic to BW5147 lymphocytes (8-fold less than ricin).Table ICytotoxic activity of recombinant ricin, DHFR-ricin, and their isolated chains on BW5147 lymphocytes and L929 fibroblastsMoleculeIC50BW5147L929Recombinant ricin (rRTA-RTB)16 ± 2 pm10 ± 2 pmRecombinant ricin + MTX15 ± 2 pm10 ± 2 pmRTB, RTA, or rRTA>10 μm>10 μmDHFR-RTA20 ± 5 nm25 ± 5 nmMTX8 ± 5 nm30 ± 5 nmDHFR-Ricin120 ± 10 pm40 ± 3 pmDHFR-Ricin + MTX300 ± 10 pm60 ± 4 pmAssays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When MTX was used (at 10 and 30 nm on BW5147 and L929 cells, respectively) to protect cells against toxins, cytotoxicity was expressed as percentage of [35S]methionine incorporation as compared to that in cells treated with MTX only. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When MTX was used (at 10 and 30 nm on BW5147 and L929 cells, respectively) to protect cells against toxins, cytotoxicity was expressed as percentage of [35S]methionine incorporation as compared to that in cells treated with MTX only. To examine the possibility that DHFR-ricin toxicity resulted from processing of DHFR-RTA within cells to generate RTA, which would then be free to translocate to the cytosol, we studied the stability of DHFR-RTA within cells during intoxication by DHFR-ricin. As shown in Fig. 4, 125I-DHFR-RTA is stable upon BW5147 cells intoxication by 5 nm125I-DHFR-ricin, and no processing could be observed even after 24 h of contact. Quantitative analysis of images obtained from storage phosphor screens showed that beyond 24 h less125I-DHFR-RTA was recovered from cells (Fig. 4). This likely arose because more than 92% of cells have by then been killed by 5 nm DHFR-ricin and consequently a proportion of cells are nonpelletable by centrifugation. Identical results have been observed when 125I-rRTA was taken up by cells in the form of free subunit or as125I-recombinant ricin (L.M.R., unpublished). These results strongly indicate that, during intoxication by DHFR-ricin, DHFR-RTA does not break down to generate free rRTA by proteolysis. Together with the toxicity of DHFR-ricin we conclude that rRTA can carry DHFR into the cytosol. To examine whether unfolding of DHFR is required at any stage during intoxication by DHFR-ricin, MTX was used. However, as experienced by others, it was found that MTX alone interfered with the cytotoxicity assay (18Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and we could not use concentrations significantly higher than the IC50 (10–30 nm) of MTX. Nevertheless 10 nm MTX was found to slightly protect BW5147 cells (1.5–3-fold) against intoxication by DHFR-ricin but did not protect against recombinant ricin (Table I). Examination of the intoxication curves revealed that, at a DHFR-ricin concentration below its IC50, 5 nm MTX had a strong protective effect (Fig. 5), whereas MTX provided no protective effect when recombinant ricin was added to cells (not shown). We believe that protection by MTX is more efficient at low DHFR-ricin concentration because the ratio [MTX]/[DHFR-RTA] is higher and might ensure the binding of MTX to DHFR even in intracellular vesicles where, as a result of endocytosis, DHFR-RTA is more concentrated compared with MTX. Cell intoxication by toxins is a multistep procedure and before drawing any conclusions from cytotoxicity data it was necessary to determine at which stage MTX was interfering with the DHFR-ricin intoxication process. To study binding and endocytosis, the initial steps of the intoxication process, cells were labeled with ricin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate and DHFR-ricin-FITC for 30 min at 37 °C before lactose scraping, fixation and examination under a confocal microscope (Fig. 6). Ricin was essentially intracellular, in transferrin-positive endosomes (no"

Biochem. 1993; 214: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have provided a framework for understanding the overall architecture of PS I. The PS I complex has an elongated shape with a local pseudo-2-fold symmetry. PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE are peripheral subunits, located on the n side (stromal side in chloroplasts and cytoplasmic side in cyanobacteria) of photosynthetic membranes, with PsaC positioned in the center of each monomeric PS I on the axis of symmetry (26Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 27Boekema E.J. Boonstra A.F. Dekker J.P. Rögner M. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1994; 26: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The recent crystal analysis of PS I has indicated the location of [4Fe-4S] clusters FX, FA, and FB, 71 chlorophylla molecules, 31 transmembrane α-helices, and 9 surface and 3 stromal α-helices (26Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A monomer of PS I consists of a “catalytic domain” and a smaller “connecting domain” that links monomers to form a trimer. The connecting domain contains three transmembrane helices which may belong to PsaL and PsaI (22Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Xu Q. Hoppe D. Chitnis V.P. Odom W.R. Guikema J.A. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16243-16250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The remaining helices belong to the PS I core and other subunits in the catalytic domain. Twenty-two transmembrane and eight peripheral helices in the catalytic domain are arranged in an approximate symmetry (25Krauß N. Hinrichs W. Witt I. Fromme P. Pritzkow W. Dauter Z. Betzel C. Wilson K.S. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nature. 1993; 361: 326-331Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar,26Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Therefore, in agreement with the hydropathy analysis, the PsaA and PsaB cores are proposed to contain 11 transmembrane helices each (30Fish L.E. Kuck U. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1413-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the x-ray crystallography studies provided information of the PS I core, PsaA and PsaB could not be distinguished at the present resolution (26Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Similarly, the interaction between PS I core and small subunits, the surface domains, and residues of the PS I core and positioning of extramembrane loops with respect to the photosynthetic membranes have not been elucidated clearly. Topographical studies provide a valuable tool to understand these unresolved structural features of PS I. In this paper, we describe biochemical studies that used subunit-deficient mutants, limited proteolysis, and domain-specific antibodies. We studied the accessibility of PsaA and PsaB to different proteases, the shielding of PsaA and PsaB by smaller PS I subunits, and the position of the N terminus of PsaA with respect to the membrane plane.

Open table in a new tab Purified PS I complexes that had been treated with proteases were used for oxygen uptake measurements. In a total volume of 1 ml, PS I containing 10 μg of chlorophyll was used for the reaction. PS II inhibitor, electron donors, and electron acceptor were added to a final concentration of 50 μm3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea, 1 mm ascorbate, 1 mm 3,6-diaminodurene, and 2 mm methyl viologen. Oxygen uptake was measured on the Oxygen Monitoring System (Hansatech, UK) under the light density of 2430 μmol m−2s−1.

The expression of fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by a probe sonicator. The fusion proteins in inclusion bodies were isolated from membranes by centrifugation through 10% sucrose and applied directly for electrophoresis. The gel was stained by Coomassie Blue. The fusion proteins were excised from the gel and used for raising antibodies at Cocalico Biological. Antibody anti-PsaB718 was raised against the C terminus of PsaB (35Henry R.L. Takemoto L.J. Murphy J. Gallegos G.L. Guikema J.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera were evaluated by Western blotting against both thylakoid membranes and purified PS I complex. All three domain-specific antibodies anti-PsaA2, anti-PsaB450, and anti-PsaB718 recognized only the 66-kDa diffuse band corresponded to the comigrating PsaA and PsaB proteins. Isolated PS I complexes and photosynthetic membranes were solubilized at 37 °C for 2 h with 1% SDS and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved by a modified Tricine/urea SDS-PAGE for better resolution of the PS I subunits (10Xu Q. Jung Y.-S. Chitnis V.P. Guikema J.A. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immunodetection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.). For sequencing of N termini of proteolytic cleavage fragments, peptides were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, stained with Coomassie Blue containing 1% acetic acid for several minutes, destained with 50% methanol, and rinsed with deionized water. The N-terminal sequences were determined on an Applied Biosystems 477A Sequencer. In this study, we used limited proteolysis to map surface domains in the PsaA-B core of PS I. To examine activity of the protease-treated complexes, we determined PS I-mediated oxygen consumption rates by Mehler reaction (36Mehler A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 33: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 37Mehler A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 34: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Purified wild type PS I complexes were treated by eight proteases and employed in oxygen uptake measurements (Table III). The PS I activity of untreated sample was 377.5 μmol of O2/mg of chlorophyll/h. The PS I activities in all eight protease treatments ranged from 99 to 133% control activity. An active reaction center and functional electron transfer chain are required for the PS I activity that is measured by the oxygen uptake. Thus the protease treatments did not damage the electron transfer chain within the PS I complex. This may imply that the limited proteolysis could only access extramembrane loops. In most protease-treated samples, the PS I activity was higher than that in the untreated control. Proteases might have degraded the extramembrane loops and small subunits, thereby facilitating access of electron donor or acceptor to the electron transfer centers in the PS I complexes.Table IIIOxygen measurements of protease-treated PS I complexesProtease treatmentPS I activity (μmol O2/mg chlorophyll · h)Control377.5Chymotrypsin416.0Clostripain371.9Glu-C408.8Lys-C472.8Papain380.9Pepsin431.5Thermolysin455.9Trypsin503.4 Open table in a new tab Purified PS I complexes from the wild type strain were treated with proteases to study the accessibility of cleavage sites in PsaA and PsaB. The PS I complexes were treated with different concentrations of proteases and the resulting fragments were stained by Coomassie Blue or immunodetected by the three domain-specific antibodies (Fig. 1). The apparent masses of protein fragments were determined from the migration of prestained protein molecular weight standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) upon electrophoresis. The protein fragments that were visible in Coomassie Blue staining were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Three criteria, the N-terminal sequences, the apparent mass, and the immunoreactivities of proteolytic fragments, were used to identify the proteolytic fragments (Table IV).Table IVN-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the proteolytic fragments in Fig. 1Proteolytic fragmentsN-terminal sequencePosition of the first amino acidPredicted fragmentApparent massPredicted masskDakDaThIATKFPKFPsaB, 2PsaB, 2–49745.054.7ThIIINSGINSPsaB, 498PsaB,498–73123.826.4ThIIIWGIGHSPsaB, 295PsaB, 295–49716.222.1ThIVILNAHKGPsaB, 304PsaB, 304–49715.221.1GlIIIKQILIEPsaB, 449PsaB, 449–73127.631.7ChISQDXAPsaB, 9PsaB, 9–50643.254.8PalIIQATXGKPsaB, 462PsaB, 462–73126.230.1TrIWGXPGPsaA, 28PsaA, 28–?53.6?The position of the first amino acid was identified after comparison with the deduced amino acid sequence of PsaA and PsaB. Open table in a new tab The position of the first amino acid was identified after comparison with the deduced amino acid sequence of PsaA and PsaB. The ThII, GlIII, and PaIII fragments were deduced accurately from their N-terminal sequence and from their immunodetection by anti-PsaB718 showing that they contain the C terminus of PsaB. The ThI, ThIII, ThIV, and ChI fragments were recognized by the anti-PsaB450 antibody indicating that they contain the PsaB450 peptide. The ThI fragment also contained the N terminus of PsaB and showed a similar accumulation pattern as the ThII fragment. The immunodetection pattern and apparent mass imply that these fragments resulted from a single cleavage at Ile-498 of PsaB. The ThIII and ThIV fragments were predicted with the same C terminus of the ThI fragment and matched the immunodetection and apparent mass. They may have resulted from the further cleavage of the ThI fragment as their accumulation followed that of ThI. The N terminus of the ChI fragment resulted from the cleavage at Phe-8 of PsaB protein. The immunodetection and apparent mass of the ChI fragment is similar to the ThI fragment, thus the C terminus of the ChI fragment should result from a cleavage close to Ile-498. The only reasonable site to generate C terminus of the ChI fragment is Phe-506. When the PS I complexes were treated with trypsin, the signals corresponding to the intact PsaA were decreased significantly when detected by anti-PsaA2. Also, a diffused band that migrated slightly faster than the PsaA-B band was visible in Coomassie Blue staining. This can be explained as a cleavage in the N-terminal sequence of PsaA. The N-terminal sequence of the TrI fragment revealed the cleavage site in the N-terminal extramembranal domain of PsaA. Thus these fragments, grouped as type I fragments, could be identified with accuracy. Similar to many membrane proteins, the electrophoretic behavior of the PS I core proteins was anomalous compared with the migration of soluble proteins. The comigrating PsaA and PsaB formed the 66-kDa diffuse band in PAGE, whereas the deduced mass is more than 80 kDa. The predicted mass was higher than the apparent mass. This was also true for the type I fragments and was considered during the prediction of the other fragments. Table V lists the results of Western blotting, the apparent mass, and the predicted proteolysis regions for the protein fragments that could be immunodetected with domain-specific antibodies. The identity of these fragments could be predicted by several ways. The prediction of type 1 fragments was described in the previous paragraph. Type 2 and type 3 fragments contained epitope for the N terminus of PsaA or epitope at the C terminus of PsaB, as shown by the immunodetection results. Based on their apparent mass, there was only one reasonable cleavage site for the fragments of type 2. For example, the GlV fragment, a 44.5-kDa polypeptide recognized by anti-PsaA2, could result from the proteolysis at Glu-512 in PsaA with a predicted mass of 47.5 kDa. The adjacent Glu-C cleavage sites were Glu-342 or Glu-695 in PsaA which made the predicted mass of 37.9 or 76.9 kDa unreasonable for GlV. In type 3 fragments, there were several possible cleavage sites located within one extramembrane loop or in a region containing two extramembrane loops. For example, the GlII fragment, a 33.7-kDa peptide immunodetected with anti-PsaA2, could result from four reasonable cleavages between Glu-323 and Glu-342 in PsaA with the predicted mass from 35.8 to 37.9 kDa. These four possible cleavage sites were located in the E loop. The LyI fragment is the only type 4 fragment. It accumulated similarly as the TrI fragment, so it was predicted to have the similar cleavage at the N-terminal loop of PsaA. The type 5 fragments contained the peptide PsaB450 but there was not enough data to identify them accurately. Overall, the limited proteolysis of the wild type PS I provided extensive information about the residues that are exposed on the surface of the PS I complex.Table VAccessibility of PsaA and PsaB to proteases, the predicted proteolysis sitesProteolytic fragmentsImmunodetectionApparent massPredicted"
https://openalex.org/W2006608964,"In this study, endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction was supported by fibrin generated from several purified fractions of plasma fibrinogen, purified proteolytic fragments of plasma fibrinogen, recombinant normal fibrinogen, and recombinant variant fibrinogen. These results were surprising because some of these fibrinogens lack domains that are known binding sites for the integrin receptors that support clot retraction. Specifically, fibrinogens lacking Aα-chain RGD residues at 572–574 or lacking the γ-chain residues AGDV 408–411 supported endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction as well as intact fibrinogen. Thus, clot retraction mediated by endothelial cells is not dependent on either of these sites. A variety of monoclonal antibodies against the integrin αvβ3 partially inhibited the endothelial cell-mediated retraction of clots formed from plasma fibrinogen. As expected, an antibody to the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 did not inhibit endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction. These results indicate that this retraction is mediated at least in part by αvβ3. These results support the conclusion that (a) neither of the two fibrinogen cell binding sites described above is required to support clot retraction or that (b) either site alone or in conjunction with other fibrin(ogen) region(s) can support clot retraction. Thus, endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction appears to be dependent on fibrinogen cell binding sites other than those required to support adhesion of resting platelets to immobilized fibrinogen and platelet aggregation.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the role in clot retraction mediated by endothelial cells of presumptive endothelial cell and platelet binding sites on fibrinogen. Platelets, fibroblasts, melanoma cells, and endothelial cells are known to support clot retraction (1De Clerck R. Borgers M. De Gaetano G. Vermylen J. Br. J.

The conclusion that αvβ3 can support clot retraction mediated by nucleated cells was confirmed by Chen et al.(4Chen Y-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alemany et al. (14Alemany M. Concord E. Garin J. Vincon M. Giles A. Marguerie G. Gulino D. Blood. 1996; 187: 592-601Crossref Google Scholar) provided evidence that a fibrinogen γA-chain binding region of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is on its β3 subunit and that ligand binding to this site is independent of platelet activation. Their results support the possibility that the αvβ3 integrin of endothelial cells, like the homologous αIIbβ3 on platelets, may be able to bind fibrinogen via the γA-chain carboxyl termini and that this hypothetical binding may play a role in endothelial-mediated clot retraction. Fibrinogen platelet binding sites have been identified using a variety of experimental systems. Farrell et al. (8Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) used recombinant forms of fibrinogen to show that platelet aggregation appears to be dependent on residues within the sequence 408–411 of the fibrinogen γA-chain. This was shown more directly by Rooney et al.(9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These observations confirmed and extended earlier results obtained using aggregated genetically modified γ-chains (15Hettasch J.M. Bolyard M.G. Lord S.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Under static conditions, the adhesion of both resting and stimulated platelets to immobilized fibrinogen appears to be dependent on the fibrinogen γA-chain carboxyl-terminal platelet binding sites (6Gartner T.K. Amrani D.R. Derrick J.M. Kirschbaum N.E. Matsueda G.R. Taylor D.B. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 47-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Gartner T.K. Amrani D.R. Derrick J.M.

The activation-independent adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen also appears to be dependent on the fibrinogen γA-chain carboxyl-terminal platelet binding sites under flow conditions (17Zaidi T.N. McIntire L.V. Farrel D.H. Thiagarajan P. Blood. 1996; 88: 2967-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rooney et al. (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), using a recombinant form of fibrinogen (without the γA-chain terminal sequence AGDV on either γA-chain), tested γA-chain involvement in platelet aggregation and clot retraction. The recombinant fibrinogen did not support platelet aggregation in response to ADP but did support clot retraction. Therefore, the ligand sites on fibrinogen that support platelet aggregation may be different than the sites on fibrin that support clot retraction. These latter studies did not exclude the possibility that normal fibrinogen secreted from the platelet α granules may have provided functional fibrinogen γA-chains to support the clot retraction. However, a recent study by Holmback et al. (18Holmback K. Danton M.J.S. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) confirms the conclusion of Rooney et al. (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that mice which have only fibrinogen lacking the QAGDV sequence of both γ-chains can support clot retraction even though the altered fibrinogen cannot support platelet aggregation. These results raise the interesting possibility that non-γ-chain platelet binding sites on fibrinogen can support platelet-mediated clot retraction (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,18Holmback K. Danton M.J.S. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Others have reported the blocking of clot retraction by certain RGD-containing peptides (presumably by binding to the receptors that mediate retraction). Unfortunately this inhibition did not identify the receptor binding site(s) on the ligand (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Hantgan R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Likewise, the role of the γA-chain carboxyl-terminal platelet binding regions is not clear. Despite the fact that the γA-chain carboxyl-terminal peptide mimetics LGGAKQAGDV (L10) and HHLGGAKQAGDV (H12) have been shown to inhibit platelet-mediated clot retraction (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the dependence of clot retraction on the corresponding platelet binding sites on fibrinogen has not been shown. In fact, as described above, recent evidence demonstrates that clot retraction mediated by human and mouse platelets is not dependent on the AGDV sequence of the fibrinogen γA-chain (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,18Holmback K. Danton M.J.S. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, care must be taken in interpreting the results of peptide inhibition studies (19Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were tested in clot retraction assays because, unlike platelets, they do not secrete fibrinogen in response to treatment with thrombin. Thus, various forms of exogenous fibrinogen in conjunction with HUVECs would be useful to try to identify the cell binding site(s) on fibrinogen that is required to support clot retraction. Peak 1 fibrinogen (γAγA), fibrinogen fraction I-9 (a fibrinogen fragment that lacks about 100 carboxyl-terminal residues from each Aα-chain including the 572–574 RGD sequence and that is bivalent with respect to the γA-chain binding sites (20Mosesson M.W.

HUVECs and endothelial cell growth medium (containing 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, 3 mg/ml bovine brain extract, 2% fetal bovine serum) were purchased from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). The cells were grown to 80–95% confluence, and then a 0.025% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA solution (Clonetics) was used to release the cells from the surface of the flask, after which trypsin neutralization solution (Clonetics) was added. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 220 × gfor 5 min, the supernatant liquid was decanted, and the cells were suspended in fresh endothelial cell growth medium. The suspended cells were allowed to recover from trypsinization by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C before use in the clot retraction assay. The clot retraction assay was a modification of published methods (3Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tapoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1785-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H.

The cell suspension was centrifuged, the liquid was decanted, and the cells were washed three times with a Tyrodes Hepes solution (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm Hepes, pH adjusted to 7.35) containing 1 mg/ml glucose and 3.5% bovine serum albumin. The washed cells were added to the incubation solution (wash solution containing 2 mm CaCl, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 μg/ml fibrinogen or fragment) and allowed to incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Cell numbers were estimated using a hemocytometer. ∼2 × 105 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of clotting medium (250 μg/ml fibrinogen or fragment in Tyrodes Hepes solution containing glucose, bovine serum albumin, CaCl2, and aprotinin) in a sylanized (using trimethylsylyl) aggregometer cuvette. mAbs that bind integrins were added to cells in incubation buffer before addition to clotting medium. mAbs that bind fibrinogens or their fragments were added to the clotting medium before the addition of the cells. Thrombin (Sigma) (1 unit/ml) was added to inititate fibrin formation. The retracting clot was photographed at several time intervals, and the photos were traced on a back-lit digitizing pad (Ortho-Graphics, Inc.) providing automated data entry into a computer. The longitudinal cross-sectional area not occupied by the clot was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total area. The results are reported as percent clot retraction where 0% is no retraction and 100% would be complete retraction, which is undefined. Each clot retraction experiment was repeated at least once. Some experiments were repeated only once due to the large amount of antibodies and recombinant fibrinogen required. Although data are presented as quantitative, these studies are not meant to be a stringent quantitative analysis; however, the experiments provide unequivocal data as to the support or inhibition of HUVEC-mediated clot retraction by the forms of fibrinogen, antibodies, and peptides used in the experiments described above. mAbs used were LM609 (50 μg/ml), which binds to the αvβ3 receptor (22Cheresh D.A.

The following fibrinogens were used in this study to identify the binding sites utilized by endothelial cells to support clot retraction: peak 1 fibrinogen (γAγA) (6Gartner T.K. Amrani D.R.

Fraction I-9 fibrinogen is devoid of intact Aα-chains and contains instead Aα-chain derivatives of the size of Bβ-chains (54 kDa) or smaller (20Mosesson M.W. Galanakis D.K. Finlayson J.F. J. Biol.

Normal recombinant fibrinogen and recombinant fibrinogen γ407 (which lacks residues 408–411 on both γA-chains) were synthesized by transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and purification was monitored as described (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reduced conditions according to the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and appeared as three bands corresponding to the Aα-, Bβ-, and γ-chains. Western blot analysis was performed as described (35Binnie C.G. Hettasch J.M. Strickland E.S. Lord S.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using 4A5. Normal recombinant and plasma fibrinogen developed bands corresponding to the γ-chain; however, the γ-chain from γ407 fibrinogen was undetectable, consistent with previous results (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Peptide inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to platelets were tested as inhibitors of endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction. The peptide LGGAKQAGDV, a γA-chain carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen peptide mimetic, GRGDSP, and a control scrambled version of GRGDSP, PGRSGD, were tested in the clot retraction assay at different concentrations. Quantity and sequences were verified by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Biotechnology Center laboratories. The methods used for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of these peptides have been described (19Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells retracted clots formed from thrombin-treated peak 1 fibrinogen γAγA, peak 1 fibrinogen fraction I-9, and peak 2 fibrinogen fraction I-9 (Fig. 1). The rates of clot retraction mediated by the HUVECs were approximately the same for all three types of fibrinogen used in these experiments (Fig. 2). The ability of peak 1 fibrinogen fraction I-9 to support clot retraction mediated by the endothelial cells means that the Aα-chain RGD (572–574) sequence was not required for retraction. Furthermore, the fact that clot retraction was also supported by peak 2 fibrinogen fraction I-9 demonstrates that if the carboxyl terminus of the γA-chain is required to support clot retraction, a single γ-chain is sufficient.Figure 2Time course of endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction.

This mAb antibody was used because it binds to the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen γA-chain (19Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby inhibits cross-linking of fibrinogen by Factor XIIIa (19Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the adhesion of platelets to immobilized fibrinogen (6Gartner T.K. Amrani D.R. Derrick J.M. Kirschbaum N.E. Matsueda G.R. Taylor D.B. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 47-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the mAb 4A5 inhibited the retraction of clots formed from both peak 1 fibrinogen and fibrinogen fraction I-9 compared with mIgG controls. This inhibition of endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction by the mAb 4A5 indicated either a requirement for the γA-chain carboxyl terminus or an indirect inhibitory effect on clot retraction by the antibody. To distinguish between these alternatives, recombinant fibrinogen containing normal Aα- and Bβ-chains, but lacking residues γA408–411 (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used in the clot retraction assay. Recombinant normal fibrinogen was used as a control. The recombinant normal fibrinogen supported the adhesion of normal and resting platelets (data not shown) and clot retraction in HUVECs (Fig. 1). Likewise, recombinant fibrinogen γ407, though it did not support the adhesion of resting platelets (data not shown), supported clot retraction mediated by HUVECs without any apparent impairment of function (Figs. 1and 4).Figure 4Endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction with recombinant fibrinogen and recombinant γ407 fibrinogen that lacks residues γ408–411. γAγA Fg, peak 1 fibrinogen (n = 3); Fr I-9, fibrinogen peak 1 fraction I-9 (n = 3), which lacks the Aα-chain 572–574 RGD sequences; rFg, recombinant normal fibrinogen (n = 2); rFg407, recombinant fibrinogen missing the γA-chain carboxyl-terminal 408–411 AGDV sequences (n = 2).

It has been shown that fibrin prepared from fibrinogen molecules lacking residues 1–42 of the Bβ-chains failed to support endothelial cell spreading (36Bunce L.A. Sporn L.A. Francis C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Francis F.W. Bunce L.A. Sporn L.A. Blood Cells. 1993; 19: 291-307PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen 325 in this study supported HUVEC clot retraction (data not shown). Two peptides that inhibit platelet-mediated clot retraction were tested in the HUVEC system (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although γA-chain carboxyl-terminal mimetic peptide L10 (LGGAKQAGDV) inhibited platelet-mediated clot retraction (data not shown), it did not inhibit retraction in the HUVEC system at the concentrations up to 6 mm (Fig. 5). In contrast, the RGD peptide GRGDSP, but not a scrambled control peptide (PGRSGD), inhibited clot retraction mediated by platelets (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (data not shown) and endothelial cells (Fig. 5). Anti-integrin mAbs also provided useful information concerning the details of endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction. First, the αvβ3-specific mAb LM609 partially inhibited clot retraction (Fig. 6 A). The αv-specific mAb CLB-706 also inhibited clot retraction (Fig. 6 A). These results confirm observations made by others (3Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tapoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1785-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating a role for the αvβ3integrin in clot retraction mediated by a variety of nucleated cells. Similarly, the mAb 7E3, but not A2A9, inhibited clot retraction in HUVECs (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, both of those mAbs inhibited platelet-mediated clot retraction, presumably reflecting a role for αIIbβ3 in the process (Fig. 6 B). These data demonstrate that clot retraction mediated by HUVECs is αvβ3-dependent since LM609, CLB-706, and 7E3 but not A2A9 or JB1a (which blocks the function of β1 integrin subunits) can inhibit αvβ3-dependent functions. Finally, the AP3 mAb, which binds to the β3 integrin subunit and can inhibit platelet-mediated clot retraction (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Pandya B.V. Cierniewski C.S. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2994-3000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also partially inhibited (at a concentration of 100 μg/ml) clot retraction in the HUVEC system (Fig. 6 A). The αIIbβ3-specific mAb Tab, which also inhibits platelet-mediated clot retraction (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), did not inhibit endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction (50 μg/ml) compared with a mouse IgG control (data not shown). Studies by Cheresh et al. (5Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and others (16Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provide evidence implicating the fibrinogen Aα-chain RGD 572–574 sequence as a putative endothelial cell binding site recognized by αvβ3 (22Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated that the fibrinogen Aα-chain 95–97 RGD residues do not play a significant role in HUVEC adhesion to fibrinogen (5Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 16Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAb data indicated that endothelial cell adhesion to this region of immobilized fibrinogen was mediated by the integrin αvβ3 (5Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 22Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Consequently, the possibility was tested that the fibrinogen Aα-chain 572–574 sequence is required to support αvβ3-mediated clot retraction by HUVECs. This possibility was tested by using fibrinogen fragment fraction I-9 in an endothelial cell-supported clot retraction assay. Surprisingly, the fibrinogen fraction I-9 (Table I) supported apparently normal clot retraction. These results mean that the Aα-chain RGD (572–574) sequence is not required for clot retraction mediated by HUVECs. The finding that HUVECs-mediated clot retraction is not dependent on the fibrinogen Aα-chain RGD 572–574 sequence resulted in the evaluation of the role of the fibrinogen γA-chain carboxyl-terminal sequences in the endothelial cell clot retraction system. Four approaches were used for this aspect of the study. Proteolytic fragments of fibrinogen, an anti-fibrinogen mAb, recombinant fibrinogens, and peptides were used in these studies. Peak 2 fibrinogen fraction I-9 (Table I) was found to support HUVEC-mediated clot retraction normally (Fig. 1), demonstrating that if a fibrinogen γ-chain carboxyl terminus is required, a single functional γA-chain carboxyl terminus is sufficient even in the absence of the Aα-chain 572–574 RGD sequences. The mAb 4A5 results reflected either a requirement for the γA-chain carboxyl-terminal platelet binding site or indirect inhibitory effects caused by 4A5 (Fig. 3). Use of recombinant human fibrinogen, which does not support platelet aggregation (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or the adhesion of resting platelets (data not shown), supported normal clot retraction in the endothelial cell clot retraction system (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the inhibition of clot retraction by mAb 4A5 apparently resulted from indirect effects (steric hindrance or the induction of an incompatible conformational change of the fibrinogen), since clot retraction was not dependent on the presence of the AGDV sequence of the fibrinogen γA-chain. The γA-chain carboxyl-terminal mimetic peptide L10 has been shown to inhibit platelet-supported clot retraction (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) but did not inhibit clot retraction at concentrations up to 6 mmmediated by endothelial cells in our assays (Fig. 5). The data from the proteolytic fragments of fibrinogen, an anti-fibrinogen mAb, recombinant fibrinogens, and peptides demonstrate that HUVEC-mediated clot retraction is not dependent on the 408–411 AGDV sequence of the fibrinogen γA-chain. Thus, the fibrinogen cell binding sites required to support endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction are different than those required to support platelet aggregation (8Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P.

McIntire L.V. Farrel D.H. Thiagarajan P. Blood. 1996; 88: 2967-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of the fibrinogen Bβ-chain is a presumptive endothelial cell interaction site. Since this region of the Bβ-chain appears to affect the interaction of HUVECs with fibrin, a protease-treated form of fibrinogen that lacks the first 42 amino acid residues of the Bβ-chains (fibrinogen 325) (28Pandya B.V. Cierniewski C.S. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2994-3000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pandya B.V. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was tested and shown to support clot retraction (data not shown). Even though this region has been shown to interact with HUVECs, it is not necessary to support HUVECs clot retraction. The amino-terminal 42 residues of the Bβ-chains are therefore not required to support clot retraction mediated by HUVECs. The results of this study reveal that HUVECs can mediate clot retraction in a manner that is not dependent on the Aα-chain 572–574 RGD sequences, the 408–411 AGDV sequence of the γA-chain carboxyl-terminal platelet binding sites, or residues 1–42 of the fibrinogen Bβ-chains. In summary, the data mean that (a) either of these fibrinogen cell binding sites may be sufficient to support clot retraction mediated by HUVECs or that (b) another region(s) of fibrinogen alone or in conjunction with either of the above mentioned fibrinogen platelet or nucleated cell binding sites can be utilized by endothelial cells to support clot retraction. The data presented here for HUVECs agree with those reported by others for the role of the fibrinogen γA-chain in clot retraction mediated by platelets (9Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol.

The results presented here extend the observation that the AGDV sequence is not required to support clot retraction to a new system, the endothelial cell clot retraction system. Additionally, these results demonstrate that clot retraction in this system is not dependent on either the Aα-chain 572–574 RGD sequence or the Bβ-chain 1–42 residues. A role for the αvβ3 integrin in endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction is supported by the facts that the αvβ3-specific mAb LM609, the αv-specific mAb CLB-706, and the mAb 7E3, which blocks both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3, inhibited endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction, whereas the αIIbβ3-specific A2A9 and the anti-β1 function blocking mAb, JB1a, did not inhibit clot retraction in this system. The fact that the mAb AP3 partially inhibited clot retraction may indicate a role for residues within the β3 348–426 sequence, which encompass the AP3 binding site, in clot retraction mediated by endothelial cells as well as platelets, since AP3 has also been shown to inhibit platelet-mediated clot retraction (10Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L.. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Carr M.E. Carr S.L. Hantgan R.R. Braaten J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the inhibitory effect of AP3 may be indirect. Finally, the observations that sites other than the γA-chain 408–411 AGDV sequences and the Aα-chain 572–574 sequences appear to be required for both platelet (fibrinogen fraction I-9 supports platelet-mediated clot retraction, data not shown) and HUVEC-mediated clot retraction may mean that receptor sites other than those used for platelet aggregation and platelet and endothelial cell adhesion are used to bind fibrin during clot retraction mediated by either platelets or HUVECs.

In contrast, E. coli EF-Ts is unable to stimulate mitochondrial EF-Tu. EF-Tsmt forms a tight complex with E. coliEF-Tu governed by an association constant of 8.6 × 1010. This value is 100-fold stronger than the binding constant for the formation of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex. To test which domain of EF-Tsmt is important for its strong binding with EF-Tu, chimeras were made between E. coli EF-Ts and EF-Tsmt. Replacing the N-terminal domain of E. coli EF-Ts with that of EF-Tsmtincreases its binding to E. coli EF-Tu 2–3-fold. Replacing the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt with the corresponding region of E. coli EF-Ts decreases its binding to E. coli EF-Tu ∼4–5-fold. A chimera consisting of the C-terminal half of E. coli EF-Ts and the N-terminal half of EF-Tsmt binds to E. coli EF-Tu as strongly as EF-Tsmt. A chimera in which Subdomain N of the core of EF-Ts is replaced by the corresponding region of EF-Tsmtbinds E. coli EF-Tu ∼25-fold more tightly than E. coli EF-Ts. Thus, the higher strength of the interaction between EF-Tsmt and EF-Tu can be localized primarily to a single subdomain. Bovine mitochondrial elongation factor Ts (EF-Tsmt) stimulates the activity of Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). In contrast, E. coli EF-Ts is unable to stimulate mitochondrial EF-Tu. EF-Tsmt forms a tight complex with E. coliEF-Tu governed by an association constant of 8.6 × 1010.

Thus, the higher strength of the interaction between EF-Tsmt and EF-Tu can be localized primarily to a single subdomain. The classical model for the elongation cycle of protein biosynthesis was developed on observations made with Escherichia coli EF-Tu. 1The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu,Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu; EF-Tsmt, bovine mitochondrial elongation factor Ts; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EF-Tu forms a ternary complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP that promotes the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA with the A-site of the ribosome. EF-Tu then hydrolyzes the bound GTP and is released from the ribosome as an EF-Tu·GDP complex (1Bosch L. Kraal B. van der Meide P. van Noort J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 30: 91-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second elongation factor (EF-Ts) promotes the release of GDP, forming an intermediate EF-Tu·Ts complex (2Miller D. Weissbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). InE. coli, GTP binds to the EF-Tu·Ts complex, promoting the release of EF-Ts and the formation of an EF-Tu·GTP complex. A new ternary complex can then form, and the cycle repeats. In Thermus thermophilus, a dimeric complex (EF-Tu·Ts)2 occurs through the interaction of two EF-Tu molecules with a stable EF-Ts dimer (3Blank J. Nock S. Kreutzer R. Sprinzl M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast to the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex, the T. thermophilus complex is not dissociated to a significant extent by either GDP or GTP alone (4Arai K. Ota Y. Nakamura S. Hennele C. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial EF-Tu and EF-Ts have been purified from bovine liver as a tightly associated complex (EF-Tu·Tsmt) (5Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16324-16330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EF-Tu·Tsmt complex differs from the correspondingE. coli complex in that EF-Tu·Tsmt is not readily dissociated by guanine nucleotides (5Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16324-16330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, no significant amounts of intermediates equivalent to EF-Tu·GTP or EF-Tu·GDP can be detected in the animal mitochondrial system. However, mammalian EF-Tu·Tsmt forms a ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA (7Woriax V. Bullard J. Ma L. Yokogawa T. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The basic steps of the bacterial elongation cycle thus appear to be occurring in mammalian mitochondria. However, the equilibrium constants that govern the interaction of EF-Tu with EF-Ts and guanine nucleotides appear to be significantly different. The cDNAs encoding EF-Tumt and EF-Tsmt have been cloned and sequenced from bovine and human liver (8Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that EF-Tumt has 56% identity to E. coli EF-Tu while EF-Tsmt is less than 30% identical to E. coli EF-Ts. When EF-Tsmt is expressed and purified from E. coli, it forms a 1:1 complex with E. coli EF-Tu (EF-TuEco·Tsmt) (9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This heterologous complex is very resistant to dissociation by guanine nucleotides even at high concentrations of GDP or GTP (10Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This feature of the heterologous complex is quite reminiscent of the native EF-Tu·Tsmt complex. Thus, it is apparently the nature of EF-Ts that determines the strength of its interaction with EF-Tu. However, it is not clear what features of EF-Tsmt modulate its tight interaction with EF-Tu. The crystal structures of trypsin-modified E. coliEF-Tu·GDP and of Thermus aquaticus EF-Tu complexed with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue have been determined (11Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 12Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 1: 35-49Google Scholar). Analysis of these structures indicates that EF-Tu folds into three domains. Domain I encompasses about the first 200 residues and contains the guanine nucleotide binding site. Domains II and III are each ∼100 residues long. All three domains are involved in binding aminoacyl-tRNA (13Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The structure of the E. coliEF-Tu·Ts complex has also been determined (Fig. 1) (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This structure indicates that EF-Ts consists of 4 structural modules: the N-terminal domain (residues 1–54); the core domain (residues 55–179 and 229–263); the dimerization domain (residues 180–228); and the C-terminal module (residues 264–282). The core domain is further divided into Subdomain N (residues 55–140) and Subdomain C (residues 141–179 and 229–263). The N-terminal domain, Subdomain N, and the C-terminal module interact with Domain I of EF-Tu, whereas Subdomain C interacts with Domain III of EF-Tu. EF-Tsmt binds to EF-Tu more tightly than does E. coli EF-Ts. This work attempts to determine the regions of the EF-Tsmt giving rise to its higher affinity for EF-Tu. Clones encoding His-tagged variants of E. coli EF-Ts and EF-Tsmtin pET24C(+) were prepared previously (9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To make a mutant ofE. coli EF-Ts lacking the N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 53), a fragment of the E. coli EF-Ts gene containing sequences encoding amino acid residues 54–282 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer ETsP4 (ccggctcgagagactgcttggacatcgcagc) and ETsΔN (cgggatcccatatgaacgttgctgctgacggc). The PCR fragment was digested withNdeI and XhoI and cloned into NdeI- and XhoI-digested pET24C(+), giving the construct pETsΔN. To make a mutated form of EF-Tsmt lacking the N-terminal domain (residues 1–56), a fragment of EF-Tsmt gene containing the sequence encoding amino acid residues 57–283 was amplified by PCR using primer BMC-N (cgggatcccatatgcgtaagaccaaagaaggt) and C-XhoI (ccgctcgagttcggcgtctgctgcgtc). The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned intoNdeI- and XhoI-digested pET24C(+), giving the construct pTsmtΔN. To make Chimeras I and II (see Fig. 5), aHindIII site was introduced into the EF-Tsmtgene at nucleotide sequence position 342 by site-directed mutagenesis using the Chameleon™ Double-Stranded, Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Primer MP15 (cttcctcccatg aagcttagcagctttact) was used for the mutagenesis. The HindIII site is underlined and the mutated residues are shown in boldface. This mutation changes residue Arg-54 to Lys-54. In the human EF-Tsmt gene, the amino acid residue at the same position is Lys-54. The N-terminal domain of E. coli EF-Ts from the N terminus to residue 49 was amplified by PCR using primer ETsP1 (gggaagcttcat atggctgaaattaccgcatccct) and ETsP2 (cccaagctt cgctgctttaatagcaccg). TheE. coli EF-Ts sequence is underlined and the restriction enzyme sites are boldface. To make Chimera I, the PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and used to replace the NdeI to HindIII fragment of EF-Tsmt using standard methods. To make Chimera II, a PCR fragment of E. coli EF-Ts encompassing amino acid residues 52 to the C terminus was amplified using primer ETsP3 (cccaagctt gcaggcaacgttgctgctgac) and ETsP4 (ccggctcgag agactgcttggacatcgcagc). The E. coli EF-Ts sequence is underlined and the restriction enzyme sites are boldface. This PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and XhoI and used to replace the HindIII toXhoI fragment of EF-Tsmt gene. Chimeras III and IV were prepared using chimeric primers and two rounds of PCR. This strategy, which is outlined in Fig. 2, permits the preparation of chimeric proteins at any position without the need to introduce new restriction sites. To make Chimera III, a portion of EF-Tsmt gene from the N terminus to amino acid residue 162 in the mature form of this factor (9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primer Vec-2 (taggggaattgtgagcggataac), derived from the pET24C(+) vector, and primer MP25 (agaacccagaacgtcgcc gctggcaccttcac). This primer is in itself a chimeric piece of DNA. The sequence shown in boldface is derived from the EF-Tsmt gene, while the underlined sequence is from the E. coli EF-Ts gene. DNA was amplified from 100 ng of plasmid DNA carrying the EF-Tsmtgene in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 100 pmol of each primer and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. PCR was carried out for 20 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The DNA fragment from this amplification reaction was purified by gel electrophoresis. A chimeric EF-Ts fragment was then amplified by using primer ETsP4 and the PCR fragment prepared above as primers with the E. coli EF-Ts gene in pET24C(+) as the template and the PCR conditions described above. This second DNA fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, digested with NdeI andXhoI, and cloned into pET24C(+) to make Chimera III. To make Chimera IV, a PCR fragment of the E. coli EF-Ts gene in pET24C from the N terminus to amino acid residue 148 was amplified by primer Vec-2 and MP24 (agagccaacatagaaacc ttccagcgcagcaac). This primer is a chimera in which the underlined sequence is derived from theE. coli EF-Ts gene while the sequence in boldface is derived from the EF-Tsmt gene. The PCR conditions described above were used, and the amplified DNA was purified by gel electrophoresis. This PCR fragment and primer C-XhoI were then used as primers to amplify a chimeric EF-Ts fragment using the EF-Tsmt DNA as template and the conditions described above. This second PCR fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, digested with NdeI and XhoI, and cloned into pET24C(+) to make a construct encoding Chimera IV. To make Chimera V, Chimeras II and III were both digested with PstI and XhoI. The 0.7-kilobase fragment of Chimera III was ligated to the 5.5-kilobase fragment of Chimera II. The His-tagged forms of E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Tumtwere expressed and purified as described previously (15Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). E. coli EF-Ts, Chimera I, and Chimera IV were expressed as described previously (15Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and purified under two conditions. In the first set of conditions, 10 mm Mg2+ was included in the buffers. In the second set of conditions, 10 μm GDP was also included in the preparation buffers. Expression of EF-Tsmt and Chimeras II, III, and V was carried out as described (9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and these proteins were purified under native and denaturing conditions. Under native conditions, 10 mmMg2+ was included in the buffers but no GDP was added. When cell extracts were prepared under native conditions, EF-Tsmt was isolated as 1:1 complex with E. coliEF-Tu. To purify EF-Tsmt, Chimera II, and Chimera III free of E. coli EF-Tu, the EF-TuEco·Tsmt complexes were denatured. The His-tagged forms of EF-Tsmt and the chimeras were purified through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and renatured (10Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined by the Micro-Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Samples (∼10 μg each) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stained with Coomassie Blue (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The activities of E. coli EF-Ts, EF-Tsmt, and their chimeras were determined by measuring their abilities to promote guanine nucleotide exchange with E. coli EF-Tu·GDP and to stimulate the activity of E. coli EF-Tu in poly(U)-directed polymerization on E. coli ribosomes (17Fox L. Erion J. Tarnowski J. Spremulli L. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6018-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schwartzbach C. Farwell M. Liao H. Spremulli L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of E. coliEF-Ts, EF-Tsmt, and their chimeras were also determined by their ability to stimulate the activity of expressed EF-Tumt in the poly(U)-directed polymerization of phenylalanine on E. coli ribosomes (10Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine the binding constants of EF-Tsmt, Chimeras III and V to E. coli EF-Tu, 1:1 complexes of EF-TuEco·Tsmt, EF-TuEco·Chimera III, or EF-TuEco·Chimera V (0.2 to 0.4 μm) were incubated in 500-μl reactions containing 10 μm or 20 μm [3H]GDP (200 cpm/pmol) in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1m NH4Cl) at 0 °C for 90 min. The amount of EF-Tu·GDP present at equilibrium was determined using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (17Fox L. Erion J. Tarnowski J. Spremulli L. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6018-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of active EF-Tu in the complexes was estimated to be ∼50% based on its ability to bind GDP. To determine the binding constants of E. coli EF-Ts, Chimera I and Chimera II to E. coli EF-Tu, EF-Tu·[3H]GDP (0.5 μm, 50 pmol), [3H]GDP (500 cpm/pmol) (5 or 10 μm) and EF-Ts or its chimeras (1–3 μm, 100–300 pmol) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) at 20 °C for 30 min in the buffer indicated above. The amount of EF-Tu·GDP at equilibrium was measured by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (17Fox L. Erion J. Tarnowski J. Spremulli L. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6018-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Kobs for the reactionEF­Tu·GDP+EF­Ts⇄EF­Tu·Ts+GDPEquation 1 Kobs=[EF­Tu·Ts][GDP][EF­Tu·GDP][EF­Ts]was calculated in each case and used to determine the binding constant (KTs) for the reactionEF­Tu+EF­Ts⇆EF­Tu·TsEquation 2 using the relationshipKTs=Kobs·KTu·GDPEquation 3 KTu·GDP is the binding constant ofE. coli EF-Tu to GDP (3.3 × 108m−1) (19Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The E. coli EF-Tu used for these experiments was ∼50% active based on its ability to bind GDP. EF-Ts was estimated to be fully active based on the percentage of EF-Tsmt that could bind EF-Tu. When mitochondrial EF-Tsmt is expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein, it forms a 1:1 complex with E. coli EF-Tu (9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Free EF-Tsmt can be purified by denaturing this complex and then allowing renaturation of the EF-Tsmt (10Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). E. coli EF-Ts has also been overexpressed in E. coli and purified as a His-tagged protein (15Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When no GDP is added to the isolation buffers, a small amount of E. coli EF-Tu co-purifies with the E. coli EF-Ts following chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins. E. coli EF-Ts was prepared free of E. coli EF-Tu by using buffers containing GDP and Mg2+. The abilities of EF-Tsmt and E. coli EF-Ts to stimulate GDP exchange and poly(U)-directed polymerization withE. coli EF-Tu were tested (Fig. 3, A and B). The purified EF-Tsmt stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange with E. coli EF-Tu and also stimulates the poly(U)-directed polymerization of phenylalanine (Fig. 3 A). However, substantially higher levels of EF-Tsmt are required to achieve the same degree of stimulation observed with E. coliEF-Ts. Nearly 10-fold higher concentrations of EF-Tsmt are required to promote the same amount of nucleotide exchange obtained with E. coli EF-Ts (Fig. 3 A). The activity of EF-Tsmt in stimulating poly(U)-directed polymerization withE. coli EF-Tu is ∼25% of that obtained with E. coli EF-Ts (Fig. 3 B). EF-Tsmt stimulates the activities of both EF-Tumt and E. coli EF-Tu in poly(U)-directed polymerization (Fig. 3, B and C). E. coli EF-Ts cannot stimulate the activity of EF-Tumt(Fig. 3 C). This observation indicates that E. coli EF-Ts may be unable to bind EF-Tumt or that it binds to EF-Tumt much more weakly than GDP does. Alignment of the primary sequence of E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Tumt indicates that these two factors are 56% identical. In addition, all of the residues in E. coli EF-Tu that are in contact with EF-Ts in the crystal structure are identical or are conservative replacements in EF-Tumt. Thus, the failure of E. coli EF-Ts to stimulate the mitochondrial factor in translation is surprising. As indicated above, higher levels of EF-Tsmt are required to produce the same degree of stimulation of E. coli EF-Tu observed with low levels of E. coli EF-Ts. Previous results have suggested that EF-Tsmt binds to E. coliEF-Tu more tightly than does E. coli EF-Ts (10Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This idea is based on the observation that the heterologous complex EF-TuEco·Tsmt is not readily dissociated by guanine nucleotides while the homologous E. coli complex is. Thus, the lower activity of EF-Tsmt probably arises from its slow release from EF-Tu which reduces the rate of ternary complex formation. To test this idea, we have determined the approximate equilibrium association constant for the binding of EF-Tsmtto E. coli EF-Tu and have compared this value with that obtained with the homologous factor. To determine the association constant for the binding of EF-Tsmt to E. coli EF-Tu, theKobs of the following reaction was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.”*E.coli EF­Tu·GDP+EF­Tsmt⇄EF­TuEco·Tsmt+GDPEquation 4 The binding constant (KTs) of EF-Tsmt to E. coli EF-Tu was calculated fromKobs, and the binding constant of E. coli EF-Tu to GDP (3.3 × 108m−1) (Table I) as described by Miller and Weissbach (19Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The value obtained (8.6 × 1010) indicates that EF-Tsmt binds toE. coli EF-Tu quite tightly. The Kobsfor E. coli EF-Ts was also measured, and the corresponding binding constant (KTs) was calculated (Table I). The KTs of E. coli EF-Ts determined here (9 × 108m−1) is quite similar to the value of 5 × 108m−1 obtained from the literature (19Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Comparison the KTs of E. coli EF-Ts with the KTs of EF-Tsmt indicates that EF-Tsmt binds to E. coli EF-Tu ∼100 times more tightly than does E. coli EF-Ts.Table IKobs and KTs for EF-Ts and chimerasEF-Ts usedKobsKTs(m−1)E. coliEF-Ts2.7 ± 0.48.9 ± 1.3 × 108EF-Tsmt260 ± 298.6 ± 1.0 × 1010Chimera I6.8 ± 1.92.2 ± 0.6 × 109Chimera II59 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.2 × 1010Chimera III308 ± 621.0 ± 0.2 × 1011Chimera V67 ± 122.2 ± 0.4 × 1010 Open table in a new tab Analysis of the protease sensitivity of EF-Ts (20Bogestrand S.

Sequence alignment indicates that there is significant homology between E. coli EF-Ts and EF-Tsmt in the N-terminal domain and it is likely that it will fold in a similar three-dimensional structure. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt was also important for its binding to EF-Tu or whether other interactions of this factor could compensate for the loss of this domain. To examine this question, N-terminal deletion mutants of E. coli EF-Ts and EF-Tsmt were constructed (Fig. 5). The EF-Ts deletion mutants were tested for their abilities to bind E. coliEF-Tu and to stimulate the activities of E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Tumt in polymerization. The N-terminal deletion mutant of E. coli EF-Ts is unable to stimulate the activity of EF-Tu in guanine nucleotide exchange or in poly(U)-directed polymerization (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with previous results showing that a proteolytic derivative of E. coli EF-Ts lacking the N-terminal domain is unable to stimulate the activity of EF-Tu (20Bogestrand S. Wiborg O. Thirup S. Nyborg J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The N-terminal deletion mutant of EF-Tsmt is unable to bind E. coli EF-Tu (data not shown). It is also inactive in stimulating the activity of eitherE. coli EF-Tu or EF-Tumt (data not shown). These data indicate that the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt, like that of E. coli EF-Ts, is important for its function in protein synthesis. These data, while indicating that the N-terminal domain is important for the interaction of EF-Tsmt with EF-Tu, do not provide any insight into whether this region plays a role in the stronger affinity for EF-Tu observed with EF-Tsmt. In the crystal structure of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex (Fig. 1) (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain and Subdomain N of the core interact with Domain I of E. coli EF-Tu. Subdomain C of the core interacts with Domain III of E. coli EF-Tu. As indicated above, EF-Tsmt binds to E. coli EF-Tu more tightly than does E. coli EF-Ts. It has not yet been possible to make direct measurements of the binding constant of EF-Tsmt for EF-Tumt. However, it is clear that guanine nucleotides cannot dissociate the EF-Tu·Tsmtcomplex (6Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16324-16330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that EF-Tsmt will also have a high affinity for EF-Tumt. To help determine which region(s) might be important for the strong interaction of EF-Tsmt with EF-Tu, an analysis of the possible structure of EF-Tsmt was carried out using the 3-dimensional structure of E. coli EF-Ts and several secondary structure prediction programs as a guide (Fig. 4). The overall lengths of E. coli EF-Ts and the mature form of EF-Tsmt are the same (9Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the two factors appear to have several significant differences in their overall structure. EF-Tsmt aligns well with E. coli EF-Ts in the N-terminal domain, and this region of the protein most likely folds into 3 helices as observed for the E. coli factor. The first 2 strands of β-sheet in Subdomain N and helices h4 and h5 are also predicted to be present in EF-Tsmt. However, Subdomain N is interrupted by an insertion of ∼20 amino acids. The precise position of this insertion is difficult to predict since the two proteins show very little primary sequence homology in this region making the alignment difficult. The remainder of Subdomain N including helices h6 and h7 and the final strand of the β-sheet (s3) are all predicted to be present. Subdomain C is predicted to begin with β-strand s4 which is followed by an insertion of ∼12 residues before strands s5 and s6 and helices h8 and h12 are found. The dimerization domain (helices h9, h10, and h11) which is involved in contacts between two EF-Ts molecules in the crystal structure of the EF-Tu·Ts complex is largely missing from EF-Tsmt. Only portions of what may be helix h10 appear to be present. Finally, the C-terminal module (h13) present in E. coli EF-Ts is missing in EF-Tsmt. The secondary structural analysis described above provided a good tool for the analysis of what regions of EF-Tsmt are important for the tight binding to EF-Tu observed with EF-Tsmt. Based on this analysis, a series of chimeric proteins consisting of portions of E. coli EF-Ts and EF-Tsmt were constructed (Fig. 5). Chimeras were first constructed by exchanging the N-terminal domains (h1 through h3) of E. coli EF-Ts and EF-Tsmt (Fig. 5, Chimeras I and II). These two chimeric proteins were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged proteins and purified by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns. In addition, His-tagged forms of EF-Tsmt and E. coli EF-Ts were also expressed and purified. All of these proteins were initially purified from cell extracts in buffers without GDP but containing Mg2+. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, EF-Tsmt is purified as a 1:1 complex with E. coli EF-Tu (Fig. 6, lane 1). In contrast,E. coli EF-Ts binds to E. coli EF-Tu much less tightly, and only ∼1 mol of EF-Tu is present for every 20 mol ofE. coli EF-Ts (Fig. 6, lane 2). The weaker binding of E. coli EF-Ts prevents it from competing effectively for EF-Tu with the guanine nucleotides and aminoacyl-tRNA present in the extract. Chimera I which carries the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt binds E. coli EF-Tu ∼2–3-fold better than E. coli EF-Ts does (Fig. 6, lane 3). It is isolated with a higher ratio of EF-Tu present in the preparations (∼1:10) than observed with E. coli EF-Ts. This observation suggests that the N-terminal domain has a small effect on increasing the affinity of EF-Ts for EF-Tu. Chimera II binds to E. coliEF-Tu much more tightly than does E. coli EF-Ts but it somewhat less tightly than EF-Tsmt (Fig. 6, lane 4). To obtain more quantitative measurements of the affinity of these chimeras for E. coli EF-Tu, equilibrium association constants were determined as described above for the normal proteins. For these experiments, E. coli EF-Ts and Chimera I were prepared free of EF-Tu by the use of buffers containing GDP during the preparation of the factors. EF-Tsmt and Chimera II were prepared by the denaturation of the EF-TuEco·Tsmt complex followed be renaturation of the EF-Tsmt (10Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analysis of these preparations on SDS-PAGE indicated that they were free of EF-Tu (data not shown). As indicated in Table I, replacing the N-terminal domain ofE. coli EF-Ts with that of EF-Tsmt (Chimera I) increases the binding constant for EF-Tu ∼2–3-fold. This observation suggests that this region of EF-Tsmt has a small effect on the strength of the interaction with EF-Tu. In the complementary construct (Chimera II), replacing the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt with that of E. coli EF-Ts decreases the binding constant of EF-Tsmt to E. coli EF-Tu ∼4–5-fold. Chimera II which is predominantly derived from EF-Tsmt still binds EF-Tu ∼20-fold more tightly than doesE. coli EF-Ts. These observations indicate that the strength of the interaction observed with EF-Tsmt is governed primarily by sequences from h4 to the C terminus with a small contribution from sequences in the N-terminal domain. To localize the region giving EF-Tsmt its stronger affinity for EF-Tu more closely, two more chimeras were prepared (Fig. 5, Chimeras III and IV). The preparation of these chimeras was based on the observation that the N-terminal half (the N-terminal domain and Subdomain N, h1 through s3) and the C-terminal half (from s4 to the C terminus) of E. coli EF-Ts fold somewhat independently in the crystal structure of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex (Fig. 1). However, the three-stranded β-sheet structure in Subdomain N forms an interface with the three-stranded sheet in Subdomain C (Fig. 1) and these chimeras must be able to form this structure to fold correctly. Chimera III consists of the N-terminal domain and Subdomain N of EF-Tsmt with the C-terminal half of E. coliEF-Ts while Chimera IV is the reverse construct (Fig. 5). Chimera III was purified as a 1:1 complex with E. coli EF-Tu (Fig. 6,lane 5). This observation suggests that it has folded correctly and that the determinants for the strong interaction between EF-Tsmt and EF-Tu reside in the NH2-terminal half of the protein. The association constant for the binding of Chimera III to EF-Tu (Table I) indicated that this chimera binds to EF-Tu as strongly as does the native EF-Tsmt. This observation indicates that all of the stronger binding between EF-Tsmt and EF-Tu arises from the N-terminal domain and Subdomain N of EF-Tsmt. This region of EF-Ts is in contact with Domain I of EF-Tu. These data also indicate that the C-terminal half of EF-Tsmt does not contribute significantly to the ability of EF-Tsmt to bind EF-Tu more tightly than E. coli EF-Ts. The reciprocal construct (Chimera IV, Fig. 5) was unable to bindE. coli EF-Tu (Fig. 6, lane 6) and probably folds incorrectly. This observation suggests that the interface between Subdomain N and Subdomain C does not form correctly in this construct. Chimera IV is expressed well in E. coli and does not appear to form inclusion bodies or to be readily degraded. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that Chimera IV has significant structure but that certain features crucial to its interaction with EF-Tu are not correctly positioned. A detailed examination of the β-sheet interface indicates that sequence differences in s6 affect the interaction of s6 with s3, possibly resulting in a distortion of the interface between the β-sheets. The data obtained with Chimeras I, II, and III suggest that sequences within Subdomain N of EF-Tsmt are primarily responsible for the stronger affinity of this factor for EF-Tu. To confirm this idea, an additional chimera was prepared (Chimera V, Fig. 5) in which Subdomain N of E. coli EF-Ts was replaced with that of EF-Tsmt. When Chimera V is prepared from E. coli, it co-purifies with considerable amounts of EF-Tu as does EF-Tsmt (Fig. 6, lane 7). This chimera is longer than the others and migrates on SDS-PAGE at a higher molecular weight than the other chimeras, due to the insertion present in Subdomain N of EF-Tsmt. The association constant for the binding of Chimera V to EF-Tu (Table I) was ∼25-fold higher than that ofE. coli EF-Ts. This observation agrees with the idea that sequences in Subdomain N of EF-Tsmt are primarily responsible for the stronger interaction of this factor with EF-Tu. Since there is an insertion of ∼20 amino acids in this region, contacts between one or more of these residues may be occurring between EF-Tsmt and Domain I of EF-Tu. As indicated in Fig. 3, E. coli EF-Ts is active with its endogenous factor but not with EF-Tumt. In contrast, EF-Tsmt can stimulate the activities of both bacterial and mitochondrial EF-Tu, although it is less efficient thanE. coli EF-Ts in stimulating the activity of E. coli EF-Tu. The activities of the chimeric EF-Ts proteins in stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange with E. coli EF-Tu were tested. As indicated in Fig. 7 A, replacing the N-terminal domain of E. coliEF-Ts with that of EF-Tsmt in Chimera I results in a factor that has the same activity as E. coli EF-Ts in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange. This level of activity, like that ofE. coli EF-Ts, is ∼10-fold higher than the activity observed with EF-Tsmt. Chimera II, in which the N-terminal domain of E. coli EF-Ts has replaced that in EF-Tsmt, has about one-half of the activity observed withE. coli EF-Ts (Fig. 7 A). This chimera has 3–4-fold higher activity than that seen with EF-Tsmt. The activity of Chimera III in stimulating GDP exchange is about the same as that observed with EF-Tsmt (Fig. 7 B). This chimera has the entire N-terminal half of EF-Tsmt and binds to EF-Tu as tightly as EF-Tsmt. Chimera IV is not active in stimulating GDP exchange as would be expected from its apparent inability to bind EF-Tu. The activity of Chimera V is slightly higher than that of EF-Tsmt but significantly lower than E. coli EF-Ts. Overall, these results indicate that EF-Tsmt and the chimeras that bind to EF-Tu more tightly have lower activities in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange. The activities of the chimeras in stimulating the activity of E. coli EF-Tu in polymerization were also tested (Fig. 8 A). In this assay, as in the GDP exchange assay, EF-Tsmt is less active than E. coli EF-Ts (Figs. 3 and 8 A). The activity of Chimera I is very similar to that of E. coli EF-Ts. The activity of Chimera II is only slightly lower than that of E. coli EF-Ts and much higher than that of EF-Tsmt. This assay is probably somewhat less sensitive to changes in the affinity of EF-Ts for EF-Tu, since the formation of the EF-Tu·Ts complex is coupled to the subsequent very favorable formation of the ternary complex. This coupling might tend to offset the stronger interaction between EF-Tu and EF-Ts to some extent. The activity of Chimera III is about the same as that observed with EF-Tsmt. Since this chimera has the same affinity for EF-Tu as does EF-Tsmt, this result is to be expected. These data further indicate that replacing the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt (Chimera II) increases the activity of EF-Tsmt in stimulating the activity of E. coli EF-Tu, while replacing the C-terminal half of EF-Tsmt does not appear to affect the activity of EF-Tsmt. As shown in Fig. 3 C, E. coli EF-Ts is not able to stimulate the activity of EF-Tumt in polymerization. The activities of the chimeras in stimulating EF-Tumt in polymerization were tested (Fig. 8 B). Replacing the N-terminal domain of E. coli EF-Ts with the corresponding region of EF-Tsmt (Chimera I) does not restore activity, indicating that the interaction between Domain I of EF-Tu and the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts is not responsible for the lack of activity observed with E. coli EF-Ts. In agreement with this idea is the observation that Chimera II, in which the N-terminal domain of EF-Tsmt is replaced by the corresponding region fromE. coli EF-Ts, is quite comparable with that of EF-Tsmt (Fig. 8 B). Chimera III, in which the C-terminal half of EF-Tsmt has been replaced by that fromE. coli EF-Ts, has very little or no activity in stimulating EF-Tumt in polymerization. Chimera V could not be tested in this assay since it could not be refolded into an active conformation following denaturation of the EF-TuEco·Chimera V complex. These data indicate that E. coli EF-Ts cannot stimulate the activity of EF-Tumt because of a failure of the C-terminal half of this factor to interact correctly with Domain III of EF-Tumt. This observation is surprising since residues in EF-Tu making contact with Subdomain-C of EF-Ts in the crystal structure have been conserved in the mitochondrial factor. The data presented here show that EF-Tsmt binds to E. coli EF-Tu ∼100-fold more tightly than E. coli EF-Ts. Analysis of the chimeric proteins indicates that sequences in Subdomain N of the core of EF-Ts are primarily responsible for the difference in the tightness of binding observed while the N-terminal domain also makes a small contribution. Six residues in the N-terminal domain of E. coli EF-Ts make contact with residues in Domain I of E. coli EF-Tu (14Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Some of these residues are conserved in EF-Tsmt while others are primarily conservative replacements. These latter residues in EF-Tsmt may account for the small effect on binding contributed by the N-terminal domain. In the interactions between Domain I of E. coli EF-Tu and Subdomain N of the core of E. coli EF-Ts, four residues (Asp-80, Phe-81, Ile-125, and Gly-126) of E. coli EF-Ts are directly involved. The only residue in EF-Tsmt that is different in this group is the conservative replacement of Leu-151 for the corresponding residue Ile-125 in E. coli EF-Ts. Since Ile-125 of E. coli EF-Ts makes a backbone contact with EF-Tu, it is unlikely that Leu-151 of EF-Tsmt contributes to the stronger interaction observed between EF-Tsmt and EF-Tu. D80A and F81A mutants of E. coli EF-Ts bind to EF-Tu much more weakly than does wild type EF-Ts. However, the corresponding D84A and F85A mutants of EF-Tsmt still bind to E. coli EF-Tu as tightly as does the wild-type factor (15Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Asp-84 and Phe-85 of EF-Tsmt do not contribute to the stronger interaction of EF-Tsmt withE. coli EF-Tu. However, as indicated in Fig. 4, Subdomain N of the core of EF-Tsmt has an insertion of ∼20 residues. Although the exact position of this insertion is difficult to assess, it is likely that these residues account for the stronger interaction between EF-Tsmt and EF-Tu. Although EF-Tsmt interacts with E. coli EF-Tu very well, it is significantly less active than E. coli EF-Ts in stimulating the activity of E. coli EF-Tu. One explanation for the lower activity observed is that the strong binding actually inhibits the activity of EF-Tsmt. The reaction of E. coli EF-Ts in stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange can be described asEF­Tu·GDP+EF­Ts⇄[EF­Tu·Ts·GDP]Equation 5 ⇄EF­Tu·Ts+GDP E. coli EF-Ts is recycled by the dissociation of the EF-Tu·Ts complex by GDP or GTP. When EF-Tsmt forms a tight complex with E. coli EF-Tu, the dissociation of the complex by GDP or GTP is very slow, making the turnover number of EF-Tsmt in the reaction low. The small turnover number may explain the low activity of EF-Tsmt in stimulating GDP exchange. In the polymerization assay, the availability of Phe-tRNA probably pulls the reaction toward the formation of the ternary complex and increases the turnover of EF-Ts, which results in the somewhat higher relative activity of EF-Tsmt in the polymerization assay. In agreement with this idea is the observation that the chimeras that bind EF-Tu less tightly generally have higher activities than those that bind EF-Tu more tightly. Despite the 56% identity in sequence betweenE. coli EF-Tu and EF-Tumt, E. coliEF-Ts is unable to stimulate the activity of EF-Tumt in polymerization. This result suggests that E. coli EF-Ts does not interact very well with EF-Tumt or that the interaction occurring fails to result in effective nucleotide exchange. Unfortunately, the poor binding of guanine nucleotides to EF-Tumt does not allow a direct measure of the exchange reaction. Since Chimera II is able to stimulate the activity of EF-Tumt, the N-terminal domain of E. coli EF-Ts probably interacts with EF-Tumt quite well. The low activities of Chimeras I and III with EF-Tumt suggests that the C-terminal half of E. coli EF-Ts does not form a good interaction with Domain III of EF-Tumt. This observation is unexpected since the residues in EF-Tu making contact with Subdomain C of EF-Ts in the crystal structure have been conserved in EF-Tumt. On the other hand, the alignment of the sequences of EF-Ts from a number of organisms shows that the C-terminal half of EF-Ts is not as conserved as the N-terminal half. E. coliEF-Ts has an extra α-helix (h13) at the C-terminal terminus compared with EF-Tsmt. In addition, E. coliEF-Ts has a dimerization domain that is not present in EF-Tsmt. These structural differences may lead to the inability of E. coli EF-Ts to stimulate the activity of EF-Tumt."

Mitogenic stimulation of C3H10T1/2-MRF4 cells with basic fibroblast growth factor negatively regulates MRF4 transcriptional activity, inhibiting myogenesis. Using patch clamp techniques we found that mitogenic stimulation of C3H10T1/2-MRF4 cells also up-regulated SK.

Addition of the SK channel blocker charybdotoxin to growth factor-containing culture medium overcame basic fibroblast growth factor-induced negative regulation of MRF4, as evidenced by induction of inward rectifier potassium and acetylcholine receptor channel expression identical to that observed in mitogen-withdrawn cells.

SK appears to be a pivotal signaling component for growth factor regulation of both cell proliferation and differentiation. The regulated expression of ion channels is a key component of developmental processes in many cell types. In nonexcitable cells such as lymphocytes and fibroblasts, both potassium and voltage-independent cation channels contribute to proliferative and cell fate control mechanisms (1Leonard R.J.

In turn, the progression of muscle fiber differentiation may be affected by the activity of these channels (8Huang C.F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J.

To understand ion channels as both causal and effector agents in cell growth and differentiation, we have looked at the regulation of channel functional expression in the C3H10T1/2-MRF4 myogenic model cell line. C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) is a multipotent, fibroblast-like cell line that can be manipulated to express a phenotype characteristic of either chondrocytes, adipocytes, or myocytes (11Reznikoff C.A. Brankow D.W. Heidelberger C. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 3231-3238PubMed Google Scholar). A muscle phenotype can be selectively produced in 10T1/2 cells via overexpression of the myogenic regulatory transcription factor MRF4. In the presence of bFGF or other mitogenic stimuli, MRF4 is unable to initiate muscle-specific gene expression, even though MRF4 protein levels remain unchanged. Upon bFGF withdrawal, negative regulation of MRF4 is removed, and an MRF4-dependent myogenic program is then induced (12Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), including both the expression of a number of muscle-specific genes such as those for α-actin and myosin heavy chain, and the fusion of cells to form multinucleate myotubes (13Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We show that bFGF withdrawal and thus initiation of the MRF4-dependent myogenic program in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells stimulates, within 24 h, expression of the muscle-typical ion channels, IRK and ACh receptor. We also extend our earlier work in other fibroblast cell lines including the 10T1/2 parental line, that mitogenic stimulation (of 10T1/2-MRF4) is consistently associated with up-regulation of the SK small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, whereas mitogen withdrawal results in SK down-regulation (5Huang Y.

In fibroblast cells pharmacological blockade of the SK channel with ChTX inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation, thus mimicking mitogenic withdrawal (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of ChTX is diagnostic for SK activity in these cells, in that they do not express some of the non-neuronal voltage-gated potassium channels known to be ChTX-sensitive (1Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Dubois J.M. Rouzaire-Dubois B. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

We now show that SK blockade in bFGF-stimulated 10T1/2-MRF4 cells also mimics mitogen withdrawal, causing in these cells the rapid stimulation of MRF4-dependent IRK and ACh receptor expression. These results suggest that SK channel activity is a critical component of the bFGF receptor-initiated signaling events, which ultimately lead to negative regulation of MRF4 transcriptional activity. This finding, combined with our previous studies, suggests that the SK channel contributes to the control of cell growth and differentiation via its ability to affect nuclear events including transcriptional activation. Experiments were performed using both nontransfected 10T1/2 cells (14Rane S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C104-C112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 10T1/2 cells constitutively expressing a rat MRF4 cDNA (10T1/2-MRF4; provided by Dr. S. F. Konieczny, Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). Stock 10T1/2-MRF4 cultures were grown on standard tissue culture plastic and maintained as undifferentiated myoblasts by continuous growth in medium consisting of basal medium, Eagle, supplemented with 15% FBS. Cells to be used for patch clamp recording were seeded onto either gelatin or rat tail collagen-coated 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow to confluence in basal medium, Eagle, 15% FBS. These cultures were mitogenically stimulated by either continued maintenance in basal medium, Eagle, 15% FBS, or by switching the medium to low glucose DMEM supplemented with 2% HS and 20 ng/ml bFGF. Cells were induced to differentiate via mitogen withdrawal by one of two methods, either changing the medium to low glucose DMEM supplemented with 2% HS for the entire growth period, or changing to DMEM, 2% HS with ITS medium supplement (Sigma) for 24–48 h, followed by growth in DMEM, 2% HS for the balance of the experiment. Although ITS, 2% HS treatment results in a more robust morphological differentiation response compared with 2% HS alone, cells differentiated with ITS-supplemented medium begin to die after about 2–3 days in culture, restricting the time course for looking at channel induction in this system. All media contained 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). All cultures were maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The standard bath solution used for recording whole-cell SK and IRK currents, as well as single channel ACh receptor currents in outside-out patches contained (in mm): 138 NaCl, 9 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES. The patch pipette solution for these recordings contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 0.1 EGTA. For inside-out patch single channel recordings of calcium-activated potassium channels, the bath and pipette solutions had (in mm): 150 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, with free calcium concentration adjusted by addition of CaCl2(15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A23187 (Sigma), α-BTX (Molecular Probes), TEA, and ChTX (BACHEM Bioscience) were stored as frozen stocks and aliquots of each were diluted to final concentrations on the day of use. Application of compounds to cells, or solution changes to excised patches, was accomplished via pressure ejection of solution from blunt-tipped pipettes (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All solutions were at pH 7.3. Patch clamp apparatus, techniques, and cell preparation for recording were as described previously (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Single channel amplitudes are means derived from Gaussian fits of amplitude histograms comprised of the number of openings as noted in the figure legends. Whole-cell SK currents were measured during voltage steps to 0 mV (from −70 mV), while intracellular calcium levels were increased either by extracellular application of A23187 (1 μm), or by increasing the free calcium concentration of the patch pipette solution to 10 μm. For inside-out patches SK channels were activated by perfusion of the intracellular patch face with 0.3 μm free calcium. IRK currents were measured during sequential voltage steps from −120 to −10 mV (500-ms duration, 10-mV increments) from a holding potential of −70 mV. Whole-cell ACh receptor currents were recorded at −70 mV in response to 1–100 μm ACh applied extracellularly for the times indicated. ACh receptor channel currents were recorded from outside-out patches at a series of holding potentials from −90 to −30 mV. For testing pharmacological agents the voltage at which current was maximal was used to repetitively evoke currents before, during, and after compound application. All recordings were done at 22–25 °C. The analog compensation circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier was used to estimate whole-cell capacitances (expressed in picofarads, pF). Whole-cell currents are normalized to cell capacitance, an indirect measure of membrane area, and expressed as a current density in picoamperes/picofarads (pA/pF). 10T1/2-MRF4 cells begin to fuse to form myotubes after approximately 40 h growth under mitogen withdrawal. We observed up-regulation of ACh receptor and IRK currents after only 24 h of growth in differentiation medium, that is prior to fusion; so, we restricted our assay for these currents, at all points in the 1–3-day differentiation time course, to cells that appeared uninucleate under phase optics, i.e. cells that had not yet fused. For these experiments, whole-cell capacitance values for mitogen-stimulated (mean = 15.1 ± 0.6 pF, n= 90 cells) versus mitogen-withdrawn (mean = 13.8 ± 0.4 pF, n = 120) cells were not significantly different, suggesting that we recorded ACh receptor and IRK currents from nonfused cells. Thus the results with these currents reflect physiologic events that occur very early in the differentiation process independent of cell fusion. Mean capacitance values after 3–5 days of growth in differentiation conditions were (for cells with and without currents) 31.7 ± 3.8 (n = 20), 31.3 ± 3.4 (n = 15), and 35.4 ± 6.6 (n = 5) pF. All statistical results are given as the mean ± S.E. Significant differences in current densities in response to various growth conditions were assessed by a two-tailed, nonpaired Student'st test at the 0.05 level. We have previously shown that a ChTX-sensitive, calcium-activated potassium channel, SK, is functionally up-regulated by oncogenicras or raf transformation of fibroblasts, including 10T1/2 cells (14Rane S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C104-C112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The same channel can be induced by stimulation of nontransformed, serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells with either epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows 1 μmA23187 activation of an outward current recorded at 0 mV in a 10T1/2-MRF4 cell that had been grown under mitogenic stimulation (2% HS + bFGF at 20 ng/ml) for 24 h. We have previously shown in other fibroblast lines that the A23187-activated outward current recorded at 0 mV is exclusively SK, thus the outward current at 0 mV was measured in these cells to give an estimate of SK current density after 24 h (mean ± S.E. = 26.5 ± 4.0 pA/pF, n = 11 cells) and 72 h (20.8 ± 3.0 pA/pF, n = 14) of growth in 2% HS + bFGF. These current densities were clearly greater than the densities in cells grown under mitogen withdrawal (Fig. 1 B, 6.8 ± 2.4 pA/pF, n = 12 after 24 h in 2% HS, 0.6 ± 0.6 pA/pF, n = 7 after 72 h in 2% HS). Mitogenic stimulation with high serum (15% FBS) also elevated SK density (13.4 ± 2.6 pA/pF,n = 11). Fig. 1 C shows a whole-cell recording from a cell grown in 15% FBS, in which inclusion of 10 μm free calcium in the patch pipette solution activated the outward current at 0 mV. Extracellular application of ChTX blocked >95% of the current, confirming it as SK (experiment replicated for three cells grown in 15% FBS and three grown in bFGF). It should also be noted that in all cases the calcium-sensitive outward current activated immediately upon stepping to 0 mV and showed no voltage or time-dependent inactivation. Thus in all respects, the whole-cell characteristics of the bFGF or high serum up-regulated current in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells are consistent with those of the SK channel current previously described in the 10T1/2 and other fibroblast lines (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rane S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C104-C112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The lack of calcium-sensitive outward current responses in cells grown under differentiating conditions indicates down-regulation of SK (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rane S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C104-C112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it suggests that these conditions are insufficient for expression of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that is found in mature skeletal muscle. Inside-out patch single channel recordings from cells grown under bFGF mitogenic stimulation for 24 h were used to confirm the SK identification. In symmetric 150 mm KCl solutions and at a holding potential of −60 mV, increasing the free calcium concentration at the intracellular patch face from <0.1 to 0.3 μmevoked 2-pA inward current single channel openings (Fig. 1 D, results are representative of eight patches). In addition, current-voltage plots for this channel type showed mild inward rectification (three additional patches), with outward current single channel amplitudes at 60 mV being 1.1 pA, giving conductance values of 33 and 18 pS for −60 and 60 mV, respectively. Further, outward currents were eliminated when the solution at the internal patch face was switched to contain 150 mm NaCl in place of KCl. These results are consistent with the amplitude and calcium-dependent behavior of the SK channel observed in ras transformed 10T1/2 parental and NIH andbalb 3T3 lines (15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Together, the single channel and whole-cell experiments confirm SK as the predominant channel expressed in murine fibroblast cell lines, including 10T1/2-MRF4, and they further establish the close correlation between its up-regulation and mitogenic growth stimulation. A23187 application (Fig. 1, A and B) or elevated free calcium in the whole-cell pipette solution (Fig. 1 C) also activated an inward current at −70 mV in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells, which we have previously reported for the 10T1/2 line (9Krause R.M. Hamann M. Bader C.R. Liu J.-H. Baroffio A. Bernheim L. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since EK was set to −70 mV in these experiments (9 mm KCl in the bath and 150 mm in the patch pipette), this current is not likely to be SK. Even if EKwas actually more positive due to incomplete equilibration of potassium concentrations between the intracellular compartment and the patch pipette solution, the inward current did not respond to ChTX (Fig. 1 C) (14Rane S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C104-C112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further arguing against SK. As for 10T1/2 cells, the inward current in 10T1/2-MRF4 was not sensitive to growth conditions. At present the ionic identity of this current and its mechanism of activation remain unresolved. Ectopic overexpression of MRF4 in 10T1/2 cells transforms them into muscle precursors, but the potential to undergo myogenesis via MRF4-dependent transcriptional activation requires differentiating growth conditions, i.e. the withdrawal of mitogenic stimulation (13Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Thus in the presence of certain mitogens such as bFGF and high serum, there is negative regulation of MRF4-dependent transcriptional activation and thus a lack of muscle specific gene expression (18Hardy S. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5943-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that under mitogenic stimulation an IRK channel is expressed at comparably low levels in both 10T1/2-MRF4 (3.6 ± 1.2 pA/pF, n = 9 cells in 15% FBS, 3.9 ± 1.3, n = 10 in 2% HS + bFGF) and 10T1/2 lines (2.9 ± 0.6 pA/pF, n = 28 in 15% FBS). Unlike the SK current, however, the IRK current does not appear to be typical of fibroblast lines, as it is not present in NIH orbalb 3T3 fibroblasts grown under mitogenic or nonmitogenic conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, in response to mitogen withdrawal, a condition under which SK is down-regulated and negative regulation of MRF4 transcriptional activity is removed, IRK current density increased significantly in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells (11.4 ± 3.1 pA/pF, n = 10 in 24-h 2% HS, 19.9 ± 5.9 pA/pF,n = 16 in 24-h ITS, 49.8 ± 16.6 pA/pF,n = 13 in 48-h ITS). Mitogen withdrawal had no effect on IRK current in 10T1/2 cells (1.8 ± 0.4 pA/pF,n = 10 cells in 24-h ITS) (Fig. 2 A). Thus IRK up-regulation in response to mitogen withdrawal occurred only in 10T1/2 cells expressing MRF4. The IRK current up-regulated in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells in response to differentiating growth conditions (2% HS or ITS) has characteristics of classical muscle-type, strong inward rectifier currents. It displayed rapid voltage-dependent activation at potentials negative to EK, and showed little or no activation at more positive potentials. Time-dependent inactivation of the current became evident at command potentials more negative than −90 mV, and the rate of inactivation increased from −90 to −120 mV (Fig. 2 A). From a holding potential of −70 mV, currents evoked by steps to −120 mV had a mean inactivation time constant of 2370 ± 149 ms (12 cells). In addition to these properties, 10T1/2-MRF4 cell IRK current was pharmacologically similar to muscle IRK. 10 mm TEA blocked the current in both mitogen-stimulated and mitogen-withdrawn 10T1/2-MRF4 cells by similar amounts (25 ± 3 and 33 ± 3%, n = 7 cells each) (Fig. 2 B). As for muscle IRK currents, barium was a very effective blocker of IRK current expressed in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. For mitogenically stimulated and mitogenically withdrawn cells, 100 μm barium reduced IRK current measured at −120 mV by the same amount, 97 ± 1% (6 and 18 cells, respectively). Therefore, IRK currents recorded from 10T1/2 cells were in all ways identical to those in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells, with the exception that mitogen withdrawal did not up-regulate IRK current density in nontransfected 10T1/2 cells. To directly test for MRF4-dependent up-regulation of nicotinic ACh receptor channels, another measure of muscle-specific gene expression, whole-cell ACh receptor currents were recorded under several growth conditions (Fig. 3). We looked for the presence of ACh receptor channels as a function of MRF4 activation by recording from 10T1/2-MRF4 cells grown under either mitogenic or differentiating conditions. Extracellular application of 100 μm ACh revealed low levels of ACh receptor channels in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells grown in 2% HS + bFGF (5.9 ± 3.6 pA/pF, 3 of 18 cells responding), relative to cells grown in ITS (117.0 ± 40.0 pA/pF, 14 of 16 cells responding), or 2% HS alone (116.9 ± 37.4 pA/pF, 8 of 10 cells responding). In the presence of α-BTX (5 μm) ACh current responses from differentiated 10T1/2-MRF4 cells were completely eliminated (eight cells). Therefore, culture conditions which remove negative regulation of MRF4 also cause up-regulation of nicotinic ACh receptor channels. This effect is clearly MRF4-dependent, since 10T1/2 cells grown in ITS were completely unresponsive to ACh application (nine cells). These data are in agreement with previous findings that show muscle regulatory factors are necessary for the activation of the myogenic program and more specifically of muscle specific genes, in this case those for the nicotinic ACh receptor channel. During development of the mammalian neuromuscular junction there is a switch in ACh receptor expression from embryonic to adult form, based on substitution of γ by ε subunits (6Kopta C. Steinbach J.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3922-3933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Camacho P. Liu Y. Mandel G. Brehm P. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 605-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult receptors characteristically have larger conductances (60–65 pS) than embryonic receptors (42–45 pS). Fig. 4 shows that 10T1/2-MRF4 cells differentiated with ITS, 2% HS for 48 h exhibit a low conductance type ACh receptor channel (42–44 pS,n = 4 patches), characteristic of an embryonic type channel. Mitogen withdrawal from 10T1/2-MRF4 cells decreases SK levels coincident with MRF4-dependent muscle gene activation and myogenic differentiation. If SK activity is a necessary component of mitogenic negative regulation of MRF4, then ChTX should override this negative regulation and initiate myogenic events such as IRK and ACh receptor channel expression. Therefore, we measured whole-cell IRK and ACh receptor current densities from serum-withdrawn cells, chronically treated with bFGF + ChTX, and compared them to the densities in cells treated with bFGF alone. Current densities for both IRK and ACh receptor channels were significantly increased when ChTX was present in bFGF-containing growth medium. Extracellular application of 100 μm ACh revealed low levels of ACh receptor channels in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells grown in 2% HS + bFGF for 1, 3, or 5 days (mean ± S.E. = 5.9 ± 3.6 pA/pF, n = 18; 0.7 ± 0.7 pA/pF, n= 7; 0.5 ± 0.5 pA/pF, n = 9), relative to cells grown in 2% HS + bFGF + ChTX (54.6 ± 35.3 pA/pF,n = 9; 97.7 ± 54.3 pA/pF, n = 10; 97.4 ± 54.7 pA/pF, n = 11) or 2% HS alone as a positive control (116.9 ± 37.4 pA/pF, n = 10; 104.3 ± 38.7 pA/pF, n = 10; 120.0 ± 41.5 pA/pF, n = 10)(Fig. 5 A). The ACh activated inward currents observed in cells treated with bFGF + ChTX were blocked by 5 μm α-BTX (data not shown), confirming them as authentic nicotinic ACh receptor channel responses. Thus ChTX overcame bFGF induced negative regulation of ACh receptor channel expression. The results with ChTX up-regulation of ACh receptor channels were paralleled by results for IRK current. For cells grown for 24 h in bFGF and ChTX, peak IRK current amplitudes at −120 mV were normalized to cell capacitance (see Fig. 2), giving a mean current density of 16.7 ± 2.6 pA/pF (n = 11 cells), a significant increase over the density for cells grown in bFGF alone (3.0 ± 0.9 pA/pF, n = 8). After 48-h growth in bFGF and ChTX, mean IRK density was 22.3 ± 4.6 pA/pF, a significant increase compared with cells grown 48 h in bFGF (3.9 ± 1.3 pA/pF). Indeed, the increase in IRK density as a result of chronic ChTX application was comparable to the increase observed when mitogenic stimulation was removed by placing cells in ITS medium for 24 h, a potent differentiation condition. The IRK current present in cells grown with bFGF and ChTX was blocked by 100 μm barium, and it was kinetically identical to the currents recorded from either mitogenically stimulated or withdrawn 10T1/2 and 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. The ability of ChTX to evoke increases in IRK and ACh receptor channel densities appears to be a function of its blocking actionversus SK, combined with the apparent regulatory function of the SK channel for MRF4-dependent transcription. ChTX blocks only potassium channels, and it had no effect on whole-cell IRK currents in bFGF-stimulated 10T1/2-MRF4 cells (data not shown), indicating that SK was the only channel target for ChTX under these conditions. Furthermore, SK channel density remained elevated in the presence of chronic ChTX treatment. After washing off the ChTX-containing growth medium, standard whole-cell recordings and A23187 applications were performed to compare SK current densities in the cells treated as shown in Fig. 5. Mean SK current densities at 1, 3, and 5 days in cells treated with bFGF alone were 26.5 ± 4.0 (n = 11), 20.8 ± 3.0 (n = 14), and 22.1 ± 4.2 pA/pF (n = 18), while in cells treated with bFGF + ChTX the densities were 32.7 ± 10.4 (n = 10), 50.9 ± 11.3 (n = 9), and 13.8 ± 6.0 (n = 10). So SK current densities remain elevated in cells treated with either bFGF or bFGF + ChTX, indicating that the bFGF-activated signaling pathways responsible for maintaining elevated SK levels were unaffected by the toxin. This suggests that signaling from the bFGF receptor, which should negatively regulate MRF4, was also intact; nonetheless ChTX overcame this negative regulation. Further, the presence of MRF4 was obligatory for ChTX to cause up-regulation and induction of IRK and ACh receptor channels, since treatment of 10T1/2 cells with bFGF + ChTX did not change IRK levels, and it did not induce ACh receptor expression. Thus in bFGF-treated 10T1/2-MRF4 cells, ChTX functional blockade of the SK channel was sufficient to allow induction of nicotinic ACh receptor channels, paralleling the ACh receptor induction observed when SK was down-regulated due to bFGF withdrawal. This study has identified several changes in the electrophysiological phenotype of 10T1/2 cells that occur prior to and during myogenic initiation under the control of the ectopically expressed muscle regulatory factor, MRF4. The major current found in mitogenically stimulated 10T1/2-MRF4 myoblasts, in which MRF4 activity is negatively regulated and myogenesis is suppressed, is due to an SK channel. This channel appears identical to the SK channel previously associated with positive control of mitogenesis in other fibroblast lines (14Rane S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C104-C112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Repp H. Draheim H. Ruland J. Seidel G.

Acta. 1995; 1269: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Calcium-activated potassium channels, specifically SK, have been correlated with proliferative control in nonexcitable cells (1Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Dubois J.M. Rouzaire-Dubois B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), including murine fibroblasts similar to the 10T1/2 parental line (5Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in NIH 3T3 cells that the partial mitogen epidermal growth factor produces only transient SK up-regulation, while the full mitogen platelet-derived growth factor produces persistent SK up-regulation. Like platelet-derived growth factor in NIH 3T3 cells, bFGF produces persistent SK up-regulation in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells, consistent with maintenance of a proliferativeversus a differentiated cell state. In addition to down-regulation of SK, removal of MRF4 negative regulation via mitogen withdrawal causes rapid up-regulation of IRK and induction of ACh receptor channels in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. Up-regulation of IRK is characteristic of mammalian muscle cell differentiation (20Kubo Y. J. Physiol. 1991; 442: 711-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Trautmann A. Delaporte C. Marty A. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 406: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Gonoi T. Hasegawa S. Pflugers Arch. 1991; 419: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 23Wieland S.J. Gong Q.-H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C490-C495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and characterization of the current present in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells shows it to be of the classical muscle type. It displays rapid activation, progressively faster time-dependent inactivation as a function of increasingly negative membrane potentials beyond −90 mV, and block by external TEA and barium. Kubo (20Kubo Y. J. Physiol. 1991; 442: 711-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) also observed IRK current in the 10T1/2 line and found it to be up-regulated in 10T1/2 cells expressing a muscle phenotype. These cells were selectively subcloned based on their fusigenic potential provoked by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-induced DNA hypomethylation, and resultant transcriptional activation of muscle specific genes. As a result the cells in which IRK up-regulation was observed had likely been expressing muscle genes for weeks, as dictated by the subcloning procedure. Our results suggest that MRF4 activation per sehas a very immediate and dramatic effect on IRK channel expression, indicating that IRK up-regulation is likely to occur very early on in muscle cell differentiation. In addition, they suggest that MRF4 may transcriptionally activate the muscle IRK channel gene. The induction of nicotinic ACh receptor channels coincident with MRF4 activation in mitogen-withdrawn 10T1/2-MRF4 cells is consistent with the finding that MRF4 efficiently trans-activates an ACh receptor reporter gene construct in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells (24Yutzey K.E.

However, the present study is the first to show MRF4-dependent functional expression of the endogenous channel gene. The single channel data show that mitogen-deprived 10T1/2-MRF4 cells express ACh-activated channels of relatively low conductance, similar to embryonic channels in authentic muscle. Although the number of recordings was limited, this result provides preliminary evidence that MRF4 induces the embryonic ACh receptor subtype that is contingent on expression of the γ subunit (versus the adult ε subunit) (6Kopta C. Steinbach J.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3922-3933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Camacho P. Liu Y. Mandel G. Brehm P. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 605-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitogen withdrawal removes MRF4 negative regulation resulting in IRK and ACh receptor expression and ultimately complete myogenic differentiation; however, the signaling pathways underlying mitogen control of MRF4 have yet to be identified. Two findings now suggest that the SK channel may be an important component of this signaling. First, mitogen withdrawal results in down-regulation of SK coincident with initiation of the myogenic program. Second, we find that ChTX functional block of the SK channel in bFGF-stimulated 10T1/2-MRF4 cells up-regulates IRK and induces ACh receptor channel expression, indicating that SK contributes to the negative regulation of MRF4 imposed by the mitogen. Inclusion of ChTX in the bFGF-containing growth medium up-regulated IRK and induced ACh receptor channel expression as early as 24 h following the start of toxin treatment. Furthermore, ACh receptor currents could be recorded in cell cultures maintained in bFGF + ChTX for as long as 5 days. Thus in terms of IRK and ACh receptor expression, SK channel functional blockade precisely mimics the removal of MRF4 negative regulation seen with mitogen withdrawal, suggesting that the SK channel contributes to mitogen regulation of transcriptional control via MRF4 and possibly other muscle regulatory factors. Mitogenic stimulation of human muscle satellite cells in vitro also has been shown to up-regulate a calcium activated potassium conductance and prevent myogenic progression (25Hamann M. Widmer H. Baroffio A. Aubry J.-P. Krause R.M. Kaelin A. Bader C.R. J. Physiol. 1994; 475: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Like SK, this current is blocked by ChTX and TEA, and it is insensitive to apamin (although it displays voltage dependence more typical of large conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels). The coincidence of calcium-activated potassium conductance up-regulation with mitogenic stimulation in satellite cells, fibroblasts, and T lymphocytes (26Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) suggests conservation of a central role for calcium-activated potassium channels in mitogenic signaling events in mesoderm-derived cells. The results of the present study with the 10T1/2-MRF4 myogenic model provide the first suggestive evidence linking SK channel activity to control of a defined transcriptional regulatory complex. In this way, they begin to establish a possible mechanism by which SK could affect the fundamental cellular events of proliferation and myogenic differentiation. Coupling between SK activity and transcriptional control could rely on the channel's ability to set the membrane potential and indirectly influence voltage-independent calcium influx, an important element in mitogenic stimulation. Krause et al. (9Krause R.M. Hamann M. Bader C.R. Liu J.-H. Baroffio A. Bernheim L. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) observed a large up-regulation of ACh receptor density in cultured human myoblasts when they were switched from proliferative to differentiating growth conditions, but before fusion to myotubes. Our results are comparable to theirs in that we recorded large ACh receptor currents from nonfused uninucleate cells which had been growing in conditions that induce differentiation, again indicating that ACh receptor induction, like IRK up-regulation, is well underway prior to fusion. Indeed, it has been suggested that ACh receptor expression and subsequent stimulation accelerates the fusion process in cultured human myoblasts. The finding that MRF4-dependent IRK and ACh receptor expression is subject to control by the SK channel further suggests that ion channel activity serves to regulates myogenic differentiation as well as to mark its progression. The 10T1/2 and 10T1/2-MRF4 cell lines provide a compelling model system in which to explore the mechanisms by which SK and other channel types perform this regulatory function. We thank M. D.

When integrated into XC-derived cells, MMTV-LTR expression reached its maximum during the first day of dexamethasone treatment, but longer exposure to the hormone resulted in the deactivation of the promoter. In contrast, glucocorticoid-responsive resident genes or MMTV-based transiently transfected plasmids maintained or even increased their mRNA levels during the same period of hormone treatment. An integrated chimeric construct containing the hormone-responsive elements from MMTV-LTR but in different sequence context became also deactivated after a prolonged hormone treatment but with a deactivation kinetics significantly slower than constructs containing the entire, chromatin-positioning MMTV-LTR sequence. The decrease on MMTV-LTR-driven transcription was concomitant with a parallel closure of the MMTV-LTR chromatin and with a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) concentration in the cell. We concluded that the chromatin-organized MMTV-LTR promoter is particularly sensitive to any decrease on GR levels. We propose that chromatin structure may contribute decisively to the differential expression of MMTV-LTR by two mechanisms: limiting MMTV-LTR accessibility to activating transcription factors and accelerating its shutting down upon a decrease on GR levels.

The mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR1) has proved to be one of the most fruitful models for steroid hormone-regulated promoters since the beginning of the 1980s, when several groups defined the concept of hormone-responsive element (HRE). 1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone-responsive element; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; MT, metallothionein; Dex, dexamethasone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; kb, kilobase pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone-responsive element; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; MT, metallothionein; Dex, dexamethasone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; kb, kilobase pair(s). The MMTV-LTR promoter can be activated by glucocorticoids and progestins through the interaction of the hormone-receptor complex with HREs. The MMTV-LTR HREs are termed GRE/PREs (glucocorticoid/progestin response elements) because they bind either glucocorticoid or progestin receptors (GR or PR). GRE/PREs contain two TGTTCT motifs, separated by three nucleotides and arranged in a palindromic structure. In the MMTV-LTR, hormone inducibility depends on the occurrence of one palindromic GRE/PRE and three hemi-palindromes. These GRE/PREs are necessary and sufficient to confer hormone inducibility to homologous and heterologous promoters when placed in their vicinity (1Beato M. Brüggemeier U. Chalepakis G.

Each of these GREs is recognized and bound by a homodimeric hormone-loaded GR or PR, subsequently triggering or enhancing transcription. Two other steroid hormone receptors, the androgen receptor and the mineralocorticoid receptor, have been found to bind to the same GREs and subsequently activate MMTV promoter (see Ref. 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar for a recent review). GRE sequences are found in regulatory regions of many glucocorticoid- and progestin-responsive genes, like the chicken or the frog ovoalbumin gene, the chicken lysozyme gene, the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene, or metallothionein (MT) genes from different mammalian tissues (1Beato M. Brüggemeier U. Chalepakis G. Haché R.J.G. Kalff M. Piña B. Slater E. Truss M. Cohen P. Foulkes G. Molecular Aspects of Cellular Recognition. Elsevier Biochemical Press, Amsterdam1990: 287-298Google Scholar).An unsuspected twist was given to the study of MMTV with the discovery of very specific positioning of nucleosomes over a long stretch of the MMTV-LTR sequence (3Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). One of these positioned nucleosomes, termed nucleosome B, covers the four GREs present in the MMTV-LTR; it coincides in position with a DNase I-hypersensitive site that appears upon hormone induction (3Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Nucleosome B reconstituted in vitro allows binding of both GR and PR while excluding other transcription factors that also bind to the same DNA sequence when free from histones (5Perlmann T. Wrange O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Piña B. Brüggemeier U. Beato M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). One possible role of the steroid hormone receptors may be the removal or structural alteration of nucleosome B to allow transcription factor binding and therefore enhance transcription (6Piña B.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).One of the most compelling arguments in favor of the role of chromatin structure in transcriptional activation is the different behavior of transiently transfected hormone-regulated promoters when compared with their chromosomal counterparts (10Lee H.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies show that a proper chromatin structure is necessary for the correct expression pattern of the MMTV-LTR promoter both in mammalian (11Archer T.K. Fryer C.J. Lee H.L. Zaniewski E. Liang T. Mymryk J.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (12Chavez S. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6987-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case we present here, MMTV-based expression constructs transfected into XC cells showed a loss of hormone response upon continuous treatment with hormone. This deactivation was not observed in resident hormone-responsive genes or when the same MMTV constructs were assayed in transient transfection experiments. Although this effect could be due to the presence of a specific repressor in hormone-treated cells, our data favor a mechanism in which deactivation correlates with an exhaustion of GR receptor upon continuous hormone administration. We propose that the response of the different genes and reporters to the decline of the receptor may be related to the ability of each promoter to shut itself down when receptor levels decay under a certain minimum. This mechanism is likely affected by the chromatin structure over the relevant sequences of the promoter. We also propose that such a mechanism may be important for the differential expression of the different hormone-regulated genes in the cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Cell LinesPlasmidspMS-H5 (13Sun J.M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been previously described; a brief description is given in the text when necessary. pRSVLUC is a construct where the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (17Gorman C.M. Merlino G. Willinghan M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) directs the expression of luciferase. pTATT-AGE5Lu is a derivative of pAGE5MMTVLu where theSma/PvuII fragment was replaced by theHindIII fragment of pTATT-CAT treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). This construct has the same characteristics of pAGE5MMTVLu, except that the luciferase gene is driven by the thymidine kinase promoter and made hormone-responsive by two copies of a synthetic, pseudopalindromic GRE. pMS-HSP27 is an unpublished construct identical to construct pMS-H5, except that the histone H5 sequences were replaced by hamster hsp27 coding sequences; it was a generous gift from Prof. J. Landry (Université Laval, Québec, Canada).Cell LinesTwo cell lines derived from epithelial-like XC rat sarcoma cells were used. XC-10 cells (13Sun J.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Ruiz C.A. Science. 1989; 245: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) contain about 300 copies of the plasmid pMS-H5 (a contribution from Prof. A. Ruiz-Carrillo, Laval Université, Québec, Canada). XC-14 cells contain a single integrated copy of pMS-HSP27. 2J. Landry, unpublished data. XC-8 is a nontransfected XC clone used as a control (13Sun J.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Ruiz C.A. Science. 1989; 245: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell lines H12 and B11 were generated from stable transfection of XC-8 cells with plasmids pAGE5MMTVLu and pTATT-AGE5Lu, respectively (see below).Cell Culture and TransfectionsCell CultureAll cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml glucose, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% (v/v) of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Except for the nontransfected XC-8 cells, stock cultures were maintained in the presence of 350 μg/ml G418 (Sigma); cells split out for experiments were cultured without antibiotic.Transient Transfection ExperimentsXC-8 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (18Kimura G. Dulbecco R. Virology. 1972; 49: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Banerji J. Olson L. W. S. Cell. 1983; 33: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). One million cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a mixture containing 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.25 mg DEAE-dextran in 0.5 ml of 1 × TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2). After incubation, the cells were treated for 2 min at room temperature with culture medium containing 15% Me2SO, washed in TBS, further incubated for 2.5–3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in medium containing 0.1 mm chloroquine diphosphate, and finally returned to standard culture medium. Hormone was added to the medium 48 h after transfection, and incubation was continued for 3–4 days before harvesting the cells to assay luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. All transfections and treatments were performed in duplicate.Establishment of Stable Cell LinesXC-8 derivatives containing the MMTV-luciferase construct were obtained by calcium phosphate precipitation (20Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar) with 30 μg of the plasmids pAGE5MMTVLu or pTATT-AGE5Lu per 9-cm plate (approximately 2.5 million cells). For the selection of transfected cells, the medium was supplemented with 350 μg/ml G418. Stable G418-resistant clone pools were seeded at limit dilution, and several single clones were isolated and characterized.Total RNA Extraction and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). 10–20 μg of RNA was separated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0) in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) in 10 × SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.5). Filters were hybridized by standard methods using either a randomly primed 32P-labeled DNA probe or a32P-labeled 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide. The probes were: hamster hsp27, a pMS-hsp27NheI-XhoI fragment containing the coding sequence of hamster hsp27; chicken histone H5, a pMS-H5NheI-XhoI fragment containing the coding sequence of H5; actin, an EcoRI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pAC18.1 (22Nudel U. Zakut R. Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) that encompasses the rat β-actin; rat metallothionein-I, 5′-TGCAGGAGGTGCATTTGCAGTTCTTGCAGC-3′ (positions 138–168 of the mRNA); and rat αB-crystallin, 5′-CGCTGATGGGAAACTTCCTTGTC-3′ (positions 600–623 of the mRNA). Relative quantitation of the bands was performed using either a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BSA 1000 (Fujix) or a transmittance scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics).Primer Extension AnalysisTotal RNA (20 μg) was hybridized in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol with 0.2 pmol of32P-labeled 5′ end-labeled primer for 4 h at 37 °C. The primer was extended in this reaction mixture after the addition of 0.5 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide, 50 ng/ml of actinomycin D, 25 ng/ml of bovine serum albumin, and 200 units of MMTV-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 12.5 mm EDTA and 25 ng/ml of pancreatic RNase A. Samples were extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol precipitated and analyzed on 8% acrylamide-urea sequencing gels. The primers used were: rat actin, 5′-GGGACGGAGGAGCTGCAAG-3′, and hamster hsp27, 5′-GCAGCAGCGAGAAGGGCAC-3′. The 5′ end of the rat actin probe is 55 bases downstream from the rat actin mRNA start site; the hamsterhsp27 probe is 321 bases downstream from the origin of transcription driven by MMTV in construct pMS-HSP27. Relative quantitation of the bands was performed using a transmittance scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics).CAT and Luciferase AssaysCell monolayers were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 0.6 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmGlycyl-glycine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol). The lysate was transferred to a microfuge tube and centrifuged for 3 min. 50 μl of the supernatants was added to 0.35 ml of luciferase assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mmMgSO4, 5 mm ATP). Luciferase-mediated light output was determined on a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold) by injection of 100 μl of 1 mm luciferin and integration of the peak of light emission for 30 s. CAT assays were performed with a CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim), following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations of extracts were determined according to Bradford using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad).DNase I Hypersensitivity AssayApproximately 200 million cells of the appropriate cell lines were incubated with 1 mm dexamethasone for the indicated periods of time and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and the nuclei were isolated as described previously (23Richard-Foy H. Sistare F.D. Riegel A.T. Simons Jr., A.T. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of DNase I (Promega, 1 units/ml) and the tubes were incubated at 30 °C. After 10 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 volumes of stop solution (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 1%N-lauryl-sarcosine solution) and incubated for 3–16 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified by two phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extractions and two chloroform extractions, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA) buffer. For Southern blot analysis, 40 μg of DNA from each sample was digested to completion with the appropriate restriction enzymes and separated electrophoretically through 0.8% agarose gels in TEA buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.) in 20 × SSC and cross-linked by UV treatment (Stratalinker, Stratagene). Membranes were hybridized with randomly primed32P-labeled DNA probes either from aHindIII/XhoI fragment from construct pMS-HSP27 encompassing the MMTV-LTR sequences (XC-14 cells) or from aAvaI/EcoRI fragment from the luciferase gene (H12 cells).GR Analysis by Western BlotWestern blots for the GR were performed according to Ref. 24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1489Crossref Scopus (9143) Google Scholar. XC-14 or H12 cells were treated with 1 μm Dex for 0, 1, and 4 days. At each time, cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The swollen cells were homogenized with a Dounce pestle B (20 strokes) and centrifuged. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Nuclear proteins were extracted by adding 100 μl of the same buffer containing 0.45 m KCl. The S-100 fraction was prepared by adding 0.11 volumes of 10 × cytoplasmic extract buffer (0.3 m Hepes, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.4 m KCl, 30 mm MgCl2) to the cytoplasmic fraction and centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 70 μg of protein from each extract was separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with a rat liver GR polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Pr. O. Wränge, Uppsala, Sweden) at 1:200 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed extensively and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti IgG (Promega) at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h. The membrane was washed again and GR was detected with the Amersham Corp. ECL Western blotting Detection kit. Relative quantitation of the bands was performed using a transmittance scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics).DISCUSSIONWe have analyzed the behavior of different glucocorticoid-responsive promoters after up to 5 days of continuous presence of hormone. We found a clear response to glucocorticoids for different MMTV-LTR-derived constructs as well as for two resident genes, the rat MT-I gene and an mRNA we identified as corresponding to the αB-crystallin gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of αB-crystallin expression in XC cells.The results presented here showed a deactivation of MMTV-driven promoters upon continued hormone administration in XC-derived cell lines. This deactivation did not affect either resident glucocorticoid-responsive genes or transiently transfected reporters. This phenomenon may be related to the reported transient response to Dex of MMTV constructs on BPV-based episomes, whereas transiently transfected plasmids remained actively transcribed (10Lee H.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the differential kinetics of activation and deactivation of different hormone-responsive genes may be a general phenomenon, and we believe that this should have important physiological implications.Our data showed that the deactivation kinetics of the MMTV promoter did not depend on the transcription product. Transcripts of three very different genes, such as luciferase, hamster hsp27, and chicken histone H5, faded at the same rate. Furthermore, we have observed a similar specific MMTV deactivation in completely different cell lines. 4S. Boronat, H. Richard-Foy, and B. Piña, manuscript in preparation. In addition, the deactivation of the MMTV promoters was independent from the cell cycle, because XC-10 cells stop dividing upon Dex administration, whereas XC-14 and XC-8 cells keep on dividing at the normal rate (13Sun J.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Ruiz C.A. Science. 1989; 245: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In turn, deactivation of the transcription of a MMTV-driven reporter depended on whether the construct was integrated into the host cell genome, suggesting a critical role of MMTV-chromatin in the process. This model is reinforced by the differential kinetics of deactivation observed on H12 and B11 cells. These two cell lines contain integrated reporters very similar in structure, except for their hormone-responsive regions. pAGE5MMTVLu (H12 cells) contains a long fragment from MMTV that has been shown to promote nucleosome positioning (9Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelberg A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). pTATT-AGE5Lu (B11 cells) contains only the very same HRE found in the MMTV-LTR. In this case, the fact that the transcription from the former construct decreased much faster than that from the latter can neither be explained by differential stability of the gene products nor by differences on the HRE sequences.Chromatin structural rearrangements of the MMTV-LTR upon glucocorticoid induction are revealed by the appearance of a DNase I-hypersensitive site (3Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelberg A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We have observed the appearance of this hypersensitive site upon Dex administration in our integrated MMTV-LTR constructs. Furthermore, the decline of MMTV-driven transcription upon continued hormone administration temporally coincided with a proportional loss of this hormone-induced DNase I-hypersensitive site. Our results showed a temporal relationship between the intensity of the DNase I-hypersensitive site and the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene in both XC-14 and H12 cells. We observed a 4–8-h lag period between the formation of the hypersensitive site and the peak of luciferase activity in H12 cells. We interpret this delay as the time required for the synthesis of luciferase. It is generally accepted that nucleosome B prevents key transcription factors from binding to their cognate sequences onto the MMTV-LTR (5Perlmann T. Wrange O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Piña B. Brüggemeier U. Beato M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We propose that the observed fading of the DNase I-hypersensitive site corresponded to the refolding of nucleosome B. Under this point of view, the decay on MMTV transcription would be explained by the inability of the GR to maintain chromatin in an open state during long periods of exposure to the hormone.Our results showed that transcription driven by integrated chromatin-organized MMTV-LTR displayed an exquisite dependence on the actual levels of hormone-loaded receptor. A loss of response to hormones upon continuous administration has been associated with a down-regulation of the receptor in different cell systems (32Bellingham D.L. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2090-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1764-1773PubMed Google Scholar, 34Okret S.

Miesfeld R.L. Logsdon C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2581-2584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This down-regulation has been related both to a transcriptional repression of the GR gene and to a destabilization of GR mRNA by the hormone-loaded GR (32Bellingham D.L. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2090-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1764-1773PubMed Google Scholar). Our data showed that GR was mainly cytoplasmic in untreated XC cells, entering the nucleus shortly after hormone administration. After 4 days of continuous hormone administration, GR levels decreased significantly to 20–30% of the initial levels. This decrease correlated with the decay in MMTV-driven transcription but opened the question of how other glucocorticoid-responsive genes maintained their transcriptional levels high, despite the decrease in GR levels.Several models can account for the observed specificity of MMTV-LTR deactivation. One possibility is the presence of a specific repressor affecting MMTV-LTR but not MT-I or αB-crystallin promoters. We do not favor this model, in part because it does not explain the temporal correlation between the decay in GR concentration, the closing of the MMTV-LTR chromatin, and the decrease in MMTV-LTR-driven transcription. In addition, this model is difficult to reconcile with the maintenance of transcription of transiently transfected MMTV-LTR plasmids. We rather propose that the minimal amount of hormone-loaded GR required for avoiding a shut down of transcription varies from one promoter to another, depending on the chromatin structure over the GREs. In integrated MMTV-LTR constructs, chromatin appears to refold rapidly when the levels of occupied GR decrease, restraining the binding of factors required for sustaining transcription. Therefore, these promoters are especially sensitive to any decrease in hormone-loaded GR levels. In contrast, transiently transfected plasmids seem to accommodate some kind of loose chromatin package, which is very accessible to enzymes or transcription factors (36Jeong S. Stein A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This probably makes transiently transfected MMTV-LTR far less sensitive to the decline of GR than their integrated counterparts. This may well also be the case for the transfected HRE-thymidine kinase promoter on B11 cells, in principle devoid of nucleosome-positioning sequences. On the other hand, both the rat MT-I (28Yagle M.K. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Karin M. Haslinger A. Holtgreve H. Richards R.I.

Biol. Chem. 270, 5024–5031). The ability of retinal to modulate opsin apoprotein activity was investigated using a guanyl nucleotide exchange assay on transducin. 11-cis-Retinal reacted with opsin at 22 °C to (a) reform pigment having maximal absorbance at 500 nm and (b) reduce opsin activity by >80%. Pigment formation also occurred at 0 °C with a t½ of 260 min. However, unlike rhodopsin formed at 22 °C (R22), the rhodopsin formed at 0 °C (R0) activated transducin with the same half-saturating concentration as opsin in an exhaustive binding assay. Thus, the formation of a protonated Schiff base associated with 500 nm absorbance does not by itself lead to the inactivation of opsin. The R0 conformation was partially inactivated by incubation at 22 °C (t½ = 61 ± 9 min), suggesting that it may be an intermediate conformation in the regeneration of rhodopsin. The bovine opsin apoprotein activates transducin, although at a much reduced level than light-activated rhodopsin (Surya, A., Foster, K., and Knox, B. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5024–5031).

The vertebrate rod cell photoreceptor, rhodopsin, is a member of a larger class of G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors. The rhodopsin holoprotein consists of the apoprotein, opsin, covalently bound to a 11-cis-retinal chromophore by a protonated Schiff base (1Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The sole action of light is to isomerize retinal from acis to trans configuration, thereby initiating a series of conformational changes in rhodopsin that modulate its affinity for the rod cell G-protein, transducin (for reviews, see Refs.2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 3Pugh E.N. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 111-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). While the dark-adapted rhodopsin molecule has negligible affinity for transducin, metarhodopsin(II), a conformation formed within milliseconds of light absorption, is a highly active form of the receptor that rapidly binds and catalyzes nucleotide exchange on hundreds of transducin molecules (4Fung B.K.-K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Metarhodopsin(II) decays to the opsin apoprotein and free all-trans-retinal. Opsin is able to activate transducin and is a form of the receptor that has low activity (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast to the high turnover number and rapid kinetics, of transducin activation by metarhodopsin(II), opsin activity is characterized by a low turnover number and slower kinetics, which results in a second-order rate constant for transducin activation by opsin that is approximately 30-fold lower than that for metarhodopsin(II) (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while metarhodopsin(II)-transducin complexes are readily isolated in the absence of GTP, similar conditions fail to yield opsin-transducin complexes suggesting that the interaction is of low-affinity (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Pepperberg D.R. Anderson S.M. Mangini N.J. Exp.

There are also significant differences in the pH profile of transducin activation by metarhodopsin(II) and opsin. Unlike metarhodopsin(II), opsin is unable to activate transducin at pH > 9 (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the high affinity that metarhodopsin(II) has for transducin arises from the contributions of basic side chains that are unavailable in opsin. The apparent low affinity and slow kinetics of transducin activation by opsin rule out a significant role in the rod cell's rapid ON response to light, which is almost entirely mediated by metarhodopsin(II). However, the ability of the apoprotein to activate transducin is a potential source of phototransduction noise and may provide a means by which the cell adapts to varying light intensities, as has been observed in bleaching adaptation (8Brin K.P. Ripps H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Pepperberg D.R. Brown P.K. Lurie M. Dowling J.E. J. Gen.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Conversely, the need for a mechanism to reduce apoprotein noise and increase the sensitivity of the rod cell during low levels of ambient light is clear (15Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.-W. J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 613-634PubMed Google Scholar). One such mechanism is the regeneration of dark-adapted rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis-retinal, a process which results in the reduction in opsin's ability to activate transducin (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and a dramatic reduction in cell sensitivity (11Jones G.J. Crouch R.K.

Cornwall M.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which retinal alters the apparent affinity of opsin for transducin is not known. The retinal binding site is located within the hydrophobic core of the protein while the transducin activation site lies on the cytoplasmic face (e.g. Refs. 16Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and 17Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the binding of retinal leads to the formation of a protonated Schiff base between opsin and 11-cis-retinal and a large shift in the absorption maximum of the chromophore, it is not known whether Schiff base formation plays a direct role in altering the affinity of opsin for transducin. In this report, we have further characterized the effect of 11-cis-retinal on opsin activity to understand the mechanism by which it reduces the affinity of opsin for transducin. We have determined that the inhibitory effect of 11-cis-retinal is not solely due to the formation of a protonated Schiff base between retinal and opsin. Rather, it appears that a conformational change, presumably at the transducin activation site, is essential for the deactivation of opsin. Rhodopsin- and opsin-containing rod outer segment membranes were prepared from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinae as described earlier (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Bovine transducin was purified according to Ref. 18Bubis J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12995-12999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and transducin activation was measured by a guanyl nucleotide exchange assay using a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, [35S]GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; R0, rhodopsin regenerated at 0 °C; R22, rhodopsin regenerated at 22 °C.(5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 22 °C in dim red light for 2 h in 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. All procedures were carried out under dim red light. 11-cis-Retinal (19Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used in the reactions was stored as an ethanolic stock solution, and the volume was adjusted such that the concentration of ethanol during regeneration did not exceed 2%. Regenerations were carried out in 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.5), at room temperature or on ice. Argon was blown into the reaction tubes, which were then incubated at the desired temperature on a nutator. Aliquots from the regenerated material were solubilized in 1% dodecyl maltoside at 0 °C for 45 min, and then centrifuged at 50,000 × g at 0 °C for 30 min to remove any insoluble material. In kinetic experiments regeneration was stopped by the addition of hydroxylamine prior to solubilization. Hydroxylamine treatment did not change the measured extent of regeneration. Absorption spectra were recorded at 0–4 °C using a Beckmann DU-640 single beam spectrophotometer fitted with a water-jacketed cuvette holder connected to a circulating water bath. The samples were bleached for 2 min at 0 °C with light from a 300-watt projector (λ > 535 nm), and dark-light difference spectra were obtained. The percent protonated Schiff base formed at each time point was calculated as follows. The 280 nm absorbance of unregenerated opsin was divided by 500 nm absorbance from the difference spectra to yield a A280/A500 ratio. This ratio was divided by theA280/A500 ratio of the urea-stripped rhodopsin from which the opsin was prepared and expressed as a percentage. In experiments in which complete Schiff base formation was desired, opsin was incubated with 10-fold excess 11-cis-retinal for a minimum of 12 h. Pigment formed in the presence of excess 11-cis-retinal at 0 °C is henceforth called R0, while that formed at 22 °C will be called R22. In an individual regeneration experiment the percent regeneration could be determined to within 5%. The extent of regeneration varied from 80 to 90% at 0 °C and from 85 to 95% at 22 °C. In experiments in which the regeneration temperature was varied, 11-cis-retinal was added to opsin on ice, and the mixture rapidly transferred to the desired temperature and incubated overnight. In each experiment, transducin assays were performed at 22 °C on four samples: opsin, R0, R22, and the sample regenerated at the test temperature. Duplicate measurements of transducin activation were normalized to the opsin value, and the mean was plotted as a percentage. To examine the inhibition of opsin activity by 11-cis-retinal, the reaction was slowed by decreasing the regeneration temperature. This permitted us to determine if the inhibition occurred in one or more steps. We chose 0 °C for the lowest temperature, to avoid the addition of glycerol or other solvents, and 22 °C as our standard temperature. Although regeneration of bovine rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis-retinal has been extensively studied, there are only a few examples of regeneration at low temperatures (20Matsumoto H. Horiuchi K. Yoshizawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 501: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Okada D. Nakai T. Ikai A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was necessary to characterize our opsin preparation which was essentially free of other rod cell proteins and retinoids by extensive washing with urea, hydroxylamine, and bovine serum albumin (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Opsin in rod outer segment membranes was reconstituted with 10-fold excess 11-cis-retinal at 0 or 22 °C, and Schiff base formation was determined by dark-light difference spectra, after quenching the reaction at various times with hydroxylamine. Schiff base formation occurred at 0 °C with a half-time of approximately 5 h and reached its final extent of >85% by 14 h (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, regeneration at 22 °C occurred in minutes (Ref. 22Henselman R.A. Cusanovich M.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5321-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, also see Fig. 5). The extent of regeneration varied between 90 and 95% at 22 °C, and 85 and 90% at 0 °C as determined by difference spectra (Fig. 1 B). The small difference in the extent was reproducible and could be due to small differences in the extinction coefficient of the two species of rhodopsin or could represent ∼5% of unregenerated opsin at 0 °C. The dark-adapted rhodopsin conformations formed at 0 °C and 22 °C are termed R0 and R22, respectively.Figure 5Rate of conversion of R0 to R22. R0 was preincubated in a 22 °C water bath, and 40-pmol aliquots were added to 60 pmol of transducin and 250 pmol of [35S]GTPγS in a 125-μl volume, at the indicated times and assayed in the dark at 22 °C for 2 h. The amount of transducin activated decreased as a function of preincubation time (•). The data were fit to a single parameter exponential function (solid line) which yielded an estimate of 45 ± 6 min for the time taken for 50% decrease in activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of rhodopsin regenerated at 0 and 22 °C to activate transducin in the dark was assayed by measuring the stimulation of [35S]GTPγS exchange on purified transducin in exhaustive binding assays (4Fung B.K.-K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3697-3705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When opsin was incubated extensively with varying amounts of 11-cis-retinal at 22 °C, the increase in the amount of bound 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 2,left panel, open circles) was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the original activity (Fig. 2, left panel, closed circles). The half-maximal retinal concentrations for these two processes were 2.7 and 3.9 μm, respectively, approximately stoichiometric to the opsin concentration. In contrast, a dramatic difference was observed when opsin was reconstituted at 0 °C. While a protonated Schiff base was formed between opsin and 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 2, right panel, open circles), only a minor inhibition (<20%) of opsin activity was observed even at the highest 11-cis-retinal concentration tested (Fig. 2, right panel, closed circles). Thus, the transducin activation site on opsin was not perturbed by the covalent binding of retinal in a protonated Schiff base at 0 °C. A complication arose from extended incubations at 22 °C. Typically 30–40% of the opsin activity was lost during overnight incubations of opsin at this temperature (Fig. 3,open bars). However, the inhibition of opsin activity due to incubation with 11-cis-retinal was significantly greater (Fig. 3, third solid bar). When R22 activity was normalized to the activity of opsin samples incubated at 22 °C, the ratio ranged from 0 to 40% (Fig. 3, hatched bars). Thus, the extent of inhibition caused by 11-cis-retinal was always much greater than that due to temperature effects on the apoprotein. Two further experiments show that the inhibition of activity caused by 11-cis-retinal occurs by a different mechanism than the temperature-dependent decay of opsin activity (e.g. as a result of denaturation of the apoprotein, Ref. 24Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, the rate of inhibition of opsin activity at 22 °C by 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 4 A, closed circles) occurred significantly faster than the thermal decay of opsin activity (Fig. 4 A, open circles). Furthermore, the rate of inhibition of opsin activity by 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 4 A, closed circles) was indistinguishable from the rate of Schiff base formation at 22 °C (Fig. 4 B, open triangles), and did not require extended incubation. The loss of activity with regeneration is in contrast to the known stabilizing effect that 11-cis-retinal has on the apoprotein (25Hubbard R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1958; 42: 259-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In fact, incubation at 22 °C for several days did not alter rhodopsin's ability to activate transducin in the light (data not shown). In summary, the mechanism by which 11-cis-retinal reduces opsin's affinity for transducin is distinct from the temperature-dependent decay of opsin activity.Figure 4Kinetics of 11-cis-retinal-dependent decrease in opsin activity.Opsin (5 μm) was incubated with 11-cis-retinal (15 μm) in 900 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) in a 22 °C water bath. Control opsin samples were treated with an equal volume of ethanol. At the indicated times, 75-μl aliquots were removed and treated with hydroxylamine (final concentration, 50 mm) for 10 min on ice to convert free retinal to retinaloxime. A, 30 pmol of regenerated material was then assayed exhaustively (2 h) with 75 pmol of transducin and 500 pmol of GTPγS and the amount of transducin activated was estimated (•), B, while the rest was solubilized in 1% dodecyl maltoside to estimate the amount of bound retinal by difference spectroscopy (▿). The data from the transducin assay and difference spectra were fit to exponential functions to estimate the half-time and saturation level. In the case of inhibition of opsin activity by 11-cis-retinal, these numbers were 2.2 ± 0.3 min and 74 ± 4%. In contrast, activity in ethanol-treated opsin samples fell slowly with time (open circles). The half-time and saturation level from the difference spectra were 2.7 ± 0.3 min and 92 ± 4%, respectively. Thus at 22 °C, the rate of Schiff base formation was comparable to the rate of inhibition of opsin activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the key features of opsin activity is its dependence on pH. Opsin shows activity over a broad pH range (5.8–7.4) but is inactive at pH > 9 unlike metarhodopsin(II) (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activity of the R0 conformation was opsin-like at high pH, R0was assayed with transducin at pH 9.5 (Table I). Opsin exhibited no activity at pH 9.5. In the dark, R0 also failed to activate transducin, suggesting similarities in the interaction of transducin with both opsin and R0 (Table I, A). As expected, R22 was also inactive in the dark at pH 9.5. In contrast, both R0and R22 activated transducin to the same extent at pH 9.5 when exposed to light, suggesting that these two different conformations form metarhodopsin(II) (Table I, B). In fact, the similarity in their activity suggests that there is no temperature-driven decay of activity in the R22 sample.Table IActivity at pH 9.5ExperimentActivity1-aActivity was measured in exhaustive binding assays using 50 pmol of transducin and 500 pmol of [35S]GTPγS in a 250-μl volume.

Open table in a new tab To examine the stability of R0, incubations at 22 or 0 °C before assay with transducin were performed (Fig. 3, solid bars). A 2-h preincubation of R0 at 22 °C resulted in a 56 ± 7% drop in its activity. In contrast, preincubation of R22at 0 °C for 2 h did not result in any appreciable change in transducin activation. Since the amount of transducin activated is proportional to the concentration of the active species (R0), the change in the amount of transducin activated as a function of preincubation time was used to determine the rate of inactivation of R0 at 22 °C. This rate of inactivation of R0 was slow, with a t½ = 61 ± 9 min (Fig. 5). Thus R0 may represent a reaction intermediate in the formation of dark-adapted rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis-retinal, stabilized at 0 °C. To determine the effect of regeneration temperature on the extent of inhibition of opsin activity, the activity of dark rhodopsin was measured after regeneration to completion with excess 11-cis-retinal, at a range of temperatures between 0 and 22 °C (Fig. 6). The percent regeneration, as estimated from difference spectra, was greater than 85% at each of the temperatures tested (data not shown). Regeneration at 0 °C preserved the most apoprotein activity, while higher regeneration temperatures showed more inactivation. The extended times for regeneration and assay precluded higher temperature resolution. Another technique will be required to further resolve this transition. Taken together with the earlier experiments, these results suggest that the active and inactive states of the transducin activation domain on dark-adapted rhodopsin are separated by a thermal barrier. To further our understanding of the structural requirements for transducin activation, we have used a guanyl nucleotide exchange assay with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (4Fung B.K.-K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to measure the activation of transducin. This assay is able to detect activity that arises from low affinity interactions between the receptor and transducin since it measures the cumulative number of activated transducin molecules. This is advantageous when compared with assays such as light-scattering, which require tight association between the receptor and the G-protein, and initial rate assays, which require higher sensitivity. Using this approach, the relatively weak activation of transducin by the bovine opsin apoprotein was observed, by measuring both the rate of activation and a titration of the number of transducin molecules activated during the lifetime of the active receptor (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both measures reflect signal transduction properties of the apoprotein. To study the relative effect of various chemical and physical constraints on this activity, experiments were carried out in the presence of excess transducin and GTPγS, using concentrations of opsin in the linear range as determined from the titration curve. To investigate the role of ligand binding on opsin activity, we have characterized the regeneration of dark-adapted rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis-retinal, and have identified a temperature-sensitive reaction intermediate in the regeneration process. R0, which can be trapped by carrying out the regeneration reaction at 0 °C, has activity similar to that of the apoprotein and activates transducin despite having a protonated Schiff base. R0 is thermally unstable and decays at room temperature to inactive dark-adapted rhodopsin, suggesting that in addition to Schiff base formation, a temperature-dependent conformational change, presumably at the transducin activation site, is required to reset the protein to its inactive state. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with those of Okada et al. (21Okada D. Nakai T. Ikai A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), who showed that the post-metarhodopsin(II) activity in their preparations was only inhibited by the addition of 11-cis-retinal at temperatures above 13 °C. We note that while the transducin binding assay is a powerful probe of conformational change, limitations in thermal resolution of conformational change are inherent due to the lengthy regeneration and assay periods. The regeneration of bovine opsin has been studied extensively, and detailed information is available on the steric requirements for retinal binding to the hydrophobic domain of the protein (27Balogh-Nair V. Nakanishi K. Tamm D. Stereochemistry. Elsevier, Amsterdam1982: 283-334Google Scholar, 28Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 112: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Competition studies have shown that the binding of 11-cisretinal to opsin is a two-step process with hydrophobic recognition preceding protonated Schiff base formation (29Matsumoto H. Yoshizawa T. Nature. 1975; 258: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Daemen F.J.M. Nature. 1978; 276: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Towner P. Gaertner W. Walckhoff B. Oesterhelt D. Hopf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the two stages of retinal binding to opsin are distinct, even the slower Schiff base formation is rapid at room temperature, in contrast to the findings at lower temperatures, where reported rates of Schiff base formation in digitonin are significantly lower (20Matsumoto H. Horiuchi K. Yoshizawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 501: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While the 11-cis-retinal-binding site is buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein (32Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), the transducin activation site lies on the cytoplasmic face of rhodopsin (2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus to alter the affinity of opsin for transducin, the binding of retinal should induce a conformational change at the transducin activation site. These changes have been detected by proteolysis experiments (33Kuhn H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), cysteine labeling (34DeGrip W.J. van De Laar G.L.M. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and EPR studies (35Farahbaksh Z.T. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Resek J.F. Farahbaksh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A key consequence of retinal binding is the formation of a Schiff base, whose protonation state correlates strongly with the active conformation of the protein. In inactive dark-adapted rhodopsin (λmax = 500 nm), the Schiff base is protonated and early photointermediates of light-activated rhodopsin have altered spectral properties, but the Schiff base remains protonated until the metarhodopsin(I)-metarhodopsin(II) transition has occurred. The early intermediates, including metarhodopsin(I) (λmax = 470 nm), are not able to activate transducin. Moreover, it has been shown that deprotonation of the Schiff base is obligatory for the formation of the high affinity transducin activation site in metarhodopsin(II) (λmax = 380 nm) (37Longstaff C. Calhoon R.D. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4209-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An additional step required for the formation of the active conformation has been suggested to involve proton uptake by Glu-134 at the cytoplasmic face of the protein (38Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Just as the activation of rhodopsin appears to involve Schiff base deprotonation and conformational change at the transducin activation site, complete inactivation of the protein requires the formation of a protonated Schiff base and conformational change at the transducin activation site. This conformational change requires thermal energy and can be decoupled from protonated Schiff base formation by simply lowering the regeneration temperature. Recently, Arnis and Hofmann (39Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have shown that the flash-induced conversion of metarhodopsin(II) to rhodopsin takes place in discrete steps that involve the protonation of the Schiff base and a spectrally silent proton transfer from the protein to the surrounding solvent. They also demonstrated that the different conformations of dark rhodopsin interacted differently with transducin. The experiments presented in the present study demonstrate thermally distinct states of dark-adapted rhodopsin that have different affinities for transducin. We speculate that conformations identified in Ref. 39Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar are similar to those identified here and note that the existence of thermal intermediates representing different conformations of the protein is reminiscent of the thermal photointermediates that are observed on the bleaching of rhodopsin (40Yoshizawa T. Wald G. Nature. 1963; 197: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,41Thorgeirsson T.E. Lewis J.W. Wallace-Williams S.E. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13861-13872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The recombination reaction between 11-cis-retinal and the opsin apoprotein provides an opportunity to independently monitor Schiff base formation and transducin activation. It was shown earlier that room temperature recombination resulted in both protonated Schiff base formation and a significant decrease in opsin activity (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has now been shown that the rate of Schiff base formation and the rate of conformational change at the cytoplasmic face are similar when the recombination reaction is carried out at room temperature. However, when recombination is carried out at 0 °C, protonated Schiff base formation occurs without significant change in transducin activation. Furthermore, raising the temperature of opsin reconstituted at 0 °C (R0) results in a lowering of the activity, suggesting that R0 is a thermal intermediate in the recombination reaction between opsin and 11-cis-retinal. Finally, the slow rate of decay of R0 to R22 explains why R0 activity is observed in room temperature assays. The ability of the apoprotein to activate transducin in a light-independent manner is a potential source of transduction noise in the rod cell. There is physiological evidence that the generation of noise could be a means of desensitizing the rod cell to adapt to higher intensities of light (42Rushton W.A.H. J. Physiol. 1961; 156: 195-205Google Scholar, 43Barlow H.B. Vision Res. 1964; 4: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 44Lamb T.D. Nature. 1980; 287: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Leibrock C.S. Reuter T. Lamb T.D. Vision Res. 1994; 34: 2787-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lamb and co-workers (45Leibrock C.S. Reuter T. Lamb T.D. Vision Res. 1994; 34: 2787-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that two processes occur in the rod cell immediately after a bleach. There is an increase in the basal current which is superimposed with photon-like quantum noise events. They also proposed that both these events originated at the level of the opsin molecule. We propose that the post-flash increase in basal current observed is caused by an accumulation of the active opsin apoprotein and that the quantum noise events are caused by the increased turnover of transducin when opsin recombines with the released all-trans-retinal. 2A. Surya and B. E. Knox, submitted for publication.However, the rod cell reverts to its low noise state during periods of extended darkness (15Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.-W. J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 613-634PubMed Google Scholar, 44Lamb T.D. Nature. 1980; 287: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Leibrock C.S. Reuter T. Lamb T.D. Vision Res. 1994; 34: 2787-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This decrease in noise coincides with the increased transport of 11-cis-retinal from the retinal pigment epithelium into the photoreceptor layer of the retina in the dark (46Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 188: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In fact, 11-cis-retinal has been shown to increase the sensitivity of isolated salamander rod (11Jones G.J. Crouch R.K. Wiggert B. Cornwall M.C. Chader G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Cornwall M.C. Fein A. MacNichol E.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 345-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and cone cells (14Jin J. Crouch R.K. Corson D. Katz B.M. MacNichol E.F. Cornwall M.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 513-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that have been bleached. Thus, physiologically, the reformation of rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis-retinal leads to a decrease in photoreceptor noise and consequent increase in sensitivity which is in agreement with in vitro biochemical data from this study that show that 11-cis-retinal causes a dramatic reduction in transducin activation by opsin. The magnitude of opsin activity required to initiate the biochemical events that underlie adaptation have been made from extrapolations of physiological data (13Corson D.W. Cornwall M.C. MacNichol E.F. Jin J. Johnson R. Derguini F. Crouch R.K. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6823-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 47Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These estimates are significantly lower than the activity of opsin measured in our in vitro assays. However, physiological measurements do not exclude the effect of quenching mechanisms, such as phosphorylation and arrestin binding, that could effect opsin and metarhodopsin(II) in different ways. In fact, the relatively high opsin activity that is measured in vitro may provide an additional reason for the shut off of the visual cascade by specialized proteins such as rhodopsin kinase and arrestin in vivo. Biochemical estimates of opsin activity vary greatly, most likely due to the use of opsin in non-native membranes (e.g. from transfected COS1 cells (48Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar)) or at non-optimal, non-physiological conditions (e.g. pH 8 (49Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1983; 9: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Experiments reported here indicate a much more active apoprotein, requiring several inactivation mechanisms. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of 11-cis-retinal, all-trans-retinal enhances opsin's ability to activate transducin (5Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 47Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R.

Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced activation of opsin by all-trans-retinal is another mechanism that could cause the observed post-flash noise in the rod cell (44Lamb T.D. Nature. 1980; 287: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Leibrock C.S. Reuter T. Lamb T.D. Vision Res. 1994; 34: 2787-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, in the rod cell, the rate of cessation of noise probably depends on both the rate of reformation of rhodopsin from opsin and 11-cis-retinal and the rate of reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol. The ability of 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal to combine with opsin and alter the sensitivity of the photoreceptors may provide the rationale for the rapid reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol by retinol dehydrogenase and the subsequent transport of retinoids out of the retina into the pigment epithelium. It follows then that the nighttime transport of 11-cis-retinal from the pigment epithelium back to the retina (46Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 188: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) coincides with increased photoreceptor sensitivity probably due to the reduction of opsin noise by 11-cis-retinal. We thank Drs. M. Max, J. Sullivan, and J. Stadel for careful reading of the manuscript."
