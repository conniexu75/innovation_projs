https://openalex.org/W2095571984,"Most existing human mobility literature focuses on exterior characteristics of movements but neglects activities, the driving force that underlies human movements. In this research, we combine activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach to model the intra-urban human mobility observed from about 15 million check-in records during a yearlong period in Shanghai, China. The proposed model is activity-based and includes two parts: the transition of travel demands during a specific time period and the movement between locations. For the first part, we find the transition probability between activities varies over time, and then we construct a temporal transition probability matrix to represent the transition probability of travel demands during a time interval. For the second part, we suggest that the travel demands can be divided into two classes, locationally mandatory activity (LMA) and locationally stochastic activity (LSA), according to whether the demand is associated with fixed location or not. By judging the combination of predecessor activity type and successor activity type we determine three trip patterns, each associated with a different decay parameter. To validate the model, we adopt the mechanism of an agent-based model and compare the simulated results with the observed pattern from the displacement distance distribution, the spatio-temporal distribution of activities, and the temporal distribution of travel demand transitions. The results show that the simulated patterns fit the observed data well, indicating that these findings open new directions for combining activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach using social media check-in data."
https://openalex.org/W2089533938,"Although neural activity often reflects the processing of external inputs, intrinsic fluctuations in activity have been observed throughout the brain. These may relate to patterns of self-generated thought that can occur while not performing goal-driven tasks. To understand the relationship between self-generated mental activity and intrinsic neural fluctuations, we developed the New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q) to assess the content and form of an individual's experiences during the acquisition of resting-state fMRI data. The data were collected as a part of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample. We decomposed NYC-Q scores using exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported thoughts clustered into distinct dimensions of content (future related, past related, positive, negative, and social) and form (words, images, and specificity). We used these components to perform an individual difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality). We found patterns of self-generated thoughts related to changes that were distributed across a wide range of cortical areas. For example, individuals who reported greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency fluctuations in a region of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to participate in the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex, the insula, and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported greater future thought exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in a region of lateral occipital cortex, a result that is consistent with the claim that particular types of self-generated thought depend on processes that are decoupled from sensory processes. These data provide evidence that self-generated thought is a heterogeneous category of experience and that studying its content can be helpful in understanding brain dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2030464567,"The definition of acute renal failure has been recently reviewed, and the term acute kidney injury (AKI) was proposed to cover the entire spectrum of the syndrome, ranging from small changes in renal function markers to dialysis needs. This study was aimed to evaluate the incidence, morbidity and mortality associated with AKI (based on KDIGO criteria) in patients after cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting or cardiac valve surgery) and to determine the value of this feature as a predictor of hospital mortality (30 days).From January 2003 to June 2013, a total of 2,804 patients underwent cardiac surgery in our service. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association between the development of AKI and 30-day mortality.A total of 1,175 (42%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for AKI based on KDIGO classification during the first 7 postoperative days: 978 (35%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for stage 1 while 100 (4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for stage 2 and 97 (3%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for stage 3. A total of 63 (2%) patients required dialysis treatment. Overall, the 30-day mortality was 7.1% (2.2%) for patients without AKI and 8.2%, 31% and 55% for patients with AKI at stages 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The KDIGO stage 3 patients who did not require dialysis had a mortality rate of 41%, while the mortality of dialysis patients was 62%. The adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that AKI based on KDIGO criteria (stages 1-3) was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (P<0.001 for all. Hazard ratio = 3.35, 11.94 and 24.85).In the population evaluated in the present study, even slight changes in the renal function based on KDIGO criteria were considered as independent predictors of 30-day mortality after cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2082634363,"Anthocyanins, one of the flavonoid subtypes, are a large family of water-soluble phytopigments and have a wide range of health-promoting benefits. Recently, an anthocyanin-rich compound from blueberries was reported to possess protective property against bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) animal models. However, the active ingredients in the anthocyanin compound have not been identified. Here we show that delphinidin, one of the major anthocyanidins in berries, is a potent active ingredient in anti-osteoporotic bone resorption through the suppression of osteoclast formation. In vitro examinations revealed that delphinidin treatment markedly inhibited the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts compared with other anthocyanidins, cyanidin and peonidin. Oral administration of delphinidin significantly prevented bone loss in both RANKL-induced osteoporosis model mice and OVX model mice. We further provide evidence that delphinidin suppressed the activity of NF-κB, c-fos, and Nfatc1, master transcriptional factors for osteoclastogenesis. These results strongly suggest that delphinidin is the most potent inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation and will be an effective agent for preventing bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2021136771,"Several neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the aggregation and posttranslational modifications of Tau protein. Its ""repeat domain"" (TauRD) is mainly responsible for the aggregation properties, and oligomeric forms are thought to dominate the toxic effects of Tau. Here we investigated the conformational transitions of this domain during oligomerization and aggregation in different states of β-propensity and pseudo-phosphorylation, using several complementary imaging and spectroscopic methods. Although the repeat domain generally aggregates more readily than full-length Tau, its aggregation was greatly slowed down by phosphorylation or pseudo-phosphorylation at the KXGS motifs, concomitant with an extended phase of oligomerization. Analogous effects were observed with pro-aggregant variants of TauRD. Oligomers became most evident in the case of the pro-aggregant mutant TauRDΔK280, as monitored by atomic force microscopy, and the fluorescence lifetime of Alexa-labeled Tau (time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)), consistent with its pronounced toxicity in mouse models. In cell models or primary neurons, neither oligomers nor fibrils of TauRD or TauRDΔK280 had a toxic effect, as seen by assays with lactate dehydrogenase and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, respectively. However, oligomers of pro-aggregant TauRDΔK280 specifically caused a loss of spine density in differentiated neurons, indicating a locally restricted impairment of function."
https://openalex.org/W1993064387,"Trans-activation element DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) characterizes insoluble protein aggregates in distinct subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TDP-43 mediates many RNA processing steps within distinct protein complexes. Here we identify novel TDP-43 protein interactors found in a yeast two-hybrid screen using an adult human brain cDNA library. We confirmed the TDP-43 interaction of seven hits by co-immunoprecipitation and assessed their co-localization in HEK293E cells. As pathological TDP-43 is ubiquitinated, we focused on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E3 and the ubiquitin isopeptidase Y (UBPY). When cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, ubiquitinated and insoluble TDP-43 species accumulated. All three UBE2E family members could enhance the ubiquitination of TDP-43, whereas catalytically inactive UBE2E3(C145S) was much less efficient. Conversely, silencing of UBE2E3 reduced TDP-43 ubiquitination. We examined 15 of the 48 known disease-associated TDP-43 mutants and found that one was excessively ubiquitinated. This strong TDP-43(K263E) ubiquitination was further enhanced by proteasomal inhibition as well as UBE2E3 expression. Conversely, UBE2E3 silencing and expression of UBPY reduced TDP-43(K263E) ubiquitination. Moreover, wild-type but not active site mutant UBPY reduced ubiquitination of TDP-43 C-terminal fragments and of a nuclear import-impaired mutant. In Drosophila melanogaster, UBPY silencing enhanced neurodegenerative TDP-43 phenotypes and the accumulation of insoluble high molecular weight TDP-43 and ubiquitin species. Thus, UBE2E3 and UBPY participate in the regulation of TDP-43 ubiquitination, solubility, and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2035520495,"Class 3 semaphorins were initially described as axonal growth cone guidance molecules that signal through plexin and neuropilin coreceptors and since then have been established to be regulators of vascular development. Semaphorin 3e (Sema3e) has been shown previously to repel endothelial cells and is the only class 3 semaphorin known to be capable of signaling via a plexin receptor without a neuropilin coreceptor. Sema3e signals through plexin D1 (Plxnd1) to regulate vascular patterning by modulating the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion structures. We showed recently that semaphorin 3d (Sema3d) mediates endothelial cell repulsion and pulmonary vein patterning during embryogenesis. Here we show that Sema3d and Sema3e affect human umbilical vein endothelial cells similarly but through distinct molecular signaling pathways. Time-lapse imaging studies show that both Sema3d and Sema3e can inhibit cell motility and migration, and tube formation assays indicate that both can impede tubulogenesis. Endothelial cells incubated with either Sema3d or Sema3e demonstrate a loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. However, the addition of neuropilin 1 (Nrp1)-blocking antibody or siRNA knockdown of Nrp1 inhibits Sema3d-mediated, but not Sema3e-mediated, cytoskeletal reorganization, and siRNA knockdown of Nrp1 abrogates Sema3d-mediated, but not Sema3e-mediated, inhibition of tubulogenesis. On the other hand, endothelial cells deficient in Plxnd1 are resistant to endothelial repulsion mediated by Sema3e but not Sema3d. Unlike Sema3e, Sema3d incubation results in phosphorylation of Akt in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway blocks the endothelial guidance and cytoskeletal reorganization functions of Sema3d but not Sema3e."
https://openalex.org/W1982574756,"Novel hybrid magnetic cross-linked enzyme aggregates of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (HM-PAL-CLEAs) were developed by co-aggregation of enzyme aggregates with magnetite nanoparticles and subsequent crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The HM-PAL-CLEAs can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by using an external magnetic field. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) indicated that PAL-CLEAs were inlayed in nanoparticle aggregates. The HM-PAL-CLEAs revealed a broader limit in optimal pH compared to free enzyme and PAL-CLEAs. Although there is no big difference in Km of enzyme in CLEAs and HM-PAL-CLEAs, Vmax of HM-PAL-CLEAs is about 1.75 times higher than that of CLEAs. Compared with free enzyme and PAL-CLEAs, the HM-PAL-CLEAs also exhibited the highest thermal stability, denaturant stability and storage stability. The HM-PAL-CLEAs retained 30% initial activity even after 11 cycles of reuse, whereas PAL-CLEAs retained 35% of its initial activity only after 7 cycles. These results indicated that hybrid magnetic CLEAs technology might be used as a feasible and efficient solution for improving properties of immobilized enzyme in industrial application."
https://openalex.org/W2045072257,"Class XIX myosin (Myo19) is a vertebrate-specific unconventional myosin, responsible for the transport of mitochondria. To characterize biochemical properties of Myo19, we prepared recombinant mouse Myo19-truncated constructs containing the motor domain and the IQ motifs using the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system. We identified regulatory light chain (RLC) of smooth muscle/non-muscle myosin-2 as the light chain of Myo19. The actin-activated ATPase activity and the actin-gliding velocity of Myo19-truncated constructs were about one-third and one-sixth as those of myosin-5a, respectively. The apparent affinity of Myo19 to actin was about the same as that of myosin-5a. The RLCs bound to Myo19 could be phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase, but this phosphorylation had little effect on the actin-activated ATPase activity and the actin-gliding activity of Myo19-truncated constructs. Using dual fluorescence-labeled actin filaments, we determined that Myo19 is a plus-end-directed molecular motor. We found that, similar to that of the high-duty ratio myosin, such as myosin-5a, ADP release rate was comparable with the maximal actin-activated ATPase activity of Myo19, indicating that ADP release is a rate-limiting step for the ATPase cycle of acto-Myo19. ADP strongly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity and actin-gliding activity of Myo19-truncated constructs. Based on the above results, we concluded that Myo19 is a high-duty ratio molecular motor moving to the plus-end of the actin filament."
https://openalex.org/W2058412361,"Astroviruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis in mammals and birds worldwide. Although historically thought to be species-specific, increasing evidence suggests that astroviruses may cross species barriers. In this report, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to screen sera from three distinct human cohorts involved in influenza studies in Memphis, TN or Chapel Hill, NC, and Midwestern poultry abattoir workers for antibodies to turkey astrovirus type 2 (TAstV-2). Surprisingly, 26% of one cohort's population was TAstV-2 positive as compared to 0 and 8.9% in the other cohorts. This cohort was composed of people with exposure to turkeys in the Midwestern United States including abattoir workers, turkey growers, and non-occupationally exposed participants. The odds of testing positive for antibodies against turkey astrovirus among abattoir workers were approximately 3 times higher than the other groups. These studies suggest that people with contact to turkeys can develop serological responses to turkey astrovirus. Further work is needed to determine if these exposures result in virus replication and/or clinical disease."
https://openalex.org/W2000074524,"Integrative taxonomy, in which multiple disciplines are combined to address questions related to biological species diversity, is a valuable tool for identifying pelagic marine fish larvae and recognizing the existence of new fish species. Here we combine data from DNA barcoding, comparative morphology, and analysis of color patterns to identify an unusual fish larva from the Florida Straits and demonstrate that it is the pelagic larval phase of a previously undescribed species of Liopropoma sea bass from deep reefs off Curaçao, southern Caribbean. The larva is unique among larvae of the teleost family Serranidae, Tribe Liopropomini, in having seven elongate dorsal-fin spines. Adults of the new species are similar to the golden bass, Liopropoma aberrans, with which they have been confused, but they are distinct genetically and morphologically. The new species differs from all other western Atlantic liopropomins in having IX, 11 dorsal-fin rays and in having a unique color pattern-most notably the predominance of yellow pigment on the dorsal portion of the trunk, a pale to white body ventrally, and yellow spots scattered across both the dorsal and ventral portions of the trunk. Exploration of deep reefs to 300 m using a manned submersible off Curaçao is resulting in the discovery of numerous new fish species, improving our genetic databases, and greatly enhancing our understanding of deep-reef fish diversity in the southern Caribbean.

https://openalex.org/W2060487992,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration throughout the association cortex and limbic system, deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the neuropil and around the blood vessels, and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The endopeptidase neprilysin has been successfully used to reduce the accumulation of Aβ following intracranial viral vector delivery or ex vivo manipulated intracranial delivery. These therapies have relied on direct injections into the brain, whereas a clinically desirable therapy would involve i.v. infusion of a recombinant enzyme. We previously characterized a recombinant neprilysin that contained a 38-amino acid brain-targeting domain. Recombinant cell lines have been generated expressing this brain-targeted enzyme (ASN12). In this report, we characterize the ASN12 recombinant protein for pharmacology in a mouse as well as efficacy in two APPtg mouse models of AD. The recombinant ASN12 transited to the brain with a t½ of 24 h and accumulated to 1.7% of injected dose at 24 h following i.v. delivery. We examined pharmacodynamics in the tg2576 APPtg mouse with the prion promoter APP695 SWE mutation and in the Line41 mThy1 APP751 mutation mouse. Treatment of either APPtg mouse resulted in reduced Aβ, increased neuronal synapses, and improved learning and memory. In addition, the Line41 APPtg mice showed increased levels of C-terminal neuropeptide Y fragments and increased neurogenesis. These results suggest that the recombinant brain-targeted neprilysin, ASN12, may be an effective treatment for AD and warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

https://openalex.org/W2075152467,"Collaborator of ARF (CARF) has been shown to directly bind to and regulate p53, a central protein that controls tumor suppression via cellular senescence and apoptosis. However, the cellular functions of CARF and the mechanisms governing its effect on senescence, apoptosis, or proliferation are still unknown. Our previous studies have shown that (i) CARF is up-regulated during replicative and stress-induced senescence, and its exogenous overexpression caused senescence-like growth arrest of cells, and (ii) suppression of CARF induces aneuploidy, DNA damage, and mitotic catastrophe, resulting in apoptosis via the ATR/CHK1 pathway. In the present study, we dissected the cellular role of CARF by investigating the molecular pathways triggered by its overexpression in vitro and in vivo. We found that the dosage of CARF is a critical factor in determining the proliferation potential of cancer cells. Most surprisingly, although a moderate level of CARF overexpression induced senescence, a very high level of CARF resulted in increased cell proliferation. We demonstrate that the level of CARF is crucial for DNA damage and checkpoint response of cells through ATM/CHK1/CHK2, p53, and ERK pathways that in turn determine the proliferative fate of cancer cells toward growth arrest or proproliferative and malignant phenotypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates the capability of a fundamental protein, CARF, in controlling cell proliferation in two opposite directions and hence may play a key role in tumor biology and cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2018206861,"Accumulating evidence indicate that macrophages activate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to acquire pro-inflammatory phenotype. However, the role of MSCs activated by macrophages in gastric cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that MSCs were activated by macrophages to produce increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Cell colony formation and transwell migration assays revealed that supernatants from the activated MSCs could promote both gastric epithelial cell and gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration. In addition, the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and stemness-related genes was increased in activated MSCs. The phosphorylated forms of NF-κB, ERK and STAT3 in gastric cells were increased by active MSCs. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by PDTC blocked the effect of activated MSCs on gastric cancer cells. Co-injection of activated MSCs with gastric cancer cells could accelerate gastric cancer growth. Moreover, human peripheral blood monocytes derived macrophages also activated MSCs to prompt gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings suggest that MSCs activated by macrophage acquire pro-inflammatory phenotype and prompt gastric cancer growth in an NF-κB-dependent manner, which provides new evidence for the modulation of MSCs by tumor microenvironment and further insight to the role of stromal cells in gastric carcinogenesis and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2076902844,"The green seaweed Ulva is a major fouling organism but also an edible aquaculture product in Asia. This study quantified for the first time the effect of key factors on the reproduction of a tropical species of filamentous Ulva (Ulva sp. 3). The controlled timing of release of swarmers (motile reproductive bodies) was achieved when experiments were initiated in the early afternoon by exposing the thalli to a temperature shock (4°C) for 10 min and subsequently placing them into autoclaved filtered seawater under a 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod at 25°C. The release of swarmers then peaked two days after initiation. In contrast, segmentation, dehydration, salinity or time of initiation of experiments had no effect of any magnitude on reproduction. The released swarmers were predominantly biflagellate (95%), negatively phototactic and germinated without complementary gametes. This indicates that Ulva sp. 3 has a simple asexual life history dominated by biflagellate zoids."
https://openalex.org/W1985457542,"Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen causing infection in adults suffering obstructive lung diseases. Existing evidence associates chronic infection by NTHi to the progression of the chronic respiratory disease, but specific features of NTHi associated with persistence have not been comprehensively addressed. To provide clues about adaptive strategies adopted by NTHi during persistent infection, we compared sequential persistent isolates with newly acquired isolates in sputa from six patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identified three patients with consecutive persistent strains and three with new strains. Phenotypic characterisation included infection of respiratory epithelial cells, bacterial self-aggregation, biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Persistent isolates differed from new strains in showing low epithelial adhesion and inability to form biofilms when grown under continuous-flow culture conditions in microfermenters. Self-aggregation clustered the strains by patient, not by persistence. Increasing resistance to AMPs was observed for each series of persistent isolates; this was not associated with lipooligosaccharide decoration with phosphorylcholine or with lipid A acylation. Variation was further analyzed for the series of three persistent isolates recovered from patient 1. These isolates displayed comparable growth rate, natural transformation frequency and murine pulmonary infection. Genome sequencing of these three isolates revealed sequential acquisition of single-nucleotide variants in the AMP permease sapC, the heme acquisition systems hgpB, hgpC, hup and hxuC, the 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid kinase kdkA, the long-chain fatty acid transporter ompP1, and the phosphoribosylamine glycine ligase purD. Collectively, we frame a range of pathogenic traits and a repertoire of genetic variants in the context of persistent infection by NTHi."
https://openalex.org/W1966060370,"Where biological datasets are spatially limited, abiotic surrogates have been advocated to inform objective planning for Marine Protected Areas. However, this approach assumes close correlation between abiotic and biotic patterns. The Solitary Islands Marine Park, northern NSW, Australia, currently uses a habitat classification system (HCS) to assist with planning, but this is based only on data for reefs. We used Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to survey fish assemblages of unconsolidated substrata at different depths, distances from shore, and across an along-shore spatial scale of 10 s of km (2 transects) to examine how well the HCS works for this dominant habitat. We used multivariate regression modelling to examine the importance of these, and other environmental factors (backscatter intensity, fine-scale bathymetric variation and rugosity), in structuring fish assemblages. There were significant differences in fish assemblages across depths, distance from shore, and over the medium spatial scale of the study: together, these factors generated the optimum model in multivariate regression. However, marginal tests suggested that backscatter intensity, which itself is a surrogate for sediment type and hardness, might also influence fish assemblages and needs further investigation. Species richness was significantly different across all factors: however, total MaxN only differed significantly between locations. This study demonstrates that the pre-existing abiotic HCS only partially represents the range of fish assemblages of unconsolidated habitats in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2085822761,"Objective In this clinical trial, we aimed to compare three means of performing chronic hemodialysis in patients with contra-indication to systemic heparinization. Methods This open-label monocentric randomized « n-of-one » trial, conducted in a single tertiary care center, recruited chronic hemodialysis patients with a contra-indication to systemic heparinization for at least 3 consecutive sessions. All patients underwent hemodialysis with an AN69ST dialyzer, and were administered three alternative dialysis procedures in a random sequence: intermittent saline flushes, constant saline infusion, or pre-dialysis heparin coating of the membrane. The primary outcome was the need to interrupt the dialysis session because of clotting events due to either (i) a complete coagulation of the circuit; (ii) a partial coagulation of the circuit; (iii) a>50% rise over baseline in the venous pressure. Results At the end of the inclusion period (May, 2007 to December, 2008), the number of patients to include (n = 75) was not reached: only 46 patients were included and underwent randomization. The study was terminated, and statistical analysis took into account 224 hemodialysis sessions performed in 44 patients with analyzable data. Heparin adsorption was associated with a significant reduction of the need to interrupt the dialysis session because of clotting events: odds ratio 0.3 (CI 95% 0.2 to 0.6; p<0.001, versus intermittent saline flushes). Heparin adsorption was also associated with higher odds for performing >3 h dialysis sessions and for having complete blood restitution. There were no significant effects of the dialysis procedure on weight loss, online ionic dialysance, and adverse events. Conclusion Heparin-coated AN69ST dialysis membrane is a safe and effective method to avoid or delay per-dialytic clotting events in patients with contra-indication to systemic anticoagulation. However, results are not generalizable safely to patients with active bleeding, since weak heparinemia, not assessed in this study, may occur. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00473109."
https://openalex.org/W1983452255,"In mice and humans, the androgen receptor (AR) gene, located on the X chromosome, is not known to be involved in sex determination. In the Japanese frog Rana rugosa the AR is located on the sex chromosomes (X, Y, Z and W). Phylogenetic analysis shows that the AR on the X chromosome (X-AR) of the Korean R. rugosa is basal and segregates into two clusters: one containing W-AR of Japanese R. rugosa, the other containing Y-AR. AR expression is twice as high in ZZ (male) compared to ZW (female) embryos in which the W-AR is barely expressed. Higher AR-expression may be associated with male sex determination in this species. To examine whether the Z-AR is involved in sex determination in R. rugosa, we produced transgenic (Tg) frogs carrying an exogenous Z-AR. Analysis of ZW Tg frogs revealed development of masculinized gonads or ‘ovotestes’. Expression of CYP17 and Dmrt1, genes known to be activated during normal male gonadal development, were up-regulated in the ZW ovotestis. Testosterone, supplied to the rearing water, completed the female-to-male sex-reversal in the AR-Tg ZW frogs. Here we report that Z-AR is involved in male sex-determination in an amphibian species."
https://openalex.org/W2312906792,"Overexpression of PKCϵ, a kinase associated with tumor aggressiveness and widely implicated in malignant transformation and metastasis, is a hallmark of multiple cancers, including mammary, prostate, and lung cancer. To characterize the mechanisms that control PKCϵ expression and its up-regulation in cancer, we cloned an ∼ 1.6-kb promoter segment of the human PKCϵ gene (PRKCE) that displays elevated transcriptional activity in cancer cells. A comprehensive deletional analysis established two regions rich in Sp1 and STAT1 sites located between -777 and -105 bp (region A) and -921 and -796 bp (region B), respectively, as responsible for the high transcriptional activity observed in cancer cells. A more detailed mutagenesis analysis followed by EMSA and ChIP identified Sp1 sites in positions -668/-659 and -269/-247 as well as STAT1 sites in positions -880/-869 and -793/-782 as the elements responsible for elevated promoter activity in breast cancer cells relative to normal mammary epithelial cells. RNAi silencing of Sp1 and STAT1 in breast cancer cells reduced PKCϵ mRNA and protein expression, as well as PRKCE promoter activity. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between PKCϵ and phospho-Ser-727 (active) STAT1 levels in breast cancer cells. Our results may have significant implications for the development of approaches to target PKCϵ and its effectors in cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1966938855,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a picture of the global spatial activation pattern of the brain. Interest is growing regarding the application of fMRI to rodent models to investigate adult brain plasticity. To date, most rodent studies used an electrical forepaw stimulation model to acquire fMRI data, with α-chloralose as the anesthetic. However, α-chloralose is harmful to animals, and not suitable for longitudinal studies. Moreover, peripheral stimulation models enable only a limited number of brain regions to be studied. Processing between peripheral regions and the brain is multisynaptic, and renders interpretation difficult and uncertain. In the present study, we combined the medetomidine-based fMRI protocol (a noninvasive rodent fMRI protocol) with chronic implantation of an MRI-compatible stimulation electrode in the ventroposterior (VP) thalamus to repetitively sample thalamocortical responses in the rat brain. Using this model, we scanned the forebrain responses evoked by the VP stimulation repeatedly of individual rats over 1 week. Cortical BOLD responses were compared between the 2 profiles obtained at day1 and day8. We discovered reproducible frequency- and amplitude-dependent BOLD responses in the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex (S1). The S1 BOLD responses during the 2 sessions were conserved in maximal response amplitude, area size (size ratio from 0.88 to 0.91), and location (overlap ratio from 0.61 to 0.67). The present study provides a long-term chronic brain stimulation protocol for studying the plasticity of specific neural circuits in the rodent brain by BOLD-fMRI."
https://openalex.org/W1990299632,"This paper presents a stable and fast algorithm for independent component analysis with reference (ICA-R). This is a technique for incorporating available reference signals into the ICA contrast function so as to form an augmented Lagrangian function under the framework of constrained ICA (cICA). The previous ICA-R algorithm was constructed by solving the optimization problem via a Newton-like learning style. Unfortunately, the slow convergence and potential misconvergence limit the capability of ICA-R. This paper first investigates and probes the flaws of the previous algorithm and then introduces a new stable algorithm with a faster convergence speed. There are two other highlights in this paper: first, new approaches, including the reference deflation technique and a direct way of obtaining references, are introduced to facilitate the application of ICA-R; second, a new method is proposed that the new ICA-R is used to recover the complete underlying sources with new advantages compared with other classical ICA methods. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic and real-world data verify the better performance of the new algorithm over both previous ICA-R and other well-known methods."
https://openalex.org/W1985785712,"The Eph receptors and their membrane-bound ligands, ephrins, play important roles in various biological processes such as cell adhesion and movement. The transmembrane ephrinBs transduce reverse signaling in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent or -independent, as well as PDZ-dependent manner. Here, we show that ephrinB1 interacts with Connector Enhancer of KSR1 (CNK1) in an EphB receptor-independent manner. In cultured cells, cotransfection of ephrinB1 with CNK1 increases JNK phosphorylation. EphrinB1/CNK1-mediated JNK activation is reduced by overexpression of dominant-negative RhoA. Overexpression of CNK1 alone is sufficient for activation of RhoA; however, both ephrinB1 and CNK1 are required for JNK phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation data showed that ephrinB1 and CNK1 act as scaffold proteins that connect RhoA and JNK signaling components, such as p115RhoGEF and MKK4. Furthermore, adhesion to fibronectin or active Src overexpression increases ephrinB1/CNK1 binding, whereas blocking Src activity by a pharmacological inhibitor decreases not only ephrinB1/CNK1 binding, but also JNK activation. EphrinB1 overexpression increases cell motility, however, CNK1 depletion by siRNA abrogates ephrinB1-mediated cell migration and JNK activation. Moreover, Rho kinase inhibitor or JNK inhibitor treatment suppresses ephrinB1-mediated cell migration. Taken together, our findings suggest that CNK1 is required for ephrinB1-induced JNK activation and cell migration."

The study’s primary objective was to determine whether abacavir/lamivudine + atazanavir (ABC/3TC+ATV) was virologically non-inferior to tenofovir/emtricitabine + atazanavir/ritonavir (TDF/FTC+ATV/r) over 24 weeks in a population of virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected patients. Design This open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study enrolled antiretroviral experienced, HIV-infected adults currently receiving a regimen of TDF/FTC+ATV/r for ≥6 months with no history of virologic failure and whose HIV-1 RNA had been ≤75 copies/mL on 2 consecutive measurements including screening. Patients were randomized 1∶2 to continue current treatment or simplify to ABC/3TC+ATV. Methods The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-RNA<50 copies/mL at Week 24 by the Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) algorithm. Secondary endpoints included alternative measures of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and fasting lipids. Exploratory endpoints included inflammatory, coagulation, bone, and renal biomarkers. Results After 24 weeks, ABC/3TC+ATV (n = 199) was non-inferior to TDF/FTC+ATV/r (n = 97) by both the primary analysis (87% in both groups) and all secondary efficacy analyses. Rates of grade 2–4 AEs were similar between the two groups (40% vs 37%, respectively), but an excess of hyperbilirubinemia made the rate of grade 3–4 laboratory abnormalities higher in the TDF/FTC+ATV/r group (30%) compared with the ABC/3TC+ATV group (13%). Lipid levels were stable except for HDL cholesterol, which increased significantly in the ABC/3TC+ATV group. Bone and renal biomarkers improved significantly between baseline and Week 24 in patients taking ABC/3TC+ATV, and the difference between groups was significant at Week 24. No significant changes occurred in any inflammatory or coagulation biomarker within or between treatment groups. Conclusions After 24 weeks, simplification to ABC/3TC+ATV from TDF/FTC+ATV/r maintained viral suppression was well-tolerated, and led to improvements in bone and renal biomarkers and HDL cholesterol.

Agonists with this activity, although potentially useful for treatment of obesity, can also have side effects and toxicities of concern, making the development of an intrinsically inactive positive allosteric modulator quite attractive.

Current model systems to study CCK1R in such an environment are unstable and expensive to maintain. We now report that the Y140A mutation within a cholesterol-binding motif and the conserved, class A G protein-coupled receptor-specific (E/D)RY signature sequence results in ligand binding and activity characteristics similar to wild type CCK1R in a high cholesterol environment. This is true for natural CCK, as well as ligands with distinct chemistries and activity profiles. Additionally, the Y140A construct also behaved like CCK1R in high cholesterol in regard to its internalization, sensitivity to a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, and anisotropy of a bound fluorescent CCK analog. Chimeric CCK1R/CCK2R constructs that systematically changed the residues in the allosteric ligand-binding pocket were studied in the presence of Y140A. This established increased importance of unique residues within TM3 and reduced the importance of TM2 for binding in the presence of this mutation, with the agonist trigger likely pulled away from its Leu356 target on TM7. The distinct conformation of this intramembranous pocket within Y140A CCK1R provides an opportunity to normalize this by using a small molecule allosteric ligand, thereby providing safe and effective correction of the coupling defect in metabolic syndrome.

The ability of CCK to stimulate satiety has been responsible for efforts to target this receptor as a potential treatment for obesity. Indeed, agonists of the type 1 CCK receptor (CCK1R) have been developed (5Aquino C.J. Armour D.R. Berman J.M. Birkemo L.S. Carr R.A. Croom D.K. Dezube M. Dougherty Jr., R.W. Ervin G.N. Grizzle M.K.

Additionally, there has been at least the theoretical concern about a long-acting CCK1R agonist having trophic effects on pancreatic cells, with possible impact to stimulate the development and/or growth of pancreatic cancer (10Hoshi H.

A possible strategy to circumvent these concerns is the development of a nonbiologically active allosteric enhancer of the CCK1R. Such a drug could exhibit satiety effects only during the brief postcibal period when natural CCK is released into the circulation, because this hormone has a particularly brief half-life. Action at that time could limit the size of the meal, a strategy that could reinforce the motivation to maintain a normal or healthy weight in individuals. Another set of observations is particularly relevant to this type of drug development. This receptor has been shown to be uniquely sensitive to the membrane cholesterol composition (12Harikumar K.G.

Mechanistic studies have localized the cause of the reduced coupling efficiency between CCK1R and its heterotrimeric G protein (Gq) to increased cholesterol composition of the membrane (20Yu P. Chen Q. Harnett K.M. Amaral J. Biancani P. Behar J. Direct G protein activation reverses impaired CCK signaling in human gallbladders with cholesterol stones.Am. J.

Consistent with this, patients with pigment gallstones who are known to have normal rather than increased membrane cholesterol, such as is present in patients with cholesterol gallstones (22Seres I.

We previously reported direct in vitro evidence showing that CCK1R function is sensitive to the membrane cholesterol content, which is reflected in its ligand binding characteristics and in its biological activity (12Harikumar K.G.

CCK binding affinity and CCK-stimulated biological responses are reduced upon cholesterol depletion, although cholesterol augmentation also reduces CCK-stimulated biological responses, but in the setting of actually enhancing CCK binding affinity. The increased binding affinity for CCK in the setting of increased membrane cholesterol, however, is nonproductive and results in a reduction in biological responsiveness. In contrast, the closely structurally related CCK2R is not sensitive to alterations in membrane cholesterol (14Potter R.M. Harikumar K.G. Wu S.V. Miller L.J.

We localized the key structural determinant within the CCK1R for cholesterol sensitivity to residues encoded by its third exon (14Potter R.M. Harikumar K.G. Wu S.V. Miller L.J.

Key residues include Tyr140 (Y3.51, based on the nomenclature of Ballesteros and Weinstein (26Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Analysis and refinement of criteria for predicting the structure and relative orientations of transmembranal helical domains.Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 107-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). There is also an additional CRAC motif in TM5 that includes Tyr237 (Y5.66). CCK binding and signaling are negatively affected by mutation of each of these residues to alanines. It is notable that, in contrast with the mutation of the other two residues, the Y140A mutation results in elimination of the sensitivity of the CCK1R to cholesterol (14Potter R.M. Harikumar K.G.

Lipid Res. 2012; 53: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tyr140 (Y3.51) is also part of the highly conserved (E/D)RY class A GPCR signature sequence. It is well established that the charged residues in this sequence, the acidic glutamic or aspartic acid and the basic arginine, form a charge-charge interaction key for the ionic lock to maintain these receptors in their inactive state (27Rovati G.E.

The role of the tyrosine residue in this sequence motif is much less clear. It is less well conserved than the other residues, often replaced with a cysteine, histidine, or valine.

In this study, we have focused on the Y140A mutant of the CCK1R, now establishing a stable mutant receptor-bearing cell line and expanding its functional characterization. These data support the use of this cell line as a mimic of the wild type CCK1R in the presence of elevated membrane cholesterol. As such, this provides a valuable new tool to use in the screening for positive allosteric modulators of this receptor that might correct the conformational change in the receptor induced by the high cholesterol membrane environment. Such a surrogate may offer substantial advantages in future high throughput screening strategies, because it addresses challenges of existing model systems incorporating physical enhancement in membrane cholesterol or cell lines with mutations in lipid synthetic machinery for mimicking CCK1R conformations in a high cholesterol environment, having a stable phenotype, and growing well in culture.

The aim of this study was to identify rare copy number variants in individuals with congenital pulmonary atresia (PA).Based on the hypothesis that rare structural variants encompassing key genes play an important role in heart development in PA patients, we performed high-resolution genome-wide microarrays for copy number variations (CNVs) in 82 PA patient-parent trios and 189 controls with an Illumina SNP array platform. CNVs were identified in 17/82 patients (20.7%), and eight of these CNVs (9.8%) are considered potentially pathogenic. Five de novo CNVs occurred at two known congenital heart disease (CHD) loci (16p13.1 and 22q11.2). Two de novo CNVs that may affect folate and vitamin B12 metabolism were identified for the first time. A de novo 1-Mb deletion at 17p13.2 may represent a rare genomic disorder that involves mild intellectual disability and associated facial features.Rare CNVs contribute to the pathogenesis of PA (9.8%), suggesting that the causes of PA are heterogeneous and pleiotropic. Together with previous data from animal models, our results might help identify a link between CHD and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM). With the accumulation of high-resolution SNP array data, these previously undescribed rare CNVs may help reveal critical gene(s) in CHD and may provide novel insights about CHD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004852676,"Abscisic acid (ABA) catabolism is one of the determinants of endogenous ABA levels affecting numerous aspects of plant growth and abiotic-stress responses. The major ABA catabolic pathway is triggered by ABA 8'-hydroxylation catalysed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, the cytochrome P450 CYP707A family. In this study, the full-length cDNAs of AhCYP707A1 and AhCYP707A2 were cloned and characterized from peanut. Expression analyses showed that AhCYP707A1 and AhCYP707A2 were expressed ubiquitously in peanut roots, stems, and leaves with different transcript accumulation levels, including the higher expression of AhCYP707A1 in roots. The expression of AhCYP707A2 was significantly up-regulated by 20% PEG6000 or 250 mmol/L NaCl in peanut roots, stems, and leaves, whereas the up-regulation of AhCYP707A1 transcript level by PEG6000 or NaCl was observed only in roots instead of leaves and stems. Due to the osmotic and ionic stresses of high concentration of NaCl to plants simultaneously, low concentration of LiCl (30 mmol/L, at which concentration osmotic status of cells is not seriously affected, the toxicity of Li+ being higher than that of Na+) was used to examine whether the effect of NaCl might be related to osmotic or ionic stress. The results revealed visually the susceptibility to osmotic stress and the resistance to salt ions in peanut seedlings. The significant up-regulation of AhCYP707A1, AhCYP707A2 and AhNCED1 transcripts and endogenous ABA levels by PEG6000 or NaCl instead of LiCl, showed that the osmotic stress instead of ionic stress affected the expression of those genes and the biosynthesis of ABA in peanut. The functional expression of AhCYP707A1 cDNA in yeast showed that the microsomal fractions prepared from yeast cell expressing recombinant AhCYP707A1 protein exhibited the catalytic activity of ABA 8'-hydroxylase. These results demonstrate that the expressions of AhCYP707A1 and AhCYP707A2 play an important role in ABA catabolism in peanut, particularly in response to osmotic stress."

Design We examined the bilateral hand radiographs of 542 occupationally active Finnish female dentists and teachers aged 45 to 63 and classified them according to the presence of OA by using reference images. Data regarding finger joint pain and other risk factors were collected using a questionnaire. We defined two hand OA phenotypes: radiographic OA in at least three joints (ROA) and symptomatic DIP OA. The genotypes were determined by PCR-based methods. In statistical analysis, we used SNPStats software, the chi-square test and logistic regression. Results Of the SNPs, rs716508 in A2BP1 was associated with ROA (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5–0.9) and rs1800470 in TGFB1 with symptomatic DIP OA (1.8, 1.2–2.9). We found an interaction between ESR1 (rs9340799) and occupation: teachers with the minor allele were at an increased risk of symptomatic DIP OA (2.8, 1.3–6.5). We saw no association among the dentists. We also found that the carriage of the COG5 rs3757713 C allele increased the risk of ROA only among women with the BCAP29 rs10953541 CC genotype (2.6; 1.1–6.1). There was also a suggestive interaction between the HFE rs179945 and the ESR1 rs9340799, and the carriage of the minor allele of either of these SNPs was associated with an increased risk of symptomatic DIP OA (2.1, 1.3–2.5). Conclusions Our results support the earlier findings of A2BP1 and TBGF1 being OA susceptibility genes and provide evidence of a possible gene-gene interaction in the genetic influence on hand OA predisposition."

Subsequent investigation of preserved voucher specimens was conducted to reconcile the genetic data and the existing classification, which is based on morphology. In addition to discovering that one of the genetic lineages is an undescribed species, which we describe as Acyrtus lanthanum, new species, we found that the nominal species Acyrtus artius has a putative venom gland associated with the subopercle that has been overlooked since the species was described nearly 60 years ago. The new species lacks the subopercular gland as does Acyrtus rubiginosus, but one is present in the related Arcos nudus. Venom glands have not been reported previously for the Gobiesocidae, and the venom gland described herein for Acyrtus and Arcos represents the first example in teleost fishes of a venom gland associated with the subopercle."

In this study, we analyzed the mobilization kinetics and the numbers of CD34+, CD31+, CD45+, and CD133+ cells in twenty polytrauma patients (n = 13 male, n = 7 female, mean age 46.5±17.2 years, mean injury severity score (ISS) 35.8±12.5 points). In addition, the endothelial differentiation capacity of enriched CD34+cells was assessed by analyzing DiI-ac-LDL/lectin uptake, the expression of endothelial markers, and the morphological characteristics of these cells in Matrigel and spheroid cultures. We found that on days 1, 3, and 7 after a major trauma, the number of CD34+cells increased from 6- up to 12-fold (p<0.0001) over the number of CD34+cells from a control population of healthy, age-matched volunteers. The numbers of CD31+ cells were consistently higher on days 1 (1.4-fold, p<0.01) and 7 (1.3-fold, p<0.01), whereas the numbers of CD133+ cell did not change during the time course of investigation. Expression of endothelial marker molecules in CD34+cells was significantly induced in the polytrauma patients. In addition, we show that the CD34+ cell levels in severely injured patients were not correlated with clinical parameters, such as the ISS score, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (APACHE II), as well as the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA-2). Our results clearly indicate that pro-angiogenic cells are systemically mobilized after polytrauma and that their numbers are sufficient for the development of novel therapeutic models in regenerative medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2017010885,"Physiological trade-offs mediated by limiting energy, resources or time constrain the simultaneous expression of major functions and can lead to the evolution of temporal separation between demanding activities. In birds, plumage renewal is a demanding activity, which accomplishes fundamental functions, such as allowing thermal insulation, aerodynamics and socio-sexual signaling. Feather renewal is a very expensive and disabling process, and molt is often partitioned from breeding and migration. However, trade-offs between feather renewal and breeding have been only sparsely studied. In barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) breeding in Italy and undergoing molt during wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, we studied this trade-off by removing a tail feather from a large sample of individuals and analyzing growth bar width, reflecting feather growth rate, and length of the growing replacement feather in relation to the stage in the breeding cycle at removal and clutch size. Growth bar width of females and length of the growing replacement feather of both sexes were smaller when the original feather had been removed after clutch initiation. Importantly, in females both growth bar width and replacement feather length were negatively predicted by clutch size, and more strongly so for large clutches and when feather removal occurred immediately after clutch completion. Hence, we found strong, coherent evidence for a trade-off between reproduction, and laying effort in particular, and the ability to generate new feathers. These results support the hypothesis that the derived condition of molting during wintering in long-distance migrants is maintained by the costs of overlapping breeding and molt."

DVD687 enhances cell cycle progression while DVD688 induces apoptosis in N87 cells. Using a half DVD687, we found that avidity may play a key role in the agonist activity of DVD687 in N87 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964433194,"P13 is one of the major outer membrane proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi. Previous studies described P13 as a porin. In the present study some structure and function aspects of P13 were studied. P13 showed according to lipid bilayer studies a channel-forming activity of 0.6 nanosiemens in 1 m KCl. Single channel and selectivity measurements demonstrated that P13 had no preference for either cations or anions and showed no voltage-gating up to ±100 mV. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to isolate and characterize the P13 protein complex in its native state. The complex had a high molecular mass of about 300 kDa and was only composed of P13 monomers. The channel size was investigated using non-electrolytes revealing an apparent diameter of about 1.4 nm with a 400-Da molecular mass cut-off. Multichannel titrations with different substrates reinforced the idea that P13 forms a general diffusion channel. The identity of P13 within the complex was confirmed by second dimension SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, mass spectrometry, and the use of a p13 deletion mutant strain. The results suggested that P13 is the protein responsible for the 0.6-nanosiemens pore-forming activity in the outer membrane of B. burgdorferi."

Here, eleven participants were asked to count down numbers and remember negative or positive autobiographical episodes of their personal lives, for 32 seconds at a time, during which they could freely engage in the execution of those tasks. We then examined the possibility of determining from a single whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging scan which one of the two mental tasks each participant was performing at a given point in time. Linear support-vector machines were used to build within-participant classifiers and across-participants classifiers. The within-participant classifiers could correctly discriminate scans with an average accuracy as high as 82%, when using data from all individual voxels in the brain. These results demonstrate that it is possible to accurately classify self-driven mental tasks from whole-brain activity patterns recorded in a time interval as short as 2 seconds."
https://openalex.org/W1993377729,"Alpha-dystroglycan requires a rare O-mannose glycan modification to form its binding epitope for extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. This functional glycan is disrupted in a cohort of muscular dystrophies, the secondary dystroglycanopathies, and is abnormal in some metastatic cancers. The most commonly used reagent for detection of alpha-dystroglycan is mouse monoclonal antibody IIH6, but it requires the functional O-mannose structure for recognition. Therefore, the ability to detect alpha-dystroglycan protein in disease states where it lacks the full O-mannose glycan has been limited. To overcome this hurdle, rabbit monoclonal antibodies against the alpha-dystroglycan C-terminus were generated. The new antibodies, named 5-2, 29-5, and 45-3, detect alpha-dystroglycan from mouse, rat and pig skeletal muscle by Western blot and immunofluorescence. In a mouse model of fukutin-deficient dystroglycanopathy, all antibodies detected low molecular weight alpha-dystroglycan in disease samples demonstrating a loss of functional glycosylation. Alternately, in a porcine model of Becker muscular dystrophy, relative abundance of alpha-dystroglycan was decreased, consistent with a reduction in expression of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in affected muscle. Therefore, these new rabbit monoclonal antibodies are suitable reagents for alpha-dystroglycan core protein detection and will enhance dystroglycan-related studies."
https://openalex.org/W2129203731,"Background Crassostrea gigas accumulates diarrheic shellfish toxins (DSP) associated to Prorocentrum lima of which Okadaic acid (OA) causes specific inhibitions of serine and threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A. Its toxic effects have been extensively reported in bivalve mollusks at cellular and physiological levels, but genomic approaches have been scarcely studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Acute and sub-chronic exposure effects of P. lima were investigated on farmed juvenile C. gigas (3–5 mm). The Pacific oysters were fed with three dinoflagellate concentrations: 0.3, 3, and 30×103 cells mL−1 along with a nontoxic control diet of Isochrysis galbana. The effects of P. lima on C. gigas were followed by analyzing expression levels of a total of four genes, three involved in cell cycle regulation and one in immune response by polymerase chain reaction and real time quantitative PCR, where changes in time and cell concentration were found. The highest expression levels were found in oysters fed 3×103 cells mL−1 at 168 h for the cycle regulator p21 protein (9 fold), chromatin assembly factor 1 p55 subunit (8 fold), elongation factor 2 (2 fold), and lipopolysaccharide/β-1, 3 glucan binding protein (13 fold above base line). Additionally, the transcript level of all the genes decreased in oysters fed wich the mixed diet 30×103 cells mL−1 of dinoflagellate after 72 h and was lowest in the chromatin assembly factor 1 p55 subunit (0.9 fold below baseline). Conclusions On C. gigas the whole cell ingestion of P lima caused a clear mRNA modulation expression of the genes involved in cell cycle regulation and immune system. Over-expression could be related to DNA damage, disturbances in cell cycle continuity, probably a genotoxic effect, as well as an activation of its innate immune system as first line of defense."

The EphA2 SAM domain has three tyrosines, Tyr921, Tyr930, and Tyr960, of which Tyr921 is absolutely conserved in Eph and many other SAM domains (Fig. 1). By contrast to most receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, which occur in relatively unstructured protein domain linker regions or loops (23Lee H.J. Hota P.K. Chugha P. Guo H. Miao H.

The tertiary structure may thus provide an additional level of regulation. Biological studies showing the phosphorylation of all of the three tyrosines have already been reported; Tyr921 and Tyr960 were found to be phosphorylated when an EphA2 kinase-SAM domain construct is expressed in Escherichia coli (12Davis S.

Similarly, phosphatase LAR was shown to dephosphorylate Tyr930 (and possibly other tyrosines), an event that appears to abrogate binding to the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Nck2 and attenuates cell migration (Y930F had the same effect on cell migration) (26Lee H.

There is no biological information on the role of Tyr921 phosphorylation in EphA2 (although binding to the SH2 domain of Vav3 has been proposed (17Fang W.B. Brantley-Sieders D.M. Hwang Y. Ham A.J.

However, in vivo studies have also shown that the conserved SAM domain tyrosine (Tyr921 in EphA2) is responsible for recruiting SH2 domains of Grb7 and Grb10 to EphB1, and this interaction is deemed essential for the regulation of cell migration (15Kalo M.S.

The extent of phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of proteins in cells is typically not easy to ascertain or to manipulate in a site-specific manner. Thus, the experiments reported above rely on the expression of proteins in which a single tyrosine has been mutated to phenylalanine (a side chain that mimics the unmodified residue and cannot be phosphorylated). Although these biological findings suggest the importance of particular sites for the interactions, this strategy can deliver false negatives, because an interaction may still persist upon mutating a single site if interactions with several phosphorylated tyrosines are possible. Similarly, it may be noted that the previous reports were not accompanied by a molecular level framework, which involves consideration of protein conformational changes and competing binding processes. Biophysical studies in vitro, as reported here, can provide deeper insight and propose models for investigation at the cellular level. Specifically, the EphA2 SAM domain forms a heterodimer with the SAM domain of SH2 domain-containing inositol-5′-phosphatase (SHIP2) (23Lee H.J. Hota P.K. Chugha P. Guo H. Miao H. Zhang L. Kim S.J.

Binding of EphA2 SAM to SHIP2 SAM inhibits receptor endocytosis and enhances activation of Eph kinase (31Zhuang G. Hunter S. Hwang Y. Chen J.

In vivo studies have also shown (using Tyr to Phe mutations in the EphA2 SAM domain) that tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for SHIP2 recruitment (31Zhuang G. Hunter S. Hwang Y. Chen J.

Here we studied directly whether the phosphorylation adds another level of complexity to the regulation of Eph receptors by controlling SAM domain-mediated interactions. Using synthetic domains, we studied the effect of phosphorylation of the EphA2 SAM domain on its structure and interactions with SHIP2 SAM. Further, stimulated by reports on EphB1 recruiting the SH2 domain of Grb7 (15Kalo M.S. Yu H.H. Pasquale E.B.

Unexpectedly, we show that phosphorylation of the tyrosines of the EphA2 SAM domain has little effect on the overall structure of the domain. EphA2 SAM phosphorylated at Tyr930 could simultaneously engage the Grb7 SH2 and SHIP2 SAM domains. In contrast, Tyr921 is located near the SHIP2 binding region, and Grb7 SH2 and SHIP2 SAM compete for binding. Surprisingly, EphA2 SAM phosphorylated at Tyr960 does not interact with Grb7 SH2 but also has no effect on SHIP2 SAM binding. We discuss how this phosphorylation-dependent specificity could give rise to different signaling platforms, regulating the function of EphA2 receptors. cDNA for human Grb7 was a gift from Prof. Jun-Lin Guan (University of Michigan). Residues 425–532, corresponding to the SH2 domain, were amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned into a pET30 Xa/LIC vector using ligation-independent cloning (EMD Biosciences). The plasmid containing Grb7 SH2 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and grown at 310 K in either Luria-Bertini (LB) medium or M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8 for both media and then induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were harvested after 24 h of induction at 289 K. Purification of the Grb7 SH2 domain was carried out using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. In brief, the harvested cells were resuspended in lysis/binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 1 mm TCEP-HCl) supplemented with EDTA-free CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). Following washing with binding buffer containing 45 mm imidazole, the bound protein was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 250 mm imidazole and 1 mm TCEP-HCl. The eluted protein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into the NMR buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP-HCl). The EphA2 and SHIP2 SAM domain constructs and their expression and purification have been described previously (20Lackmann M. Oates A.C. Dottori M. Smith F.M. Do C. Power M. Kravets L. Boyd A.W. Distinct subdomains of the EphA3 receptor mediate ligand binding and receptor dimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20228-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The EphA2 and SHIP2 SAM proteins were also exchanged into the same NMR buffer. Phosphorylated peptides corresponding to residues 910SEWLESIKMQQpYTEHFMAAGFT931 (denoted pep.pY921),916WKMQQFTEHFMAAGpYTAIEVVQ937 (pep.pY931), and 951LPGHQKRIApYSLLGLKDQVNTV972 (pep.pY960) as well as the equivalent unphosphorylated peptides were purchased from GenScript. The peptides were dissolved into the NMR buffer without further purification. Three domain-length EphA2 SAM peptides (residues 901–976) were synthesized (United Peptide, Inc.), also referred to as simply EphA2 below (experiments were carried out only with the SAM domains in this paper). Each domain peptide has phosphorylated side chains at Tyr921 (EphA2.pY921), Tyr930 (EphA2.pY930), or Tyr960 (EphA2.pY960). These full-length phosphorylated peptides initially had poor solubility in water and were refolded by incubation in 8 m urea (20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP-HCl) overnight and then were dialyzed extensively against the NMR buffer. Peptide and protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance with reference to predicted extinction coefficients. The secondary structure and the thermal stability of the phosphorylated domains were examined by CD spectroscopy using established protocols (32Kelly S.M. Price N.C. The use of circular dichroism in the investigation of protein structure and function.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded on a 20 μm sample using a cuvette with a path length of 4 mm on an Aviv (model 215) instrument. The temperature scans were carried out in the range of 293–363 K, at 222 nm, with a step size of 2 K and a 30-s equilibration period and a 30-s recording time. All of the experiments were carried out in triplicate, and signal from the buffer was subtracted. All experiments were run at 298 K on an 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI probe (Bruker Avance). One-dimensional 1H NMR (using WATERGATE) and homonuclear two-dimensional 1H NOESY experiments (mixing time of 300 ms) were recorded with 300 μm samples of the SAM domains. 15N-1H HSQC experiments on Grb7 SH2 were recorded on the 15N-labeled protein itself or on a 1:1 mixture with unlabeled EphA2 domains or after the further addition of 2 molar eq of unlabeled SHIP2 SAM. The data were processed using nmrPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. Nmrpipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on Unix pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11526) Google Scholar), and the two-dimensional spectra were visualized using Sparky (Goddard TD, Kneller DG, SPARKY3, University of California, San Francisco). The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were plotted using the software Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Interaction of the short (unphosphorylated and phosphorylated) peptides with Grb7 SH2 and of the domain-length phosphorylated and refolded EphA2 peptides with Grb7 SH2 and/or the SHIP2 SAM domain was measured by ITC (MicroCal iTC200, GE Healthcare) with established protocols. Typically a 40 μm concentration of the EphA2 protein was used in the chamber, and a 400 μm concentration of the SHIP2 SAM domain was used in the syringe for titration. ITC experiments with Grb7 SH2 were performed using Grb7 SH2 in the chamber and titrating in the corresponding binding partner. The data were analyzed using Origin (OriginLab). The solvent-accessible surface area for the tyrosine residues of EphA2 was calculated using the algorithm SURFACE of the CCP4 suite (34Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). The complex structure of EphA2 SAM-SHIP2 SAM (Protein Data Bank entry 2KSO) was used, and calculations were set up with a probe of 1.4-Å radius. Biophysical studies demand large quantities of pure proteins. It is difficult to obtain proteins that are fully phosphorylated at one specific site by exposure to kinases in vitro. Here, we obtained SAM domain polypeptides that have specific sites fully and stably phosphorylated during their chemical synthesis (United Peptides Inc.). Initial NMR experiments with the synthesized domains dissolved in buffer showed that these proteins are not properly folded (data not shown). We carried out a chemical denaturation, followed by a refolding step to correctly fold the domains. In order to confirm that a nearly native SAM domain structure is obtained, we analyzed the conformations of the refolded proteins by both one-dimensional 1H NMR (Fig. 2) and homonuclear two-dimensional 1H NOESY experiments (Fig. 3). The NMR spectra show that all three specifically phosphorylated SAM domains (referred to as EphA2.pY921, EphA2.pY930, and EphA2.pY960) are well folded, as is evident from the dispersed amide signals, resonances for the tryptophan side chains, and up-field shifted methyl signals (highlighted with boxes in Fig. 2). The spectra show that the peptides adopt a structure very similar to that of the recombinant protein. Subtle differences are apparent in EphA2.pY921 and EphA2.pY930, the two tyrosines that are partially buried in the wild type protein (with 17.6 and 32.9% solvent exposure calculated for Tyr921 and Tyr930, respectively) and probably have become more exposed upon phosphorylation. In addition, we characterized the secondary structure of the phosphorylated proteins by far-UV CD spectroscopy and found that they share within ±15% an α-helical content similar to that of the recombinant EphA2 SAM domain. We also assessed the thermal stabilities of the phosphorylated proteins and of the recombinant EphA2 SAM by measuring the signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature; phosphorylation at any one of its three tyrosines does not dramatically destabilize the SAM domain fold (Fig. 4 and Table 1).FIGURE 3The phosphorylation of EphA2 SAM domains is not accompanied by large conformational changes. Shown are two-dimensional homonuclear 1H NOESY spectra of unphosphorylated EphA2 SAM (A), EphA2.pY921 (B), EphA2.pY930 (C), and EphA2.pY960 (D); the phosphorylated domains adopt nearly native-like global folds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Phosphorylated SAM domains share similar secondary structure with the recombinant EphA2 SAM domain and are thermally stable.

The phosphorylated EphA2 SAM domains (phosphorylated at Tyr921, Tyr930, or Tyr960) bind SHIP2 SAM with an affinity that is comparable with that of the recombinant unphosphorylated protein (representative ITC interaction data are shown in Fig. 5). We report the dissociation constants (KD) and the derived thermodynamic contributions of the individual interactions in Table 2. The change in binding enthalpy is slightly more favorable for the phosphorylated proteins compared with the unphosphorylated protein, but the binding entropy is lower. It is likely that the change in enthalpy for this process is a systematic effect because the synthetic proteins have shorter termini, compared with the recombinant protein. Thus, remarkably, the binding of EphA2 to SHIP2 SAM is essentially insensitive to tyrosine phosphorylation. We, therefore, decided to study the interaction of the phosphorylated domains with Tyr(P)-binding proteins.TABLE 2Thermodynamics of binding of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated EphA2 SAM domains and peptides to SHIP2 SAM and Grb7 SH2Protein in ITC cellTitrantKDΔHTΔSΔGCommentμmkcal/molkcal/mol/degkcal/molEphA2.pY921SHIP24.1 ± 0.5−4.92.5−7.4EphA2.pY930SHIP23.4 ± 0.4−5.12.4−7.5EphA2.pY960SHIP23.9 ± 0.2−4.72.7−7.4Recombinant EphA2SHIP25.2 ± 0.3−2.54.7−7.2Grb7 SH2SHIP23.5 ± 0.1−1.9518.4−7.3Grb7 SH2EphA2.pY9212.6 ± 0.7−8.0−0.3−7.7Grb7 SH2EphA2.pY9308.6 ± 4.3−2.54.4−6.9Grb7 SH2EphA2.pY960No interactio"
https://openalex.org/W2032354699,"Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were established as promising cell sources for revolutionary regenerative therapies. The initial culture system used for iPSC generation needed fetal calf serum in the culture medium and mouse embryonic fibroblast as a feeder layer, both of which could possibly transfer unknown exogenous antigens and pathogens into the iPSC population. Therefore, the development of culture systems designed to minimize such potential risks has become increasingly vital for future applications of iPSCs for clinical use. On another front, although donor cell types for generating iPSCs are wide-ranging, T cells have attracted attention as unique cell sources for iPSCs generation because T cell-derived iPSCs (TiPSCs) have a unique monoclonal T cell receptor genomic rearrangement that enables their differentiation into antigen-specific T cells, which can be applied to novel immunotherapies. In the present study, we generated transgene-free human TiPSCs using a combination of activated human T cells and Sendai virus under defined culture conditions. These TiPSCs expressed pluripotent markers by quantitative PCR and immunostaining, had a normal karyotype, and were capable of differentiating into cells from all three germ layers. This method of TiPSCs generation is more suitable for the therapeutic application of iPSC technology because it lowers the risks associated with the presence of undefined, animal-derived feeder cells and serum. Therefore this work will lead to establishment of safer iPSCs and extended clinical application."

We attempted to examine the effects of particles emitted from a diesel engine burning either diesel (diesel exhaust particles, DEP) or diesel doped with various concentrations of CeO2 (DEP-Env) on innate immune responses in THP-1 and primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Batches of DEP and DEP-Env were obtained on three separate occasions using identical collection and extraction protocols with the aim of determining the reproducibility of particles generated at different times. However, we observed significant differences in size and surface charge (zeta potential) of the DEP and DEP-Env across the three batches. We also observed that exposure of THP-1 cells and PBMC to identical concentrations of DEP and DEP-Env from the three batches resulted in statistically significant differences in bioreactivity as determined by IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-12p40 mRNA (by qRT-PCR) and protein expression (by ELISPOT assays). Importantly, bioreactivity was noted in very tight ranges of DEP size (60 to 120 nm) and zeta potential (-37 to -41 mV). Thus, these physical properties of DEP and DEP-Env were found to be the primary determinants of the bioreactivity measured in this study. Our findings also point to the potential risk of over- or under- estimation of expected bioreactivity effects (and by inference of public health risks) from bulk DEP use without taking into account potential batch-to-batch variations in physical (and possibly chemical) properties."
https://openalex.org/W2049681599,"Chronic exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs) may induce β cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes. However, the precise mechanism by which FFAs trigger β cell apoptosis is still unclear. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) is a pseudokinase inhibiting Akt, a key mediator of insulin signaling, and contributes to insulin resistance in insulin target tissues. This paper outlined the role of TRB3 in FFAs-induced INS-1 β cell apoptosis. TRB3 was promptly induced in INS-1 cells after stimulation by FFAs, and this was accompanied by enhanced INS-1 cell apoptosis. The overexpression of TRB3 led to exacerbated apoptosis triggered by FFAs in INS-1-derived cell line and the subrenal capsular transplantation animal model. In contrast, cell apoptosis induced by FFAs was attenuated when TRB3 was knocked down. Moreover, we observed that activation and nuclear accumulation of protein kinase C (PKC) δ was enhanced by upregulation of TRB3. Preventing PKCδ nuclear translocation and PKCδ selective antagonist both significantly lessened the pro-apoptotic effect. These findings suggest that TRB3 was involved in lipoapoptosis of INS-1 β cell, and thus could be an attractive pharmacological target in the prevention and treatment of T2DM."

This study is the first to examine an existing stress-model from the general population, in patients diagnosed with adjustment disorders, using a longitudinal design. Methods The study sample consisted of 108 patients consecutively admitted for adjustment disorders. Associations of stress perception, emotional distress, resources, and mental health were measured at three time points: the outpatients’ presentation, admission for inpatient treatment, and discharge from the hospital. To evaluate a longitudinal stress model of ADs, we examined whether stress at admission predicted mental health at each of the three time points using multiple linear regressions and structural equation modeling. A series of repeated-measures one-way analyses of variance (rANOVAs) was performed to assess change over time. Results Significant within-participant changes from baseline were observed between hospital admission and discharge with regard to mental health, stress perception, and emotional distress (p<0.001). Stress perception explained nearly half of the total variance (44%) of mental health at baseline; the adjusted R2 increased (0.48), taking emotional distress (i.e., depressive symptoms) into account. The best predictor of mental health at discharge was the level of emotional distress (i.e., anxiety level) at baseline (β = −0.23, R2corr = 0.56, p<0.001). With a CFI of 0.86 and an NFI of 0.86, the fit indices did not allow for acceptance of the stress-model (Cmin/df = 15.26; RMSEA = 0.21). Conclusions Stress perception is an important predictor in adjustment disorders, and mental health-related treatment goals are dependent on and significantly impacted by stress perception and emotional distress."

CRF was recorded as V02 max from a maximal treadmill test with the Bruce protocol.Subjects (mean±SD) were aged 37±11 years, with BMI = 26.5±5.1 kg.m⁻², HbA1c = 7.7±1.3% (61±14 mmol/mol) and V02 max (ml.min⁻¹.kg⁻¹) = 39.9±8.4 (range 22.4-58.6). TEE (36.3±5.5 kcal.kg⁻¹.day⁻¹) was strongly associated with CRF(39.9±8.4 ml.min⁻¹.kg⁻¹) independently of sex (r = 0.63, p<0.01). However, neither TEE (r = -0.20, p = 0.36) nor CRF (r = -0.20, p = 0.39; adjusted for sex), were significantly associated with mean glycaemia measured by CGMS.Higher levels of energy expenditure (due to a more active lifestyle) are associated with increased cardiorespiratory fitness, but not necessarily better glycaemic control. Since increased levels of energy expenditure and good glycaemic control are both needed to protect against diabetes-related complications our data suggest they need to be achieved independently."
https://openalex.org/W2145998020,"Growing evidence indicates a moderate but significant relationship between processing speed in visuo-cognitive tasks and general intelligence. On the other hand, findings from neuroscience proposed that the primate visual system consists of two major pathways, the ventral pathway for objects recognition and the dorsal pathway for spatial processing and attentive analysis. Previous studies seeking for visuo-cognitive factors of human intelligence indicated a significant correlation between fluid intelligence and the inspection time (IT), an index for a speed of object recognition performed in the ventral pathway. We thus presently examined a possibility that neural processing speed in the dorsal pathway also represented a factor of intelligence. Specifically, we used the mental rotation (MR) task, a popular psychometric measure for mental speed of spatial processing in the dorsal pathway. We found that the speed of MR was significantly correlated with intelligence scores, while it had no correlation with one’s IT (recognition speed of visual objects). Our results support the new possibility that intelligence could be explained by two types of mental speed, one related to object recognition (IT) and another for manipulation of mental images (MR)."
https://openalex.org/W2012756483,"For animals in confinement housing the housing structure has tremendous potential to impact well being. Dogs in animal shelters are often housed in one of two types of confinement housing – single kennels and rooms or double compartment kennels and rooms most often separated by a guillotine door. This study examines the effect of housing on the location of elimination behavior in dogs housed in double compartment kennels were the majority of the dogs were walked daily. One side of the kennel contained the food, water and bed and the other side was empty and available except during cleaning time. Location of urination and defecation was observed daily for 579 dogs housed in indoor double compartment kennels for a total of 4440 days of observation. There were 1856 days (41.9%) when no elimination was noted in the kennel. Feces, urine or both were observed in the kennel on 2584 days (58.1%). When elimination occurred in the kennel the probability of fecal elimination on the opposite side of the bed/food/water was 72.5% (95% CI 69.05% to 75.69%). The probability of urination on the opposite side of the bed/food/water was 77.4% (95% CI 74.33% to 80.07%). This study demonstrates the strong preference of dogs to eliminate away from the area where they eat, drink and sleep. Double compartment housing not only allows this – it allows staff the ability to provide safe, efficient, humane daily care and confers the added benefits of reducing risks for disease transmission for the individual dog as well as the population."

The importance of virulence factors for the survival and colonization of S. pyogenes is well established, and many of these factors are exposed to the extracellular environment, enabling bacterial interactions with the host. In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed and compared S. pyogenes proteins in the growth medium of a strain that is virulent to mice with a non-virulent strain. Particularly, one of these proteins was present at significantly higher levels in stationary growth medium from the virulent strain. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the protein that showed a unique tetrameric organization composed of four helix-loop-helix motifs. Affinity pull-down mass spectrometry analysis in human plasma demonstrated that the protein interacts with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), and the name sHIP (streptococcal histidine-rich glycoprotein-interacting protein) is therefore proposed. HRG has antibacterial activity, and when challenged by HRG, sHIP was found to rescue S. pyogenes bacteria. This and the finding that patients with invasive S. pyogenes infection respond with antibody production against sHIP suggest a role for the protein in S. pyogenes pathogenesis.

Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A streptococci, or GAS, is an important human pathogen colonizing the skin and the upper respiratory tract, where it causes relatively mild clinical conditions (erysipelas, impetigo, and pharyngitis). In addition, invasive infections can produce severe and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. S. pyogenes is also associated with the postinfection sequelae of acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. Worldwide, S. pyogenes causes an estimated 700 million cases of mild and non-invasive infections each year, of which ∼650,000 progress to severe invasive infections with an associated mortality of ∼25% (1Carapetis J.R.

Immunol. 2013; 368: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). These numbers show that S. pyogenes is one of the most significant bacterial pathogens in the human population. To cause invasive infection, S. pyogenes requires virulence factors to interact with host tissues and evade the innate and adaptive immune responses of the host. These virulence factors are predominantly secreted or surface-associated proteins, and some of the most studied include the family of M proteins (3Lancefield R.C.

Despite the fact that several virulence factors have been characterized, there are still many uncharacterized and/or unknown bacterial proteins exposed to the extracellular environment. This suggests that there could be additional proteins interacting with the human host with an impact on the pathology of S. pyogenes. S. pyogenes is a strict human pathogen, but there are rare isolates that cause invasive infections in mice. One of these is the AP1 strain (21Björck L. Akesson P. Bohus M. Trojnar J. Abrahamson M. Olafsson I. Grubb A. Bacterial growth blocked by a synthetic peptide based on the structure of a human proteinase inhibitor.Nature. 1989; 337: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) of the M1 serotype, a serotype that has dominated in cases of severe invasive infections since the 1980s.

In this study, we performed a mass spectrometry (MS) screen in order to compare the presence of so far unknown proteins in the growth medium from highly virulent AP1 bacteria with the medium from the SF370 strain. In particular, one protein (UniProtKB ID Q99XU0) was found at significantly higher levels in the extracellular pool of the AP1 strain. We have performed thorough functional and structural characterization of this protein, including the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure.

Therefore, the name sHIP (streptococcal histidine-rich glycoprotein-interacting protein) was introduced. The antibacterial activity of HRG was blocked by sHIP, a mechanism that could contribute to the virulence of AP1 bacteria. This notion was further supported by the observation that patients with severe invasive S. pyogenes infections, in contrast to patients with uncomplicated superficial infections, develop elevated antibody titers against sHIP. affinity pull-down mass spectrometry histidine-rich glycoprotein HRG short peptide HRG long peptide streptococcal histidine-rich glycoprotein-interacting protein selected reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry Todd-Hewitt tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane isothermal titration calorimetry surface plasmon resonance. S. pyogenes M1 strain AP1 (strain 40/58 from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Streptococci, Prague, Czech Republic) was grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in protein-reduced Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth (25Lei B. Mackie S. Lukomski S. Musser J.M. Identification and immunogenicity of group A Streptococcus culture supernatant proteins.Infect.

The optical density at 620 nm (A620 nm) of these cultures was measured, and the number of bacterial cells was quantified by plating serial dilutions of the cultures on TH agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and the colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were determined. The medium samples were concentrated to 350 μl by ultrafiltration (Millipore-Amicon ultracentrifugation filter units, 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off) prior to sample preparation for selected reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) analysis. The cell pellets were suspended in LC-H2O into a 1% bacterial suspension prior to cell homogenization in a cell disruptor (Mini-Beadbeater-96, Bio Spec) and subsequent sample preparation for SRM-MS analysis. Samples for SRM-MS were reduced, alkylated, digested with trypsin, and purified using C18 reverse phase spin columns as described (see “Affinity Pull-down and Sample Preparation for Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry”).

The SRM-MS measurements were performed as described previously (28Nordenfelt P. Waldemarson S. Linder A. Mörgelin M. Karlsson C. Malmström J. Björck L. Antibody orientation at bacterial surfaces is related to invasive infection.J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209: 2367-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protein G, a 17-kDa fragment containing the IgG-binding region, was purchased from GE Healthcare and radiolabeled with 125I using IODO-BEAD iodination reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. S. pyogenes AP1 bacteria were grown in protein-reduced TH broth to stationary phase, washed, and diluted to 2 × 109 cfu/ml in PBS. The rabbit antiserum against the recombinant protein sHIP was produced by BioGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany). A 200-μl bacterial solution was incubated with 10 μl of preimmune serum or anti-sHIP antiserum, diluted 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. The bacteria were then washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with 25 μl of 125I-labeled protein G for 30 min at room temperature. Following a washing step with PBST, bacteria-bound radioactivity was determined. The DNA sequence corresponding to residues Lys3–Met98 in the S. pyogenes protein sHIP (UniProtKB ID Q99XU0) was introduced into the expression vector pNIC-Bsa4 by ligation-independent cloning (29Aslanidis C. de Jong P.J. Ligation-independent cloning of PCR products (LIC-PCR).Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutant protein corresponding to the single site mutation C65S was constructed. The resulting expression constructs contained either a His tag (biophysics, structural studies, and antibody production) or a TAP tag (His-HA-StrepII tag, MS interactome studies) and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site at the N terminus. Escherichia coli cells were cultured in Terrific Broth medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside, and cell growth was continued for 18 h at 18 °C. Harvested bacterial pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm TCEP) complemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor and ruptured using a French press cell disruptor. Cell debris and membrane components were removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. sHIP was produced in four variants, two variants of the wild-type protein (His tag and TAP tag), the C65S mutant (His tag), and a selenomethionine-labeled wild-type variant (His tag) using minimal medium for cell growth. Purification of the proteins was performed in two steps using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on an ÄKTA express system (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C with the HiTrap chelating columns (30Gileadi O.

Subsequently, the proteins were purified using reverse phase chromatography on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped with a preparative C18 HPLC column (Gemini NX, Phenomenex). The proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile, flash-frozen, and lyophilized. Lyophilized proteins were dissolved in crystallization buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. For the proteins used in the biophysical and structural studies and for antibody production, the His tag was removed by treatment with tobacco etch virus protease followed by reverse phase chromatography purification, giving the following amino acid sequence: SMKQDQLIVEKMEQTYEAFSPKLANLIEALDAFKEHYEEYATLRNFYSSDEWFRLANQPWDDIPCGVLSEDLLFDMIGDHNQLLADILDLAPIMYKHM. HRG cDNA (UniProtKB ID P04196) was cloned into the strepII C-terminal vector pCEP4-CTStrepII using ligation-independent cloning (29Aslanidis C. de Jong P.J. Ligation-independent cloning of PCR products (LIC-PCR).Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into Mach1-T1 cells (Invitrogen), and 2.7 liters of overnight culture was prepared with the Nucleobond PC 10000 EF kit (Macherey-Nagel). The transfection was performed in human embryonic kidney EBNA cell lines (HEK293 6E) grown in serum-free Freestyle F17 medium (Invitrogen). One day prior to transfection, HEK293 6E cells were resuspended in fresh Freestyle F17 medium to a cell density of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Before transfection, cells were resuspended in 50 ml of fresh Freestyle F17 expression medium at a cell density of 20 × 106 cells/ml and incubated in an orbital shaker incubator at 37 °C, 70% humidity, 5% CO2, and 120 rpm until completion of the transfection. 5000 μg of of DNA (50 μg/ml final) and 10 ml of polyethyleneimine MAX (Polysciences) (100 μg/ml solution final) were directly added to the cell suspension. 1950 ml of Freestyle F17 medium was added to a final volume of 2 liters of cell suspension, 4 h post-transfection. TN1 (Invitrogen) additive was added to a final concentration of 0.5% 24 h post transfection. Five days post-transfection, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 6500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and concentrated using a SARTOFLOW System, with a Hydrosart 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off (3081443902E-SG, Sartorius) to a volume of 100 ml at 4 °C. The concentrated solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g and filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. The concentrated solution was injected into an IBA Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity column (IBA 2-1234-001) for purification of the Strep-tagged protein. The standard protocol and buffers recommended by IBA was used. The purity and monodispersity of the proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. For affinity pull-down, Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA) were equilibrated in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and charged with 20 μg of recombinant, TAP-tagged sHIP. Pooled normal human plasma from healthy donors (Innovative Research) (200 μl) was incubated with protein sHIP charged beads at 20 and 37 °C and 800 rpm for 1 h. The beads were washed with 4 ml of ice-cold PBS buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, and sHIP protein was eluted with bound proteins using 120 μl of 5 mm biotin. An equal amount of 8 m urea and 100 mm NH4HCO3 was added, and the cysteine bonds were reduced with 5 mm TCEP (37 °C 1 h) and alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide (22 °C 30 min). The sample was diluted with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate to a final urea concentration of 1.5 m, and trypsin was added for protein digestion (37 °C, 18 h). The peptides were purified with C18 reverse phase spin columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Microspin columns, Nest Group). Crystallization of sHIP was carried out using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. The best native and selenomethionine crystals were obtained from 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 m sodium malonate, and 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 7.5. Prior to plunge freezing, the crystals were soaked for ∼30 s in a drop of a reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. The crystals belonged to the space group P1211 and contained four monomers per asymmetric unit. Both native and derivative data sets were collected at BESSY (BL14-1) (Berlin, Germany). Data were indexed and integrated using XDS (31Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar) or iMOSFLM (32Battye T.G.

Open table in a new tab The lyophilized peptides were reconstituted (2% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid), and the MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Elite ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), using Xcalibur version 2.2, coupled to a Thermo Scientific nLCII nanoflow HPLC system. Solvents for LC separation of the digested samples were as follows. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (98%) and acetonitrile (2%), and solvent B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (98%) and water (2%). From a thermostat-controlled microautosampler, 2 μl of the tryptic peptide mixture (corresponding to 7% of the eluate) was automatically loaded onto a 15-cm fused silica analytical column (PicoFrit, New Objective) with an inner diameter of 75 μm packed with C18 reverse phase material, and the peptides were eluted from the analytical column with a 40-min gradient ranging from 5 to 35% solvent B followed by a 10-min gradient from 35 to 80% solvent B at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min. The analyses were performed in a data-dependent acquisition mode using a top 20 collision-induced dissociation type of method. Dynamic exclusion for selected ions was 30 s. No lock masses were used in the study. The spectra were searched using the search engines X! Tandem (version 2010.12.01.1) (41Craig R. Beavis R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2095449726,"The stochastic dilution hypothesis has been proposed to explain species coexistence in species-rich communities. The relative importance of the stochastic dilution effects with respect to other effects such as competition and habitat filtering required to be tested. In this study, using data from a 25-ha species-rich subtropical forest plot with a strong topographic structure at Badagongshan in central China, we analyzed overall species associations and fine-scale species interactions between 2,550 species pairs. The result showed that: (1) the proportion of segregation in overall species association analysis at 2 m neighborhood in this plot followed the prediction of the stochastic dilution hypothesis that segregations should decrease with species richness but that at 10 m neighborhood was higher than the prediction. (2) The proportion of no association type was lower than the expectation of stochastic dilution hypothesis. (3) Fine-scale species interaction analyses using Heterogeneous Poisson processes as null models revealed a high proportion (47%) of significant species effects. However, the assumption of separation of scale of this method was not fully met in this plot with a strong fine-scale topographic structure. We also found that for species within the same families, fine-scale positive species interactions occurred more frequently and negative ones occurred less frequently than expected by chance. These results suggested effects of environmental filtering other than species interaction in this forest. (4) We also found that arbor species showed a much higher proportion of significant fine-scale species interactions (66%) than shrub species (18%). We concluded that the stochastic dilution hypothesis only be partly supported and environmental filtering left discernible spatial signals in the spatial associations between species in this species-rich subtropical forest with a strong topographic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2091168885,"The mitotic kinase Aurora A (AurA) is regulated by a complex network of factors that includes co-activator binding, autophosphorylation, and dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylation of AurA by PP2A (human, Ser-51; Xenopus, Ser-53) destabilizes the protein, whereas mitotic dephosphorylation of its T-loop (human, Thr-288; Xenopus, Thr-295) by PP6 represses AurA activity. However, AurA(Thr-295) phosphorylation is restricted throughout the early embryonic cell cycle, not just during M-phase, and how Thr-295 is kept dephosphorylated during interphase and whether or not this mechanism impacts the cell cycle oscillator were unknown. Titration of okadaic acid (OA) or fostriecin into Xenopus early embryonic extract revealed that phosphatase activity other than PP1 continuously suppresses AurA(Thr-295) phosphorylation during the early embryonic cell cycle. Unexpectedly, we observed that inhibiting a phosphatase activity highly sensitive to OA caused an abnormal increase in AurA(Thr-295) phosphorylation late during interphase that corresponded with delayed cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activation. AurA(Thr-295) phosphorylation indeed influenced this timing, because AurA isoforms retaining an intact Thr-295 residue further delayed M-phase entry. Using mathematical modeling, we determined that one phosphatase would be insufficient to restrict AurA phosphorylation and regulate CDK1 activation, whereas a dual phosphatase topology best recapitulated our experimental observations. We propose that two phosphatases target Thr-295 of AurA to prevent premature AurA activation during interphase and that phosphorylated AurA(Thr-295) acts as a competitor substrate with a CDK1-activating phosphatase in late interphase. These results suggest a novel relationship between AurA and protein phosphatases during progression throughout the early embryonic cell cycle and shed new light on potential defects caused by AurA overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W1965069077,"Strain selection and strain improvement are the first, and arguably most important, steps in the industrial production of biological compounds by microorganisms. While traditional methods of mutagenesis and selection have been effective in improving production of compounds at a commercial scale, the genetic changes underpinning the altered phenotypes have remained largely unclear. We utilized high-throughput Illumina short read sequencing of a wild Penicillium chrysogenum strain in order to make whole genome comparisons to a sequenced improved strain (WIS 54-1255). We developed an assembly-free method of identifying chromosomal rearrangements and validated the in silico predictions with a PCR-based assay and Sanger sequencing. Despite many rounds of mutagen treatment and artificial selection, WIS 54-1255 differs from its wild progenitor at only one of the identified rearrangements. We suggest that natural variants predisposed for high penicillin production were instrumental in the success of WIS 54-1255 as an industrial strain. In addition to finding a previously published inversion in the penicillin biosynthesis cluster, we located several genes related to penicillin production associated with these rearrangements. By comparing the configuration of rearrangement events among several historically important strains known to be high penicillin producers to a collection of recently isolated wild strains, we suggest that wild strains with rearrangements similar to those in known high penicillin producers may be viable candidates for further improvement efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2016316871,"Infection with schistosomes invokes severe fibrotic granulomatous responses in the liver of the host. Schistosoma mansoni infection induces dramatic fluctuations in Th1 or Th2 cytokine responses systemically; Th1 reactions are provoked in the early phase, whilst Th2 responses become dominant after oviposition begins. In the liver, various unique immune cells distinct from those of conventional immune competent organs or tissues exist, resulting in a unique immunological environment. Recently, we demonstrated that S. mansoni infection induces unique CD4+ T cell populations exhibiting unconventional cytokine profiles in the liver of mice during the period between Th1- and Th2-phases, which we term the transition phase. They produce both IFN-γ and IL-4 or both IFN-γ and IL-13 simultaneously. Moreover, T cells secreting triple cytokines IFN-γ, IL-13 and IL-4 were also induced. We term these cells Multiple Cytokine Producing Hepatic T cells (MCPHT cells). During the transition phase, when MCPHT cells increase, IL-18 secretion was up-regulated in the liver and sera. In S. mansoni-infected IL-18-deficient mice, expansion of MCPHT cells was curtailed. Thus our data suggest that IL-18 produced during S. mansoni infection play a role in the expansion of MCPHT cells."
