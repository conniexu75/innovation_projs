https://openalex.org/W2952815301,"Exhausted CD8+ T (Tex) cells in chronic infections and cancer have limited effector function, high co-expression of inhibitory receptors and extensive transcriptional changes compared with effector (Teff) or memory (Tmem) CD8+ T cells. Tex cells are important clinical targets of checkpoint blockade and other immunotherapies. Epigenetically, Tex cells are a distinct immune subset, with a unique chromatin landscape compared with Teff and Tmem cells. However, the mechanisms that govern the transcriptional and epigenetic development of Tex cells remain unknown. Here we identify the HMG-box transcription factor TOX as a central regulator of Tex cells in mice. TOX is largely dispensable for the formation of Teff and Tmem cells, but it is critical for exhaustion: in the absence of TOX, Tex cells do not form. TOX is induced by calcineurin and NFAT2, and operates in a feed-forward loop in which it becomes calcineurin-independent and sustained in Tex cells. Robust expression of TOX therefore results in commitment to Tex cells by translating persistent stimulation into a distinct Tex cell transcriptional and epigenetic developmental program."
https://openalex.org/W2951598503,"Tumour-specific CD8 T cell dysfunction is a differentiation state that is distinct from the functional effector or memory T cell states1-6. Here we identify the nuclear factor TOX as a crucial regulator of the differentiation of tumour-specific T (TST) cells. We show that TOX is highly expressed in dysfunctional TST cells from tumours and in exhausted T cells during chronic viral infection. Expression of TOX is driven by chronic T cell receptor stimulation and NFAT activation. Ectopic expression of TOX in effector T cells in vitro induced a transcriptional program associated with T cell exhaustion. Conversely, deletion of Tox in TST cells in tumours abrogated the exhaustion program: Tox-deleted TST cells did not upregulate genes for inhibitory receptors (such as Pdcd1, Entpd1, Havcr2, Cd244 and Tigit), the chromatin of which remained largely inaccessible, and retained high expression of transcription factors such as TCF-1. Despite their normal, 'non-exhausted' immunophenotype, Tox-deleted TST cells remained dysfunctional, which suggests that the regulation of expression of inhibitory receptors is uncoupled from the loss of effector function. Notably, although Tox-deleted CD8 T cells differentiated normally to effector and memory states in response to acute infection, Tox-deleted TST cells failed to persist in tumours. We hypothesize that the TOX-induced exhaustion program serves to prevent the overstimulation of T cells and activation-induced cell death in settings of chronic antigen stimulation such as cancer."

Tightly controlled interactions between structural and immune cells are required to maintain lung homeostasis. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to chart the cellular landscape of upper and lower airways and lung parenchyma in healthy lungs, and lower airways in asthmatic lungs. We report location-dependent airway epithelial cell states and a novel subset of tissue-resident memory T cells. In the lower airways of patients with asthma, mucous cell hyperplasia is shown to stem from a novel mucous ciliated cell state, as well as goblet cell hyperplasia. We report the presence of pathogenic effector type 2 helper T cells (TH2) in asthmatic lungs and find evidence for type 2 cytokines in maintaining the altered epithelial cell states. Unbiased analysis of cell–cell interactions identifies a shift from airway structural cell communication in healthy lungs to a TH2-dominated interactome in asthmatic lungs. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals immune and stromal compartment remodeling, including the enrichment of unique populations of epithelial cells and CD4+ T cells, in asthmatic lungs"

https://openalex.org/W2949675525,"Asthma prevalence has increased in epidemic proportions with urbanization, but growing up on traditional farms offers protection even today1. The asthma-protective effect of farms appears to be associated with rich home dust microbiota2,3, which could be used to model a health-promoting indoor microbiome. Here we show by modeling differences in house dust microbiota composition between farm and non-farm homes of Finnish birth cohorts4 that in children who grow up in non-farm homes, asthma risk decreases as the similarity of their home bacterial microbiota composition to that of farm homes increases. The protective microbiota had a low abundance of Streptococcaceae relative to outdoor-associated bacterial taxa. The protective effect was independent of richness and total bacterial load and was associated with reduced proinflammatory cytokine responses against bacterial cell wall components ex vivo. We were able to reproduce these findings in a study among rural German children2 and showed that children living in German non-farm homes with an indoor microbiota more similar to Finnish farm homes have decreased asthma risk. The indoor dust microbiota composition appears to be a definable, reproducible predictor of asthma risk and a potential modifiable target for asthma prevention. Exposure to a farm-like house dust microbiome is associated with protection against asthma development in children living in urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W2951299640,"Neonates are protected from colonizing bacteria by antibodies secreted into maternal milk. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of neonatal preterm infants with high morbidity and mortality that is associated with intestinal inflammation driven by the microbiota1–3. The incidence of NEC is substantially lower in infants fed with maternal milk, although the mechanisms that underlie this benefit are not clear4–6. Here we show that maternal immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an important factor for protection against NEC. Analysis of IgA binding to fecal bacteria from preterm infants indicated that maternal milk was the predominant source of IgA in the first month of life and that a relative decrease in IgA-bound bacteria is associated with the development of NEC. Sequencing of IgA-bound and unbound bacteria revealed that before the onset of disease, NEC was associated with increasing domination by Enterobacteriaceae in the IgA-unbound fraction of the microbiota. Furthermore, we confirmed that IgA is critical for preventing NEC in a mouse model, in which pups that are reared by IgA-deficient mothers are susceptible to disease despite exposure to maternal milk. Our findings show that maternal IgA shapes the host–microbiota relationship of preterm neonates and that IgA in maternal milk is a critical and necessary factor for the prevention of NEC. Immunoglobulin A antibodies in maternal milk are required for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2951725337,"Background Multimorbidity–having two or more coexisting chronic conditions–is highly prevalent, costly, and disabling to older adults. Questions remain regarding chronic diseases accumulation over time and whether this differs by racial and ethnic background. Answering this knowledge gap, this study identifies differences in rates of chronic disease accumulation and multimorbidity development among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic study participants starting in middle-age and followed up to 16 years. Methods and findings We analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a biennial, ongoing, publicly-available, longitudinal nationally-representative study of middle-aged and older adults in the United States. We assessed the change in chronic disease burden among 8,872 non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic participants who were 51–55 years of age at their first interview any time during the study period (1998–2014) and all subsequent follow-up observations until 2014. Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more of seven somatic chronic diseases: arthritis, cancer, heart disease (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, or other heart problems), diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and stroke. We used negative binomial generalized estimating equation models to assess the trajectories of multimorbidity burden over time for non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic participants. In covariate-adjusted models non-Hispanic black respondents had initial chronic disease counts that were 28% higher than non-Hispanic white respondents (IRR 1.279, 95% CI 1.201, 1.361), while Hispanic respondents had initial chronic disease counts that were 15% lower than non-Hispanic white respondents (IRR 0.852, 95% CI 0.775, 0.938). Non-Hispanic black respondents had rates of chronic disease accumulation that were 1.1% slower than non-Hispanic whites (IRR 0.989, 95% CI 0.981, 0.998) and Hispanic respondents had rates of chronic disease accumulation that were 1.5% faster than non-Hispanic white respondents (IRR 1.015, 95% CI 1.002, 1.028). Using marginal effects commands, this translates to predicted values of chronic disease for white respondents who begin the study period with 0.98 chronic diseases and end with 2.8 chronic diseases; black respondents who begin the study period with 1.3 chronic diseases and end with 3.3 chronic diseases; and Hispanic respondents who begin the study period with 0.84 chronic diseases and end with 2.7 chronic diseases. Conclusions Middle-aged non-Hispanic black adults start at a higher level of chronic disease burden and develop multimorbidity at an earlier age, on average, than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Hispanics, on the other hand, accumulate chronic disease at a faster rate relative to non-Hispanic white adults. Our findings have important implications for improving primary and secondary chronic disease prevention efforts among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic Americans to stave off greater multimorbidity-related health impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2952409564,"Totipotency refers to the ability of a cell to generate all of the cell types of an organism. Unlike pluripotency, the establishment of totipotency is poorly understood. In mouse embryonic stem cells, Dux drives a small percentage of cells into a totipotent state by expressing 2-cell-embryo-specific transcripts. To understand how this transition takes place, we performed single-cell RNA-seq, which revealed a two-step transcriptional reprogramming process characterized by downregulation of pluripotent genes in the first step and upregulation of the 2-cell-embryo-specific elements in the second step. To identify factors controlling the transition, we performed a CRISPR–Cas9-mediated screen, which revealed Myc and Dnmt1 as two factors preventing the transition. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that Myc prevents downregulation of pluripotent genes in the first step, while Dnmt1 impedes 2-cell-embryo-specific gene activation in the second step. Collectively, the findings of our study reveal insights into the establishment and regulation of the totipotent state in mouse embryonic stem cells. Fu et al. report the transition of ESCs into a 2-cell-embyro-like state induced by Dux involves two steps and can be prevented by Myc and Dnmt1, which inhibit the downregulation of pluripotency genes and the activation of 2C+-upregulated elements."
https://openalex.org/W2953178162,"We studied whether medical conditions across 21 broad categories were predictable from social media content across approximately 20 million words written by 999 consenting patients. Facebook language significantly improved upon the prediction accuracy of demographic variables for 18 of the 21 disease categories; it was particularly effective at predicting diabetes and mental health conditions including anxiety, depression and psychoses. Social media data are a quantifiable link into the otherwise elusive daily lives of patients, providing an avenue for study and assessment of behavioral and environmental disease risk factors. Analogous to the genome, social media data linked to medical diagnoses can be banked with patients’ consent, and an encoding of social media language can be used as markers of disease risk, serve as a screening tool, and elucidate disease epidemiology. In what we believe to be the first report linking electronic medical record data with social media data from consenting patients, we identified that patients’ Facebook status updates can predict many health conditions, suggesting opportunities to use social media data to determine disease onset or exacerbation and to conduct social media-based health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2953306855,"The relationship between noncoding DNA sequence and gene expression is not well-understood. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of ∼500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced."
https://openalex.org/W2952599108,"Current tools and strategies are not sufficient to reliably address threats and outbreaks of arboviruses including Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Hence there is a growing public health challenge to identify the best new control tools to use against the vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we investigated Ae. aegypti sugar feeding strategies in Bamako, Mali, to determine if this species can be controlled effectively using attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSB).We determined the relative attraction of Ae. aegypti males and females to a variety of sugar sources including flowers, fruits, seedpods, and honeydew in the laboratory and using plant-baited traps in the field. Next, we observed the rhythm of blood feeding versus sugar feeding activity of Ae. aegypti in vegetation and in open areas. Finally, we studied the effectiveness of spraying vegetation with ATSB on Ae. aegypti in sugar rich (lush vegetation) and in sugar poor (sparse vegetation) urban environments.Male and female laboratory sugar feeding rates within 24 h, on 8 of 16 plants offered were over 80%. The survival rates of mosquitoes on several plant sources were nearly as long as that of controls maintained on sucrose solution. In the field, females were highly attracted to 11 of 20 sugar sources, and 8 of these were attractive to males. Peak periods of host attraction for blood-feeding and sugar feeding in open areas were nearly identical and occurred shortly after sunrise and around sunset. In shaded areas, the first sugar-seeking peak occurred between 11:30 and 12:30 while the second was from 16:30 to 17:30. In a 50-day field trial, ATSB significantly reduced mean numbers of landing / biting female Ae. aegypti in the two types of vegetation. At sugar poor sites, the mean pre-treatment catch of 20.51 females on day 14 was reduced 70-fold to 0.29 on day 50. At sugar rich sites, the mean pre-treatment catch of 32.46 females on day 14 was reduced 10-fold to a mean of 3.20 females on day 50.This is the first study to show how the vector Ae. aegypti depends on environmental resources of sugar for feeding and survival. The demonstration that Ae. aegypti populations rapidly collapsed after ATSB treatment, in both sugar rich and sugar poor environments, is strong evidence that Ae. aegypti is sugar-feeding frequently. Indeed, this study clearly demonstrates that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes depend on natural sugar resources, and a promising new method for vector control, ATSB, can be highly effective in the fight against Aedes-transmitted diseases."

Global deletion of the mRNA-binding protein insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2 or IMP2) in mice causes resistance to obesity and fatty liver induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), whereas liver-specific IMP2 overexpression results in steatosis. To better understand the role of IMP2 in hepatic triglyceride metabolism, here we crossed mice expressing albumin-Cre with mice bearing a floxed Imp2 gene to generate hepatocyte-specific IMP2 knockout (LIMP2 KO) mice. Unexpectedly, the livers of LIMP2 KO mice fed an HFD accumulated more triglyceride. Although hepatocyte-specific IMP2 deletion did not alter lipogenic gene expression, it substantially decreased the levels of the IMP2 client mRNAs encoding carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα). This decrease was associated with their more rapid turnover and accompanied by significantly diminished rates of palmitate oxidation by isolated hepatocytes and liver mitochondria. HFD-fed control and LIMP2 KO mice maintained a similar glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity up to 6 months; however, by 6 months, blood glucose and serum triglycerides in LIMP2 KO mice were modestly elevated but without evidence of liver damage. In conclusion, hepatocyte-specific IMP2 deficiency promotes modest diet-induced fatty liver by impairing fatty acid oxidation through increased degradation of the IMP2 client mRNAs PPARα and CPT1A. This finding indicates that the previously observed marked protection against fatty liver conferred by global IMP2 deficiency in mice is entirely due to their reduced adiposity.

It is unclear whether the steatosis accompanying hepatic IMP2 overexpression contributes to the pro-tumorigenic phenotype. The finding that IMP2 hepatic overexpression results in steatosis whereas global IMP2 deficiency is accompanied by a marked reduction in hepatic triglyceride suggested that IMP2 may favor liver triglyceride deposition. To examine the role of endogenous IMP2 in hepatocyte triglyceride balance, Imp2ff mice were crossed with mice expressing cre recombinase driven by the albumin promoter. Liver-specific Imp2ff knockout (LIMP2 KO) mice exhibit a marked loss of IMP2 expression in postnatal liver. When consuming a high-fat diet, LIMP2 KO mice unexpectedly exhibited increased hepatic triglyceride accumulation and, ultimately, elevated blood triglyceride levels. We demonstrate that this results from a reduction in hepatic fatty acid oxidation caused by more rapid turnover and decreased abundance of the IMP2 client mRNAs encoding the CPT1A and PPARα polypeptides. During mouse development, expression of IMP2 mRNA in the liver peaks around E12.5 and diminish sharply after birth (Fig. 1A); however, at E12.5, the liver is primarily a hematopoietic organ, and hepatoblasts are relatively few (22Zaret K.S.

Liver IMP2 polypeptide expression in WT and LIMP2 KO mice was examined by immunoblot at 2 months age; liver IMP2 protein was greatly reduced in homozygous LIMP2 KO mice (Fig. 1B). Additional immunoblot studies of LIMP2 KO with tissues from fat, muscle, and brain showed no significant difference in IMP2 protein level compared with control animals, confirming the tissue specificity of Cre expression (data not shown). Mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) from weaning. No significant differences in body weight or body composition of WT and LIMP2 KO mice were observed, either at weaning or after 30 weeks on normal chow or on the high-fat diet (Fig. S1). Although hepatic triglyceride content in WT and LIMP2 KO male mice at 10 weeks age is similar (Fig. S2A), by 30 weeks of age, the livers of LIMP2 KO male mice on the HFD contained ∼60% more triglyceride than control livers (Fig. 1C). In female mice, although a tendency toward higher triglyceride levels was observed in LIMP2 KO livers of mice on both normal chow (Fig. S2B) and the HFD (Fig. S2C), liver triglycerides were highly variable and not statistically significant. Thus, hepatocyte expression of IMP2 is protective against development of fatty liver in male mice, whereas the effect in females remains to be determined. Subsequent studies focused on male mice. To explore the mechanisms underlying increased lipid accumulation in the livers of male LIMP2 KO mice, we performed real-time PCR for mice fed a HFD at 30 weeks. The analysis revealed that albumin-Cre–mediated deletion of the Imp2 gene in the liver had no effect on the relative abundance of a cohort on mRNAs encoding elements important for lipogenesis (ACC1, ACC2, FAS, ACLY, SREBP1c, SREBP2, and ChREBP) and triglyceride synthesis (CD36, SCD1, GPAT, AGPAT, Lipin, DGAT, ApoB, and MTP), apart from a 62% reduction in PPARγ mRNA (Fig. 1D). By contrast, IMP2 deletion resulted in significant down-regulation of several mRNAs encoding elements critical for fatty acid oxidation: a 60% decrease in CPT1A mRNA, a 64% decrease in PPARα mRNA, a 50% decrease in FGF21 mRNA, and a nonsignificant 24% decrease in CPT2 mRNA (Fig. 1E). Western blots of the PPARα, PPARγ, and Cpt1A polypeptides confirmed the reduced abundance of these polypeptides, whereas CPT2 was unaltered (Fig. 1F). Altogether, these data suggest that IMP2 promotes lipid oxidation without affecting neutral lipid synthesis. The ability of primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 2A) and liver mitochondria (Fig. 2B), prepared from the livers of 6-week-old male LIMP2 KO and WT mice, to carry out oxidation of [1-14C]palmitate was determined. In hepatocytes, generation of 14CO2 and 14C-labeled acid-soluble metabolites (ASM) from [1-14C]palmitate by LIMP2 KO cells was 33% and 36% less than in WT hepatocytes, whereas essentially identical levels of 14CO2 and [14C]ASM were generated from LIMP2 KO and WT hepatocytes when they were pretreated briefly with the CPT-1 inhibitor etoximir (Fig. 2A). Thus, hepatocyte IMP2 deficiency reduces mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by intact cells. This was confirmed by an assay of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation by mitochondrial preparations isolated from livers of 6-week-old male LIMP2 KO and WT mice. Generation of 14CO2 by LIMP2 KO mitochondria was reduced by 15% (p < 0.002) and that of [14C]ASM by 18.8% (p = 0.05) compared with isolates from WT livers (Fig. 2B). IMP2 is an RNA-binding protein that can regulate the life cycle of client mRNAs through altered transport, stability, and translation. To identify IMP2 mRNA clients relevant to fat metabolism in the liver, immunoprecipitates (IPs) were prepared from extracts of hepatocytes isolated from 30-week-old mice using anti-IMP2 and nonimmune IgG; RNA extracted from the IPs was quantitated by RT-PCR. Compared with IPs obtained with nonimmune IgG, the IMP2 IP was substantially enriched in mRNAs encoding PPARα, PPARγ, CPT1A, FGF21, ACOT7, and SCD1, indicating that these are IMP2 clients, whereas CPT2 enrichment (1.46-fold), although statistically significant, was marginal (Fig. 2C). We next sought to understand whether IMP2 regulates the stability and/or translation of its client mRNAs in the lipid oxidation pathway. We used CRISPR to delete IMP2 from AML12 mouse hepatocytes (23Nagarajan S.R. Paul-Heng M. Krycer J.R. Fazakerley D.J. Sharland A.F. Hoy A.J. Lipid and glucose metabolism in hepatocyte cell lines and primary mouse hepatocytes: a comprehensive resource for in vitro studies of hepatic metabolism.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2019; 316 (30694691): E578-E58910.1152/ajpendo.00365.2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and compared these IMP2 CRISPR AML12 cells with GFP CRISPR control AML12 cells. Compared with CRISPR-GFP control AML12 cells, IMP2 CRISPR AML12 cells exhibit a 53% reduction in the abundance of CPT-1A mRNA (Fig. 3A), accompanied by a significantly shortened mRNA half-life (Fig. 3B, 2.78 h versus 1.52 h) and reduced mRNA polysomal abundance (Fig. 3C, 56% versus 39%). CRISPR deletion of IMP2 from AML12 cells also caused a substantial reduction in CPT-1A polypeptide abundance (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Thus, the 68% decrease in CPT-1A polypeptide abundance in the IMP2-deficient liver is probably in part due to reduced CPT-1A mRNA stability and reduced translational efficiency. The abundance of PPARα mRNA in IMP2 CRISPR AML12 cells was reduced by 78% (Fig. 3A) with a shortened t½ from 1.84 h to 0.65 h compared with that for PPARα mRNA in GFP CRISPR AML12 cells (Fig. 3B); PPARα mRNA polysomal abundance was not altered (Fig. 3C). Thus, IMP2 deficiency reduces PPARα mRNA stability but not translation. The decreased level of PPARα in IMP2 CRISPR cells may contribute an element of reduced Cpt1a transcription (24Napal L. Marrero P.F. Haro D. An intronic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-binding sequence mediates fatty acid induction of the human carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354 (16271724): 751-75910.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.097Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although CPT-2 mRNA is a candidate IMP2 client, CPT-2 polypeptide abundance in the liver is not altered by IMP2 deficiency in the liver (Fig. 1F, bottom panel) or in AML cells (Fig. 3A, bottom panel), nor were there differences in CPT2 mRNA abundance, t½, or polysomal abundance (Fig. 3, A–C) in IMP2 CRISPR AML12 cells. At 10 weeks of age, the levels of blood glucose, insulin, glucagon, leptin, cholesterol, FFA, and triglycerides of control and LIMP2 KO mice were similar (Table 1). In addition, the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of LIMP2 KO and WT mice did not differ at 12 and 30 weeks and 14 and 32 weeks of age, respectively (Fig. 4, A–E). However, at 30–32 weeks of age, LIMP2 KO mice displayed increased serum triglycerides (Table 1), and blood glucose, whether fed, fasting, or fast-refeeding, was slightly but significantly higher in LIMP2 KO mice (Fig. 4F). At this time, serum ALT and AST levels were not elevated in the LIMP2 KO mice (Table 1), nor was their liver histology (H&E stain, Fig. S3) visibly different from WT littermates.Table 1Some serum values in WT and LIMP2 KO miceGenotype8–10 weeks of age28–30 weeks of ageWTLIMP2 KOp valueWTLIMP2 KOp valueMales, 6 pairs, HFD, 6-h fast Blood glucose (mg/dl)127.6128.30.48218.4236.70.02 Serum insulin (ng/dl)0.430.410.525.14.90.56 Serum glucagon (pg/ml)0.010.010.650.060.050.26 Serum leptin (ng/ml)0.90.80.437.27.30.83 Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)86.488.20.11172.4210.40.06 Serum triglyceride(mg/dl)26.227.80.26120.4153.80.03 Serum FFA (mmol/I)0.20.20.821.21.10.68Males, 4 pairs, HFD, 6-h fast Alanine aminotransferase (normal = 10–190 units/liter)69.353.80.28 Aspartate aminotransferase (normal = 10–380 units/liter)119.394.40.28 Open table in a new tab The primary finding reported here is that elimination of the IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 2/IMP2 from adult mouse liver is accompanied by increased intrahepatic triglyceride deposition in mice fed a high-fat diet. This outcome was unexpected because transgenic overexpression of IMP2 in hepatocytes is accompanied by increased triglyceride deposition (11Tybl E. Shi F.D. Kessler S.M. Tierling S. Walter J.

We have no direct information concerning the mechanisms by which transgenic IMP2 overexpression causes hepatic steatosis; however, a plausible inference is that transgenic overexpression of IMP2 in hepatocytes modifies the abundance of client RNAs, including IGF2 mRNA (13Kessler S.M. Laggai S. Van Wonterg E. Gemperlein K. Müller R. Haybaeck J. Vandenbroucke R.E. Ogris M. Libert C. Kiemer A.K. Transient hepatic overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 induces free cholesterol and lipid droplet formation.Front. Physiol. 2016; 7 (27199763): 147PubMed Google Scholar) and perhaps including some mRNAs not recruited by the normally low levels of IMP2 in adult hepatocytes. Although the latter might be considered an “artifact” of IMP2 overexpression, the cohort of IMP2 RNA clients does vary in a tissue-specific manner, determined both by the abundance of IMP2 and of its candidate client RNAs. Regarding the protective effect of global IMP2 deficiency on liver triglyceride deposition in mice fed a HFD, the present results indicate strongly that this protection is entirely due to the lesser mass of white adipose tissue in Imp2-null mice and is probably offset slightly because of the diminished fatty acid oxidation of the IMP2-deficient liver. A caveat, however, is that we have not characterized lipid metabolism in hepatocytes derived from mice with germline Imp2 inactivation. It remains conceivable, therefore, that loss of IMP2 in endoderm or liver bud precursors might reprogram hepatocyte triglyceride metabolism in a manner distinct from that engendered by deletion using albumin-cre. Regarding the mechanism by which IMP2 deficiency in the adult liver causes increased triglyceride deposition, we show that the mRNAs encoding PPARα, PPARγ, CPT-1A, FGF21, and SCD1 are IMP2 clients, and elimination of IMP2 was accompanied by substantially reduced levels of PPARα, PPARγ, and CPT1A mRNAs because of a 2-fold or more increased rate of mRNA turnover; the corresponding polypeptide levels were comparably reduced. Notably, expression of the Cpt1A gene was strongly up-regulated by PPARα, so that the somewhat greater reduction of CPT-1A mRNA consequent to Imp2 inactivation may reflect the loss of PPARα-stimulated Cpt1A transcription as well (24Napal L. Marrero P.F. Haro D. An intronic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-binding sequence mediates fatty acid induction of the human carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354 (16271724): 751-75910.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.097Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Direct measurement of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation by intact hepatocytes and liver mitochondria demonstrated a modest reduction by those isolated from IMP2-deficient liver. In contrast, the mRNAs of all lipogenic genes examined (including SCD1) were unaltered in IMP2-deficient liver. This is somewhat surprising given the substantial drop in PPARγ in LIMP2 KO liver, which is generally considered to drive lipogenesis (25Schadinger S.E. Bucher N.L. Schreiber B.M. Farmer S.R. PPARγ2 regulates lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in steatotic hepatocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 288 (15644454): E1195-E120510.1152/ajpendo.00513.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In summary, IMP2 binds and stabilizes the mRNAs encoding the critical regulators of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, PPARα and CPT-1A; loss of IMP2 diminishes the abundance of those mRNAs, resulting in reduced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Over time, mice with hepatic IMP2 deficiency fed a high-fat diet show a modest, progressive accumulation of hepatic triglycerides beyond that of HFD-fed controls, ultimately reflected in elevated circulating triglycerides and mildly elevated blood glucose. Notably, however, evidence of liver damage is lacking, at least at 6 months age. The proclivity to increased hepatic triglyceride deposition caused by hepatocyte-selective IMP2 deficiency is entirely masked in mice with global IMP2 deficiency by their marked reduction in white adipose mass. For hepatocyte IMP2 deficiency to contribute to type 2 diabetes risk, the intronic SNPs in the human IMP2 gene associated with type 2 diabetes would have to cause a profound hepatocyte-selective decrease in IMP2 expression, an outcome that appears highly unlikely. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that the diabetogenic risk conferred by the intronic SNPs is attributable to a reduction of IMP2 abundance in β cells (26Greenwald W.W. Chiou J. Yan J. Qiu Y.

Elovl3 knockout, ELOVL3-ablated (E3hom) mice and their wild type littermates (E3wt) were studied side by side. E3hom mice had abnormal ocular phenotypes such as delayed eye opening, weeping eyes, crusty eyelids, eyelid edema, highly vascularized cornea and tarsal plates (TPs), slit eye, and increased tearing that resemble symptoms observed in human subjects with various forms of dry eye, MG dysfunction and blepharitis. Lipid profiling of E3hom TPs was conducted using chromatography and mass spectrometry. The analyses revealed that the lipid composition of E3hom TPs was strikingly different from that of their E3wt littermates. The mutation affected major classes of meibomian lipids - cholesteryl esters, wax esters, and cholesteryl esters of (O)-acylated w-hydroxy fatty acids. The studies illuminated the central role of ELOVL3 in producing C21:0-C29:0 fatty acids, including odd-chain and branched ones.

Understanding the range expansion of AIS is key for mitigating their impacts. Most approaches rely on Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict the expansion of AIS, using mainly environmental variables, yet ignore the role of human activities in favouring the introduction and range expansion of AIS. In this study, we use five SDM algorithms (independently and in ensemble) and two accuracy measures (TSS, AUC), combined with a null modelling approach, to assess the predictive performance of the models and to quantify which predictors (environmental and anthropogenic from the native and introduced regions) best explain the distribution of nine freshwater invasive species (including fish, arthropods, molluscs, amphibians and reptiles) in a large island (Great Britain), and which species characteristics affect model performance. Our results show that the distribution of invasive species is difficult to predict by SDMs, even in cases when TSS and AUC model accuracy values are high. Our study strongly advocates the use of null models for testing SDMs performance and the inclusion of information from the native area and a variety of both human-related and environmental predictors for a more accurate modelling of the range expansion of AIS. Otherwise, models that only include climatic variables, or rely only on standard accuracy measures or a single algorithm, might result in mismanagement of AIS."

The objective of this study was to determine the relative validity and reproducibility of a 157 item semi-quantitative FFQ among Lebanese adult population. Material and methods Dietary intake was assessed through dietary recalls, a FFQ with food items, and traditional recipes from the Mediterranean cuisine. Validity of the FFQ was measured by comparing the intake of calories, macro and micronutrients to the mean values derived from three dietary recalls (DR). Reproducibility of the FFQ was evaluated after repeating the same FFQ among the participant after a four-month period. Results 114 healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years of which 52.6% are men participated in this study. 53 of these adults participated in the reproducibility study. Intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two FFQ measurements ranged from 0.822 for sodium to 0.998 for energy indicating excellent reproducibility. The FFQ showed slightly higher intakes than the dietary recalls for most of the nutrients and foods reaching 2.1% for nutrients (polyunsaturated fatty acids) and 18% for food groups (olive oil). Correlation coefficients ranged between 0.783 (sodium) and 0.996 (carbs) for nutrients and between 0.906 (fish) and 1 (fruits and nuts) for food groups, with a significant p value (p = 0.038 for folate). Cross-classification of nutrients into quartiles showed that more than 81% of the participants were classified in the same quartile. Misclassifications were low for most nutrients with one to three persons misclassified at the extreme quartiles. Conclusion The FFQ used in this research contained western and Mediterranean type of dishes and foods. Statistical analysis showed good reproducibility and validity of the tested tool in a heterogeneous sample of adults living in a Mediterranean country. It is a useful tool for future investigations and strategies promoting the comeback of this traditional diet."

While evidence exists on the impact of drought on under-five children, its effect during late childhood and early adolescence remains less investigated.This study estimates the impact of concurrent and long-term exposure to drought on linear growth during late childhood and early adolescence.Four rounds (2002-2013) of data from the young lives Cohort Study dataset (n = 2000) was used. The associations of concurrent and long-term exposure to drought and Height-for-age z-score was analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. The study also explored the mediating role of interim period growth in the association of early exposure to drought and undernutrition at later age and the role of the Productive Safety Net Program in buffering the impact of drought on child nutrition.Results show that both concurrent and long-term exposure to drought was negatively associated with Height-for-age z-score (p < 0.001). Exposure to drought at age 5, 8, and 12 years is associated with lower Height-for-age z- score at age 5, 8, and 12 years respectively. Exposure to drought at age 5 years was also negatively associated with Height-for-age z-score at age 12 years (p < 0.001). This association was mainly indirect (89%) and mediated through reduced child growth in subsequent years. Participation in productive safety net program by drought-affected children reduces but does not completely offset the negative effects of drought on Height-for-age z-score (p < 0.1). Moreover, girls were more likely to suffer poor growth than boys.Drought exposure after the 1,000 days window could have a lasting impact on child growth. Given the importance of this period for child physical and mental development, children beyond the 1,000 days window should also be a focus of disaster relief programs."

In B16 melanoma cells, ArhGAP12 suppresses basal Rac and Cdc42 activity, F-actin assembly, invadopodia formation and experimental metastasis. In this setting, ArhGAP12 mutants defective for G-actin binding exhibit more effective downregulation of Rac GTP loading following HGF stimulation and enhanced inhibition of Rac-dependent processes, including invadopodia formation. Potentiation or disruption of the G-actin/ArhGAP12 interaction, by treatment with the actin-binding drugs latrunculin B or cytochalasin D, has corresponding effects on Rac GTP loading. The interaction of G-actin with RPEL-family rhoGAPs thus provides a negative feedback loop that couples Rac activity to actin dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2953001344,"As in other Latin American populations, Argentinians are the result of the admixture amongst different continental groups, mainly from America and Europe, and to a lesser extent from Sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is known that the admixture processes did not occur homogeneously throughout the country. Therefore, considering the importance for anthropological, medical and forensic researches, this study aimed to investigate the population genetic structure of the Argentinian Patagonia, through the analysis of 46 ancestry informative markers, in 433 individuals from five different localities. Overall, in the Patagonian sample, the average individual ancestry was estimated as 35.8% Native American (95% CI: 32.2–39.4%), 62.1% European (58.5–65.7%) and 2.1% African (1.7–2.4%). Comparing the five localities studied, statistically significant differences were observed for the Native American and European contributions, but not for the African ancestry. The admixture results combined with the genealogical information revealed intra-regional variations that are consistent with the different geographic origin of the participants and their ancestors. As expected, a high European ancestry was observed for donors with four grandparents born in Europe (96.8%) or in the Central region of Argentina (85%). In contrast, the Native American ancestry increased when the four grandparents were born in the North (71%) or in the South (61.9%) regions of the country, or even in Chile (60.5%). In summary, our results showed that differences on continental ancestry contribution have different origins in each region in Patagonia, and even in each locality, highlighting the importance of knowing the origin of the participants and their ancestors for the correct interpretation and contextualization of the genetic information."
https://openalex.org/W2949741173,"The variable domain of New Antigen Receptors (vNAR) from sharks, present special characteristics in comparison to the conventional antibody molecules such as: small size (12-15 kDa), thermal and chemical stability and great tissue penetration, that makes them a good alternative source as therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Therefore, it is essential to improve techniques used for the development and selection of vNAR antibodies that recognize distinct antigens. The development of synthetic antibody libraries offers a fast option for the generation of antibodies with the desired characteristics. In this work three synthetic antibody libraries were constructed; without cysteines (Cys), with one Cys and with two Cys residues within its CDR3, with the objective of determining whether the presence or absence of Cys in the CDR3 favors the isolation of vNAR clones from a synthetic library. The libraries were validated selecting against six mammalian proteins. At least one vNAR was found for each of the antigens, and a clone coming from the library without Cys in the CDR3 was selected with all the antigens. In vitro angiogenesis assay with the isolated anti-VEGF antibodies, suggest that these vNARs are capable of inhibiting in vitro angiogenesis. In silico analysis of anti-VEGF antibodies showed that vNARs from synthetic libraries could rival antibodies with affinity maturation by in silico modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2949944300,"Estuarine food webs are generally considered to be supported by marine pelagic and benthic primary producers and by the import of dead organic matter from the open sea. Although estuaries receive considerable amounts of freshwater phytoplankton and organic compounds from adjacent rivers, the potential contribution of these living and dead matter to estuarine food webs is often assumed to be negligible and, therefore, not examined. Based on stable isotope analyses, we report the importance of freshwater suspended particulate organic matter (FW-SPOM) for fuelling estuarine food webs in comparison to estuarine SPOM and microphytobenthos. This previously neglected food source contributed 50–60% (annual average) of food intake of suspension-feeding bivalves such as cockles (Cerastoderma edule), mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) at the Balgzand tidal flats, an estuarine site in the western Wadden Sea (12–32 psu). For these species, this proportion was particularly high in autumn during strong run-off of SPOM-rich freshwater, whilst estuarine SPOM (20%-25%) and microphytobenthos (15%-30%) were relatively important in summer when the freshwater run-off was very low. These findings have implications for our understanding of the trophic interactions within coastal food webs and for freshwater management of estuarine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2950684931,"Background More than 2.5 million newborns die each year, accounting for 47% of children dying worldwide before their age of five years. Complications of preterm birth are the leading cause of death among newborns. Pakistan is amongst the top ten countries with highest preterm birth rate per 1000 live births. Globally, Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) has emphasized on Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) as an essential component of neonatal health initiatives. Materials and methods We conducted this qualitative study with 12 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 14 focus group discussion (FGD) sessions, in two health facilities of Sindh, Pakistan during October-December 2016, to understand the key barriers and enablers to a mother's ability to practice KMC and the feasibility of implementing and improving these practices. Results The findings revealed that community stakeholders were generally aware of health issues especially related to maternal and neonatal health. Both the health care providers and managers were supportive of implementing KMC in their respective health facilities as well as for continuous use of KMC at household level. In order to initiate KMC at facility level, study respondents emphasized on ensuring availability of equipment, supplies, water-sanitation facility, modified patient ward (e.g., curtain, separate room) and quality of services as well as training of health providers as critical prerequisites. Also in order to continue practicing KMC at household level, engaging the community and establishing functional referral linkage between community and facilities were focused issues in facility and community level FGDs and IDIs. Conclusion The study participants considered it feasible to initiate KMC practice at health facility and to continue practicing at home after returning from facility. Ensuring facility readiness to initiate KMC, improving capacity of health providers both at facility and community levels, coupled with focusing on community mobilization strategy, targeting specific audiences, may help policy makers and program planners to initiate KMC at health facility and keep KMC practice continued at household level."
https://openalex.org/W2949937814,"The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that macrophage polarization is altered in old compared to young skeletal muscle, possibly contributing to the poor satellite cell response observed in older muscle tissue. Muscle biopsies were collected prior to and at 3, 24, and 72 h following a muscle-damaging exercise in young and old individuals. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure i.m. macrophage content and phenotype, and cell culture experiments tested macrophage behavior and influence on primary myoblasts from older individuals. We found that macrophage infiltration was similar between groups at 24 (young: 3712 ± 2407 vs. old: 5035 ± 2978 cells/mm3) and 72 (young: 4326 ± 2622 vs. old: 5287 ± 2248 cells/mm3) hours postdamage, yet the proportion of macrophages that expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b were markedly lower in the older subjects (young: 74.5 ± 15 vs. old: 52.6 ± 17%). This finding was coupled with a greater overall proportion of CD206+, anti-inflammatory macrophages in the old (group: P = 0.0005). We further demonstrate in vitro that proliferation, and in some cases differentiation, of old primary human myoblasts increase as much as 30% when exposed to a young macrophage-conditioned environment. Collectively, the data suggest that old macrophages appear less capable of adapting and maintaining inflammatory function, which may contribute to poor satellite cell activation and delayed recovery from muscle damage.—Sorensen, J.

Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs) have been suggested as a possible therapeutic tool for the treatment of pregnancy-related disorders in view of their paracrine actions on trophoblast cells.To quantify the plasma markers of peroxidation in patients affected by PE and IUGR and to examine the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PE and IUGR in vitro by using hUMSCs from physiological and pathological pregnancies and a trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo).In pathological and physiological pregnancies the plasma markers of oxidative stress, arterial blood pressure, serum uric acid, 24h proteinuria, weight gain and body mass index (BMI) were examined. Furthermore, the pulsatility index (PI) of uterine and umbilical arteries, and of fetal middle cerebral artery was measured. In vitro, the different responses of hUMSCs, taken from physiological and pathological pregnancies, and of HTR-8/SVneo to pregnancy-related hormones in terms of viability and nitric oxide (NO) release were investigated. In some experiments, the above measurements were performed on co-cultures between HTR-8/SVneo and hUMSCs.The results obtained have shown that in pathological pregnancies, body mass index, serum acid uric, pulsatility index in uterine and umbilical arteries and markers of oxidative stress were higher than those found in physiological ones. Moreover, in PE and IUGR, a relation was observed between laboratory and clinical findings and the increased levels of oxidative stress. HTR-8/SVneo and hUMSCs showed reduced viability and increased NO production when stressed with H2O2. Finally, HTR-8/SVneo cultured in cross-talk with hUMSCs from pathological pregnancies showed a deterioration of cell viability and NO release when treated with pregnancy-related hormones.Our findings support that hUMSCs taken from patients affected by PE and IUGR have significant features in comparison with those from physiologic pregnancies. Moreover, the cross-talk between hUMSCs and trophoblast cells might be involved in the etiopathology of IUGR and PE secondary to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2949247513,"The biologically active pancreatic hormone peptide islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) regulates brain functions such as appetite and cognition. It also plays a role in clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ), a peptide implicated in the dementia disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD). If IAPP becomes modified, it loses its biological activity and starts to aggregate. Such aggregations have been found in the AD brain and decreased plasma levels of the unmodified IAPP (uIAPP) have been shown in the same patients. In the current study, we analyze levels of uIAPP and total IAPP (unmodified and modified) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to investigate its potential as a biomarker for AD. We found no differences in neither CSF nor plasma levels of uIAPP or total IAPP in AD patients compared to cognitive healthy individuals (NC). The levels of uIAPP in CSF of NC were positively correlated with uIAPP in plasma, Q-albumin and albumin levels in CSF, but negatively correlated with CSF levels of t-tau and p-tau. These findings were not seen in AD patients. Levels of total CSF IAPP correlated positively with total Q-albumin and albumin levels in CSF in both AD and NC. In addition, total plasma IAPP correlated positively with CSF t-tau and p-tau in NC and negatively with CSF Aβ42 in AD patients. To conclude, our studies did not find evidence supporting the use of CSF IAPP as an AD biomarker. However, our findings, indicating a compromised translocation of uIAPP in and out of the brain in AD patients as well as the correlations between total plasma IAPP and AD biomarkers, encourage further research on the role for IAPP in AD."

Like its homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the T. curvata aldolase is a protein complex of Ltp2 with a DUF35 domain derived from the C-terminal domain of a hydratase (ChsH2DUF35) that catalyzes the preceding step in the pathway. We determined the structure of the Ltp2–ChsH2DUF35 complex at 1.7 Å resolution using zinc-single anomalous diffraction. The enzyme adopts an αββα organization, with the two Ltp2 protomers forming a central dimer, and the two ChsH2DUF35 protomers being at the periphery. Docking experiments suggested that Ltp2 forms a tight complex with the hydratase but that each enzyme retains an independent CoA-binding site. Ltp2 adopted a fold similar to those in thiolases; however, instead of forming a deep tunnel, the Ltp2 active site formed an elongated cleft large enough to accommodate 17-HOPC-CoA. The active site lacked the two cysteines that served as the nucleophile and general base in thiolases and replaced a pair of oxyanion-hole histidine residues with Tyr-246 and Tyr-344. Phenylalanine replacement of either of these residues decreased aldolase catalytic activity at least 400-fold. On the basis of a 17-HOPC-CoA -docked model, we propose a catalytic mechanism where Tyr-294 acts as the general base abstracting a proton from the D-ring hydroxyl of 17-HOPC-CoA and Tyr-344 as the general acid that protonates the propionyl-CoA anion following C–C bond cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2949622784,"The MYC gene encodes a human transcription factor and proto-oncogene that is dysregulated in over half of all known cancers. To better understand potential post-transcriptional regulatory features affecting MYC expression, we analyzed secondary structures in the MYC mRNA using a program that is optimized for finding small locally-folded motifs with a high propensity for function. This was accomplished by calculating folding metrics across the MYC sequence using a sliding analysis window and generating unique consensus base pairing models weighted by their lower-than-random predicted folding energy. A series of 30 motifs were identified, primarily in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, which show evidence of structural conservation and compensating mutations across vertebrate MYC homologs. This analysis was able to recapitulate known elements found within an internal ribosomal entry site, as well as discover a novel element in the 3' UTR that is unusually stable and conserved. This novel motif was shown to affect MYC expression, potentially via the modulation of miRNA target accessibility or other trans-regulatory factors. In addition to providing basic insights into mechanisms that regulate MYC expression, this study provides numerous, potentially druggable RNA targets for the MYC gene, which is considered “undruggable” at the protein level."
https://openalex.org/W2951537189,"This study investigated how camp management and tourist activities affect body condition, adrenocortical function, lipid profiles and metabolic status in female tourist elephants. We compared twice monthly serum insulin, glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations to body condition scores (BCS) at five camps with different management styles (e.g., tourist activities, work type, diet) between the High (November–February) and Low (March–October) tourist seasons. There were significant camp effects on health parameters, with BCS, TC, HDL, insulin and glucose being among the highest, and G:I being the lowest (less heathy) in elephants at an observation camp compared to those at camps where elephants received exercise by providing rides to tourists. Differences between High and Low tourist season months also were found for all measures, except TG and FGM concentrations. Both work time and walking distance were negatively correlated to glucose, fructosamine and insulin, while walking distance was negatively related to FGM concentrations. By contrast, positive associations were found between tourist number and BCS, TG, and insulin, perhaps related to tourists feeding elephants. Quantity of supplementary diet items (e.g., bananas, sugar cane, pumpkin) were positively correlated with FGM concentrations, glucose, fructosamine, and insulin. This study provides evidence that body condition, adrenal activity, metabolic markers, and lipid profiles in captive elephants may be affected by visitor numbers, work activities, and the amount of supplementary foods offered by tourists. Some activities appear to have negative (e.g., feeding), while others (e.g., exercise) may have positive effects on health and welfare. We conclude that camps adopting a more hands-off approach to tourism need to ensure elephants remain healthy by providing environments that encourage activity and rely on more natural diets or foraging."
https://openalex.org/W2952169319,"Many insect species display daily variation of sensitivity to insecticides when they are exposed to the same concentration at different times during the day. To date, this has not been investigated in bed bugs. To address this, we explored circadian rhythms in insecticide susceptibility, xenobiotic metabolizing (XM) gene expressions, and metabolic detoxification in the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius. An insecticide susceptible Monheim strain of C. lectularius was most tolerant of deltamethrin during the late photophase at ZT9 (i.e. nine hours after light is present in the light-dark cycle (LD) cycle) and similarly repeated at CT9 (i.e. nine hours into the subjective day in constant darkness (DD)) suggesting endogenous circadian involvement in susceptibility to deltamethrin. No diel rhythm was observed against imidacloprid insecticide despite significant daily susceptibility in both LD and DD conditions. Rhythmic expressions of metabolic detoxification genes, GSTs1 and CYP397A1 displayed similar expression patterns with total GST and P450 enzyme activities in LD and DD conditions, respectively. The oscillation of mRNA levels of GSTs1 and CYP397A1 was found consistent with peak phases of deltamethrin susceptibility in C. lectularius. This study demonstrates that circadian patterns of metabolic detoxification gene expression occur within C. lectularius. As a consequence, insecticide efficacy can vary dramatically throughout a 24 hour period."

Probiotics have been linked to positive health effects such as faster disease recovery times in humans and increased weight gain in poultry. Pigeon fanciers often feed their show pigeons probiotics with the intention of increasing flight performance. The objective of our study was to determine the effect of two different probiotics, alone and in combination, on the fecal microbiome of Birmingham Roller pigeons. We sequenced fecal samples from 20 pigeons divided into three probiotic treatments, including prior to, during, and after treatment. Pre-treatment and control group samples were dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. Administration of a probiotic pellet containing Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus resulted in increase in average relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. from 4.7 ± 2.0% to 93.0 ± 5.3%. No significant effects of Enterococcus spp. were detected. Probiotic-induced shifts in the microbiome composition were temporary and disappeared within 2 days of probiotic cessation. Administration of a probiotic powder in drinking water that contained Enterococcus faecium and three Lactobacillus species had minimal effect on the microbiome. We conclude that supplementing Birmingham roller pigeons with the probiotic pellets, but not the probiotic powder, temporarily changed the microbiome composition. A next step is to experimentally test the effect of these changes in microbiome composition on host health and physical performance."
https://openalex.org/W2949889105,"Overdosing of the analgesic acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most common causes for acute liver failure in modern countries. Although the exact molecular mechanisms mediating hepatocellular necrosis are still elusive, it is preceded by oxidative stress triggered by excessive levels of the metabolite N-acetyl-para-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Here, we describe the role of the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel TRP vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) for APAP-induced hepatoxicity. Both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of TRPV4 ameliorate APAP-induced necrosis in mouse and human hepatocytes in vitro. Liver injury caused by a systemic overdose of APAP is reduced in TRPV4-deficient mice and in wild-type mice treated with a TRPV4 inhibitor. The reduction of hepatotoxicity accomplished by systemic TRPV4 inhibition is comparable to the protective effects of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. Although TRPV4 does not modulate intrahepatic levels of glutathione, both its inhibition and genetic deletion attenuate APAP-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress as well as mitochondrial membrane depolarization. NAPQI evokes a calcium influx by activating heterologously expressed TRPV4 channels and endogenous TRPV4 channels in hepatoma cells but not in primary mouse hepatocytes. Taken together, our data suggest that TRPV4 mediates APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and thus may be a suitable target for treatment of this critical side effect.—Echtermeyer, F., Eberhardt, M., Risser, L., Herzog, C., Gueler, F., Khalil, M., Engel, M., Vondran, F., Leffler, A.

https://openalex.org/W2950128221,"Because the serum uric acid level increases as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases, hyperuricemia is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although hyperuricemia is a risk factor for CKD progression, the causal role of uric acid remains controversial in patients with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. This study included 588 patients with stage 3–4 CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Using propensity score matching, 165 pairs treated and untreated with pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy were matched. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to determine the effect of urate-lowering agents on kidney survival. The prognostic value for kidney survival was ascertained using Cox regression analysis. The GFR changes over time between the patients treated and untreated with urate-lowering agents were assessed using a linear mixed model analysis. The mean age of the matched patients was 63.2 ± 12.7 years, and 52 (15.8%) patients had diabetic nephropathy. The mean estimated GFR (eGFR) and serum uric acid level were 36.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 7.8 mg/dL, respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 41.9 months, 87 developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The incidence rates of ESKD were comparable between the patients treated and untreated with urate-lowering agents. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that kidney survival was also comparable between them. In the multivariate analysis, heart failure and low eGFR were the significant prognostic factors for kidney survival. However, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy was not predictive of kidney survival. The overall GFR decline rate was also comparable between the groups (P = 0.13). The efficacy of pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy in delaying CKD progression remains controversial. Therefore, further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy in attenuating kidney function deterioration in patients with stage 3–4 CKD."

Heterozygous defects in the aggrecan gene have been identified as a cause of autosomal dominant short stature, bone age acceleration, and premature growth cessation. The mechanisms accounting for this phenotype remain unknown. We used ATDC5 cells, an established model of chondrogenesis, to evaluate the effects of aggrecan deficiency. ATDC5 aggrecan knockdown cell lines (AggKD) were generated using lentiviral shRNA transduction particles. Cells were stimulated with insulin/transferrin/selenium for up to 21 days to induce chondrogenesis. Control ATDC5 cells showed induction of Col2a1 starting at day 8 and induction of Col10a1 starting at day 12. AggKD cells had significantly reduced expression of Col2a1 and Col10a1 (p<0.0001) with only minimal increases in expression over time, indicating that chondrogenesis was markedly impaired. The induction of Col2a1 and Col10a1 was not rescued by culturing of AggKD cells in wells pre-conditioned with ATDC5 extracellular matrix or in co-culture with wild-type ATDC5 cells. We interpret our studies as indicating that aggrecan has an integral role in chondrogenesis that may be mediated through intracellular mechanisms."

Drosophila Ihog proteins are type I single-span transmembrane proteins with four or five extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and two extracellular fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains; consequently, these proteins resemble cell adhesion molecules (12Chothia C. Jones E.Y. The molecular structure of cell adhesion molecules.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66 (9242926): 823-86210.1146/annurev.biochem.66.1.823Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Previously, our laboratory identified a function of the Ihog proteins that is independent of their role in transducing the Hh signal (13Hsia E.Y.C. Zhang Y. Tran H.S. Lim A. Chou Y.H. Lan G. Beachy P.A. Zheng X. Hedgehog mediated degradation of Ihog adhesion proteins modulates cell segregation in Drosophila wing imaginal discs.Nat.

Specifically, ectopic Ihog expression leads to aggregation of otherwise nonadherent cells, and loss of Ihog activity in the context of the Drosophila wing disc disrupts cell segregation, even in the presence of downstream genetic rescue of the intracellular response to Hh (13Hsia E.Y.C. Zhang Y. Tran H.S. Lim A. Chou Y.H. Lan G. Beachy P.A. Zheng X. Hedgehog mediated degradation of Ihog adhesion proteins modulates cell segregation in Drosophila wing imaginal discs.Nat.

Considering the structural similarity between Ihog proteins and cell adhesion molecules, we proposed that Ihog proteins function similarly to cell adhesion molecules to directly mediate cell–cell interactions. However, mechanistic understanding of this function, how the dual roles of Ihog proteins (transduction of the Hh signal and cell–cell interaction) are coordinated, and their functional interplay is lacking. To address these questions, we explored the cell adhesion and homophilic interaction properties of Ihog and the effect of Hh on these properties. We used Drosophila S2 cells, which lack a Hh signal response and are intrinsically nonadhesive, to investigate the properties of ectopically expressed Ihog in cell–cell interactions. We found that Ihog proteins are enriched at the site of cell–cell contacts and engaged in calcium-independent homophilic trans-interactions. By mapping the Ihog–Ihog trans-homophilic binding site, we determined that it overlaps with the Ihog–Hh interface on the first fibronectin repeat in the extracellular domain of Ihog. We further demonstrated that Hh interferes with Ihog-mediated trans-homophilic interactions by competing for Ihog binding. These results, thus, not only reveal a molecular mechanism for Ihog-mediated cell–cell interactions but also suggest a direct Hh-mediated regulation of both intracellular signaling and cell adhesion through Ihog. The Hh co-receptors Ihog and Boi resemble typical cell adhesion molecules with a single transmembrane domain, four Ig domains, and two FNIII domains (12Chothia C. Jones E.Y. The molecular structure of cell adhesion molecules.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66 (9242926): 823-86210.1146/annurev.biochem.66.1.823Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our laboratory reported that the Ihog proteins possess cell adhesion functions independent of their role in transducing the Hh signal (13Hsia E.Y.C. Zhang Y. Tran H.S. Lim A. Chou Y.H. Lan G.

Consistent with our previous observations (13Hsia E.Y.C. Zhang Y. Tran H.S. Lim A. Chou Y.H. Lan G. Beachy P.A. Zheng X. Hedgehog mediated degradation of Ihog adhesion proteins modulates cell segregation in Drosophila wing imaginal discs.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (29097673): 127510.1038/s41467-017-01364-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Drosophila S2 cells transiently transfected with Ihog tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) at the C-terminal intracellular side formed multicellular aggregates, whereas the untransfected cells remained mostly dispersed (Fig. 1A). When we stained the cells with an antibody recognizing the extracellular domain (anti-IhogECD) and an antibody recognizing the intracellular HA tag (anti-HA), we found that anti-IhogECD detected Ihog along the outer surface of the multicell aggregates and that anti-HA revealed Ihog at both the outer surface of the clusters and along the contacting cell surfaces (Fig. 1, B and C). We predicted that the extensive contacts formed among the Ihog-expressing cells prevented antibodies from diffusing into the multicell aggregates, thus excluding the anti-IhogECD antibodies from cell–cell contacts (Fig. 1B). The anti-HA staining pattern suggested that Ihog proteins were enriched at cell–cell contacts (Fig. 1C), and quantification of fluorescence intensity in the stained cells confirmed this enrichment (Fig. 1D). We also showed that the enrichment of Ihog proteins at cell–cell contacts was severalfold higher than the enrichment of coexpressed membrane-localized mCD8-GFP proteins (Fig. S1), suggesting that the increased signal of Ihog at the cell–cell contacts was not simply due to membranes of adjacent cells being in close proximity. Drosophila S2 cells, which are derived from phagocytic hematopoietic cells, lack DE-cadherin at the cell surface and do not form Ca2+-dependent cell aggregates (17Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. A Drosophila homolog of cadherin associated with Armadillo and essential for embryonic cell-cell adhesion.Dev. Biol. 1994; 165 (7958432): 716-72610.1006/dbio.1994.1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that Ihog caused S2 cell aggregation by indirectly activating or inducing the production of other endogenous adhesion molecules, we stained S2 cells for DE-cadherin, DN-cadherin, and fasciclin II (Drosophila neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)). As expected, the S2 cells had only background staining for these proteins, and their abundances were unaffected by transfection with Ihog-YFP constructs (Fig. 2, A–C). Furthermore, Ihog-dependent cell aggregation occurred when Ca2+ in the medium was eliminated with the addition of EGTA (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, the data indicated that the Ihog proteins, in addition to functioning as a Hh co-receptor (5Zheng X. Mann R.K. Sever N. Beachy P.A. Genetic and biochemical definition of the Hedgehog receptor.Genes Dev. 2010; 24 (20048000): 57-7110.1101/gad.1870310Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), engage in Ca2+-independent, homophilic trans-interactions to mediate cell–cell interactions. The Ig (Ig1–4) domains and the FNIII (Fn1 and Fn2) domains in the extracellular portion of Ihog proteins are potentially capable of mediating cell adhesion (12Chothia C. Jones E.Y. The molecular structure of cell adhesion molecules.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66 (9242926): 823-86210.1146/annurev.biochem.66.1.823Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To map the region in the extracellular portion of Ihog required for the formation of cell–cell contacts, we generated a series of truncations of the extracellular domain of Ihog-YFP, expressed them in S2 cells, and monitored their distribution in live cells using YFP fluorescence. We also monitored the distribution of the small, single-transmembrane-domain protein CD8 tagged with GFP (mCD8-GFP (18Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22 (10197526): 451-46110.1016/S0896-6273(00)80701-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar)) as a control protein that localizes to the membrane. As expected, mCD8-GFP was found in intracellular structures (likely intermediates along the biosynthetic and trafficking pathway) and along the cell surface (Fig. 3A). The distribution of mCD8-GFP was similar in individual cells, two closely positioned cells, and clusters of multiple cells (Fig. 3A). Similar to the full-length Ihog protein, Ihog truncated at the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) was enriched along the contacting sides of cells that both expressed the truncated Ihog (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the intracellular domain is not necessary for the enrichment and homophilic interaction. We found that all the extracellular domain–truncated Ihog variants with an intact Fn1 domain were enriched at the sites of cell–cell contact in closely positioned two-cell and multiple-cell aggregates (Fig. 3, C–F). In contrast, Ihog lacking the Fn1 domain was present along the plasma membrane but did not concentrate at the site of cell–cell contact (Fig. 3, G–I). Similar results were also seen for cells cotransfected with the Ihog paralogue Boi. We tested the ability of the truncated Ihog variants to induce aggregation of transfected S2 cells. We monitored aggregation induced by coexpression of mCherry with Ihog or Ihog lacking the CTD (IhogΔCTD), lacking the Fn2 domain (IhogΔFn2), lacking all four Ig domains (IhogΔIG), and lacking the Fn1 domain (IhogΔFn1) (Fig. 4A). Control cells expressed mCherry without any coexpressed Ihog. We dissociated the cells and then quantified the percentage of cell clusters 4 h after mixing (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing wildtype (WT) Ihog protein or any of the Ihog truncated proteins containing the Fn1 domain (IhogΔCTD, IhogΔFn2, and IhogΔIG) exhibited significant aggregation of the transfected S2 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, cells expressing IhogΔFn1 did not form any recognizable cell aggregates and were indistinguishable from those expressing mCherry alone (Fig. 4, A and B). We confirmed by immunoblotting that the transfected cells used for the aggregation assays had similar amounts of Ihog or Ihog mutant (Fig. 4C). To test for the Ihog–Ihog interaction biochemically, we assessed whether the extracellular domain of Ihog binds to itself using a pulldown assay. We used only the extracellular domain to avoid any aggregation due to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain or unphysiological interactions between the extracellular domain and the intracellular domain. We expressed variants of the extracellular domain of Ihog tagged with FLAG (FLAG-tagged IhogECD) along with YFP-tagged WT IhogECD in S2 cells and collected the media. We captured FLAG-tagged IhogECD variants with FLAG antibody–coated beads and detected the amount of YFP-tagged IhogECD bound by immunoblotting. Consistent with the cellular data, FLAG-tagged IhogECD variants with the Fn1 domain, but not those with Fn1 deletions, pulled down YFP-tagged IhogECD (Fig. 4D). Thus, S2 cell–based results and the biochemical data indicated that Ihog proteins bind to each other through the Fn1 domain, which serves as the basis for Ihog-mediated homophilic cell–cell interactions. Our data showed that the Ihog Fn1 domain is essential for Ihog–Ihog homophilic interactions, and previous biochemical and structural studies showed that the Ihog Fn1 contributes to the binding site for the N-terminal Hh signaling domain (HhN) in a heparin-dependent manner (7Yao S. Lum L. Beachy P. The Ihog cell-surface proteins bind Hedgehog and mediate pathway activation.Cell. 2006; 125 (16630821): 343-35710.1016/j.cell.2006.02.040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8McLellan J.S.

We explored the structural properties that enable the same FNIII domain to possess these two distinct functions of ligand binding and homophilic trans-interaction. We used the IhogFn1-2 (PDB code 2IBB) and the IhogFn1-2–HhN (PDB code 2IBG) complex structures (8McLellan J.S. Yao S. Zheng X. Geisbrecht B.V. Ghirlando R. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J.

We divided those residues that are nonoverlapping with the Hh–Ihog interface into six major regions, which we called M1–6, and subjected these regions to mutagenesis (Fig. 5A and Table S1). Based on previous reports (5Zheng X. Mann R.K. Sever N. Beachy P.A.

Because the side chains of the selected residues are solvent-exposed, we expected that the folded structures of these proteins would not be affected. Indeed, the abundances of the mutant proteins were similar to that of WT Ihog expressed in the S2 cells, and the mutants properly localized to the cell surface of S2 cells (Fig. S2). We expressed mCherry alone or mCherry with WT or the mutated Ihog proteins and assessed their ability to induce cell clustering by quantifying cell cluster formation 4 h after cell dissociation (Fig. 5, B and C). The only region that impaired cell aggregation activity when mutated was the region where Ihog interacts with heparin and mediates the Hh interaction (IhogxHh). Furthermore, S2 cells expressing IhogxHh mutants neither formed clusters with S2 cells expressing WT Ihog proteins (Fig. 6, A–C) nor concentrated at the cell–cell contact sites (Fig. 6D). In contrast, IhogxPtc was enriched at cell–cell contacts (Fig. 6E), and IhogxPtc-expressing cells formed clusters at the same proportion as WT Ihog–expressing cells. Together, these data with the S2 cells indicated that the Ihog homophilic binding site involves the heparin-binding site and overlaps with the Ihog–Hh interface in the Ihog Fn1 domain. Intriguingly, our data indicated that the two distinct functions of Ihog proteins involve the same extracellular domain on an overlapping surface of Ihog (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), suggesting that the signal transduction and trans-homophilic binding activities are simultaneously incompatible for a single Ihog molecule. Thus, we predicted that the presence of Hh ligands would compete for the Ihog homophilic binding or vice versa, depending on the relative abundance and affinities of the Fn1 domain for Hh and another Ihog Fn1 domain. Indeed, we found that transient coexpression of HhN by S2 cells reduced the interaction of differentially tagged IhogECD in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 7A). A competitive binding assay using purified HhN revealed a concentration-dependent interference between the interactions of differentially tagged IhogECD proteins (Figs. 7B and S3). These results are consistent with competition between homophilic Ihog–Ihog interactions and heterophilic Ihog–Hh interactions. The published HhN–IhogFn1-2 crystal structure reveals a 2:2 complex, in which each HhN molecule contacts a single Ihog molecule, and a pair of 1:1 Hh–Ihog complexes forms a dimeric 2:2 complex that is entirely mediated by cis-interactions between the Ihog proteins (8McLellan J.S. Yao S. Zheng X. Geisbrecht B.V. Ghirlando R. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Structure of a heparin-dependent complex of Hedgehog and Ihog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consistent with a cis-interaction that is not destabilized by Hh, the HhN-mediated disruption of Ihog–Ihog binding was incomplete, even when the concentration of HhN was 10 times higher than the reported dissociation constant of IhogFn1–2 for HhN (8McLellan J.S.

The Ihog–Ihog interaction that persisted in the presence of excess HhN was likely due to Ihog–Ihog homophilic cis-interactions that were not competed by HhN (8McLellan J.S. Yao S. Zheng X. Geisbrecht B.V. Ghirlando R. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Structure of a heparin-dependent complex of Hedgehog and Ihog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, due to the coexistence of Ihog–Ihog cis-homophilic interactions that are not competed by Hh, in vitro competition assays, such as that used here (Fig. 7), cannot determine the binding affinity of Ihog–Hh versus Ihog–Ihog trans-homophilic interactions. Taken together, we showed that the Hedgehog co-receptor Ihog mediates trans-homophilic binding and signal reception via an overlapping surface, and the presence of excess Hh ligands interferes with Ihog-mediated homophilic interactions by competing for Ihog binding. The Ihog family proteins are type I single-span transmembrane proteins with Ig and FNIII domains, resembling typical cell adhesion molecules in the Ig cell adhesion molecule (Ig-CAM) superfamily. We previously found that Ihog proteins not only play an essential role in Hh signal transduction but also contribute to cell segregation in the Drosophila wing imaginal discs (5Zheng X. Mann R.K.

In this study, we showed that, when transfected into the relatively nonadhesive Drosophila S2 cells lacking the ability to transduce the Hh signal, Ihog proteins concentrate at cell–cell contacts and mediate cell–cell interactions in a homophilic, calcium-independent manner. The region that we identified as mediating the trans-Ihog–Ihog interaction overlaps with the region that mediates the interaction with Hh and includes the region where the negatively charged glycan heparin binds. Heparin is required for the Ihog–HhN heterophilic interaction by bridging positively charged patches of both proteins at the interaction interface (8McLellan J.S. Yao S. Zheng X. Geisbrecht B.V. Ghirlando R. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Structure of a heparin-dependent complex of Hedgehog and Ihog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the in vitro immunoprecipitation assay and competition assay (Figure 4, Figure 7), binding between differentially tagged Ihog ECDs and Hh-mediated disruption of Ihog–Ihog interactions required heparin in the immunoprecipitation buffer (see “Experimental procedures”). In the cell-based assays, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present because these are naturally produced by the S2 cells (19Kasevayuth K. Yanagishita M. Catabolism of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in Drosophila cell lines.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324 (15465003): 205-21110.1016/j.bbrc.2004.09.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ihog–Ihog homophilic trans-interactions likely occurred through heparin-dependent bridging of positively charged surfaces on the two opposing Fn1 domains, in a manner similar to heparin-bridged Ihog–Hh interactions (Fig. S4). These results thus provided a mechanistic basis for the role of Ihog proteins in wing disc cell segregation (13Hsia E.Y.C. Zhang Y. Tran H.S. Lim A. Chou Y.H. Lan G. Beachy P.A. Zheng X.

Alteration of SUMOylation cycles leads to severe developmental and homeostatic defects and malignancy, but signals coordinating SUMOylation are still unidentified. The adrenal cortex is a zonated endocrine gland that controls body homeostasis and stress response. Here, we show that in human and in mouse adrenals, SUMOylation follows a decreasing centripetal gradient that mirrors cortical differentiation flow and delimits highly and weakly SUMOylated steroidogenic compartments, overlapping glomerulosa, and fasciculata zones. Activation of PKA signaling by acute hormonal treatment, mouse genetic engineering, or in Carney complex results in repression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation in the inner cortex by coordinating expression of SUMO pathway inducers and repressors. Conversely, genetic activation of canonical wingless-related integration site signaling maintains high SUMOylation potential in the outer neoplastic cortex. Thus, SUMOylation is tightly regulated by signaling pathways that orchestrate adrenal zonation and diseases.-Dumontet, T., Sahut-Barnola, I., Dufour, D., Lefrançois-Martinez, A.-M., Berthon, A., Montanier, N., Ragazzon, B., Djari, C., Pointud, J.-C., Roucher-Boulez, F., Batisse-Lignier, M., Tauveron, I., Bertherat, J., Val, P., Martinez, A.

Here, we report the critical role of β-arrestin1 (βarr1) in radiation-induced intestinal injury. Intestinal βarr1 was highly expressed in radiation enteritis and in a radiation model. βarr1 knockout (KO) or knockdown mice exhibited increased proliferation in intestinal Lgr5+ stem cell, crypt reproduction, and survival following radiation.

The aim of this study was to identify genes whose expression levels were associated with AAM or ANM due to pleiotropy or causality by integrating GWAS data with genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. We also aimed to identify the pleiotropic genes that influenced both phenotypes.We employed GWAS data of AAM and ANM and genome-wide eQTL data from whole blood. The summary data-based Mendelian randomization method was used to prioritize the associated genes for further study. The colocalization analysis was used to identify the pleiotropic genes associated with both phenotypes.We identified 31 genes whose expression was associated with AAM and 24 genes whose expression was associated with ANM due to pleiotropy or causality. Two pleiotropic genes were identified to be associated with both phenotypes.The results point out the most possible genes which were responsible for the association. Our study prioritizes the associated genes for further functional mechanistic study of AAM and ANM and illustrates the benefit of integrating different omics data into the study of complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2951251806,"Background Population Services International (PSI) Myanmar’s social franchise network of general practitioners, known as Sun Quality Health Clinics (SQHC), provided tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment with Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTs) across Myanmar since 2004, with a total of 898 clinics across the country. People who sought TB treatment from these SQHC by themselves were regarded as walk-in patients. To augment TB case notification, PSI Myanmar developed two treatment seeking channels: Community Health Services Providers (CHSP) and Interpersonal Communicators (IPC). They actively sought people who were suspected to have TB and referred them to SQH clinics. In this study, we compared the loss to follow-up rates of TB patients across three treatment seeking channels; and investigated risk-factors for loss to follow-up. Methods and findings A retrospective cohort design was applied using TB client records between 2012 and 2016. Outcome was defined as loss to follow-up in comparison to successful TB treatment (completed or cured). Multivariate Poisson regression was conducted to estimate incidence rate ratio of loss to follow-up. Of the 62,664 TB patients registered at the SQHC, around 10% each were actively screened by the CHSP and the IPC, and 78.9% were walk-in patients. Overall cumulative incidence for loss to follow-up rate was significantly higher in the IPC channel (14.2%, 95% CI 13.4–15.1%) than walk-in patients (8.9%, 95% CI 8.6–9.1%) and the CHSP channel (5.5%, 95% CI 5.0–6.1%) (p<0.001). The median time after which patients were lost to follow-up from treatment was 4.04 months. We found that patients with older age, male sex, patients residing in hilly region, unknown smear status, retreated cases, HIV co-infection, and unknown HIV status were risk-factors for loss to follow-up in the continuation phase of treatment; whereas patients with higher initial body weight, patients who received travel support and patients taking treatment in older providers were less likely to be lost to follow-up. Conclusions Based on these findings, we recommend that implementation strategies for improving case notification and treatment seeking should carefully consider retention strategies in parallel, and the identified influencing factors for loss to follow-up should be taken account for such consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2949751771,"Background Blood collection, transportation and storage remain a problem in countries where infrastructure, laboratory facilities and skilled manpower are scarce. This limits evaluation of immune responses in natural infections and vaccination in field studies. We developed methods to measure antigen specific antibody responses using dried blood spot (DBS) in cholera, ETEC and typhoid fever patients as well as recipients of oral cholera vaccine (OCV). Methodology/Principle findings We processed heparinized blood for preparing DBS and plasma specimens from patients with, cholera, ETEC and typhoid as well as OCV recipients. We optimized the conventional vibriocidal method to measure vibriocidal antibody response in DBS eluates. We measured responses in DBS samples and plasma (range of titer of 5 to 10240). Vibriocidal titer showed strong agreement between DBS eluates and plasma in cholera patients (ICC = 0.9) and in OCV recipients (ICC = 0.8) using the Bland-Altman analysis and a positive correlation was seen (r = 0.7, p = 0.02 and r = 0.6, p = 0.006, respectively). We observed a strong agreement of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cholera toxin B (CTB)-specific antibody responses between DBS eluates and plasma in cholera patients and OCV recipients. We also found agreement of heat labile toxin B (LTB) and membrane protein (MP)-specific antibody responses in DBS eluates and plasma specimen of ETEC and typhoid patients respectively. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that dried blood specimens can be used as an alternate method for preservation of samples to measure antibody responses in enteric diseases and vaccine trials and can be applied to assessment of responses in humanitarian crisis and other adverse field settings."
https://openalex.org/W2950777436,"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a transmissible, rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. The transmissible agent linked to sCJD is composed of the misfolded form of the host-encoded prion protein. The combination of histopathological and biochemical analyses has allowed the identification and sub-classification of six sCJD subtypes. This classification depends on the polymorphic variability of codon 129 of the prion protein gene and the PrPres isotype, and appears to be associated with neuropathological and clinical features. Currently, sCJD subtyping is only fully achievable post mortem. However, a rapid and non-invasive method for discriminating sCJD subtypes in vita would be invaluable for the clinical management of affected individuals, and for the selection of participants for clinical trials. The CSF analysis by Real Time Quaking Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) reaction is the most sensitive and specific ante mortem sCJD diagnostic test available to date, and it is used by a number of laboratories internationally. RT-QuIC takes advantage of the natural replication mechanisms of prions by template-induced misfolding, employing recombinant prion protein as reaction substrate. We asked whether epitope mapping, of the RT-QuIC reaction products obtained from seeding RT-QuIC with brain and CSF samples from each of the six molecular subtypes of sCJD could be employed to distinguish them and therefore achieve in vita sCJD molecular subtyping. We found that it is possible to distinguish the RT-QuIC products generated by sCJD biological samples from the ones generated by spontaneous conversion in the negative controls, but that different sCJD subtypes generate very similar, if not identical RT-QuIC reaction products. We concluded that whilst RT-QuIC has demonstrable diagnostic value it has limited prognostic value at this point in time."
https://openalex.org/W2953075798,"Background HIV prevalence in Mozambique is estimated to be 13.2%. Routine viral load for HIV monitoring was first implemented in the rural area of Tete in 2014. Programmatic data showed an unexpected high proportion of high viral load results, with up to 40% of patients having a viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Objectives This qualitative study aimed to explore perceptions about virological failure and viral load monitoring from the perspective of HIV positive patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) and health-care workers. Methods The study was conducted in seven rural communities in Changara-Marara district, Tete province, Mozambique. A total of 91 participants took part in in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs), including health-care workers (n = 18), patients on ART in individual care or Community Adherence Groups (CAGs) who experienced virological failure and virological re-suppression (n = 39) and CAG focal points (n = 34). Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Interviews and FGDs were conducted in Nhuengue and Portuguese. IDIs and FGDs were translated and transcribed before being coded and thematically analysed. Results Emergent themes showed that patients and health-care workers attributed great importance to viral load monitoring. A supressed viral load was viewed by participants as a predictor of good health and good adherence. However, some patients were confused and appeared distressed when confronted with virological failure. Viral load results were often little understood, especially when virological failure was detected despite good adherence. Inadequate explanations of causes of virological failure, delayed follow-up viral load results, repeated blood tests and lack of access to second-line ART resulted in reduced confidence in the effectiveness of ART, challenged the patient-provider relationship and disempowered patients and providers. Conclusion In this rural context undetectable viral load is recognized as a predictor of good health by people living with HIV and health-care workers. However, a lack of knowledge and health system barriers caused different responses in patients and health-care workers. Adapted counselling strategies, accelerated viral load follow-up and second-line ART initiation in patients with virological failure need to be prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W2951520453,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) corrupts the outcome of about 50% of all critically ill patients. We investigated the possible contribution of the pathology acidemia on the development of AKI. Pigs were exposed to acidemia, acidemia plus hypoxemia or a normal acid-base balance in an experimental setup, which included mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy to facilitate biotrauma caused by extracorporeal therapies. Interestingly, extensive histomorphological changes like a tubular loss of cell barriers occurred in the kidneys after just 5 hours exposure to acidemia. The additional exposure to hypoxemia aggravated these findings. These 'early' microscopic pathologies opposed intra vitam data of kidney function. They did not mirror cellular or systemic patterns of proinflammatory molecules (like TNF-α or IL 18) nor were they detectable by new, sensitive markers of AKI like Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. Instead, the data suggest that the increased renal proton excretion during acidemia could be an 'early' first hit in the multifactorial pathogenesis of AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2952348834,"Background Residual HIV-1 replication among individuals under antiretroviral therapy (ART) relates to HIV micro-inflammation. Objectives To determine the levels of residual HIV replication markers among distinct subgroups of antiretroviral-treated individuals. Methods One hundred sixteen patients were distributed into 5 treatment groups: first-line suppressive ART with a non-nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (n = 26), first-line suppressive ART with boosted protease inhibitors (PI-r) (n = 25), salvage therapy using PI-r (n = 27), salvage therapy with PI-r and raltegravir (n = 22) and virologic failure (n = 16). Episomal and total DNA quantitation was evaluated. ELISA was used for HIV antibody and LPS quantitation. Results Episomal DNA was positive in 26% to 38% of individuals under suppressive ART, and it was higher among individuals experiencing ART virologic failure (p = 0.04). The HIV proviral load was higher among patients with detectable episomal DNA (p = 0.01). Individuals receiving initial PI-r treatment presented lower HIV antibody (p = 0.027) and LPS (p = 0.029) levels than individuals receiving NNRTI. There was a negative correlation between episomal DNA quantitation and the duration of suppressive ART (p = 0.04), CD4+ T-cell count (p = 0.08), and CD8+ T-cell count (p = 0.07). Conclusions Residual HIV replication has been inferred among individuals under suppressive ART according to episomal DNA detection. Residual replication may decrease with longer periods of suppressive ART and higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The relationship between episomal DNA and total DNA suggests there is a replenishment of the proviral reservoir with impacts on HIV persistence. Lower antibody and LPS levels among patients with initial PI-r ART suggest these regimens may more effectively suppress HIV and have a higher capacity to decrease the HIV antigenic component."

https://openalex.org/W2952089205,"In recent years, with the rapid development of China's air transport industry and the change in market consumption structure, service quality has become one of the important factors affecting airline revenue. How to formulate a reasonable pricing strategy and maintain competitiveness in the fierce market competition has become an urgent problem for airlines. First, the impact factor of service quality level in the traditional pricing model is introduced and a static price competition model for multi-oligopoly airlines based on service quality is established in this paper. And then, a dynamic pricing model based on service quality of the multi-oligopoly airlines is established. The model incorporates the weight factor of service quality impact, which is used to indicate the weight of the service quality level in the process of airline dynamic pricing. The research results show that the service quality level of airlines has an indispensable influence on its development. Airlines should improve service quality as soon as possible to enhance market competitiveness and achieve sustainable development."

https://openalex.org/W2952242297,"American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth are more likely to ever have had sex, and to have engaged in sexual activity prior to age 13 compared to all other race groups. It is essential to understand the development of skills to refuse sexual experience in early adolescence in order to reduce disparities associated with early sexual debut among AI/AN youth. Familial, social, and individual factors can act as protective influences on adolescent sexual experience; however, in other settings, research has shown that frequent residential mobility disrupts these protective influences and may increase the likelihood of adolescent sexual activity. AI/AN youth are highly mobile, and, as a result, may be especially vulnerable to increased sexual risk. To date, no prior study has considered the impact of residential mobility on AI/AN youth sexual experience, nor the influence on precursors that reduce initiation of sex. We used data from a longitudinal study of AI/AN youth attending all middle schools from a Northern Plains reservation from 2006–2009 to estimate a structural equation model based on a cultural and age adapted theoretical framework. The tested model included frequent residential mobility as the independent variable and sex refusal self-efficacy as the dependent variable. Mediating variables included factors related to individual risks, psychological well-being, and social supports. Results indicate a direct association between residential mobility and sex refusal self-efficacy (-.29, p = 0.05) and an indirect association mediated by deviant peers (-.08, p = .05). Other mediating variables did not provide insight on the mechanism by which residential mobility influences skills to refuse sexual intercourse among AI/AN youth in early adolescence. Findings provide evidence for an association between residential mobility and precursors to sexual experience suggesting augmenting sexual health interventions for highly mobile youth."
