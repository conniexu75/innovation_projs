https://openalex.org/W3092361867,"Background & aims Although metabolic risk factors are associated with more severe COVID-19, there is little evidence on outcomes in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We here describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of NAFLD patients in a cohort hospitalised for COVID-19. Methods This study included all consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 between February and April 2020 at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, with either imaging of the liver available dated within one year from the admission or a known diagnosis of NAFLD. Clinical data and early weaning score (EWS) were recorded. NAFLD diagnosis was based on imaging or past medical history and patients were stratified for Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Clinical endpoints were admission to intensive care unit (ICU)and in-hospital mortality. Results 561 patients were admitted. Overall, 193 patients were included in the study. Fifty nine patients (30%) died, 9 (5%) were still in hospital, and 125 (65%) were discharged. The NAFLD cohort (n = 61) was significantly younger (60 vs 70.5 years, p = 0.046) at presentation compared to the non-NAFLD (n = 132). NAFLD diagnosis was not associated with adverse outcomes. However, the NAFLD group had higher C reactive protein (CRP) (107 vs 91.2 mg/L, p = 0.05) compared to non-NAFLD(n = 132). Among NAFLD patients, male gender (p = 0.01), ferritin (p = 0.003) and EWS (p = 0.047) were associated with in-hospital mortality, while the presence of intermediate/high risk FIB-4 or liver cirrhosis was not. Conclusion The presence of NAFLD per se was not associated with worse outcomes in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Though NAFLD patients were younger on admission, disease stage was not associated with clinical outcomes. Yet, mortality was associated with gender and a pronounced inflammatory response in the NAFLD group."
https://openalex.org/W3092200531,"Background Recently, myocardial work analysis as an echocardiographic tool to non-invasively determine LV work has been introduced and validated against invasive measurements. Based on systolic blood pressure and speckle-tracking derived longitudinal strain (GLS) during systole and isovolumic relaxation, it is considered less load-dependent than LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or GLS and to integrate information on LV active systolic and diastolic work. Objectives We aimed to establish reference values for global constructive (GCW) and global wasted work (GWW) as well as of global work index (GWI) and global work efficiency (GWE) across a wide age range and to assess the association with standard echocardiography parameters to estimate the potential additional information provided by myocardial work (MyW). Methods The Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure STAges A/B and Determinants of Progression (STAAB) cohort study carefully characterized a representative sample of the population of the City of Würzburg, Germany, aged 30–79 years. We performed myocardial work analysis using the standardized, quality-controlled transthoracic echocardiograms of all individuals lacking any cardiovascular risk factor. Results Out of 4965 participants, 779 (49±10 years, 59% women) were eligible for the present analysis. Levels of GCW, GWW, and GWE were independent of sex and body mass index, and were stable until the age of 45 years. Thereafter, we observed an upward shift to further stable values of GCW and a linear increase of GWW with advancing age, resulting in lower GWE. Age-adjusted percentiles for GCW, GWW, GWI, and GWE were derived. Higher levels of blood pressure or LV mass were associated with higher GCW, GWI, and GWW, resulting in lower GWE; higher LVEF correlated with higher GCW and GWI, but lower GWW. Higher E/e´ correlated with higher GWW, higher e´ with lower GWW. Conclusions Derived from a large sample of apparently healthy individuals from a population based-cohort, we provide age-adjusted reference values for myocardial work indices, applicable for either sex. Weak correlations with common echocardiographic parameters suggest MyW indices to potentially provide additional information, which has to be evaluated in diseased patient cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3092358047,"Background SARS-Cov2 infection may trigger lung inflammation and acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome (ARDS) that requires active ventilation and may have fatal outcome. Considering the severity of the disease and the lack of active treatments, 14 patients with Covid-19 and severe lung inflammation received inhaled adenosine in the attempt to therapeutically compensate for the oxygen-related loss of the endogenous adenosine→A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR)-mediated mitigation of the lung-destructing inflammatory damage. This off label-treatment was based on preclinical studies in mice with LPS-induced ARDS, where inhaled adenosine/A2AR agonists protected oxygenated lungs from the deadly inflammatory damage. The treatment was allowed, considering that adenosine has several clinical applications. Patients and treatment Fourteen consecutively enrolled patients with Covid19-related interstitial pneumonitis and PaO2/FiO2 ratio<300 received off-label-treatment with 9 mg inhaled adenosine every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and subsequently, every 24 days for the next 4 days. Fifty-two patients with analogue features and hospitalized between February and April 2020, who did not receive adenosine, were considered as a historical control group. Patients monitoring also included hemodynamic/hematochemical studies, CTscans, and SARS-CoV2-tests. Results The treatment was well tolerated with no hemodynamic change and one case of moderate bronchospasm. A significant increase (> 30%) in the PaO2/FiO2-ratio was reported in 13 out of 14 patients treated with adenosine compared with that observed in 7 out of52 patients in the control within 15 days. Additionally, we recorded a mean PaO2/FiO2-ratio increase (215 ± 45 vs. 464 ± 136, P = 0.0002) in patients receiving adenosine and no change in the control group (210±75 vs. 250±85 at 120 hours, P>0.05). A radiological response was demonstrated in 7 patients who received adenosine, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA load rapidly decreased in 13 cases within 7 days while no changes were recorded in the control group within 15 days. There was one Covid-19 related death in the experimental group and 11in the control group. Conclusion Our short-term analysis suggests the overall safety and beneficial therapeutic effect of inhaled adenosine in patients with Covid-19-inflammatory lung disease suggesting further investigation in controlled clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3092355102,"Climate change is one of the most significant causes of species range shift and extinction. Based on a citizen science dataset of birds in China, the Bird Report, we developed a high-resolution map of bird species richness in China, and simulated the range shifts and area changes of the 1,042 birds through the year 2070 using three different General Circulation Models and two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, including RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). It was found that 241–244 (under different scenarios) bird species would lose a portion of their distribution ranges; and that most species in China would move to either higher elevations or northward. The other 798–801 species would experience range expansion. Compared to resident species (n = 516), migratory birds (n = 526) may undergo more limited range expansion but a longer range shift distance on average. The species diversity of birds will considerably increase in areas higher than 1,500 m in elevation under both RCPs. Conservation priorities with higher species richness were also identified using the Zonation model. The existing national nature reserves are not sufficient for protecting important bird habitats, especially after range shifts. Significant gaps in protected areas were observed in the northern Xinjiang, southern Tibet, Greater Khingan, Sanjiang Plain, Songnen Plain, northern Bohai Rim, and southeastern coastline areas. Many of these areas are characterized by high human populations and intensive development, and establishing sizable protected areas has become difficult. Inclusive conservation mechanisms that include restoring habitats in urban parks and sharing habitats in farmland areas, may be a feasible solution."
https://openalex.org/W3092618382,"Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] is one of the important climate-resilient legume crops for food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia is believed to harbor high cowpea genetic diversity, but this has not yet been efficiently characterized and exploited in breeding. The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent and pattern of genetic diversity in 357 cowpea accestions comprising landraces (87%), breeding lines (11%) and released varieties (2%), using single nucleotide polymorphism markers. The overall gene diversity and heterozygosity were 0.28 and 0.12, respectively. The genetic diversity indices indicated substantial diversity in Ethiopian cowpea landraces. Analysis of molecular variance showed that most of the variation was within in the population (46%) and 44% between individuals, with only 10% of the variation being among populations. Model-based ancestry analysis, the phylogenetic tree, discriminant analysis of principal components and principal coordinate analysis classified the 357 genotypes into three well-differentiated genetic populations. Genotypes from the same region grouped into different clusters, while others from different regions fell into the same cluster. This indicates that differences in regions of origin may not be the main driver determining the genetic diversity in cowpea in Ethiopia. Therefore, differences in sources of origin, as currently distributed in Ethiopia, should not necessarily be used as indices of genetic diversity. Choice of parental lines should rather be based on a systematic assessment of genetic diversity in a specific population. The study also suggested 94 accesstions as core collection which retained 100% of the genetic diversity from the entire collection. This core set represents 26% of the entire collection pinpointing a wide distribution of the diversity within the ethiopian landraces. The outcome of this study provided new insights into the genetic diversity and population structure in Ethiopian cowpea genetic resources for designing effective collection and conservation strategies for efficient utilization in breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3092037991,"During the past decades, heavy metal pollution in agricultural soil and its impact on human health have been becoming one of the most important global environmental problems. In this research, heavy metal (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd, Ni, As, Hg) concentrations were measured for four hundred and two soil samples collected from agricultural area within the Guangzhou-Foshan urban zone. Soil heavy metal pollution was evaluated used geoaccumulation index and potential ecological risk index. The dose response model proposed by the USEPA was used to estimate the potential health risk caused by heavy metals in agricultural soil. The results showed that: 1) Cd and Hg were the main heavy metal pollutants in agricultural soil of the study area. 89.1% and 93.3% of total soil samples suffered medium to heavy potential ecological risk caused by Cd and Hg, respectively. 2) The THI and TCR were respectively greater than 1.0 and 1.0×10-4, indicating that heavy metals in agricultural soil were likely to constitute non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, both of which were mainly brought by product consumption, to the public in the study area. The non-carcinogenic risks were mainly caused by Cr and As, while the carcinogenic risks were mainly from Cr, Cd, and As."
https://openalex.org/W3091814886,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is the keystone pathogen of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease which causes tooth loss and deterioration of gingiva. Medicinal plants have been traditionally used for oral hygiene and health and might play a role as antibacterial agents against oral pathogens. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of plants used for oral hygiene or symptoms of periodontitis against P. gingivalis. We first reviewed the literature to identify plant species used for oral hygiene or symptoms of periodontitis. Then, we cross-checked this species list with our in-house library of plant extracts to select extracts for testing. Antibacterial activity tests were then performed for each plant extract against P. gingivalis, and their cytotoxicity was assessed on HaCaT cells. The selectivity index (SI) was then calculated. A total of 416 plant species belonging to 110 families and 305 genera were documented through our literature search, and 158 plant species were noted as being used by North American Native peoples Once cross-checked with the extracts contained in our library of natural products, 30 matches were identified and 21 were defined as high priority. Of the 109 extracts from 21 plant species selected and tested, 21 extracts from 11 plants had higher than 90% inhibition on P. gingivalis at 64 μg/mL and were further selected for MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) assays. Out of 21 plant extracts, 13 extracts (7 plant species) had a SI > 10. Pistacia lentiscus fruits showed the best MIC with value of 8 μg/mL, followed by Zanthoxylum armatum fruits/seeds with a MIC of 16 μg/mL. P. lentiscus fruits also showed the highest SI of 256. Most of the extracts tested present promising antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity. Further testing for biofilm eradication and examination of activity against other dental pathogens and oral commensals should be performed to confirm the potential of these extracts as antibacterial agents. Future work will focus on application of a bioassay-guided fractionation approach to isolating and identifying the most active natural products in the top performing extracts. This study can serve as a basis for their future development as ingredients for oral hygiene products."
https://openalex.org/W3092521025,"Modern day investigation in fields of archaeology and palaeontology can be greatly characterised by an exponential growth of integrated new technologies, nevertheless, while these advances are of great significance to multiple lines of research, their evaluation and update over time is equally as important. Here we present an application of inter and intra-observer analysis in taphonomy based geometric morphometrics, employing robust non-parametric statistical analyses for the study of experimental carnivore tooth pit morphologies. To fully understand the influence of measurement errors in the collection of this data, our statistical assessment was performed on fully superimposed, partially superimposed and raw landmark coordinates collected from 3D surface scanning. Experimental samples used to assess these errors includes wolf and dog tooth pits used in modern day ecological livestock predation analysis. Results obtained from this study highlight the importance of landmark type in the assessment of error, emphasising the value of semi-landmark models over the use of ambiguous Type III landmarks. In addition to this, data also reveals the importance of observer experience for the collection of data alongside an interesting increase in error when working with fully superimposed landmarks due to the Pinocchio Effect. Through this study we are able to redefine the geometric morphometric models used for tooth pit morphological analyses. This final hybrid Type II fixed landmark and semi-landmark model presents a significant reduction in human induced error, generating a more metrically reliable and replicable method that can be used for data pooling in future inter-institutional research. These results can be considered a fundamental step forward for carnivore inspired studies, having an impact on archaeological, palaeontological, modern-day ecological research as well as applications in other forensic sciences."
https://openalex.org/W3092645342,"Heat poses an urgent threat to public health in cities, as the urban heat island (UHI) effect can amplify exposures, contributing to high heat-related mortality and morbidity. Urban trees have the potential to mitigate heat by providing substantial cooling, as well as co-benefits such as reductions in energy consumption. The City of Boston has attempted to expand its urban canopy, yet maintenance costs and high tree mortality have hindered successful canopy expansion. Here, we present an interactive web application called Right Place, Right Tree-Boston that aims to support informed decision-making for planting new trees. To highlight priority regions for canopy expansion, we developed a Boston-specific Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) and present this alongside maps of summer daytime land surface temperatures. We also provide information about tree pests and diseases, suitability of species for various conditions, land ownership, maintenance tips, and alternatives to tree planting. This web application is designed to support decision-making at multiple spatial scales, to assist city officials as well as residents who are interested in expanding or maintaining Boston's urban forest."
https://openalex.org/W3092144870,"Description of the spatial characteristics of viral dispersal is important in understanding the history of infections. Nine hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes (A-I), and a putative 10th genotype (J), with distinct geographical distribution, are recognized. In sub-Saharan Africa (sub)-genotypes A1, D3 and E circulate, with E predominating in western Africa (WA), where HBV is hyperendemic. The low genetic diversity of genotype E (HBV/E) suggests its recent emergence. Our aim was to study the dispersal of HBV/E using full-length, non-redundant and non-recombinant sequences available in public databases. HBV/E was confirmed, and the phylogeny reconstruction performed using maximum likelihood (ML) with bootstrapping. Phylogeographic analysis was conducted by reconstruction of ancestral states using the criterion of parsimony on the estimated ML phylogeny. 46.5% of HBV/E sequences were found within monophyletic clusters. Country-wise analysis revealed the existence of 50 regional clusters. Sequences from WA were located close to the root of the tree, indicating this region as the most probable origin of the HBV/E epidemic and expanded to other geographical regions, within and outside of Africa. A localized dispersal was observed with sequences from Nigeria and Guinea as compared to other WA countries. Based on the sequences available in the databases, the phylogenetic results suggest that European strains originated primarily from WA whereas a majority of American strains originated in Western Central Africa. The differences in regional dispersal patterns of HBV/E suggest limited cross-border transmissions because of restricted population movements."
https://openalex.org/W3092612321,"Shifting cultivation has resulted in large-scale deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics; however the abandoned fallows are known to have high potential for carbon capture. The paper is an attempt to determine the forest recovery patterns following shifting cultivation by evaluating the tree species composition, diversity and abundance with respect to topographical factors in Manipur, India. We also used ordination analysis to understand the change in species composition with regard to environmental variables. The living woody biomass carbon of each fallow was quantified, and the factors affecting the recovery of carbon stock along an increasing fallow gradient was assessed. Our results showed that the species richness and basal area recovered relatively with time since abandonment, and the north-facing lower elevation fallow sites displayed higher species richness and stem density than those in higher elevations. Environmental variables had no impact on the regeneration of Elaeocarpus floribundus Blume and Castanopsis hystrix Hook. f. & Thomson ex A. DC. which suggests that they may be capable of effective restoration of degraded forest areas. As these species appear naturally in the forests, it would facilitate quicker rehabilitation and reinstate the soil nutrients making the soil reusable in a short term. We also found that fallow age plays a vital role in recovering above-ground biomass carbon from living woody species followed by the aspect of the site. The total living woody biomass carbon ranged from 0.98 Mg ha-1 in 5 years fallow to 142.58 Mg ha-1 in 20 years fallow. The above-ground biomass carbon recovery of the oldest fallow was 39% to 40% of the reference undisturbed forest and the estimated time for the shifting cultivation fallows to reach that of the undisturbed forest level was approximately 39 years to 41 years."
https://openalex.org/W3092491824,"Objective To solicit leading health informaticians’ predictions about the impact of AI/ML on primary care in the US in 2029. Design A three-round online modified Delphi poll. Participants Twenty-nine leading health informaticians. Methods In September 2019, health informatics experts were selected by the research team, and invited to participate the Delphi poll. Participation in each round was anonymous, and panelists were given between 4–8 weeks to respond to each round. In Round 1 open-ended questions solicited forecasts on the impact of AI/ML on: (1) patient care, (2) access to care, (3) the primary care workforce, (4) technological breakthroughs, and (5) the long-future for primary care physicians. Responses were coded to produce itemized statements. In Round 2, participants were invited to rate their agreement with each item along 7-point Likert scales. Responses were analyzed for consensus which was set at a predetermined interquartile range of ≤ 1. In Round 3 items that did not reach consensus were redistributed. Results A total of 16 experts participated in Round 1 (16/29, 55%). Of these experts 13/16 (response rate, 81%), and 13/13 (response rate, 100%), responded to Rounds 2 and 3, respectively. As a result of developments in AI/ML by 2029 experts anticipated workplace changes including incursions into the disintermediation of physician expertise, and increased AI/ML training requirements for medical students. Informaticians also forecast that by 2029 AI/ML will increase diagnostic accuracy especially among those with limited access to experts, minorities and those with rare diseases. Expert panelists also predicted that AI/ML-tools would improve access to expert doctor knowledge. Conclusions This study presents timely information on informaticians’ consensus views about the impact of AI/ML on US primary care in 2029. Preparation for the near-future of primary care will require improved levels of digital health literacy among patients and physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3092606382,"The outcomes of species interactions–such as those between predators and prey–increasingly depend on environmental conditions that are modified by human activities. Light is among the most fundamental environmental parameters, and humans have dramatically altered natural light regimes across much of the globe through the addition of artificial light at night (ALAN). The consequences for species interactions, communities and ecosystems are just beginning to be understood. Here we present findings from a replicated field experiment that simulated over-the-water lighting in the littoral zone of a small lake. We evaluated responses by emergent aquatic insects and terrestrial invertebrate communities, and riparian predators (tetragnathid spiders). On average ALAN plots had 51% more spiders than control plots that were not illuminated. Mean individual spider body mass was greater in ALAN plots relative to controls, an effect that was strongly sex-dependent; mean male body mass was 34% greater in ALAN plots while female body mass was 176% greater. The average number of prey items captured in spider webs was 139% greater on ALAN mesocosms, an effect attributed to emergent aquatic insects. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and a multiple response permutation procedure revealed significantly different invertebrate communities captured in pan traps positioned in ALAN plots and controls. Control plots had taxonomic-diversity values (as H’) that were 58% greater than ALAN plots, and communities that were 83% more-even. We attribute these differences to the aquatic family Caenidae which was the dominant family across both light treatments, but was 818% more abundant in ALAN plots. Our findings show that when ALAN is located in close proximity to freshwater it can concentrate fluxes of emergent aquatic insects, and that terrestrial predators in the littoral zone can compound this effect and intercept resource flows, preventing them from entering the terrestrial realm."
https://openalex.org/W3092428809,"Wildlife disease surveillance and pathogen detection are fundamental for conservation, population sustainability, and public health. Detection of pathogens in snakes is often overlooked despite their essential roles as both predators and prey within their communities. Ophidiomycosis (formerly referred to as Snake Fungal Disease, SFD), an emergent disease on the North American landscape caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, poses a threat to snake population health and stability. We tested 657 individual snakes representing 58 species in 31 states from 56 military bases in the continental US and Puerto Rico for O. ophiodiicola. Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola DNA was detected in samples from 113 snakes for a prevalence of 17.2% (95% CI: 14.4–20.3%), representing 25 species from 19 states/territories, including the first reports of the pathogen in snakes in Idaho, Oklahoma, and Puerto Rico. Most animals were ophidiomycosis negative (n = 462), with Ophidiomyces detected by qPCR (n = 64), possible ophidiomycosis (n = 82), and apparent ophidiomycosis (n = 49) occurring less frequently. Adults had 2.38 times greater odds than juveniles of being diagnosed with ophidiomycosis. Snakes from Georgia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia all had greater odds of ophidiomycosis diagnosis, while snakes from Idaho were less likely to be diagnosed with ophidiomycosis. The results of this survey indicate that this pathogen is endemic in the eastern US and identified new sites that could represent emergence or improved detection of endemic sites. The direct mortality of snakes with ophidiomycosis is unknown from this study, but the presence of numerous individuals with clinical disease warrants further investigation and possible conservation action."
https://openalex.org/W3092455073,"The aim of this study was to look at how the composition and morphology of polymer scaffolds could be altered to create an optimized environment for endothelial cells. Four polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were electrospun with increasing fibre diameters ranging from 1.64 μm to 4.83 μm. The scaffolds were seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and cultured for 12 days. PCL scaffolds were then electrospun incorporating decellularized bovine aorta ECM and cultured in a hypoxic environment. We noted deeper cell infiltration on the largest fibre diameter compared to the other three scaffolds which resulted in an increase in the gene expression of CD31; a key angiogenic marker. Increased cell viability and cell proliferation were also noted on the largest fibre. Furthermore, we noted that the incorporation of extracellular matrix (ECM) had minimal effect on cell viability, both in normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. Our results showed that these environments had limited influences on hypoxic gene expression. Interestingly, the major findings from this study was the production of excretory ECM components as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The results from this study suggest that fibre diameter had a bigger impact on the seeded HUVECs than the incorporation of ECM or the culture conditions. The largest fibre dimeter (4.83 μm) is more suitable for seeding of HUVECs."
https://openalex.org/W3091925169,"Background Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized form of adipose tissue, able to increase energy expenditure by heat generation in response to various stimuli. Recently, its pathological activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia. To establish a causal relationship, we retrospectively investigated the longitudinal changes in BAT and cancer in a large FDG-PET/CT cohort. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 13 461 FDG-PET/CT examinations of n = 8 409 patients at our institution from the winter months of 2007–2015. We graded the activation strength of BAT based on the anatomical location of the most caudally activated BAT depot into three tiers, and the stage of the cancer into five general grades. We validated the cancer grading by an interreader analysis and correlation with histopathological stage. Ambient temperature data (seven-day average before the examination) was obtained from a meteorological station close to the hospital. Changes of BAT, cancer, body mass index (BMI) and temperature between the different examinations were examined with Spearman’s test and a mixed linear model for correlation, and with a causal inference algorithm for causality. Results We found n = 283 patients with at least two examinations and active BAT in at least one of them. There was no significant interaction between the changes in BAT activation, cancer burden or BMI. Temperature changes exhibited a strong negative correlation with BAT activity (ϱ = -0.57, p<0.00001). These results were confirmed with the mixed linear model. Causal inference revealed a link of Temperature ➜ BAT in all subjects and also of BMI ➜ BAT in subjects who had lost weight and increased cancer burden, but no role of cancer and no causal links of BAT ➜ BMI. Conclusions Our data did not confirm the hypothesis that BAT plays a major role in cancer-mediated weight loss. Temperature changes are the main driver of incidental BAT activity on FDG-PET scans."
https://openalex.org/W3091887222,"Highly pathogenic (HPAI) strains emerge from their low pathogenic (LPAI) precursors and cause severe disease in poultry with enormous economic losses, and zoonotic potential. Understanding the mechanisms involved in HPAI emergence is thus an important goal for risk assessments. In this study ostrich-origin H5N2 and H7N1 LPAI progenitor viruses were serially passaged seventeen times in 14-day old embryonated chicken eggs and Ion Torrent ultra-deep sequencing was used to monitor the incremental changes in the consensus genome sequences. Both virus strains increased in virulence with successive passages, but the H7N1 virus attained a virulent phenotype sooner. Mutations V63M, E228V and D272G in the HA protein, Q357K in the nucleoprotein (NP) and H155P in the neuraminidase protein correlated with the increased pathogenicity of the H5N2 virus; whereas R584H and L589I substitutions in the polymerase B2 protein, A146T and Q220E in HA plus D231N in the matrix 1 protein correlated with increased pathogenicity of the H7N1 virus in embryos. Enzymatic cleavage of HA protein is the critical virulence determinant, and HA cleavage site motifs containing multibasic amino acids were detected at the sub-consensus level. The motifs PQERRR/GLF and PQRERR/GLF were first detected in passages 11 and 15 respectively of the H5N2 virus, and in the H7N1 virus the motifs PELPKGKK/GLF and PELPKRR/GLF were detected as early as passage 7. Most significantly, a 13 nucleotide insert of unknown origin was identified at passage 6 of the H5N2 virus, and at passage 17 a 42 nucleotide insert derived from the influenza NP gene was identified. This is the first report of non-homologous recombination at the HA cleavage site in an H5 subtype virus. This study provides insights into how HPAI viruses emerge from low pathogenic precursors and demonstrated the pathogenic potential of H5N2 and H7N1 strains that have not yet been implicated in HPAI outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3091916200,"Objective We aim to explore the barriers to accessing modern healthcare services in two tribal populations in Assam. Methods In March 2018, we conducted qualitative research through 60 in-depth interviews with men and women aged 15 to 50 from Bodo and Rabha tribes in Udalguri and Baksa districts of Assam. We interviewed a group of health-service providers from public health facilities to understand the demand-supply balance in those facilities. Findings On the demand side, direct and indirect financial obstacles, distance to health facilities, poor public transportation, perceived negative behavior of hospital staff, and lack of infrastructure were the main barriers to utilizing healthcare facilities. On the supply side, doctors and nurses in government health facilities were overburdened by demand due to a lack of human resources. Conclusions Our study highlights the barriers to utilizing health facilities; these are not always driven by factors linked to the patient’s socio-economic status but also depend significantly on the quality of the health services and other contextual factors. Although the government has made efforts to improve the rural healthcare system through national-level programs, our qualitative study shows that these programs have not been successful in enhancing the rural healthcare system in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W3092325832,"Background The rate of Caesarean Section (CS) deliveries has shown an alarming rise in recent years. CS is a surgical procedure used when there is apprehension of risk to the life of mother or baby in case of vaginal delivery, but its rates higher than 10–15 per cent are not justifiable. It is well recognised that a CS delivery could have a large number of adverse impacts on women and infants. Several studies, especially in developing countries, have revealed that delivery in private hospitals is one of the most contributing factors in CS deliveries. The present study conceptualises a causal pathway in which the possible risk factors, socio-economic, maternal and pregnancy-related, as well as institutional, influence the chances of CS delivery. It is hypothesised that certain factors would contribute to CS deliveries largely indirectly through the place of delivery, that is, either a public or private institution. Methods and findings To test the hypotheses, this study analysed 146,280 most recent live births delivered in hospitals during the five years preceding the fourth round of India’s National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), carried out during 2015–2016. The analysis, using generalised structural equation modelling (GSEM), revealed that many exogenous variables considered in the path models influence CS deliveries significantly, directly and/or indirectly through the place of delivery factor. Prominent among these are wealth index and receiving ANC services at only private hospitals; the total effects of these variables are even higher than the direct/total effect of place of delivery. Conclusion From this finding, it could be said that the place of delivery is a proximate determinant of a CS delivery or a mediator of other co-factors. Interventions to curb higher CS deliveries should be focused on improving the quality of public health sectors and on developing protocols for CS deliveries."
https://openalex.org/W3091789137,"Background The detection of wheezes as an exacerbation sign is important in certain respiratory diseases. However, few highly accurate clinical methods are available for automatic detection of wheezes in children. This study aimed to develop a wheeze detection algorithm for practical implementation in children. Methods A wheeze recognition algorithm was developed based on wheezes features following the Computerized Respiratory Sound Analysis guidelines. Wheezes can be detected by auscultation with a stethoscope and using an automatic computerized lung sound analysis. Lung sounds were recorded for 30 s in 214 children aged 2 months to 12 years and 11 months in a pediatric consultation room. Files containing recorded lung sounds were assessed by two specialist physicians and divided into two groups: 65 were designated as “wheeze” files, and 149 were designated as “no-wheeze” files. All lung sound judgments were agreed between two specialist physicians. We compared wheeze recognition between the specialist physicians and using the wheeze recognition algorithm and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for all recorded sound files to evaluate the influence of age on the wheeze detection sensitivity. Results The detection of wheezes was not influenced by age. In all files, wheezes were differentiated from noise using the wheeze recognition algorithm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the wheeze recognition algorithm were 100%, 95.7%, 90.3%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions The wheeze recognition algorithm could identify wheezes in sound files and therefore may be useful in the practical implementation of respiratory illness management at home using properly developed devices."
https://openalex.org/W3092580385,"Objective Melanoma is rare but dangerous skin cancer, and it can spread rather quickly in the advanced stages of the tumor. Abundant evidence suggests the relationship between tumor development and progression and the immune system. A robust gene risk model could provide an accurate prediction of clinical outcomes. The present study aimed to explore a robust signature of immune-related gene pairs (IRGPs) for estimating overall survival (OS) in malignant melanoma. Methods Clinical and genetic data of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was performed as a training dataset to identify candidate IRGPs for the prognosis of melanoma. Two independent datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE65904) and TCGA dataset (TCGA-UVM) were selected for external validation. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were then performed to explore the prognostic power of the IRGPs signature and other clinical factors. CIBERSORTx was applied to estimate the fractions of infiltrated immune cells in bulk tumor tissues. Results A signature consisted of 33 IRGPs was established which was significantly associated with patients’ survival in the TCGA-SKCM dataset (P = 2.0×10−16, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 4.220 (2.909 to 6.122)). We found the IRGPs signature exhibited an independent prognostic factor in all the three independent cohorts in both the univariate and multivariate Cox analysis (P<0.01). The prognostic efficacy of the signature remained unaffected regardless of whether BRAF or NRAS was mutated. As expected, the results were verified in the GSE65904 dataset and the TCGA-UVM dataset. We found an apparent shorter OS in patients of the high-risk group in the GSE65904 dataset (P = 2.1×10−3; HR = 1.988 (1.309 to 3.020)). The trend in the results of the survival analysis in TCGA-UVM was as we expected, but the result was not statistically significant (P = 0.117, HR = 4.263 (1.407 to 12.91)). CD8 T cells, activated dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and activated CD4 memory T cells presented a significantly lower fraction in the high-risk group in the TCGA-SKCM dataset(P <0.01). Conclusion The results of the present study support the IRGPs signature as a promising marker for prognosis prediction in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3092161080,"Successful publishing of an article depends on several factors, including the structure of the main text, the so-called introduction, methods, results and discussion structure (IMRAD). The first objective of our work is to provide recent results on the number of paragraphs (pars.) per section used in articles published in major medical journals. Our second objective is the investigation of other structural elements, i.e., number of tables, figures and references and the availability of supplementary material. We analyzed data from randomly selected original articles published in years 2005, 2010 and 2015 from the journals The BMJ, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine and PLOS Medicine. Per journal and year 30 articles were investigated. Random effect meta-analyses were performed to provide pooled estimates. The effect of time was analyzed by linear mixed models. All articles followed the IMRAD structure. The number of pars. per section increased for all journals over time with 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70–1.46) pars. per every two years. The largest increase was observed for the methods section (0.29 pars. per year; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19–0.39). PLOS Medicine had the highest number of pars. The number of tables did not change, but number of figures and references increased slightly. Not only the standard IMRAD structure should be used to increase the likelihood for publication of an article but also the general layout of the target journal. Supplementary material has become standard. If no journal-specific information is available, authors should use 3/10/9/8 pars. for the introduction/methods/results/discussion sections."
https://openalex.org/W3091832104,"Arachidonic acid (ARA) is an integral constituent of the biological cell membrane, conferring it with fluidity and flexibility, which are necessary for the function of all cells, especially nervous system, skeletal muscle, and immune system. Codium species biosynthesize sulfated polysaccharides with very distinct structural features. Some of them have different biological activities with great potential in pharmaceutical applications. In this study, anionic macromolecules extracted from Codium fragile were investigated for their cooperative immune-enhancing activities with ARA. The cooperation between ARA and Codium resulted in increased, dose-dependent nitric oxide production and iNOS gene expression. In addition, co-treatment of ARA and Codium effectively increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), compared with Codium alone. We also demonstrated that the expression of COX-2 mRNA was also increased, which is responsible for the production of inflammatory mediator prostaglandins and their metabolites. Compared to the Codium group, the co-treatment of Codium with ARA enhanced the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB p-65, p38, and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2, indicating that this combination stimulated immune response through nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. These results indicated that the coordination of arachidonic acid with polysaccharide extracted from seaweed may be a potential source of immunomodulatory molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3092581632,"Background Global HIV funding cutbacks have been accompanied by the adoption of user fees to address funding gaps in treatment programs. Our objective was to assess the impact of user fees on HIV care utilization and medication adherence in Nigeria. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in care before (October 2012-September 2013) and after (October 2014-September 2015) the introduction of user fees in a Nigerian clinic. We assessed pre- vs. post-user fee patient characteristics and enrollment trends, and determined risk of care interruption, loss to follow-up, and optimal medication adherence. Results After fees were instituted, there was a 66% decline in patient enrollment and 75% decline in number of ART doses dispensed. There was no difference in the proportion of female clients (64% vs 63%, p = 0.46), average age (36 vs. 37 years, p = 0.15), or median baseline CD4 (220/ul vs. 222/uL, p = 0.24) in pre- and post-fee cohorts. There was an increase in clients employed and/or had tertiary education (24% vs. 32%, p<0.001). Compared to pre-fee patients, the post-fee period had a 48% decreased risk of care interruption (aRR = 0.52, 95%CI:0.39–0.69), 22% decreased LTFU risk (aRR = 0.64, 95%CI:0.96), and 27% decreased odds of optimal medication adherence (aOR = 0.7, 3 95%CI 0.59–0.89). Conclusions Patients enrolled in care after introduction of user fees in Nigeria were more likely to be educated or employed, and effectively retained in care after starting ART. However, fees were accompanied by a drastic reduction in new patient enrollment, suggesting that many patients may have been marginalized from HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W3091865505,"Human subsistence societies have thrived in environmental extremes while maintaining biodiversity through social learning of ecological knowledge, such as techniques to prepare food and medicine from local resources. However, there is limited understanding of which processes shape social learning patterns and configuration in ecological knowledge networks, or how these processes apply to resource management and biological conservation. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the prestige (rarity or exclusivity) of knowledge shapes social learning networks. In addition, we test whether people tend to select who to learn from based on prestige (knowledge or reputation), and homophily (e.g., people of the same age or gender). We used interviews to assess five types of medicinal plant knowledge and how 303 people share this knowledge across four villages in Solomon Islands. We developed exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to test whether hypothesized patterns of knowledge sharing based on prestige and homophily are more common in the observed network than in randomly simulated networks of the same size. We found that prestige predicts five hypothesized network configurations and all three hypothesized learning patterns, while homophily predicts one of three hypothesized network configurations and five of the seven hypothesized learning patterns. These results compare the strength of different prestige and homophily effects on social learning and show how cultural practices such as intermarriage can affect certain aspects of prestige and homophily. By advancing our understanding of how prestige and homophily affect ecological knowledge networks, we identify which social learning patterns have the largest effects on biocultural conservation of ecological knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3091955865,"Oral health conditions and cerebral small vessel disease, such as white matter lesions or cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), are associated with the incidence of stroke. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between oral health conditions (serum IgG titers of periodontal pathogens) with the presence or severity of CMBs in acute stroke patients. From January 2013 to April 2016, acute stroke patients were registered in two hospitals. Serum samples were evaluated for antibody titers against 9 periodontal pathogens using the ELISA method. The cut-off points for reactivity (the positive decision point) to each antigen were defined as more than a mean ELISA unit + 1 standard deviation (after logarithmic transformation) in all subjects. CMBs were evaluated on T2*-weighted MRI. In all, 639 patients were evaluated (ischemic, n = 533 and hemorrhagic, n = 106; 73.1 ± 12.9 years old). Among these patients, 627 were available for CMB evaluation. Among the 9 evaluated periodontal pathogens, only Campylobacter rectus (C. rectus) was associated with the presence of CMBs. the prevalence of positive serum antibody titers against C. rectus was higher among patients with CMBs than among those without CMBs (14.6% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.025). In addition, positive serum antibody titers against C. rectus remained one of the factors associated with the presence of CMBs in multivariate logistic analysis (odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval 1.19-3.47, P = 0.010). A positive serum antibody titer against C. rectus was associated with the presence of CMBs in acute stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W3091992085,"Introduction Core symptomatology in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) points at dysfunction in the mesencephalon and pons indicating pathological changes in these regions, but only a few studies have addressed the issue. The aim of this study was to investigate diffusion (ADC) and perfusion patterns pre- and postoperatively in these areas in iNPH. Methods Twenty iNPH patients and 15 healthy controls were included. Patients underwent a clinical examination and brain MRI pre- and 3–6 months postoperatively. The MRI-scan included diffusion and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion weighted sequences. Regions of interest in the mesencephalon and pons were drawn on a FLAIR sequence and co-registered to ADC maps and perfusion data. Results There were no significant differences in pre or postoperative ADC compared to the control group, however postoperative ADC increased by 10% (p = 0.026) in the mesencephalon and 6% (p = 0.016) in the pons in all patients and also in the subgroup of shunt responders by 11% (p = 0.021) and 4% (p = 0.020), respectively. Preoperative relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was similar in iNPH patients and controls. Postoperatively, rCBF increased in shunt responders by 6% (p = 0.02) in the mesencephalon and 11% (p = 0.004) in the pons. This increase correlated with the degree of clinical improvement (rs = 0.80, p = 0.031 and rs = 0.66, p = 0.021, respectively). Conclusion The postoperative increase in ADC and the correlation between postoperative increase in rCBF and clinical improvement in the mesencephalon and pons shown in this study point at an involvement of these areas in the core pathophysiology and its reversibility in iNPH."
https://openalex.org/W3092145671,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, X-chromosome linked muscle-wasting disease affecting about 1 in 3500-6000 boys worldwide. Myofibre necrosis and subsequent loss of muscle mass are due to several molecular sequelae, such as inflammation and oxidative stress. We have recently shown increased neutrophils, highly reactive oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) generation by myeloperoxidase (MPO), and associated oxidative stress in muscle from the GRMD dog and mdx mouse models for DMD. These findings have led us to hypothesise that generation of HOCl by myeloperoxidase released from neutrophils has a significant role in dystropathology. Since access to muscle from DMD patients is limited, the aim of this study was to develop methods to study this pathway in urine. Using immunoblotting to measure markers of protein oxidation, we show increased labelling of proteins with antibodies to dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP, oxidative damage) and DiBrY (halogenation by reactive oxidants from myeloperoxidase) in GRMD and mdx urine. A strong positive correlation was observed between DiBrY labelling in dog urine and muscle. A strong positive correlation was also observed when comparing DNP and DiBrY labelling (in muscle and urine) to markers of dystropathology (plasma creatine kinase) and neutrophil presence (muscle MPO). Our results indicate the presence of neutrophil mediated oxidative stress in both models, and suggest that urine is a suitable bio-fluid for the measurement of such biomarkers. These methods could be employed in future studies into the role of neutrophil mediated oxidative stress in DMD and other inflammatory pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3092220942,"This study aimed to analyze the factors associated with likely TB deaths, likely TB-related deaths and deaths from other causes. Understanding the factors associated with mortality could help the strategy to End TB, especially the goal of reducing TB deaths by 95% between 2015 and 2035.A retrospective, population-based cohort study of the causes of death was performed using a competing risk model in patients receiving treatment for TB. Patients had started TB treatment in Brazil 2008-2013 with any death certificates dated in the same period. We used three categories of deaths, according to ICD-10 codes: i) probable TB deaths; ii) TB-related deaths; iii) deaths from other causes.In this cohort, 39,997 individuals (14.1%) died, out of a total of 283,508 individuals. Of these, 8,936 were probable TB deaths (22.4%) and 3,365 TB-related deaths (8.4%), illustrating high mortality rates. 27,696 deaths (69.2%) were from other causes. From our analysis, factors strongly associated with probable TB deaths were male gender (sHR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.26-1.40), age over 60 years (sHR = 9.29, 95% CI: 8.15-10.60), illiterate schooling (sHR = 2.33, 95% CI: 2.09-2.59), black (sHR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.26-1.40) and brown (sHR = 13, 95% CI: 1.07-1.19) color/race, from the Southern region (sHR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.28), clinical mixed forms (sHR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.73-2.11) and alcoholism (sHR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.81-2.00). Also, HIV positive serology was strongly associated with probable TB deaths (sHR = 62.78; 95% CI: 55.01-71.63).In conclusion, specific strategies for active surveillance and early case detection can reduce mortality among patients with tuberculosis, leading to more timely detection and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3092449105,"Species of the perennial woody plant genus Betula dominate subalpine forests and play a significant role in preserving biological diversity. In addition to their conventional benefits, birches synthesize a wide range of secondary metabolites having pharmacological significance. Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is one of these naturally occurring compounds constitutively produced by different birch species. MeSA is therapeutically important in human medicine for muscle injuries and joint pain. However, MeSA is now mainly produced synthetically due to a lack of information relating to MeSA biosynthesis and regulation. In this study, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of two candidate genes mediating MeSA biosynthesis, SALICYLIC ACID METHYLTRANSFERASE (SAMT) and SALICYLIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN 2 (SABP2), of high (B. lenta, B. alleghaniensis, B. medwediewii, and B. grossa) and low (B. pendula, B. utilis, B. alnoides, and B. nana) MeSA-producing birch species. Phylogenetic analyses of SAMT and SABP2 genes and homologous genes from other plant species confirmed their evolutionary relationships. Multiple sequence alignments of the amino acid revealed the occurrence of important residues for substrate specificity in SAMT and SABP2. The analysis of cis elements in different birches indicated a functional multiplicity of SAMT and SABP2 and provided insights into the regulation of both genes. We successfully developed six prominent single nucleotide substitution markers that were validated with 38 additional birch individuals to differentiate high and low MeSA-producing birch species. Relative tissue-specific expression analysis of SAMT in leaf and bark tissue of two high and two low MeSA-synthesizing birches revealed a high expression in the bark of both high MeSA-synthesizing birches. In contrast, SABP2 expression in tissues revealed indifferent levels of expression between species belonging to the two groups. The comparative expression and bioinformatics analyses provided vital information that could be used to apply plant genetic engineering technology in the mass production of organic MeSA."
https://openalex.org/W3091884218,"Background Patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) are known to have poor clinical outcomes. The pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been completely understood. Objective We aimed to assess the involvement of the de-novo synthetic pathway of sphingolipid metabolism in patients with AERD compared to those with aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA). Methods A total of 63 patients with AERD and 79 patients with ATA were enrolled in this study. Analysis of mRNA expression of serine palmitoyl transferase, long-chain base subunit 2 (SPTLC2) and genotyping of ORMDL3 SNP (rs7216389) was performed. Results Significantly higher levels of SPTLC2 mRNA expression were noted in patients with AERD, which showed significant positive correlations with peripheral/sputum eosinophil counts and urine LTE4 (all P<0.05). The levels of SPTLC2 mRNA expression showed significant negative correlations with the level of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC (P = 0.033, r = −0.274; P = 0.019, r = −0.299, respectively). Genotype frequencies of ORMDL3 SNP (rs7216389) showed no significant differences between the AERD and ATA groups. Patients with AERD carrying the TT genotype of ORMDL3 had significantly lower levels of FVC (%) and PC20 methacholine than those carrying the CT or CC genotype (P = 0.026 and P = 0.030). Conclusion & clinical relevance This is the first study that shows the dysregulated de novo synthetic pathway of sphingolipids may be involved in the eosinophilic inflammation and airflow limitation in AERD."
https://openalex.org/W3092158820,"This study compared the response of the wearable sensors tested against the industry-standard pressure transducers at blast overpressure (BOP) levels typically experienced in training. We systematically evaluated the effects of the sensor orientation with respect to the direction of the incident shock wave and demonstrated how the averaging methods affect the reported pressure values. The evaluated methods included averaging peak overpressure and impulse of all four sensors mounted on a helmet, taking the average of the three sensors, or isolating the incident pressure equivalent using two sensors. The experimental procedures were conducted in controlled laboratory conditions using the shock tube, and some of the findings were verified in field conditions with live fire charges during explosive breaching training. We used four different orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) of the headform retrofitted with commonly fielded helmets (ACH, ECH, Ops-Core) with four B3 Blast Gauge sensors. We determined that averaging the peak overpressure values overestimates the actual dosage experienced by operators, which is caused by the reflected pressure contribution. This conclusion is valid despite the identified limitation of the B3 gauges that consistently underreport the peak reflected overpressure, compared to the industry-standard sensors. We also noted consistent overestimation of the impulse. These findings demonstrate that extreme caution should be exercised when interpreting occupational blast exposure results without knowing the orientation of the sensors. Pure numerical values without the geometrical, training-regime specific information such as the position of the sensors, the distance and orientation of the trainee to the source of the blast wave, and weapon system used will inevitably lead to erroneous estimation of the individual and cumulative blast overpressure (BOP) dosages. Considering that the 4 psi (~28 kPa) incident BOP is currently accepted as the threshold exposure safety value, a misinterpretation of exposure level may lead to an inaccurate estimation of BOP at the minimum standoff distance (MSD), or exclusion criteria."
https://openalex.org/W3092115793,"This study examined the factors affecting corneal curvature change after lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection surgery in patients with intermittent exotropia. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study in intermittent exotropia patients who underwent rectus resection surgery. The study involved 41 male and 42 female patients (mean age: 9.55 ± 5.03 years, range: 3-28 years). Corneal astigmatism analysis was performed using the Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer. The values of simulated and ray tracing corneal keratometry (K) of astigmatism, including axis changes, were determined preoperatively and at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively. The factors found to affect corneal curvature change were sex, extent of surgery, and axial length. Simulated and ray tracing changes were significant preoperatively and at 1 week and 3 months after rectus resection surgery (p < 0.05); however, there were no differences in astigmatism (D) at any time. The spherical equivalent had a myopic change after rectus resection surgery with cycloplegic refraction, and in ray tracing mode, flat K was decreased at 1 week from baseline and increased 3 months later. Steep, mean K, and axis increased continuously from baseline to 1 week and 3 months. Astigmatism, in contrast, was increased at 1 week, but decreased at 3 months, with no return to baseline. Univariable linear regression analyses showed that the extent of surgery had an effect on flat K change and that sex had an effect on steep K and axis. Additionally, axial length affected steep K and astigmatism, while age had no effect on any variable. Ray tracing values were significantly different from simulated values. In ray tracing mode, rectus resection surgery may result in astigmatism shifted toward with-the-rule, and myopic changes may be caused by differences in thickness and flexibility of the sclera. Notably, age did not affect any variable."

Genetic improvement of crested wheatgrass has been challenged by its complex genome, outcrossing nature, long breeding cycle, and lack of informative molecular markers. Genomic selection (GS) has potential for improving traits of perennial forage species, and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has enabled the development of genome-wide markers in non-model polyploid plants. An attempt was made to explore the utility of GBS and GS in crested wheatgrass breeding. Sequencing and phenotyping 325 genotypes representing 10 diverse breeding lines were performed. Bioinformatics analysis identified 827, 3,616, 14,090 and 46,136 single nucleotide polymorphism markers at 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% missing marker levels, respectively. Four GS models (BayesA, BayesB, BayesCπ, and rrBLUP) were examined for the accuracy of predicting nine agro-morphological and three nutritive value traits. Moderate accuracy (0.20 to 0.32) was obtained for the prediction of heading days, leaf width, plant height, clump diameter, tillers per plant and early spring vigor for genotypes evaluated at Saskatoon, Canada. Similar accuracy (0.29 to 0.35) was obtained for predicting fall regrowth and plant height for genotypes evaluated at Swift Current, Canada. The Bayesian models displayed similar or higher accuracy than rrBLUP. These findings show the feasibility of GS application for a non-model species to advance plant breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3092444392,"The stepping-forward affordance perception test (SF-APT) fills an important gap within the screening of falls risk factors by considering the perception of affordances. The test showed to be a valid instrument for community-dwelling older adults falls risk assessment. The present study aimed to distinguish and test the key outcomes of the SF-APT usable for falls risk assessment in community-dwelling older adults to determine the respective cut-offs. This cross-sectional study enrolled 347 participants (73.1 ± 6.2 years; non-fallers: 57.9%; fallers: 42.1%; recurrent-fallers: 17.9%). Falls occurrence and SF-APT outcomes were assessed. Analyses were performed using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The area under the ROC curve was computed (AUC) for each built model explaining falling or recurrent falling. Results distinguished the Estimated stepping-forward, and Absolute-error in interaction with Error-tendency as the SF-APT key outcomes for falls risk assessment [AUCfalling: 0.665 (CI 95%: 0.608–0.723); AUCfalling recurrently: 0.728 (CI 95%: 0.655–0.797)]. Computed cut-offs’ analysis showed that (i) a boundary stepping-forward estimation >58 cm plus an underestimation bias >5 cm (>42nd percentile) avoid older adults to be recurrent-fallers, and (ii) a boundary stepping-forward estimation >62 cm plus an underestimation bias >6 cm (>54th percentile) avoid older adults to be fallers. In conclusion, results suggest that SF-APT is a valuable tool for falls risk assessment in community-dwelling older adults. Interventions targeting the prevention of falls should consider the above key outcomes and the respective cut-offs as alert red-flags."
https://openalex.org/W3092617255,"Tissue factor (TF) is critical for the activation of blood coagulation. TF function is regulated by the amount of externalised phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the surface of the cell in which it is expressed. We investigated the role PS and PE in fibroblast TF function. Fibroblasts expressed 6–9 x 104 TF molecules/cell but had low specific activity for FXa generation. We confirmed that this was associated with minimal externalized PS and PE and characterised for the first time the molecular species of PS/PE demonstrating that these differed from those found in platelets. Mechanical damage of fibroblasts, used to simulate vascular injury, increased externalized PS/PE and led to a 7-fold increase in FXa generation that was inhibited by annexin V and an anti-TF antibody. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), that did not express TF, supported minimal FVIIa-dependent FXa generation but substantially increased fibroblast TF activity. This enhancement in fibroblast TF activity could also be achieved using synthetic liposomes comprising 10% PS without TF. In conclusion, despite high levels of surface TF expression, healthy fibroblasts express low levels of external-facing PS and PE limiting their ability to generate FXa. Addition of platelet-derived TF-negative EVs or artificial liposomes enhanced fibroblast TF activity in a PS dependent manner. These findings contribute information about the mechanisms that control TF function in the fibroblast membrane."
https://openalex.org/W3092632493,"Purpose Feasibility of a highly reduced-dose lumbar spine CT protocol using iterative reconstruction (IR) in a human cadaver model. Materials and methods The lumbar spine of 20 human cadavers was repeatedly examined using three different reduced-dose protocols (RDCT) with decreasing reference tube current-exposure time products (RDCT-1: 50 mAs; RDCT-2: 30 mAs; RDCT-3: 10 mAs) at a constant tube voltage of 140 kV. A clinical standard-dose protocol (SDCT) served as the reference (reference tube current–exposure time product: 70 mAs; tube voltage: 140 kV). Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and two increasing levels of IR: IRL4 and IRL6. A five-point scale was used by two observers to assess the diagnostic quality of anatomical structures (cortical and trabecular bone, intervertebral foramina, pedicles and intervertebral joints, spinous and transverse processes). Objective image noise (OIN) was measured. Results were interpreted using a linear mixed-effects regression model. Results RDCT-2 with IRL6 (1.2 ± 0.5mSv) was the lowest reduced-dose protocol which provided diagnostically acceptable and equivalent image quality compared to the SDCT (2.3 ± 1.1mSV) with FBP (p > 0.05). All RDCT protocols achieved a significant reduction of the mean (±SD) effective radiation doses (RDCT-1: 1.7±0.9mSv; RDCT-2: 1.2±0.5mSv; RDCT-3: 0.4±0.2mSv; p < 0.05) compared to SDCT. OIN was lower in all RDCT protocols with the application of IRL4 and IRL6, compared to the SDCT with FBP (p < 0.05). Conclusion Highly reduced-dose lumbar spine CT providing diagnostically acceptable image quality is feasible using IR in this cadaver model and may be transferred into a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3092232392,"This study presents a multi-stage random regret minimization (RRM) model as an emergency rescue decision support system to determine the emergency resource pre-allocation schedule for the freeway network. The proposed methodology consists of three steps: (1) improved accident frequency approach to identify the black spots on the freeway network, (2) stochastic programming (SP) model to determine the initial allocation plan sets, and (3) regret-based model in the logarithmical specification to select the most minimal regret one considering the factors of the response time, total cost and demand. The model is applied to the case study of 2014-2016 freeway network in Shandong, China. The results show that the random regret minimization (RRM) model can improve the full-compensation of SP model to a certain degree. RRM in logarithmical specification performs lightly better than random utility maximization (RUM) and RRM in the linear-additive specification in this case. This approach emerges as a valuable tool to help decision makers to allocate resources before traffic accident occurs, with the aim of minimizing the total regret of their decisions."

There has been no research assessing the influence of poor glycemic control on thrombus formation under flow conditions in vitro or in pregnant type 1 diabetic women to date.This study compared singleton pregnant T1DM women (n = 21) and control pregnant subjects without any metabolic disease (n = 15). The T1DM group was divided into two subgroups of sufficient (SGC-DM; HbA1c ≤6,5%,n = 15) and poor glycaemic control (PGC-DM; HbA1c >6,5%,n = 6). Evaluation of the whole blood thrombogenicity we assessed using T-TAS® at a shear rate of 240 s-1 (Total-Thrombus Analysis System, Zacros, Japan).Blood clot formation initiation time (T10) was significantly shortened in PGC-DM subgroup when compared to SGC-DM subgroup (p = 0,03). The area under the curve (AUC30) of blood clot time formation and the MPV (mean platelet volume) values were substantially higher in the PGC-DM subgroup in comparison to the SGC-DM group (p = 0,03). Negative correlations were noted between HbA1c and T10 values (p = 0,02) and between T10 and MPV values in the T1DM group (p = 0,04).Poor glycaemic control in T1DM subjects triggers a shift towards a prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic state. This phenomenon can be detected using the novel system for quantitative assessment of the platelet thrombus formation process under flow conditions in vitro. The alteration of T-TAS values in PGC-DM subgroup proves that a poor glycemic control-related shift of the equilibrium toward thrombogenesis occurs in this group of patients. Our findings need a further elucidation in research on more massive data sets to be confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W3091893602,"Cancer Survivorship is a growing public health challenge. Effective responses from health care and social services depend on appropriate identification of survivors and their families´ specific needs. There are few studies on survivorship in low and middle-income countries, therefore, more evidence-based studies are necessary to develop a comprehensive approach to cancer survivorship.Identify the needs of cancer survivors and their relatives, specifically those of individuals with breast, cervical or prostate cancer, and with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).A qualitative, exploratory study conducted in two referral institutions in Brazil, located in Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) and Fortaleza (Northeast region). The study included 47 patients of public and private health services and 12 family members. We used script-based semi-structured interviews. The discursive material obtained was categorized and analyzed using the Thematic Analysis approach.The analysis identified three central themes: 1) consequences of cancer treatment; 2) Changes in daily life associated with cancer survivorship; and 3) Unmet structural needs in cancer survivorship.Social and cancer control policies in Brazil should provide resources, specific care standards and clinical, psychological and social support. Cancer survivors should also receive rehabilitation and work reintegration guidelines. This matter requires broader access to qualified cancer information, development of an integrated patient-centered care and care model, and more research resources for the country's post-treatment cancer period."
https://openalex.org/W3091970401,"Many microbial phenotypes are differentially or exclusively expressed on agar surfaces, including biofilms, motility, and sociality. However, agar-based assays are limited by their low throughput, which increases costs, lab waste, space requirements, and the time required to conduct experiments. Here, we demonstrate the use of wax-printed microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) to measure linear growth rate of microbes on an agar growth media as a means of circumventing the aforementioned limitations. The main production materials of the proposed μPAD design are a wax printer, filter paper, and empty pipet boxes. A single wax-printed μPAD allowing 8 independent, agar-grown colonies costs $0.07, compared to $0.20 and $9.37 for the same number of replicates on traditional microtiter/spectrophotometry and Petri dish assays, respectively. We optimized the μPAD design for channel width (3 mm), agar volume (780 μL/channel), and microbe inoculation method (razor-blade). Comparative analyses of the traditional and proposed μPAD methods for measuring growth rate of nonmotile (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and motile (flagellated Escherichia coli) microorganisms suggested the μPAD assays conferred a comparable degree of accuracy and reliability to growth rate measurements as their traditional counterparts. We substantiated this claim with strong, positive correlations between the traditional and μPAD assay, a significant nonzero slope in the model relating the two assays, a nonsignificant difference between the relative standard errors of the two techniques, and an analysis of inter-device reliability. Therefore, μPAD designs merit consideration for the development of enhanced-throughput, low-cost microbial growth and motility assays."
https://openalex.org/W3092271351,"The microbial communities colonize the mucosal immune inductive sites could be captured by hosts, which could initiate the mucosal immune responses. The aggregated lymphoid nodule area (ALNA) and the ileal Payer’s patches (PPs) in Bactrian camels are both the mucosal immune inductive sites of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, the bacteria community associated with the ALNA and ileal PPs were analyzed using of 16S rDNA-Illumina Miseq sequencing. The mutual dominant bacterial phyla at the two sites were the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria, and the mutual dominant genus in both sits was Prevotella. The abundances of the Fibrobacter, Campylobacter and RFP12 were all higher in ALNA than in ileal PPs. While, the abundances of the 5-7N15, Clostridium, and Escherichia were all higher in ileal PPs than in ALNA. The results suggested that the host’s intestinal microenvironment is selective for the symbiotic bacteria colonizing the corresponding sites, on the contrary, the symbiotic bacteria could impact on the physiological functions of this local site. In ALNA and ileal PPs of Bactrian camel, the bacteria which colonized different immune inductive sites have the potential to stimulate different immune responses, which is the result of the mutual selection and adaptation between microbial communities and their host."
https://openalex.org/W3092521481,"Objectives To determine the structure and demographic of medical teams working in Rural General Hospitals (RGHs) in Scotland, and to gain insight into their experiences and determine their opinions on a remote and rural medical training pathway. Design Structured face-to-face interviews. Interviews were partially anonymised, and underwent thematic analysis. Setting Medical departments of the six RGHs in Scotland 2018-2019. Participants 14 medical consultants and 23 junior doctors working in RGHs in Scotland. Inclusion criteria: Present at time of site visit, medical consultant in an RGH or junior doctor working in an RGH who provides care for medical patients. Exclusion criteria: Doctors on leave or off shift. Medical consultants with less than one month of experience in post. Non-medical specialty consultants e.g. surgical or anaesthetic consultants. Results Of 21 consultant posts in the RGHs, only eight are filled with resident consultants, the remainder rely on locums. Consultants found working as generalists rewarding and challenging, and juniors found it to be a good training experience. Consultants feel little professional isolation due to modern connectivity. The majority of consultants (12/14) and all junior doctors favour a remote and rural medicine training pathway encompassing a mandatory paediatrics component, and feel this would help with consultant recruitment and retention. Conclusion RGHs medical departments are reliant on locum consultants. The development of a remote and rural training medical training pathway is endorsed by the current medical teams of RGHs and has the potential to improve medical consultant staffing in RGHs."
https://openalex.org/W3092559826,"Middle ear cholesteatoma is a destructive disease in which inflammation plays an important role in development and progression, and there are currently no biomarkers predicting prognosis or recurrence. Cylindromatosis (CYLD), a tumor suppressor deubiquitinase, serves as a negative regulator of inflammation expressed in tissues including the middle ear. To determine the clinical significance of CYLD in acquired cholesteatoma, we evaluated CYLD expression in acquired cholesteatoma tissue by immunostaining and analyzed its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. Our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CYLD expression levels were varied in the tissues of acquired cholesteatoma patients. The relative expression levels of CYLD in cholesteatoma exhibited a significant correlation with the grade of otorrhea (R = 0.532, p = 0.039). Moreover, the period of epithelialization was also significantly associated with the relative expression levels of CYLD (R = 0.720, p = 0.002). In addition, CYLD expression tended to be lower in the group with recurrence. These results suggest that low CYLD expression correlates with postoperative recovery of acquired cholesteatoma, while potentially affecting the induction of recurrence. This is the first report showing that low CYLD expression correlates with accelerated disease recovery, and suggests a new aspect of CYLD as a prognostic predictor of acquired cholesteatoma."
https://openalex.org/W3092140143,"Sexual dimorphism is a common in the animal kingdom and is often linked to mate choice or competition for mates in polygynous mating systems. However, sexual dimorphism is less common in species that form heterosexual pairs and has not been recorded in pair-forming coral-reef fish. Here we demonstrate a pronounced morphological difference between males and females in the humphead bannerfish (Heniochus varius)-a pair-forming coral reef butterflyfish. Males of paired individuals collected in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea had substantially larger hump and horn protrusions on their heads than females. Fish were also sexed, sized and aged to determine the reproductive and demographic basis of the pairing behaviour. H. varius pairs were exclusively heterosexual and were assorted strongly by total length and slightly less so by age. Females in pairs were generally the same size as male partners, but were frequently older by a year and sometimes more. Hump and horn lengths increased proportionally to body-size in both sexes, with horns growing at a greater rate among males. These findings suggest that H. varius form pairs primarily for reproductive purposes, with selection via a size-assortative process that likely also extends to selection for larger hump and horn protrusions among males. The larger humps and horns in males appear to be the first recorded example of a secondary sexual morphological characteristic in a pair-forming coral reef fish species."
https://openalex.org/W3092252258,"Background While factors that drive early mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have been described, less is known about the predictors of long-term mortality for those with ART experience. Methods PLWH and on ART attending two HIV treatment clinics in Moshi, Tanzania were enrolled from 2008 through 2009 and followed for 3.5 years. Demographic, psychosocial, and clinical information were collected at enrollment. Plasma HIV RNA measurements were collected annually. Cause of death was adjudicated by two independent reviewers based on verbal autopsy information and medical records. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models to identify predictors of mortality. Results The analysis included 403 participants. The median (IQR) age in years was 42 (36-48) and 277 (68.7%) participants were female. The proportion of participants virologically suppressed during the 4 collection time points was 88.5%, 94.7%, 91.5%, and 94.5%. During follow-up, 24 participants died; the overall mortality rate was 1.8 deaths per 100 person-years. Of the deaths, 14 (58.3%) were suspected to be HIV/AIDS related. Predictors of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) were male sex (2.63, 1.01-6.83), secondary or higher education (7.70, 3.02-19.60), receiving care at the regional referral hospital in comparison to the larger zonal referral hospital (6.33, 1.93-20.76), and moderate to severe depression symptoms (6.35, 1.69-23.87). Conclusions As ART coverage continues to expand in SSA, HIV programs should recognize the need for interventions to promote HIV care engagement for men and the integration of mental health screening and treatment with HIV care. Facility-level barriers may contribute to challenges faced by PLWH as they progress through the HIV care continuum, and further understanding of these barriers is needed. The association of higher educational attainment with mortality merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3092642191,"This study developed and validated a Korean community health determinants index (K-CHDI), which can be used to assess the health status of the community. To develop composite indicators, we followed the guidelines of the Joint Research Centre of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We reviewed previous studies and formed a theoretical framework to systematize our domains and indicators, which were decided through a Delphi survey of healthcare experts. Data on indicators were obtained from the Korean Statistics and Community Health Survey. We applied the Min-Max normalization method and measured weights by the analytic hierarchy process. Health outcomes were estimated using mortality, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years by standardizing sex and age. The value of the index is between 0 and 1; higher values indicate more positive health determinants. K-CHDI for 250 subnational regions (cities, counties, and districts, or Si·Gun·Gu) were correlated with health outcomes. The correlation coefficient was stronger in large cities than in medium-sized areas and small areas, and the higher the K-CHDI group, the higher the coefficient. The K-CHDI represents a reference standard for estimating health status using health determinants as composite indicators at the subnational level."
https://openalex.org/W3091980938,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is associated with decreased respiratory quality of life and impaired diaphragm function. Recent hyperpolarized helium (HHe) MRI studies show alveolarization continues throughout adolescence, and mechanical forces are known to impact alveolarization. We therefore hypothesized that patients with AIS would have alterations in alveolar size, alveolar number, or alveolar septal dimensions compared to adolescents without AIS, and that posterior spinal fusion (PSF) might reverse these differences. We conducted a prospective observational trial using HHe MRI to test for changes in alveolar microstructure in control and AIS subjects at baseline and one year. After obtaining written informed consent from subjects' legal guardians and assent from the subjects, we performed HHe and proton MRI in 14 AIS and 16 control subjects aged 8-21 years. The mean age of control subjects (12.9 years) was significantly less than AIS (14.9 years, p = 0.003). At baseline, there were no significant differences in alveolar size, number, or alveolar duct morphometry between AIS and control subjects or between the concave (compressed) and convex (expanded) lungs of AIS subjects. At one year after PSF AIS subjects had an increase in alveolar density in the formerly convex lung (p = 0.05), likely reflecting a change in thoracic anatomy, but there were no other significant changes in lung microstructure. Modeling of alveolar size over time demonstrated similar rates of alveolar growth in control and AIS subjects in both right and left lungs pre- and post-PSF. Although this study suffered from poor age-matching, we found no evidence that AIS or PSF impacts lung microstructure. Trial registration: Clinical trial registration number NCT03539770."
https://openalex.org/W3092510653,"Sentence formation is a highly structured, history-dependent, and sample-space reducing (SSR) process. While the first word in a sentence can be chosen from the entire vocabulary, typically, the freedom of choosing subsequent words gets more and more constrained by grammar and context, as the sentence progresses. This sample-space reducing property offers a natural explanation of Zipf’s law in word frequencies, however, it fails to capture the structure of the word-to-word transition probability matrices of English text. Here we adopt the view that grammatical constraints (such as subject–predicate–object) locally re-order the word order in sentences that are sampled by the word generation process. We demonstrate that superimposing grammatical structure–as a local word re-ordering (permutation) process–on a sample-space reducing word generation process is sufficient to explain both, word frequencies and word-to-word transition probabilities. We compare the performance of the grammatically ordered SSR model in reproducing several test statistics of real texts with other text generation models, such as the Bernoulli model, the Simon model, and the random typewriting model."
https://openalex.org/W3092631438,"Mitochondrial OXPHOS generates most of the energy required for cellular function. OXPHOS biogenesis requires the coordinated expression of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. This represents a unique challenge that highlights the importance of nuclear-mitochondrial genetic communication to cellular function. Here we investigated the transcriptomic and functional consequences of nuclear-mitochondrial genetic divergence in vitro and in vivo. We utilized xenomitochondrial cybrid cell lines containing nuclear DNA from the common laboratory mouse Mus musculus domesticus and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Mus musculus domesticus, or exogenous mtDNA from progressively divergent mouse species Mus spretus, Mus terricolor, Mus caroli and Mus pahari. These cybrids model a wide range of nuclear-mitochondrial genetic divergence that cannot be achieved with other research models. Furthermore, we used a xenomitochondrial mouse model generated in our laboratory that harbors wild-type, C57BL/6J Mus musculus domesticus nuclear DNA and homoplasmic mtDNA from Mus terricolor. RNA sequencing analysis of xenomitochondrial cybrids revealed an activation of interferon signaling pathways even in the absence of OXPHOS dysfunction or immune challenge. In contrast, xenomitochondrial mice displayed lower baseline interferon gene expression and an impairment in the interferon-dependent innate immune response upon immune challenge with herpes simplex virus, which resulted in decreased viral control. Our work demonstrates that nuclear-mitochondrial genetic divergence caused by the introduction of exogenous mtDNA can modulate the interferon immune response both in vitro and in vivo, even when OXPHOS function is not compromised. This work may lead to future insights into the role of mitochondrial genetic variation and the immune function in humans, as patients affected by mitochondrial disease are known to be more susceptible to immune challenges."
