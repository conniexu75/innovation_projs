https://openalex.org/W1569529186,"Abstract Rabbit heart extract contains three glycogen phosphorylase b isozymes separable by disc gel electrophoresis or column chromatography. These types of phosphorylase are designated as phosphorylase Ib, which migrates the farthest on electrophoresis; IIb, with an intermediate rate of migration; and IIIb, having the slowest rate. Phosphorylase IIIb is known to be identical with skeletal muscle phosphorylase b from previous work. Each type of phosphorylase b can be converted to the corresponding a form with ATP and phosphorylase kinase; the a forms are designated as phosphorylases Ia, IIa, and IIIa. Phosphorylases Ib and Ia have been purified and partially characterized. The two forms of this type of phosphorylase have the same molecular weight, i.e. about 200,000, in contrast to phosphorylases IIIb and IIIa, the a form of which is twice the size of the b form. When phosphorylases Ib and IIIb are incubated together, an intermediate hybrid band appears in the IIb position. Low temperature, high salt, low pH, and the presence of deforming agents increase the rate of hybridization. Glucose 6-phosphate and AMP block the reaction. No hybridization between phosphorylases Ia and IIIa or between Ib and inactive liver phosphorylase has been observed. An activity-staining technique for phosphorylase in gels is described."
https://openalex.org/W1599058642,"Abstract Synthetic polytripeptides with the structure (l-Pro-Gly-l-Pro)n were used to study protocollagen hydroxylase, the enzyme which hydroxylates appropriate proline residues in protocollagen, the polypeptide precursor of collagen. With these synthetic substrates the synthesis of hydroxyproline could be followed quantitatively, and for the first time the reaction was studied under conditions where the substrate concentration was not rate-limiting. As previously observed with protocollagen as a substrate for the reaction, the hydroxylation of (Pro-Gly-Pro)n required α-ketoglutarate, ferrous iron, and ascorbate, but the Km values for the cofactors were slightly different from those observed with protocollagen. Hydroxylation of (Pro-Gly-Pro)n fractions of varying molecular weights indicated that a fraction with a molecular weight of about 1,800 had a Km value of 220 µg per ml, and four fractions ranging in molecular weight from 4,000 to 15,000 gave Km values of 110 µg per ml. All the Km values for (Pro-Gly-Pro)n preparations were considerably greater than that previously reported for proline-labeled protocollagen. No differences were observed in the maximal velocities with the different fractions of (Pro-Gly-Pro)n. A copolymer of glycine and proline (1:1.9) with a molecular weight of 4000 gave a Km of 440 µg per ml, and the maximal velocity was less than that observed with (Pro-Gly-Pro)n preparations. Poly-l-proline II was a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, and the Ki value observed was 0.3 µg per ml. The results suggest that (Pro-Gly-Pro)n is not as appropriate a substrate for the hydroxylase as protocollagen, and that the higher Km values observed for preparations of (Pro-Gly-Pro)n were not explained by their smaller size. The results also suggest that the enzyme has a high affinity for proline in the extended single-stranded helix found in poly-l-proline II."
https://openalex.org/W2100871462,"Abstract Various methods of plotting allosteric data are discussed with the conclusion that plots of initial velocity divided by substrate concentration (v/S) versus the initial velocity are most convenient. This type of plot is discussed in terms of the information which can be obtained from it with respect to the parameters of an equation analogous to that proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux. The model proposed by these authors is also discussed in terms of its meaning with respect to enzyme kinetic, rather than ligand binding, data. A simple extension of this model is provided by considering the possibility that different conformational forms of an enzyme may have different intrinsic activities. Other models for describing allosteric kinetic data are discussed and compared. The inconsistencies between various models are pointed out. A somewhat different mechanism from those which have previously been discussed in the literature is presented. This mechanism is for the situation which corresponds to polymerization of an enzyme in a reversible fashion and for which the polymer and monomer differ with respect to kinetic parameters such as ligand binding. An equation describing this situation for dimerization is presented and the mechanism is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1651034858,"Monoamine oxidase of bovine kidney mitochondria has been purified to high specific activity by solubilization with digitonin, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and calcium phosphate gel-cellulose column chromatography. Absorption and fluorescence spectra indicated strongly that mitochondrial monoamine oxidase is a flavoenzyme. Under anaerobic conditions, benzylamine reduced the flavin at 460 mµ apparently to 75% of the total reduction observed with sodium dithionite. The enzyme preparation contained approximately 1 mole of flavin per 100,000 g of protein. The flavin prosthetic group was not characterized precisely, due to the tight association of this group with the protein. Analysis of monoamine oxidase exhibited 7 to 8 sulfhydryl equivalents per 105 g of protein. When varying amounts of silver nitrate or p-chloromercuribenzoate were incubated with the enzyme, the activity was observed to decrease as a linear function of the amount of inhibitor added; complete inhibition was obtained at a ratio of 7.3 moles of thiol-characterizing reagent per 105 g of protein. Similarly, the extent of reduction of the flavoenzyme by benzylamine, at 460 mµ, was proportional to the metallic reagent-enzyme ratio, indicative of a selective inhibitory process. The copper content of the purified enzyme was found by a procedure of atomic absorption spectrophotometry to be 0.14 to 0.15 µg per mg of protein. On the basis of such values and the flavin content there would be 4 or 5 eq of catalytically active flavin per atom of copper, indicating the nonessentiality of copper for activity of this oxidase. These observations are not in agreement with conclusions offered recently by other authors. In addition, there was no observable correlation between the inhibition of enzyme activity by appropriate chelating agents and the ability of these agents to chelate copper. Other interpretations for the inhibition produced by certain of these agents are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1963985231,"IN 1964 Macfarlane1 proposed a reaction mechanism for the interaction of blood coagulation factors, known as the enzyme cascade. In this hypothesis the blood coagulation factors as they occur in plasma are considered to be zymogens (except factor I; namely, fibrinogen). Coagulation is initiated by the conversion of one of these zymogens into an enzyme as a result of contact with anything other than intact vascular endothelium. This enzyme then acts on another clotting factor to form another active enzyme. All clotting factors thus interact in a given order until prothrombin (factor II) is converted into thrombin. Thrombin then brings about the actual coagulation by converting fibrinogen into fibrin."
https://openalex.org/W1514459134,"Xanthine dehydrogenase, purified 550-fold from Micrococcus lactilyticus, exhibits a molecular weight of about 250,000 and an absorption spectrum which differs only slightly from that of related molybdo-iron-flavoproteins, and appears to contain 2 g atoms of molybdenum, 8 g atoms of iron, and 2 moles of flavin per mole. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of a wide variety of purines and aldehydes. Ferredoxin is the most effective electron acceptor, but oxygen, various dyes, and ferricyanide can also be utilized, as can cytochrome c, but DPN+ cannot. The reductions of ferredoxin and cytochrome c are not dependent upon the presence of molecular oxygen, but may be correlated with the appearance of a stable flavin semiquinone in enzyme which has been reduced by its substrates. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible dismutation of xanthine to hypoxanthine and urate at 60% of the rate for the aerobic oxidation of xanthine. The enzyme is resistant to inhibition by cyanide, and is extremely susceptible to progressive inhibition by methanol. These latter observations strengthen the hypothesis that molybdenum serves as a hydroxyl acceptor and donor in the normal catalytic function of molybdo-iron-flavoproteins. It is also resistant to arsenite, but is progressively inactivated by borate."
https://openalex.org/W1546171469,"Abstract The conversion of squalene to lanosterol by rat liver preparations in vitro has been re-examined. It has been shown that this transformation, hitherto considered to take place through the agency of one enzyme (squalene oxidocyclase-1), actually involves the formation of squalene-2,3-oxide as an intermediate. The oxide is cyclized to lanosterol by a cyclizing system which acts independently of the oxidative step and requires neither oxygen nor NADPH. The cyclase is shown to exist in highest concentration in the microsomal fraction, although an over-all greater quantity of the enzyme remains in the supernatant after centrifugation for 1 hour at 100,000 x g."

https://openalex.org/W1525868105,"Abstract The citrate cleavage enzyme (EC 4.1.3.8) was isolated from rat liver and purified. Reciprocal plots with coenzyme A or MgATP as variable substrates were linear, but when citrate was varied, the plot was curved, convex upward. The reciprocal plot became linear in the presence of 0.25 m chloride, and under these conditions Mg-citrate appeared to be the active substrate. Complete initial velocity studies run in the presence of chloride at pH 8.1 indicated a sequential reaction pathway and suggested that MgATP added to the enzyme first followed by a rapid equilibrium random addition of Mg-citrate and CoA. The associated Michaelis constants and inhibition constants have been determined. Apparent Km values for the reverse reaction and an approximate equilibrium constant for the reaction have also been measured. Isotopic exchange experiments indicated the presence of a ping-pong sequence in which MgADP could be released before the addition of the other two reactants. However, MgATP remains as the first substrate to add to the enzyme, and the ping-pong pathway is apparently an alternate sequence to the sequential pathway. A phosphorylated enzyme was formed either from MgATP-γ-32P or from phosphate-32P, acetyl-CoA, and oxaloacetate; however, the two phosphoenzymes were not equivalent. The one formed with MgATP could react with MgADP to give MgATP or with CoA and Mg-citrate to give free phosphate. The apparent phosphoenzyme formed from phosphate, acetyl-CoA, and oxaloacetate was unreactive with either MgADP or Mg-citrate and CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1597326000,"Abstract A simple procedure affording a 940-fold purification of the nucleoside phosphotransferase from carrot is described. Preliminary evidence indicates that, by an additional fractionation through a Sephadex column, a further 5- to 6-fold increase in activity can be effected. The particle weight of the enzyme varies with pH. At the pH optimum of 5.0 one species of particle weight 45,000, at pH 9.5 two species of 63,000 and 44,000 are observed. Disc electrophoresis shows only one band at pH 5.0, two bands at pH 9.5. The enzyme is considered a nucleoside phosphotransferase which also exhibits hydrolase activity because (a) phosphate transfer is favored over hydrolysis; (b) transfer occurs specifically to nucleosides; (c) high yields of nucleotide are recorded. In the characterization of the transfer reaction four factors must be considered: (a) the nature of the phosphate donor; (b) the aglycone of the nucleoside acceptor; (c) the sugar moiety of the nucleoside; (d) the donor-acceptor pair. The main product of the enzymic transfer is a 5'-nucleotide, although upon long incubation other isomers can also be observed. The presence in the enzyme of several active sites is made probable by studies of the effects of Mg2+, Cu2+, and Co2+, of the dialysis against chelating agents, of the pH curves, and of aging properties. The investigation of the hydrolytic functions of the enzyme leads to the conclusion that efficient donors for the transferase are hydrolyzed, although not all hydrolyzable substrates are efficient donors; and that poor acceptors for transferase are good inhibitors of hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W2149566407,"Abstract An improved method is described for the preparation of crystalline dihydroorotate dehydrogenase which is electrophoretically homogeneous. The enzyme exhibits an s20,w value of 7.45 S at infinite dilution, and its molecular weight is 115,000 ± 7,000. It contains 2 moles of FAD, 2 moles of FMN, 4 g atoms of iron, and 4 moles of acid-labile sulfide per mole of enzyme. Apparent Km values were determined for DPNH, orotate, and dihydroorotate. Orotate and oxidized enzyme yield a complex characterized by its absorption spectrum. Thermodynamic parameters for the dissociation of this complex are presented. Substrate specificity was studied with a series of pyrimidine derivatives. The ring hydroxyl and carboxyl substituents are essential for binding and oxidation of reduced enzyme. Halogen substitution at Position 5 increases both Km and Vmax. Reduction of the enzyme by reducing substrates is evidenced by bleaching at 450 mµ and the appearance of long wave length absorption. Reduction by DPNH proceeds rapidly; reduction by dihydroorotate is slow and proceeds to about one-half the extent found with DPNH. However, reduction of the enzyme by dihydroorotate in the presence of DPN is as complete, and perhaps as rapid, as that by DPNH. A large Cotton effect, observed in the visible region of the spectrum, was markedly altered by dithionite or reducing substrate and was shifted to lower wave lengths by 3.5 m urea. A flavin-free iron-protein was obtained which exhibited an absorption spectrum similar to that of iron-proteins from other iron-flavoproteins and to that of spinach ferredoxin. Three techniques were used to demonstrate the formation of an oxygen free radical when enzyme, reduced by substrate, is reoxidized by oxygen. Treatment with cysteine is required for reactions involving orotate or dihydroorotate, but not for DPNH oxidase activity. Similarly, treatment with mercuribenzoate destroyed orotate reductase and dihydroorotate oxidase activity while inhibiting DPNH oxidase activity only slightly. A tentative scheme for the internal electron transport system of this enzyme is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1598509585,"Experiments are described which have led to the selective alkylation of a histidine residue in streptococcal proteinase without concomitant reaction with the single essential sulfhydryl group. The reduced, active form of the enzyme was first treated with sodium tetrathionate to protect the sulfhydryl group and to introduce a negative charge near the active center. The resulting inactive derivative was not detectably alkylated by iodoacetic acid, iodoacetamide, N-chloroacetyltryptophan, or N-chloroacetylglycyleucine. After treatment with these reagents activity could be regenerated by reduction with a thiol. If, however, the S-sulfenylsulfonate derivative of the enzyme was exposed to a positively charged alkylating agent, α-N-bromoacetylarginine methyl ester, 1 molecule of the reagent was incorporated per molecule of protein, as indicated by an increase in the amount of arginine by 1 residue, a decrease in the amount of histidine by 1 residue, and the formation of 1 residue of 3-carboxymethylhistidine. The modified protein possessed no enzymatic activity when the sulfhydryl group was regenerated by reduction. These experiments thus furnish direct chemical evidence for the involvement of a histidine residue, as well as of a sulfhydryl group, in the active site of streptococcal proteinase."

https://openalex.org/W1604532978,"Abstract Uroporphyrinogen I synthetase has been isolated and partially purified from homogenates of spleens from phenylhydrazine-treated mice. One mole of uroporphyrinogen is formed for each 4 moles of porphobilinogen consumed. In the presence of uroporphyrinogen III cosynthetase from wheat germ, the product formed by the synthetase is uroporphyrinogen III. A second fraction from the mouse spleen, which lacks synthetase activity, can replace the wheat germ enzyme in the formation of uroporphyrinogen III by spleen or spinach synthetase. This indicates the presence of uroporphyrinogen III cosynthetase in a mammalian tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1516740555,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the cytosol of Tetrahymena pyriformis is closely related to the high rate of glyconeogenesis in that organism, while the enzyme in the mitochondria does not show such a correlation. This finding, together with the observation of depression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and malate dehydrogenase activities by glucose in the cytosol, indicates an extramitochondrial pathway for phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis from dicarboxylic acids which is similar to that postulated for rat liver and may, therefore, be of general metabolic significance. A change of oxygen tension which influences glyconeogenesis in Tetrahymena also has an effect on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and possibly other glyconeogenic enzymes. One factor in the repression and derepression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was found to be related to oxygen tension and to occur independently of any carbohydrate in the growth medium. A phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase has been identified in this organism. Although its exact metabolic significance is somewhat unclear, the enzyme may function as the primary CO2 fixation mechanism in Tetrahymena."
https://openalex.org/W1498165252,"Abstract 1. Rat liver glycogen was separated into fractions of relatively uniform particle sizes by large volume rate-zonal centrifugation of tissue homogenates with the use of sucrose density gradients. 2. After centrifugation, the distribution curve obtained by plotting the glycogen content of all collected fractions exhibited its maximum a short centrifugal distance from the zone which contained the starting sample. The curve then decreased progressively until an abrupt increase was noted in the zone containing the isopycnically banded membranes. 3. The distribution curves for the α-glucan phosphorylase and of UDP-glucose-glycogen transferase activities were similar to those for glycogen. 4. The phosphorylase-to-glycogen ratios decreased as the molecular weight of the glycogen particles increased, while the opposite was observed with the transferase-to-glycogen ratios. 5. The possible relationship between patterns of preferential binding of enzymes and the molecular weight spectra of glycogen characteristic of their origin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1583371607,"Abstract The enzyme mutarotase (aldose 1-epimerase), found in most mammalian tissues and certain bacteria, catalyzes interconversion of the anomeric forms of certain sugars, particularly those pentoses and hexoses related configurationally to d-glucose. This paper describes the widespread distribution of a similar enzyme in higher plants. The enzyme was found in both mono- and dicotyledons and was most widely distributed in the families Solanaceae (bell pepper, red pepper, tomato, eggplant), Cucurbitaceae (cantaloupe, cucumber, squash), and Liliaceae (asparagus, hyacinth, tulip). It was absent from all tested members of the Rutaceae (lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit) and Rosaceae (plum, pear, apple, strawberry). The mutarotase from green pepper (Capsicum frutescens) was isolated and purified approximately 1400-fold by a combination of salt fractionation, dialysis, preferential protein stabilization, and column chromatography on hydroxylapatite and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The substrate specificity, in order of decreasing catalytic efficiency (d-glucose = 100), was d-galactose, 150; l-arabinose, 49; d-xylose, 18; and maltose, 6. The Km for d-glucose was 23.5 mm. Maltose, l-arabinose, and cellobiose were effective competitive inhibitors (Ki = 3.1, 6.3, and 12.3 mm, respectively). Phloridzin, phloretin, l-fucose, and l-deoxyglucose did not inhibit plant mutarotase. This is in marked contrast to the inhibitor specificity of the mammalian enzyme. The temperature optimum was 40°, and a broad pH-activity spectrum was displayed from pH 4.0 to 8.5, with the maximum at pH 7.4. The enzyme activity sedimented as a single band in sucrose density gradients and was eluted as a single peak from chromatographic columns. The molecular weight is approximately 50,000, and the turnover number is in excess of 8 x 105 moles of α- to β-glucose per min. The enzyme is sulfhydryl-dependent, being completely inactivated by 2 x 10-5 m mercuric chloride and reactivated by cysteine. A rapid, semiautomated assay procedure for the enzyme is also described."

Kinetic data have been obtained with the purified X4 isozyme of lactic dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) from rabbit and human spermatozoa, and compared with the data for the purified H4 and M4 isozymes. The studies indicate that the rabbit or human X4 isozymes have enzymatic properties very similar to those of the rabbit or human H4 isozymes, respectively. 2. The average molecular weight of the rabbit X4 isozyme was estimated by sucrose density gradient to be 150,000, identical with that of the rabbit H4 isozyme, while the rabbit M4 isozyme had an average molecular weight of 140,000. 3. The distribution of the X4 isozyme in various rabbit tissues was investigated, and bands corresponding to the X4 isozyme were found in the seminal fluid, and in extracts of heart, kidney, and the ampulla, as well as in the testes and spermatozoa. 4. Kinetic data concerning substrate inhibition by l-lactate of the rabbit H4 isozyme subbands was obtained, which demonstrate that these subbands do not all have the same enzymatic properties. 5. The electrophoretic patterns, molecular weights, heat stabilities, and enzymatic properties were interpreted as suggesting that the X4 isozyme and the subbands of rabbit lactic dehydrogenase are tetramers formed by hybrid subunits, and are not controlled by genes other than those controlling the synthesis of the H4 and M4 isozymes."

https://openalex.org/W1574617232,"Abstract The kinetics of the reaction of human deoxyhemoglobin with oxygen at high concentrations of ligand (∼10-4 m) has been studied with the use of a fast stopped flow apparatus with a dead time of approximately 300 µsec. The shape of the progress curve reveals that the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction with oxygen (k') increases with the extent of the reaction, similar to what was reported for other ligands (i.e. carbon monoxide). Within the oxygen concentration range studied, the rate of the reaction at any stage is proportional to the ligand concentration, notwithstanding the change in rate as the reaction proceeds. These results are interpreted to indicate that the ligand-linked intramolecular change in hemoglobin is a fast process which occurs in a fraction of a millisecond."
https://openalex.org/W1585381656,"Abstract A study on α1-acid glycoprotein by various techniques was carried out to investigate certain conformational transitions associated with the release of the buried tryptophan residues of this protein. The reactive tryptophan residues of α1-acid glycoprotein were determined with Koshland's reagent (2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylbromide). As solvents, sodium acetate buffers, pH 4.4, containing increasing concentrations of 2-chloroethanol or guanidine hydrochloride were used. In sodium acetate buffer alone, 2 of the 4 tryptophan residues were found to be reactive. In the presence of 50% 2-chloroethanol or 3 m guanidine hydrochloride, or after incubation at pH 13 for 30 min, all 4 residues reacted with Koshland's reagent. These results, together with the changes in the specific optical rotation and optical rotatory dispersion observed in the mentioned solvents, are discussed in relation to the changes in the structure of this protein induced by these solvents. In 2-chloroethanol a reversible transition of the β conformation of the native protein to a conformation that has properties similar to those of an α-helical structure was observed. In guanidine hydrochloride the conformation of α1-acid glycoprotein was also reversibly altered, but yielded a random coil structure. Incubation at pH 13 caused irreversible denaturation. Further, this study showed that the sialyl residues of this typical glycoprotein do not significantly influence the conformational transitions of its polypeptide chain. In a correlated study, the optical rotatory dispersion of the glycopeptide mixture derived from native α1-acid glycoprotein was determined and shown to account for only a small percentage of the optical rotatory dispersion of the glycoprotein. Hence, the Cotton effect of glycoproteins is essentially due to the conformation of their polypeptide moieties."

Of practical importance in clinical anaesthesia is the fact that in animals progesterone potentiated the effect of ether and chloroform2. No clinical confirmation of this effect in humans is, however, available. Paradoxically, it is believed that progesterone renders the respiratory centre more sensitive to carbon dioxide and that this may account for the lowered pCO2 in blood during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1564956714,"Studies on the biosynthesis of actinidine, the steam-volatile alkaloid of Actinidia polygama Miquel, show that radioactivity from mevalonate-2-14C, acetate-2-14C, and geranyl pyrophosphate-1-14C is incorporated into the alkaloid. Radioactivity from lysine-2-14C and quinolinic acid-2,3,5,7-14C is not incorporated. Radioactivity from uniformly labeled aspartic acid-14C is incorporated only during experiments of long duration. The results provide evidence for the isoprenoid origin of actinidine and show that lysine and quinolinic acid do not serve as precursors of the pyridine ring of actinidine; they thus demonstrate the existence of a third biosynthetic pathway for the formation of pyridine compounds in plants."

The 5'-substituted nucleotides were prepared to serve as nonpolymerizing substrates in kinetic studies of oligoribonucleotide synthesis. Reaction conditions were obtained which allowed a comparison of the synthetic activity of the native enzyme and the synthetically active derivative, e-dinitrophenyllysine-41-ribonuclease. Irrespective of substrate, the synthetic activity of the dinitrophenylated enzyme differed from that of unmodified ribonuclease with regard to optimal pH, proportionality to enzyme concentration, reaction velocity, and the effect of substrate concentration. In reactions catalyzed by ribonuclease A, the kinetic parameters (Km and Vm) for synthetic activity were identical with either nonpolymerizing pyrimidine cyclic phosphate. The e-dinitrophenyllysine-41-ribonuclease-catalyzed reactions yielded kinetic values which varied with the 5'-substituent of the cyclic phosphate. Relative to native ribonuclease, the apparent affinity (Km) of the substrates for the modified enzyme was not diminished, although the reaction velocity (Vm) was reduced. Analysis of the data suggests that the lysine-41 residue is not essential for pyrimidine cyclic phosphate binding, but may participate in the catalytic process required for synthetic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1561616958,"Analogues of 8-lysine-vasopressin in which the carboxamide groups on the glutamine and asparagine residues at positions 4 and 5 are replaced individually by hydrogen have been synthesized by the p-nitrophenyl ester method of peptide synthesis and tested for some of the pharmacological activities characteristic of this pressor-antidiuretic hormone of the posterior pituitary gland. The 4-decarboxamido-8-lysine-vasopressin ([4-α-aminobutyric acid]-8-lysine-vasopressin) has an antidiuretic potency of approximately 700 units per mg, nearly 3 times the potency of 8-lysine-vasopressin. It also possesses approximately 25% of the avian vasodepressor activity, 20% of the oxytocic activity, and 4% of the pressor activity of 8-lysine-vasopressin, whereas 5-decarboxamido-8-lysine-vasopressin ([5-alanine]-8-lysine-vasopressin) does not exhibit an appreciable degree of any of these activities. Thus the carboxamide group of the asparagine residue at position 5 of 8-lysine-vasopressin appears to play an important role in determining the pharmacological effects of the hormone. The corresponding 1-deamino analogues of the 4- and 5-decarboxamido-8-lysine-vasopressins, in which the free amino group on the half-cystine residue at position 1 is replaced by hydrogen, have also been synthesized. 1-Deamino-4-decarboxamido-8-lysine-vasopressin possesses extremely high antidiuretic activity (730 units per mg), low pressor activity (3.5 units per mg), and the same oxytocic and avian vasodepressor activities as 4-decarboxamido-8-lysine-vasopressin, whereas 1-deamino-5-decarboxamido-8-lysine-vasopressin is practically inactive. The successive replacement of the carboxamide and amino groups on the glutamine and half-cystine residues at positions 4 and 1, respectively, of 8-lysine-vasopressin thus results in a striking enhancement of antidiuretic activity coupled with a marked decrease in pressor activity."

https://openalex.org/W1535232903,"Abstract Respiration-linked Ca++ accumulation by rat liver or bovine heart mitochondria generates an apparent acid-base gradient between mitochondria and the suspending medium, composed of an increase in titratable alkalinity of the mitochondria (treated to render their dissociating groups accessible) and a decrease in pH and an increase of titratable acidity of the medium. This apparent gradient is not influenced or discharged during a subsequent addition of ADP and its phosphorylation to ATP. Thus, if respiratory energy is stored in the form of an acid-base or Ca++ gradient between mitochondria and medium, it is not available to be used for the phosphorylation of ADP. The significance of this finding with respect to the chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative phosphorylation and to the physical and chemical nature of the membrane changes during mitochondrial ion movements is briefly discussed."
