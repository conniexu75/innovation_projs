https://openalex.org/W1890358491,"We have examined the intracellular levels of the guanosine tetraphosphate, guanosine 5'-diphosphate 2'- or 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp), in an isogenic pair of stringent and relaxed strains of Escherichia coli. As previously observed, relaxed strains do not accumulate ppGpp during amino acid deprivation, while stringent strains do. However, under all other culture conditions examined, relaxed and stringent cells regulate their ppGpp levels similarly. During carbon deprivation or step-down transitions both strains accumulate ppGpp. Neither strain accumulates appreciable amounts during phosphate deprivation or after treatment with colicin E1. The basal levels of ppGpp observed in both stringent and relaxed strains during balanced growth are, in most cases, the same, and vary inversely with the growth rate and RNA content of the cells."

The membranes have been characterized by phase and electron microscopy and by the use of radioactive precursors to RNA, protein, glycoprotein, and lipid. The glycoprotein and polypeptide constituents have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis in conjunction with subfractionation by mild detergents. There appears to be a predominant species of polypeptide and [3H]-l-fucose-labeled glycoprotein having a molecular weight of 40,000 to 45,000. The number of plasma membrane ghosts in a preparation was determined by counting ghosts in a hemacytometer and the yield of ghosts was then found to be in the range of 10 to 20% of the number of cells used for the preparation. Purified plasma membranes labeled for 4 hours or more contained 70 to 100% of the total cell trichloroacetic acid insoluble [3H]-l-fucose. Thus, [3H]-l-fucose seems to be a specific label for HeLa cell plasma membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1623705260,"Abstract Several substrate-like epoxides were found to act as specific and irreversible inactivators of pepsin. Of these, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy) propane (EPNP) was the most potent. When EPNP reacted with pepsin, all enzyme activity was lost. Two molecules of EPNP were found to be covalently bound to each molecule of completely inactivated enzyme. In this reaction, two carboxyl groups of the enzyme are each apparently esterified by one hydroxyl of glycol formed from EPNP. The esterification of carboxylates by epoxides is a well established reaction. The modified enzyme, EPNP-pepsin, released the bound EPNP groups in alkaline solution. On thin layer chromatography, the released modifying was identified as the glycol of EPNP. These observations support the view that esterification was the inactivation reaction. Prior reaction of pepsin with diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methyl ester or p-bromophenacyl bromide was still followed by the reaction of 2 EPNP residues per pepsin molecule. The EPNP-reactive carboxyl must, therefore, differ from those carboxyl groups reacted with diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methyl ester and p-bromophenacyl bromide. EPNP failed to inactivate pepsinogen. Moreover, in the presence of synthetic substrates or their hydrolytic products, the inactivation of pepsin by EPNP was significantly slower. Results on the EPNP incorporation in the presence and absence of substrates indicated that only one of the two modified carboxyl groups was protected by the presence of the dipeptide substrate. This active center carboxyl group may participate in the catalysis of the enzyme. The second EPNP-reactive carboxyl was apparently not essential for enzyme activity. EPNP was found to inactivate other gastric proteases: human gastricsin, human pepsin, and bovine rennin. The stoichiometry of the reaction in human gastricsin and pepsin was identical with that in porcine pepsin."

The agent was isolated by cocultivation from biopsy specimens of two of five patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The virus was identified by hemagglutination-inhibition, immunofluorescent, and neutralization tests. Biopsies from controls did not show evidence of measles virus."
https://openalex.org/W1989289423,"Although the C1̅ inhibitor was detected in 5 to 10 percent of normal hepatic parenchymal cells by means of the immunofluorescent technique, none was seen in liver biopsies from two individuals with hereditary angioneurotic edema having low concentrations of C1̅ inhibitor in the serum. In contrast, the percentages of cells which reacted with fluorescent antiserums to C4 and transferrin were normal. These data suggest that in most subjects with hereditary angioneurotic edema, there is decreased synthesis of the C1̅ inhibitor but normal synthesis of C4, and that the disease results from this biosynthetic error."

https://openalex.org/W47885612,"Abstract Polynucleotide ligase purified from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T4 reacts with ATP to form a ligase-AMP complex which can be isolated by gel filtration. When this ligase-AMP complex is incubated with DNA containing single strand breaks (nicks), there is a transfer of the AMP from the enzyme to the 5'-phosphoryl terminus of the nick to form a pyrophosphate bond (AppDNA). If the reaction is carried out at 0° and at pH 5.6, AppDNA is accumulated. The AppDNA has been isolated and the character of the linkage of AMP to DNA has been elucidated by a number of physical and enzymatic studies. The chemical properties of this enzymatically synthesized AppDNA are identical with those of AppT(pT)n in which AMP has been chemically linked by a pyrophosphate bond to the 5'-terminal phosphate of an oligomer of thymidylic acid. App[poly(N)], whether synthesized by enzymatic or chemical means, serves as an intermediate in the reaction which is catalyzed by the T4 ligase, and in which phosphodiester bond formation is accompanied by stoichiometric release of adenosine 5'-phosphate. The reaction occurs in the absence of ATP and is specific for nicks in duplex polynucleotides. If the enzyme is first incubated with ATP, the reaction is strongly inhibited. A temperature-sensitive polynucleotide ligase purified from E. coli cells infected with a mutant of T4 bacteriophage is unable to carry out either this reaction or the over-all joining reaction at elevated temperatures. When dAMP is substituted for AMP in the chemically synthesized polynucleotide intermediate, joining occurs at 8% the normal rate. No joining is detected if GMP is used as the activating species. The rates of joining of d(pT)7, d(pT)12, AppT(pT)6, and AppT(pT)11 in the presence of poly d(A) have been determined at various temperatures, and provide a sensitive method for the analysis of secondary structure of polynucleotides."

But apart from the necessity of being competitive in market price, they must be acceptable to the human palate, a requirement that has often frustrated attempts to introduce new foods. In this light, the improvement of production and processing of a commodity which is currently marketed for direct human consumption but on a small and inefficient scale has several advantages. Such a commodity is the aquatic plant, Wolffia arrhiza Wimm., Lemnaceae, known to have been used as a vegetable by the Burmese, Laotians and the people of northern Thailand for many generations. The local Thai name for the plant, “khai-nam”, may be literally translated as eggs of the water and suggests the oval shape of the plant (length 1.5 mm, width 1.0 mm). Khai-nam is generally regarded as a poor people's food and has attracted little attention as a potentially significant source of human food. The species also occurs in India1, but no report has been made pertaining to its application as a food source in that country."
https://openalex.org/W1490956873,"Abstract Resting lymphocytes were found to accumulate rRNA in their cytoplasm at only half the rate at which the molecules were synthesized in the nucleus. This discrepancy was reversed by stimulating cell growth. This confirms, by independent means, conclusions reached previously on the basis of evidence showing rapid degradation of a large portion of newly synthesized 18 S rRNA in resting lymphocytes. By pulse chase studies with l-[methyl-3H]methionine it was shown that degradation of a fraction of newly synthesized 18 S rRNA molecules occurs shortly after cleavage of the 45 S pre-rRNA into 32 S and 18 S segments. Survival of new 18 S rRNA molecules was found to be dependent on continuous synthesis of a protein or proteins. Reduction of protein synthesis with cycloheximide caused exaggeration of 18 S RNA wastage normally occurring in resting cells. Increasing protein synthesis by temperature elevation reduced 18 S RNA wastage. Partial reduction of rRNA synthesis by low doses of actinomycin D caused an increased survival of those 18 S RNA molecules synthesized. This suggests that the protective protein acts on the new 18 S RNA molecule to prevent attack by ribonucleases, rather than acting on the degradative enzymes to alter their activity. The data support the conclusion that the survival of new 18 S rRNA molecules in resting lymphocytes is controlled by the rate of synthesis of a continuously produced protein. This control may act as a regulator of cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1500616201,"Escherichia coli strains with relaxed (CP79) and stringent (CP78) RNA control were examined in regard to their RNA synthesis and accumulation during balanced growth in two media supporting different growth rates, and during downshift transitions between them. Although the RNA content was greater for CP79 at both growth rates, the total rate of RNA synthesis was found to be proportional to the growth rate in both strains. Both strains traversed a downshift transition in about equal periods of time, but as a consequence of the relaxed mutation the reduction of the rate of RNA synthesis in CP79 was much less; the total rate of RNA synthesis was reduced during the downshift to 5% of the preshift rate in CP78 but to only 50% of the preshift rate in CP79. Therefore, cessation of RNA accumulation during the downshift in CP79 implies that considerable RNA degradation was required. Thus, in addition to its function during amino acid starvation, the rel gene increases the efficiency of the transition from fast to slow growth rates."

https://openalex.org/W1493207557,Abstract Escherichia coli tRNA has been fractionated on benzoylated DEAE-cellulose to yield five purified tRNAleu species. They differ in chromatographic behavior and in coding properties. These tRNAleu species are all charged by pure E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Partially purified leucyl-tRNA synthetase from KB cells or from yeast can esterify leucine completely only to some of the isoacceptors while insignificant reaction is observed with the others.
https://openalex.org/W1566716396,"Abstract Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies (enzyme-tRNA complex formation examined by gel filtration) were conducted in the same buffer with leucyl-tRNA synthetase and five tRNAleu isoacceptors, seryl-tRNA synthetase and three tRNAser isoacceptors, and valyl-tRNA synthetase and two tRNAval isoacceptors. All of the enzymes and tRNAs were highly purified from one strain of Escherichia coli K-12. The tRNA Km values and relative binding affinities are closely similar (estimates of ΔF range between 10 and 11 kcal per mole), suggesting that tRNA recognition by these three enzymes has some common thermodynamic feature. The results at least indicate basic similarities in the geometry of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA complex. This notion is supported by the finding that all three enzymes exhibit a reaction sequence of the bi uni uni bi ping pong type, the addition order of substrates being amino acid, ATP, tRNA. The three enzymes differ in their susceptibility to ATP substrate inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2076324805,"So far, all known studies of human meiosis have been performed on germinal cells obtained from testicular biopsies1,2. As this involves a surgical procedure to obtain the material, we wish to draw attention to the statement, first made by Michael and Joel3, that immature germ cells can regularly be seen in the seminal fluid of the human male. We have found that in smear preparations of the ejaculate of subjects with a normal sperm count, nearly 3% of the cells consist of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids (Table 1), the maximum percentage being 5%. A similar result was obtained by Heinke and Doepfmer4. As the sperm count decreases, however, the percentage of immature cells generally increases and, in some pathogenic cases, the percentage may be 40% or more5. We have characterized the cells in material in which a high percentage of the cells were immature as a preliminary to cytogenetic studies of human male meiosis."

https://openalex.org/W1496521946,"Abstract Bovine serum albumin has been shown to act as an acceptor for leucine and phenylalanine in the reaction catalyzed by leucyl, phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase. The acceptor activity was greatly enhanced if the albumin was first modified by the enzymatic addition of arginine at its NH2-terminal position. [3H]arginylalbumin was used as the protein acceptor for either [14C]leucine or [14C]phenylalanine. After tryptic digestion of the products, a doubly labeled peptide containing most of the incorporated [14C]amino acid was isolated. This peptide was identified by Edman degradation as [14C]leucyl- or [14C]phenylalanyl[3H]arginine. When untreated albumin was employed as acceptor, a much smaller fraction of the molecules was acylated; however, tryptic digestion yielded the same dipeptides. The radioactive proteins formed by acylation of arginylated albumin with either [14C]leucine or [14C]phenylalanine migrated during electrophoresis on cellulose acetate identically with those obtained when unmodified albumin was used as acceptor. Furthermore, digestion of these products with pepsin or Nagarse produced radioactive peptides which were indistinguishable by paper chromatography or electrophoresis. These data indicate that leucyl, phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase catalyzes the transfer of these amino acids specifically into peptide linkage with the NH2-terminal residue of the protein acceptor. They further suggest that acceptor activity in commercial preparations of bovine serum albumin is due to a fraction of the albumin molecules which contains arginine in the NH2-terminal position."

https://openalex.org/W1577760618,"A wild type strain of Salmonella typhimurium produced three forms (II, IIIa, and IIIb) of uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9), the molecular weights of which were around 40,000, 40,000, and 80,000, as determined by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. A deletion mutant his-519, lacking gene galF, produced a single species (IV) of the enzyme with a molecular weight around 80,000. Enzyme IIIa was converted in vitro into Enzyme II; this conversion required a factor that was present also in the cells lacking the galF gene. Enzyme IIIa was also converted into a dimer, IIIb, and this conversion was accelerated by small amounts of NaCl. Enzymes II, IIIb, and IV were stable and were not further converted into any other form at neutral pH. It is suggested that the structural gene for uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase, galU, codes for a polypeptide which forms a tightly associated dimer (Enzyme IV) in the absence of products specified by the gene galF. In the wild type cells, however, the products coded for by the galF gene modify the galU-specified polypeptide so that it can now exist as a monomer (Enzyme IIIa), which in turn can be further converted into Enzyme II or IIIb."
https://openalex.org/W1564474562,"Abstract Two genes were found to be involved in the synthesis of multiple forms of uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9) in Salmonella typhimurium. When one of them (galF) was deleted, all of the isozymic forms seen in the wild type extract (Enzymes II, IIIa, and IIIb) disappeared, and a single new form of the enzyme (Enzyme IV) was synthesized. When the other gene (galU) mutated to a leaky defective state, not only was the activity of Enzyme IV greatly reduced in the galF deletion strain but also the activities of Enzymes II, IIIa, and IIIb were very much diminished or undetectable in the strain containing the galF+ allele. Furthermore, strains containing another mutation in the galU gene produced a thermolabile Enzyme II in the presence of the galF+ allele. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that galU is a structural gene producing a polypeptide which is present in all the isozymic forms of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and that the product specified by the galF gene modifies this polypeptide so that it is converted into Enzymes II, IIIa, and IIIb."

https://openalex.org/W1970032390,"MOUSE lymphomas, such as 6C3HED, undergo complete regression after one or more injections of L-asparaginase1, and remissions have been reported in some patients with acute leukaemia after treatment with L-asparaginase2–4. Roberts et al.5 found that purified bacterial L-glutaminase inhibited the growth of Ehrlich mouse carcinoma. Before considering this enzyme for therapeutic studies in man, it is necessary to study in vitro effects of the enzyme on human blood cells. Previous work6 demonstrated that the cells of 6C3HED lymphoma do not survive incubation with very low concentrations of L-asparaginase (1.7 mIU/ml.), while the cells of the in vivo resistant variant of 6C3HED were not killed by 170 mIU of enzyme/ml. The blood lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were found to be more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to incubation with 170 mIU of L-asparaginase/ml. but not as sensitive as 6C3HED mouse lymphoma which responds in vivo to the enzyme. In this study, the slide chamber method7 was used to compare the sensitivity of normal and leukaemic lymphocytes to glutaminase."

The effect of Mn2+ is to cause the synthesis of an enzyme with a greater intrinsic activity and heat stability, but not to change the quantity of l-arabinose isomerase produced. Several divalent cations, including manganese, are able to confer heat stability. In contrast, Mn2+ is specifically required during synthesis for full activity. Mn2+ is unable to convert partially active enzyme to fully active enzyme either in vivo or in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W69986500,"Abstract A highly sensitive and specific enzymatic derivative method for the measurement of l-methionine is described. The procedure depends upon the addition of tracer quantities of l-[methyl-3H]methionine and its conversion to [3H, 14C]-S-adenosyl-l-methionine in the presence of [8-14C]ATP and of purified Escherichia coli ATP:l-methionine S-adenosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.13). The S-adenosyl-l-methionine is separated from the radioactive reactants and its 14C:3H ratio is a linear function of the quantity of l-methionine originally present. The method has been applied to the measurement of l-methionine in various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1595113652,"Abstract Escherichia coli thyA101 is a temperature-sensitive mutant altered in the structural gene for thymidylate synthetase. A previous study from this laboratory has shown that thyA101 belongs to a new class of temperature-sensitive mutants (Group IV) and is blocked in the synthesis of thymidylate synthetase at the level of the polyribosome complex. The block has been postulated to result from a conformational defect in the growing polypeptide chain of thymidylate synthetase. On shifting to the permissive temperature, the chain assumes the proper configuration and the enzyme is completed by a process requiring protein synthesis. This study describes conditions under which thyA101 cultures can carry out net synthesis of thymidylate synthetase at the nonpermissive temperature. A thyA101 culture grown at 25° and then shifted to 37°, the nonpermissive temperature, continues to form thymidylate synthetase, although more slowly than other proteins. Ultimately the enzyme is diluted during cell division and the Thy- phenotype is expressed in the form of thymineless death. Synthesis of thymidylate synthetase at 37° after shifting from 25° requires protein synthesis. Furthermore protein synthesis must also occur in the prior incubation at 25°. Density and temperature shift studies in D2O medium at 25° and H2O medium at 37° and the use of CsCl gradients to analyze for heavy and light enzyme activity have demonstrated that new thymidylate synthetase is synthesized at 37°. From these studies we have suggested a model for thyA101 in which thymidylate synthetase (or its subunits) previously formed at 25° interacts at 37° at the level of the polyribosome complex with the defective and blocked polypeptide chain to effect a conformational change which allows the protein to be completed. It was suggested that in this type of rescue the preformed subunit be considered as a conformational template."
