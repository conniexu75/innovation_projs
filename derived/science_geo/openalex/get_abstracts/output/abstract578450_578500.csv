https://openalex.org/W2582355481,"Integrins are adhesion receptors that transmit force across the plasma membrane between extracellular ligands and the actin cytoskeleton. In activation of the transforming growth factor-β1 precursor (pro-TGF-β1), integrins bind to the prodomain, apply force, and release the TGF-β growth factor. However, we know little about how integrins bind macromolecular ligands in the extracellular matrix or transmit force to them. Here we show how integrin αVβ6 binds pro-TGF-β1 in an orientation biologically relevant for force-dependent release of TGF-β from latency. The conformation of the prodomain integrin-binding motif differs in the presence and absence of integrin binding; differences extend well outside the interface and illustrate how integrins can remodel extracellular matrix. Remodelled residues outside the interface stabilize the integrin-bound conformation, adopt a conformation similar to earlier-evolving family members, and show how macromolecular components outside the binding motif contribute to integrin recognition. Regions in and outside the highly interdigitated interface stabilize a specific integrin/pro-TGF-β orientation that defines the pathway through these macromolecules which actin-cytoskeleton-generated tensile force takes when applied through the integrin β-subunit. Simulations of force-dependent activation of TGF-β demonstrate evolutionary specializations for force application through the TGF-β prodomain and through the β- and not α-subunit of the integrin."

Jordan Mayor et al. examine the ecosystem properties of treeline ecotones in mountainous areas of seven temperate regions of the world. They find that the reduction in temperature with increasing elevation does not affect tree leaf nutrient concentrations, but does reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen levels. This leads to a strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all of the regions. Temperature is a primary driver of the distribution of biodiversity as well as of ecosystem boundaries1,2. Declining temperature with increasing elevation in montane systems has long been recognized as a major factor shaping plant community biodiversity, metabolic processes, and ecosystem dynamics3,4. Elevational gradients, as thermoclines, also enable prediction of long-term ecological responses to climate warming5,6,7. One of the most striking manifestations of increasing elevation is the abrupt transitions from forest to treeless alpine tundra8. However, whether there are globally consistent above- and belowground responses to these transitions remains an open question4. To disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on ecosystem properties, here we evaluate replicate treeline ecotones in seven temperate regions of the world. We find that declining temperatures with increasing elevation did not affect tree leaf nutrient concentrations, but did reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen, leading to the strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all regions. Further, elevation-driven changes in plant nutrients were associated with changes in soil organic matter content and quality (carbon to nitrogen ratios) and microbial properties. Combined, our identification of direct and indirect temperature controls over plant communities and soil properties in seven contrasting regions suggests that future warming may disrupt the functional properties of montane ecosystems, particularly where plant community reorganization outpaces treeline advance."
https://openalex.org/W2581369360,"Elucidation of the evolutionary history and interrelatedness of Plasmodium species that infect humans has been hampered by a lack of genetic information for three human-infective species: P. malariae and two P. ovale species (P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri). These species are prevalent across most regions in which malaria is endemic and are often undetectable by light microscopy, rendering their study in human populations difficult. The exact evolutionary relationship of these species to the other human-infective species has been contested. Using a new reference genome for P. malariae and a manually curated draft P. o. curtisi genome, we are now able to accurately place these species within the Plasmodium phylogeny. Sequencing of a P. malariae relative that infects chimpanzees reveals similar signatures of selection in the P. malariae lineage to another Plasmodium lineage shown to be capable of colonization of both human and chimpanzee hosts. Molecular dating suggests that these host adaptations occurred over similar evolutionary timescales. In addition to the core genome that is conserved between species, differences in gene content can be linked to their specific biology. The genome suggests that P. malariae expresses a family of heterodimeric proteins on its surface that have structural similarities to a protein crucial for invasion of red blood cells. The data presented here provide insight into the evolution of the Plasmodium genus as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2582363697,"CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated) systems are RNA-guided adaptive immunity pathways used by bacteria and archaea to defend against phages and plasmids. Type III-A systems use a multisubunit interference complex called Csm, containing Cas proteins and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target cognate nucleic acids. The Csm complex is intriguing in that it mediates RNA-guided targeting of both RNA and transcriptionally active DNA, but the mechanism is not well understood. Here, we overexpressed the five components of the Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) Type III-A Csm complex (TthCsm) with a defined crRNA sequence, and purified intact TthCsm complexes from E. coli cells. The complexes were thermophilic, targeting complementary ssRNA more efficiently at 65°C than at 37°C. Sequence-independent, endonucleolytic cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by TthCsm was triggered by recognition of a complementary ssRNA, and required a lack of complementarity between the first 8 nucleotides (5' tag) of the crRNA and the 3' flanking region of the ssRNA. Mutation of the histidine-aspartate (HD) nuclease domain of the TthCsm subunit, Cas10/Csm1, abolished DNA cleavage. Activation of DNA cleavage was dependent on RNA binding but not cleavage. This leads to a model in which binding of an ssRNA target to the Csm complex would stimulate cleavage of exposed ssDNA in the cell, such as could occur when the RNA polymerase unwinds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) during transcription. Our findings establish an amenable, thermostable system for more in-depth investigation of the targeting mechanism using structural biology methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W2579960265,"Slow oscillations are important for consolidation of memory during sleep, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients experience memory disturbances. Thus, we examined slow oscillation activity in an animal model of AD. APP mice exhibit aberrant slow oscillation activity. Aberrant inhibitory activity within the cortical circuit was responsible for slow oscillation dysfunction, since topical application of GABA restored slow oscillations in APP mice. In addition, light activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expressed in excitatory cortical neurons restored slow oscillations by synchronizing neuronal activity. Driving slow oscillation activity with ChR2 halted amyloid plaque deposition and prevented calcium overload associated with this pathology. Thus, targeting slow oscillatory activity in AD patients might prevent neurodegenerative phenotypes and slow disease progression."

https://openalex.org/W2581865612,"Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas. These macromolecular machineries inject toxins directly into prokaryotic or eukaryotic prey cells. Hcp proteins are structural components of the extracellular part of this machinery. We recently reported that MFE01, an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens, possesses at least two hcp genes, hcp1 and hcp2, encoding proteins playing important roles in interbacterial interactions. Indeed, P. fluorescens MFE01 can immobilise and kill diverse bacteria of various origins through the action of the Hcp1 or Hcp2 proteins of the T6SS. We show here that another Hcp protein, Hcp3, is involved in killing prey cells during co-culture on solid medium. Even after the mutation of hcp1, hcp2, or hcp3, MFE01 impaired biofilm formation by MFP05, a P. fluorescens strain isolated from human skin. These mutations did not reduce P. fluorescens MFE01 biofilm formation, but the three Hcp proteins were required for the completion of biofilm maturation. Moreover, a mutant with a disruption of one of the unique core component genes, MFE01ΔtssC, was unable to produce its own biofilm or inhibit MFP05 biofilm formation. Finally, MFE01 did not produce detectable N-acyl-homoserine lactones for quorum sensing, a phenomenon reported for many other P. fluorescens strains. Our results suggest a role for the T6SS in communication between bacterial cells, in this strain, under biofilm conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2581143476,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been successfully used as a non-invasive therapeutic intervention for several neurological disorders in the clinic as well as an investigative tool for basic neuroscience. rTMS has been shown to induce long-term changes in neuronal circuits in vivo. Such long-term effects of rTMS have been investigated using behavioral, imaging, electrophysiological, and molecular approaches, but there is limited understanding of the immediate effects of TMS on neurons. We investigated the immediate effects of high frequency (20 Hz) rTMS on the activity of cortical neurons in an effort to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms activated by rTMS. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute rat brain slices and calcium imaging of cultured primary neurons to examine changes in neuronal activity and intracellular calcium respectively. Our results indicate that each TMS pulse caused an immediate and transient activation of voltage gated sodium channels (9.6 ± 1.8 nA at -45 mV, p value < 0.01) in neurons. Short 500 ms 20 Hz rTMS stimulation induced action potentials in a subpopulation of neurons, and significantly increased the steady state current of the neurons at near threshold voltages (at -45 mV: before TMS: I = 130 ± 17 pA, during TMS: I = 215 ± 23 pA, p value = 0.001). rTMS stimulation also led to a delayed increase in intracellular calcium (153.88 ± 61.94% increase from baseline). These results show that rTMS has an immediate and cumulative effect on neuronal activity and intracellular calcium levels, and suggest that rTMS may enhance neuronal responses when combined with an additional motor, sensory or cognitive stimulus. Thus, these results could be translated to optimize rTMS protocols for clinical as well as basic science applications."
https://openalex.org/W2582747119,"Introduction Sepsis is dysregulated systemic inflammatory response which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. With an estimated 30 million cases per year, it is a global public health concern. Severe infections leading to sepsis account for more than half of all under five deaths and around one quarter of all neonatal deaths annually. Most of these deaths occur in low and middle income countries and could be averted by rapid assessment and appropriate treatment. Evidence suggests that service provision and quality of care pertaining to sepsis management in resource poor settings can be improved significantly with minimum resource allocation and investments. Cognizant of the stark realities, a project titled ‘Interrupting Pathways to Sepsis Initiative’ (IPSI) introduced a package of interventions for improving quality of care pertaining to sepsis management at 2 sub-district level public hospitals in rural Bangladesh. We present here the quality improvement process and achievements regarding some fundamental steps of sepsis management which include rapid identification and admission, followed by assessment for hypoxemia, hypoglycaemia and hypothermia, immediate resuscitation when required and early administration of parenteral broad spectrum antibiotics. Materials and Method Key components of the intervention package include identification of structural and functional gaps through a baseline environmental scan, capacity development on protocolized management through training and supportive supervision by onsite ‘Program Coaches’, facilitating triage and rapid transfer of patients through ‘Welcoming Persons’ and enabling rapid treatment through ‘Task Shifting’ from on-call physicians to on-duty paramedics in the emergency department and on-call physicians to on-duty nurses in the inpatient department. Results From August, 2013 to March, 2015, 1,262 under-5 children were identified as syndromic sepsis in the emergency departments; of which 82% were admitted. More neonates (30%) were referred to higher level facilities than post-neonates (6%) (p<0.05). Immediately after admission, around 99% were assessed for hypoxemia, hypoglycaemia and hypothermia. Around 21% were hypoxemic (neonate-37%, post-neonate-18%, p<0.05), among which 94% received immediate oxygenation. Vascular access was established in 78% cases and 85% received recommended broad spectrum antibiotics parenterally within 1 hour of admission. There was significant improvement in the rate of establishing vascular access and choice of recommended first line parenteral antibiotic over time. After arrival in the emergency department, the median time taken for identification of syndromic sepsis and completion of admission procedure was 6 minutes. The median time taken for completion of assessment for complications was 15 minutes and administration of first dose of broad spectrum antibiotics was 35 minutes. There were only 3 inpatient deaths during the reporting period. Discussion and Conclusion Needs based health systems strengthening, supportive-supervision and task shifting can improve the quality and timeliness of in-patient management of syndromic sepsis in resource limited settings."

PF4 is stored in platelet α-granules bound to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of serglycin. This study revealed that platelet serglycin is decorated with chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and that PF4 binds to these GAG chains. Additionally, PF4 had a higher affinity for endothelial-derived perlecan heparan sulfate chains than serglycin GAG chains.

Vascular permeation of platelet factor 4 after endothelial injury.Science. 1980; 209: 611-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It binds to endothelial cells through integrins αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 (3.Aidoudi S. Bujakowska K. Kieffer N. Bikfalvi A.

PF4 inhibits heparin binding growth factors, including FGF2 and VEGF165, binding to their receptors through both heparin-dependent and -independent mechanisms (5.Sato Y. Abe M. Takaki R.

PF4 promotes pro-coagulant activities by preventing the formation of a stable heparin·anti-thrombin III·thrombin ternary complex (9.Lane D.A. Denton J. Flynn A.M. Thunberg L. Lindahl U. Anticoagulant activities of heparin oligosaccharides and their netrualization by platelet factor 4.Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The presence of heparin·PF4 immune complexes suggests that PF4 has a high affinity for heparin and that it is not a normally occurring complex in the blood stream. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can occur via both non-immune and immune mediated complications of heparin administration in some patients (10.Baroletti S.A. Goldhaber S.Z. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.Circulation. 2006; 114: e355-e356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by the formation of heparin·PF4 complexes that are recognized as foreign, resulting in the formation of antibodies against the complex. These antibodies bind to the heparin·PF4 complex and platelets themselves, increasing coagulation and reducing levels of circulating platelets. Serglycin is an intracellular proteoglycan produced by hematopoietic cells including neutrophils, mast cells, macrophages, and platelets (11.Kolset S.O. Gallagher J.T. Proteoglycans in haemopoietic cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 191-211PubMed Google Scholar), as well as cells of non-hematopoietic origin including smooth muscle and endothelial cells (12.Lemire J.M. Chan C.K. Bressler S. Miller J.

The name serglycin was derived from the serine-glycine repeat structure where up to eight GAG chains can decorate the protein core of ∼18 kDa. The type and sulfation of GAG chains that decorate serglycin are cell type-dependent mechanisms in which connective tissue mast cells decorate serglycin with heparin (14.Kolset S.O. Pejler G. Serglycin: a structural and functional chameleon with wide impact on immune cells.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 4927-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas mucosal tissue mast cells decorate serglycin with CS (15.Kolset S.O. Tveit H. Serglycin-structure and biology.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), neutrophils and platelets decorate serglycin with CS, and macrophages decorate serglycin with CS and HS (16.Kolset S.O.

Serglycin is located in the α-granules of platelets where it is bound to many cytokines and proteases, including PF4, until they become activated (15.Kolset S.O. Tveit H. Serglycin-structure and biology.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Serglycin knock-out mice exhibit a reduced platelet aggregation response and reduced levels of platelet α-granule proteins including PF4, β-thromboglobulin, and platelet-derived growth factor that are thought to be related to defects in packaging and secretion of α-granule proteins, including proteases, that are required for platelet activation (17.Woulfe D.S.

Perlecan is an HS proteoglycan present in the basement membrane that binds and supports the signaling of heparin binding growth factors including FGFs and VEGFs (18.Whitelock J.M. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Underwood P.A. The degradation of human endothelial cell-derived perlecan and release of bound basic fibroblast growth factor by stromelysin, collagenase, plasmin, and heparanases.J. Biol.

In addition, perlecan supports platelet adhesion via the integrin α2β1 (20.Lord M.S. Yu W. Cheng B. Simmons A. Poole-Warren L. Whitelock J.M.

This study demonstrated that platelet serglycin is decorated with CS and DS and that PF4 binds to the CS/DS chains. Additionally, PF4 has a higher affinity for perlecan HS chains than serglycin GAG chains and can be competed from complexes with serglycin in the presence of perlecan. The binding of PF4 to perlecan inhibits both FGF signaling and platelet activation. Peptide identification of proteins present in the proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract by mass spectrometry identified two cell surface proteoglycans, betaglycan and syndecan-1, as well as the intracellular proteoglycan serglycin (Table 1). This fraction also contained PF4, indicating that it may be closely associated with the proteoglycans in this fraction.TABLE 1Proteoglycans and PF4 identified in proteoglycan enriched platelet extract detected by peptide LC-MS2 from an in-solution tryptic digest and ranked by molecular mass search score (MOWSE score)Peptide identifiedProtein molecular massMOWSE scoreaMOWSE score as determined by Mascot query.

Open table in a new tab Platelet-derived serglycin was analyzed by Western blotting and detected as a smear between apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of 75,000 and more than 250,000, which corresponded to the expected size of serglycin decorated with GAGs (Fig. 1A, first lane). It should be noted that the protein standards migrate faster than glycosylated proteins; therefore the Mr reported are estimates. Treatment of the serglycin with chondroitinase (C'ase) ABC to digest GAG chains containing both CS and DS disaccharides resulted in a reduction of the Mr of the smear to ∼25,000, corresponding to the protein core indicating that platelet-derived serglycin contained ∼45,000–225,000 CS and/or DS (Fig. 1A, second lane). Treatment of the serglycin with C'ase ACII that digests only terminal CS disaccharides resulted in a shift in Mr of the platelet-derived serglycin in the range of 70,000 to more than 250,000, but not the generation of the protein core (Fig. 1A, third lane). Similarly C'ase B only removes terminal DS disaccharides and resulted in a shift in Mr of the platelet derived serglycin to 65,000 to more than 250,000, but not the generation of the protein core (Fig. 1B, fourth lane). Because C'ases ACII and B are exoglycosidases, it indicated that the GAG chains that decorated this form of serglycin contained both CS and DS disaccharides (Fig. 1B). This would account for the small shift in Mr when treated with either C'ase ACII or B, because once a terminal disaccharide was encountered that the enzyme could not digest, then digestion would cease. Treatment of the sample with heparinase III (HepIII) indicated that the platelet-derived serglycin was not decorated with HS because there was no change in Mr compared with the undigested sample (Fig. 1A, first and fifth lanes). Proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract was also analyzed by ELISA for the presence of serglycin (Fig. 1C). Low levels of serglycin were detected in the undigested sample; however, upon digesytion with either C'ase ABC or C'ase B, significantly higher (p < 0.05) levels of serglycin were detected, indicating that CS and DS disaccharides decorated the protein core of serglycin and that these GAG chains hindered the access of the antibody to the epitopes present on the protein core. Treatment of the proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract with HepIII did not alter the level of serglycin detected compared with the undigested sample, confirming that platelet-derived serglycin was not decorated with HS (Fig. 1C). Serglycin was found to contain the 4-sulfated stub structure after C'ase ABC digestion, but not C'ase B digestion, indicating that only CS disaccharides were present close to the protein core and were decorated with 4-sulfated CS stubs (Fig. 1D). Un- and 6-sulfated CS stubs were not detected after digestion with either C'ase ABC or B (data not shown). The CS chain structures present in the proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract were reactive with the CS antibody clone CS-56 (Fig. 1E), indicating the presence of CS disaccharides with the sequence GlcUA-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S) (23.Ito Y. Hikino M. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sirko S. von Holst A. Faissner A. Fukui S. Sugahara K. Structural characterization of the epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies 473HD, CS-56, and MO-225 specific for chondroitin sulfate D-type using the oligosaccharide library.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). There was a background level of reactivity with the CS chain antibody clones LY-111 and MO-225 (data not shown). The types of GAG chains attached to serglycin that were involved in the binding of PF4 were investigated using the proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract. Proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract was probed for the presence of PF4 and found to contain immunoreactive bands as a smear between 70,000 and more than 250,000, which corresponded to the expected Mr of serglycin (Fig. 2A, first lane 1). Additionally, PF4 was detected at Mr 8,000, corresponding to its monomer form. PF4 was present at Mr 8,000 in the extract following either C'ase ABC, ACII, or B digestion, indicating that PF4 was released from the proteoglycans in the extract following digestion of the CS/DS chains (Fig. 2A, second, third, and fourth lanes). Together with the data presented in Fig. 1A, which demonstrated a minimal level of GAG digestion when either C'ase ACII or B was used alone, this indicated that the majority of PF4 bound to the non-reducing end of the GAG chains. To confirm that PF4 was bound to serglycin via its CS/DS chains, a sandwich ELISA was performed where a serglycin polyclonal antibody was used to immobilize serglycin from the proteoglycan-enriched platelet extract and a monoclonal PF4 antibody was used to detect the presence of PF4 in the fraction or in the fraction following C'ase ABC, ACII, or B digestion (Fig. 2B). PF4 bound to serglycin in the undigested extract, whereas the levels of PF4 bound to serglycin were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced following digestion with either C'ase ABC, ACII or B, indicating that PF4 was bound to platelet serglycin via CS/DS chains. To further explore the interaction between PF4 and serglycin, recombinantly expressed serglycin decorated with CS/DS, HS/heparin (24.Lord M.S. Cheng B. Tang F. Lyons J.G. Rnjak-Kovacina J. Whitelock J.M. Bioengineered human heparin with anticoagulant activity.Metab. Eng. 2016; 38: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used. Recombinant serglycin did not contain PF4 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) when compared with a positive control of PF4 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Incubation of recombinant serglycin with PF4 resulted in complexes with Mr of 100,000 to greater than 250,000, as well as PF4 at Mr of 8,000 when analyzed by Western blotting with a PF4 antibody (Fig. 3B, lane 1), indicating similar-sized complexes were formed as for platelet-derived serglycin with PF4. Incubation of recombinant serglycin with PF4 followed by digestion with either C'ase ABC or B resulted in a reduction in level of complexes with Mr of 100,000 to greater than 250,000 and the presence of PF4 monomers at Mr 8,000 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4). Incubation of recombinant serglycin with PF4 followed by digestion with either C'ase ACII or HepIII resulted in a broader range of complexes with Mr of 50,000 to greater than 250,000 and the presence of PF4 monomers at Mr 8,000 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5). Incubation of recombinant serglycin with PF4 followed by digestion with both C'ase ABC and HepIII resulted in the presence of PF4 monomers at Mr 8,000 (Fig. 3B, lane 6). These data indicated that PF4 bound to the recombinant serglycin predominantly via by CS, DS, and HS/heparin. These data also indicated differences in the binding of PF4 to recombinant serglycin compared with platelet serglycin because of the presence of the HS/heparin. A sandwich ELISA was also performed following incubation of recombinant serglycin with PF4 and GAG digestion. This assay revealed that PF4 bound to the recombinant serglycin via both CS and DS, with DS involved to a significantly greater (p < 0.05) extent than CS (Fig. 3C). Additionally, PF4 was found to bind to the HS/heparin chains attached to the recombinant serglycin. The ability of PF4 to bind to HS was further explored using endothelial-derived perlecan that was exclusively decorated with HS and as perlecan is abundant in the vascular basement membrane. PF4 bound to endothelial-derived perlecan to a significantly greater (p < 0.05) extent than recombinant serglycin when coated at the same concentration (Fig. 4A). PF4 did not bind to endothelial perlecan that had been treated with HepIII to remove its HS chains (Fig. 4A), indicating that PF4 only bound to the HS that decorated the protein core. PF4 bound to recombinantly expressed perlecan domain V via both its CS and HS chains (Fig. 4B). Surface plasmon resonance studies indicated that PF4 bound to immobilized heparin, perlecan, and serglycin in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5). The association rate was similar for each condition with equilibrium reached rapidly followed by a slow dissociation (Fig. 5, A–C). The equilibrium constants were 25, 100, and 50 nm for heparin, serglycin, and perlecan, respectively, indicating that PF4 had the highest affinity for heparin followed by perlecan and serglycin (Fig. 5D). Control experiments performed with perlecan predigested with Hep III to remove HS and serglycin predigested with both C'ase ABC and HepIII to remove CS/DS and HS gave baseline sensorgrams indicating that growth factor binding was only to the GAG chains (data not shown). Analysis of the level of PF4 binding to heparin (Fig. 5A) indicated that one PF4 tetramer bound per heparin chain. This analysis is not possible for the proteoglycans because the relative contribution of the protein and GAG chains to the response units measured by the instrument cannot be determined. The relative affinity of PF4 for perlecan and serglycin was analyzed in an ELISA assay where serglycin was immobilized on the ELISA plate and incubated with PF4 followed by incubation with perlecan. Perlecan was able to release PF4 from serglycin as detected by a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the level of PF4 bound to serglycin after incubation with perlecan compared with without soluble perlecan treatment (Fig. 6). However, when the PF4·serglycin complex was incubated with perlecan that had been digested with HepIII to remove its HS chains, there was no change in the level of PF4 bound to serglycin, indicating that the protein core of perlecan did not release PF4 from serglycin. Incubation of the PF4·serglycin complex with perlecan domain V was also able to release PF4 from serglycin, and this interaction was found to be dependent on the presence of the HS chains. Treatment of the PF4·serglycin complex with GAG digestion enzymes alone under the same conditions had no effect on the level of PF4 bound to serglycin because of the short incubation times used in this assay. This indicated that PF4 had a higher affinity for perlecan HS than serglycin GAG chains. The ability of ternary complexes to form between heparin, FGF2, and FGF receptor 1c (FGFR1c) and signal in the presence of PF4 was analyzed in BaF-32 cells transfected with FGFR1c (Fig. 7). Heparin and FGF2 were used as a positive control for the assay, whereas cells in the presence of medium or growth factor alone were used as negative controls. BaF-32 cells expressing FGFR1c responded to FGF2 in the presence of heparin to a level significantly above (p < 0.05) the medium only control; however, in the presence of PF4 at concentrations of 0.64–2.56 μm, the level of signaling was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared with the positive control (Fig. 7A). Perlecan in the presence of FGF2 was able to signal to a similar extent as the positive control; however, in the presence of PF4, the level of signaling was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) and at a level comparable to the negative control as well as perlecan in the absence of growth factor (Fig. 7B). These data indicated that PF4 could inhibit the binding and signaling of FGF2 through both heparin and perlecan HS. Platelet activation was determined by measuring P-selectin expression. Type I collagen was used as a positive control for the assay, whereas freshly isolated platelets were used as the negative control (Fig. 8A). Exposure of platelets to PF4 was found to increase P-selectin expression, but not to the same extent as exposure to collagen type I. Exposure of platelets to heparin, endothelial perlecan, or recombinant serglycin did not activate platelets (Fig. 8B). Preincubation of PF4 with perlecan, serglycin, or heparin before exposure to the platelets inhibited the PF4 mediated activation of platelets (Fig. 8C), suggesting that the GAG chains modulated the activity of PF4. This study demonstrated that platelets contain serglycin decorated with GAG chains that consist of both CS and DS disaccharides with 4-sulfated CS closer to the protein core and part of the linkage tetrasaccharide structure. This finding extends previous reports that platelet serglycin is decorated with CS containing 4-sulfated disaccharides (17.Woulfe D.S. Lilliendahl J.K. August S. Rauova L. Kowalska M.A. Abrink M.

PF4 was found to bind to platelet serglycin through both CS and DS as well as perlecan through HS chains. Additionally, PF4 bound to recombinant serglycin via CS, DS, and HS/heparin chains further supporting the affinity of PF4 for a variety of GAG chains. Previous analyses of the affinity of PF4 for various GAG chains revealed that PF4 had the highest affinity for heparin followed by CSD or E, HS, and CSA, B, or C (25.Vandercappellen J. Van Damme J.

Cohen H.J. Purification and binding properties of human platelet factor four.J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4273-4282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The affinity of PF4 for proteoglycans was explored for the time in this study and indicated that PF4 had a higher affinity for perlecan decorated with HS than serglycin predominantly decorated with CS/DS. PF4 has been established to be a tetrameric complex at physiological pH and ionic strength via NMR and neutron scattering (29.Ibel K. Poland G.A. Baldwin J.P. Pepper D.S. Luscombe M. Holbrook J.J.

An NMR and site-directed mutagenesis study: arginine residues are crucial for binding.Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Models of these studies support the hypothesis that the heparin chain wraps around the PF4 tetramer (30.Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Roongta V. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T. Daly T.J. Heparin binding to platelet factor-4. An NMR and site-directed mutagenesis study: arginine residues are crucial for binding.Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although this arrangement is likely with exposure of PF4 tetramers to single GAG chains, physiologically it is likely that the PF4 will be exposed to serglycin with eight GAG chains and perlecan with three GAG chains. Given the close proximity of the GAG chains on both serglycin and perlecan, there is limited flexibility for the chains to wrap around the PF4 tetramers as is possible with an isolated GAG chain. Thus there is the possibility of multiple GAG chains binding the PF4 tetramers as depicted in Fig. 9; however, this model remains to be experimentally verified. Following vascular injury, platelets are known to adhere to the denuded vascular basement membrane, particularly to collagen, inducing platelet aggregation, activation, and the release of PF4. PF4 is released from platelets in complex with serglycin (31.Capitanio A.M. Niewiarowski S. Rucinski B. Tuszynski G.P. Cierniewski C.S. Hershock D. Kornecki E. Interaction of platelet factor 4 with human platelets.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus the release of PF4 from serglycin GAG chains by perlecan HS, as demonstrated in this study, is a likely mechanism by which PF4 is transferred to the vascular basement membrane as observed in vivo (2.Goldberg I.D. Stemerman M.B. Handin R.I. Vascular permeation of platelet factor 4 after endothelial injury.Science. 1980; 209: 611-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Additionally, under physiological conditions, endothelial cell surface GAG chains bind basal levels of platelet-derived PF4 (32.Dawes J. Pumphrey C.W. McLaren K.M. Prowse C.V. Pepper D.S. The in vivo release of human platelet factor 4 by heparin.Thrombosis Res. 1982; 27: 65-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

Intradermal injection of treated sarcoidosis spleen tissue resulted in a granuloma response at injection site by 4-6 weeks. Previous work indicates proteins as the possible trigger of this reaction. We aimed to identify Kv-specific proteins and characterise the ex vivo response of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and healthy control patients when stimulated with both Kv and selected Kv-specific proteins.Kv extracts were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE and 2D-DIGE and then underwent mass spectrometric analysis for protein identification. Sarcoidosis and control PBMCs were first stimulated with Kv and then with three selected recombinant protein candidates which were identified from the proteomic analysis. PBMC secreted cytokines were subsequently measured by Multiplex Cytokine Assay.We observed significantly increased IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion from Kv-stimulated PBMCs of sarcoidosis patients vs. PBMCs from healthy volunteers (IFN-γ: 207.2 pg/mL vs. 3.86 pg/mL, p = 0.0018; TNF-α: 2375 pg/mL vs. 42.82 pg/mL, p = 0.0003). Through proteomic approaches we then identified 74 sarcoidosis tissue-specific proteins. Of these, 3 proteins (vimentin, tubulin and alpha-actinin-4) were identified using both 1D-SDS-PAGE and 2D-DIGE. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005150. Increased cytokine secretion was subsequently observed with vimentin stimulation of sarcoidosis PBMCs vs. tuberculosis PBMCs (IFN-γ: 396.6 pg/mL vs 0.1 pg/mL, p = 0.0009; TNF-α: 1139 pg/mL vs 0.1 pg/mL, p<0.0001).

No difference was found in cytokine secretion between sarcoidosis and control PBMCs when stimulated with either tubulin or alpha-actinin-4.Stimulation with both Kveim reagent and vimentin induces a specific pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from sarcoidosis PBMCs. Further investigation of cellular immune responses to Kveim-specific proteins may identify novel biomarkers to assist the diagnosis of sarcoidosis."

https://openalex.org/W2581037780,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones that are perceived at the plasma membrane (PM) by the ligand binding receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and the co-receptor SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE 3/BRI1 ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (SERK3/BAK1). To visualize BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-mCherry in the plane of the PM, variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM) was employed, which allows selective illumination of a thin surface layer. VAEM revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-mCherry at the PM, which we attribute to the presence of distinct nanoclusters. Neither the BRI1 nor the SERK3/BAK1 nanocluster density is affected by depletion of endogenous ligands or application of exogenous ligands. To reveal interacting populations of receptor complexes, we utilized selective-surface observation-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (SSO-FLIM) for the detection of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Using this approach, we observed hetero-oligomerisation of BRI1 and SERK3 in the nanoclusters, which did not change upon depletion of endogenous ligand or signal activation. Upon ligand application, however, the number of BRI1-SERK3 /BAK1 hetero-oligomers was reduced, possibly due to endocytosis of active signalling units of BRI1-SERK3/BAK1 residing in the PM. We propose that formation of nanoclusters in the plant PM is subjected to biophysical restraints, while the stoichiometry of receptors inside these nanoclusters is variable and important for signal transduction."

In screening for collagen substrate sites for the remaining members of the vertebrate P3H family, P3h3 and Sc65 knock-out mice revealed a common lysine under-hydroxylation effect at helical domain cross-linking sites in skin, bone, tendon, aorta, and cornea. No effect on prolyl 3-hydroxylation was evident on screening the spectrum of known 3-hydroxyproline sites from all major tissue collagen types.

We therefore investigated whether glucose concentrations influence STAT3 expression in type 1 endometrial cancer, and whether such STAT3 expression might be inhibited by metformin.In Ishikawa (grade 1) endometrial cancer cells subjected to media with low, normal, or high concentrations of glucose, expression of STAT3 and its target proteins was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ishikawa cells were treated with metformin and assessed with cell proliferation, survival, migration, and ubiquitin assays, as well as Western blot and qPCR. Expression of apoptosis proteins was evaluated with Western blot in Ishikawa cells transfected with a STAT3 overexpression plasmid and treated with metformin. A xenograft tumor model was used for studying the in vivo efficacy of metformin.Expression of STAT3 and its target proteins was increased in Ishikawa cells cultured in high glucose media. In vitro, metformin inhibited cell proliferation, survival and migration but induced apoptosis. Metformin reduced expression levels of pSTAT3 ser727, total STAT3, and its associated cell survival and anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, metformin treatment was associated with increased degradation of pSTAT3 ser727. No change in apoptotic protein expression was noticed with STAT3 overexpression in Ishikawa cells. In vivo, metformin treatment led to a decrease in tumor weight as well as reductions of STAT3, pSTAT3 ser727, its target proteins.These results suggest that STAT3 expression in type 1 endometrial cancer is stimulated by a high glucose environment and inhibited by metformin."

Twenty-two male rugby sevens players from the Brazilian National Olympic Team (Rio-2016) performed vertical jumping tests (squat and countermovement jumps [SJ and CMJ]), JS and HS exercises, COD speed test and sprinting velocity in 40 m, in this order. Based on the results of the MPP in the JS and HS exercises the participants were divided, using the median split, into four groups as follows: higher JS, lower JS, higher HS, and lower HS. Between-group differences in the functional tasks were detected via magnitude-based inferences. The athletes with higher MPP in the JS were capable of jumping higher and sprinting faster (including the COD speed test) than their weaker counterparts. This pattern was not observed in the HS exercise. To conclude, JS was shown to be more connected to sprinting, COD speed and jumping abilities than HS in elite rugby sevens players and should be preferred for assessing and possibly training elite athletes needing to improve speed-power related abilities."

Previous studies indicated that inhibition of histone deacetylases or methyltransferase, such as G9A, using Trichostatin A (TSA) or BIX-01294 significantly enhanced the developmental efficiency of porcine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. However, potential mechanisms underlying the improved early developmental competence of SCNT embryos exposed to TSA and BIX-01294 are largely unclear. Here we found that 50 nM TSA or 1.0 μM BIX-01294 treatment alone for 24 h significantly elevated the blastocyst rate (P < 0.05), while further improvement was not observed under combined treatment condition. Furthermore, co-treatment or TSA treatment alone significantly reduced H3K9me2 level at the 4-cell stage, which is comparable with that in in vivo and in vitro fertilized counterparts. However, only co-treatment significantly decreased the levels of 5mC and H3K9me2 in trophectoderm lineage and subsequently increased the expression of OCT4 and CDX2 associated with ICM and TE lineage differentiation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that co-treatment of TSA and BIX-01294 enhances the early developmental competence of porcine SCNT embryos via improvements in epigenetic status and protein expression."

When mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with EGT, TLR signal-mediated cytokine production was augmented in BMDMs. The results were reproducible with TLR2, 3, 4 and 7 agonists. In particular, IL-6 and IL-12p40 were elevated further by pretreatment with EGT in BMDMs, suggesting the induction of M1 polarization. In co-culture assay with OT-II CD4+ T cells and splenic F4/80+ macrophages, EGT significantly induced Th17 skewing in CD4+ T cells.

The biochemical step is mediated by a complex network of signaling proteins in spines. Two-photon imaging techniques combined with two-photon glutamate uncaging allows researchers to induce and quantify structural plasticity in single dendritic spines. However, this method is laborious and slow, making it unsuitable for high throughput screening of factors necessary for structural plasticity. Here we introduce a MATLAB-based module built for Scanimage to automatically track, image, and stimulate multiple dendritic spines. We implemented an electrically tunable lens in combination with a drift correction algorithm to rapidly and continuously track targeted spines and correct sample movements. With a straightforward user interface to design custom multi-position experiments, we were able to adequately image and produce targeted plasticity in multiple dendritic spines using glutamate uncaging. Our methods are inexpensive, open source, and provides up to a five-fold increase in throughput for quantifying structural plasticity of dendritic spines."

The TGF-β/Smad pathway is initiated by ligand binding to TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII), in which the intracellular domain has constitutive serine/threonine kinase activity (7.Macias M.J. Martin-Malpartida P. Massagué J. Structural determinants of Smad function in TGF-β signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 296-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Subsequently, TβRII forms a heteromeric complex with TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI or activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)) and phosphorylates serine and threonine residues within the glycine-serine repeat (GS) domain and is present at the juxtamembrane region in ALK5 (8.Massagué J. TGF-β signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3985) Google Scholar). Then, the intracellular serine/threonine kinase activity in ALK5 becomes active. The active ALK5 kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the two extreme C-terminal serine residues of certain receptor-regulated (R-Smad) proteins, i.e. Smad2 and Smad3 (7.Macias M.J. Martin-Malpartida P. Massagué J. Structural determinants of Smad function in TGF-β signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 296-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated R-Smad form a binary or ternary complex with common-mediated Smad (Co-Smad, i.e. Smad4), which is followed by their translocation to the nucleus, where they transcriptionally regulate TGF-β target genes together with other transcriptional factors, coactivators, and corepressors (9.Derynck R.

Besides the canonical Smad pathway, the TGF-β receptor complex can also initiate intracellular non-Smad pathways. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) including Erk, JNK, p38, PI3K/Akt, RhoA/Rock1, mTORC, Par6, and Shc become activated by TGF-β contextually in certain cell types (12.Moustakas A. Heldin C.H.

TGF-β signaling is of key importance in embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis; hence, dysregulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway invokes congenital abnormalities as well as a number of diseases including cancer, fibrosis, and vascular defects (18.ten Dijke P.

Thus, TGF-β signaling needs to be intricately regulated. This intricate regulation occurs at all steps in the TGF-β signal transduction cascade, for example, in extracellular environments in which the bioavailability of the ligand is controlled by extracellular matrix ligand-binding proteins (23.Robertson I.B.

Frequently, these negative extracellular and intracellular regulators are induced by TGF-β, thereby exerting negative feedback functions. Consequently, cells are prohibited from being exposed by an excessive intensity and duration of TGF-β signaling (27.Itoh S. ten Dijke P.

Transmembrane p24-trafficking protein 10 (TMED10), alternatively termed p23, TMP21 (transmembrane protein with type I topology 21), Tmp-21-I, and p24δ, is a member of the EMP24 (endomembrane protein precursor of 24 kDa)/GP25L (glycoprotein 25L)/p24 family, which is involved in COP (coat protein) vesicle cargo receptors (29.Strating J.R. Martens G.J. The p24 family and selective transport processes at the ER-Golgi interface.Biol. Cell. 2009; 101: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TMED10, a type I transmembrane protein, is located to the plasma membrane, microsomal membranes, and zymogen granule membranes (30.Blum R. Feick P. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Klengel R.

Indeed, it has been reported that TMED10 contributes to the recruitment of the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) to the Golgi apparatus owing to actin assembly (31.Zhao L. Helms J.B.

TMED10 has roles that extend beyond trafficking; for example, TMED10 interacts with presenilin complexes to modulate the activity of γ-secretase without any effect of ϵ-secretase in decreasing the secretion of amyloid-β (34.Chen F. Hasegawa H. Schmitt-Ulms G. Kawarai T. Bohm C. Katayama T. Gu Y. Sanjo N. Glista M. Rogaeva E. Wakutani Y. Pardossi-Piquard R. Ruan X. Tandon A.

The role of TMP21 in trafficking and amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) processing in Alzheimer's disease.Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2012; 9: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, TMED10 can limit the activity of PKCδ via its association with PKCδ in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP to inhibit apoptosis (37.Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. p23/Tmp21 differentially targets the Rac-GAP β2-chimaerin and protein kinase C via their C1 domains.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Wang H. Xiao L. Kazanietz M.G. p23/Tmp21 associates with protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) and modulates its apoptotic function.J. Biol.

Gao H. Qin J. He L. Liu W. TMP21 modulates cell growth in papillary thyroid cancer cells by inducing autophagy through activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway.Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2015; 8: 10824-10831PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TMED10 preferentially binds to MHC I heavy chains that dissociate with β2-microglobulin (40.Jun Y. Ahn K. Tmp21, a novel MHC-I interacting protein, preferentially binds to β2-microglobulin-free MHC-I heavy chains.BMB Rep. 2011; 44: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, TMED10, dependent on the context, may act as a multipotent protein in cells. In this study, we found that TMED10 attenuates TGF-β signaling via dissociation of the TGF-β type I/type II heteromeric receptor complex. In particular, the extracellular domain of TMED10 is required for TMED10 to bind to both TβRII and ALK5. Interestingly, the short peptide derived from the extracellular domain of TMED10 can antagonize TGF-β signaling. Thus, a low molecular weight mimetic based on the structure of this peptide might be therapeutically suitable for patients with diseases with underlying excessive TGF-β receptor signaling. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that underlie TGF-β signaling via modulation of TGF-β receptor activity, we identified putative ALK5-interacting proteins by high throughput analysis of proteins coimmunoprecipitated with epitope-tagged human constitutively active ALK5 (ALK5ca) in HEK293 cells by use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) analysis. One of the proteins we identified was TMED10. It was selected from among 13 candidates because TMED10 was always isolated using the above method in four independent experiments. To validate this finding, we analyzed whether TMED10 interacts with human ALK5ca when coexpressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1A). We also tested whether the kinase activity of ALK5 influences its interaction with TMED10. We found that the interaction of TMED10 with ALK5ca was weaker than that with kinase-dead ALK5 (ALK5kd) (Fig. 1A). To investigate the specificity of the interaction of TMED10 with ALK5, we also investigated whether ALK6, a BMP type IB receptor, forms a complex with TMED10 upon their coexpression in COS7 cells. The interaction of TMED10 with either kinase-dead ALK6 (ALK6kd) or constitutively active (ALK6ca) was only marginally observed. In addition, TMED10 possessed the subtle ability to bind to TβRII and kinase-dead TβRII (TβRIIkd) (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that TMED10 has selectivity to interact with ALK5 when compared with other tested type I and type II receptors. Next, we performed affinity-labeling experiments using 125I-TGF-β in COS1 cells transfected with TMED10, ALK5 (or its kinase-inactive mutant), TβRII (or its kinase-inactive mutant), or combinations thereof. The kinase activity of ALK5 was not required for ALK5 to interact with TMED10, whereas the loss of TβRII kinase activity made the interaction between TβRII and TMED10 weaker. The reason that the intensity of the band corresponding to TβRII covalently bound to 125I-TGF-β becomes strong is that TβRII alone, but not ALK5 alone, can bind to TGF-β (Fig. 1C) (41.Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Identification of human activin and TGF β type I receptors that form heteromeric kinase complexes with type II receptors.Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 42.Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Cloning of a TGF β type I receptor that forms a heteromeric complex with the TGF β type II receptor.Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we could not detect any interaction between TMED10 and 125I-TGF-β when TMED10 alone was transfected in COS1 cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we tried to show endogenous interaction between TGF-β receptors and TMED10 using 125I-TGF-β in HaCaT cells. The immunoprecipitation of the receptor complex with a rabbit anti-TMED10 antibody could be detected, although rabbit anti-HA antibody as a control antibody could not isolate any receptor complex (Fig. 1E). Thus, TMED10 endogenously interacts with the TGF-β receptor complex on the cell membrane. The physiological interaction between TMED10 and ALK5 prompted us to examine their subcellular colocalization. When human embryonic retinoblast 911 cells were transfected with both TMED10 and ALK5, both of them could be seen mainly in the cytosol (Fig. 1F, upper panels), because both proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the cell membrane via the Golgi apparatus as transmembrane proteins. However, the vertical image shows that their colocalization can be observed along the cell membrane in part (Fig. 1F, insert in lower right panel). These data suggest that TMED10 associates with ALK5 at the cell membrane. ALK5 and TβRII are present as homodimers at the cell surface (43.Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzén P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes of type I and type II receptors for transforming growth factor-β.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether this is also the case for TMED10, we transfected two differentially epitope-tagged TMED10 (TMED10/FLAG and TMED10/V5) (Fig. 1H) in COS7 cells was followed by coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting analysis with an anti-V5 antibody. The result showed evidence for homo-oligomerization of TMED10. On the other hand, a mutant TMED10 containing an internal deletion of TMED10 between Ile32 and Ala80 (Fig. 1G, TMED10Δ(I32-A80)) was unable to interact with wild-type TMED10 (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal region of TMED10 plays a key role in the homo-oligomerization of TMED10. To investigate whether TMED10 affects TGF-β signaling, we tested the effect of TMED10 on the TGF-β-induced Smad-driven transcriptional (SBE)4-luc reporter (44.Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. Identification and functional characterization of a Smad binding element (SBE) in the JunB promoter that acts as a transforming growth factor-β, activin, and bone morphogenetic protein-inducible enhancer.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), we and observed dose-dependent inhibition of TMED10 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, TMED10Δ(I32-A80) could also inhibit TGF-β signaling like TMED10. Thus, the oligomerization of TMED10 is not required for the inhibition of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 2B). TMED10 also has the ability to interfere with BMP signaling, albeit with relatively weak inhibition (Fig. 2C). Thus, we focused on the inhibitory effect of TMED10 on TGF-β signaling in the subsequent experiments. To examine the possibility that the short C-terminal intracellular tail of TMED10 plays a role in the perturbation of TGF-β signaling, TMED10Δ(L208-E219) was constructed (Fig. 2D) and then transfected and subsequently stimulated with TGF-β in HepG2 cells. As seen in Fig. 2E, TMED10Δ(L208-E219) had an inhibitory action comparable to that of wild-type TMED10. We further examined whether TMED10 had an ability to hamper TGF-β-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of TMED10 in human keratinocyte HaCaT (Fig. 2F), 293T (data not shown), and mouse mammary gland epithelial NMuMG cells (data not shown) inhibited phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 upon TGF-β stimulation. It is well known that TGF-β potentiates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NMuMG cells (45.Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. TGF-β induced transdifferentiation of mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells: involvement of type I receptors.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). During this process, a switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression takes place (46.Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Transforming growth factor-β1 mediates epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation through a RhoA-dependent mechanism.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Adenoviral infection of TMED10 in NMuMG cells blocked TGF-β-mediated suppression of E-cadherin expression (Fig. 2, G and H) and TGF-β-mediated induction of N-cadherin expression (Fig. 2I). Negative regulators of TGF-β signaling such as Smad7, SnoN, TGIF, Smurf1, and TMEPAI are known to be direct target genes of TGF-β signaling (28.Itoh S. Itoh F. Inhibitory machinery for the TGF-β family signaling pathway.Growth Factors. 2011; 29: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β did not influence the expression of TMED10 mRNA, whereas it did influence the expression of TMEPAI mRNA (Fig. 2J). Because cell motility is potentiated in some epithelial cells by TGF-β, we tried to confirm that TMED10 inhibits cell migration upon TGF-β stimulation. In the Transwell assay, we observed a trend for the inhibition by TMED10 on TGF-β-induced cell migration when TMED10 was overexpressed by adenoviral gene transfer (Fig. 2, K and L). Because of the inhibitory effect of TMED10 on TGF-β signaling, we investigated whether loss-of-function of TMED10 enhances TGF-β signaling. When we reduced the expression of TMED10 in HaCaT cells by lentiviral transfer of TMED10-specific shRNA (Fig. 3A), an extension of TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation could be observed (Fig. 3B). Consistently, E-cadherin expression in HaCaT cells carrying shTMED10 decreased more quickly than in HaCaT cells carrying control shRNA when the cells were stimulated with TGF-β (Fig. 3C). We also confirmed the enhancement of stress fiber formation in HaCaT cells carrying TMED10 shRNA (Fig. 3D). Next we explored the effect of TMED10 depletion on cell motility. As seen in Fig. 3, E and F, not only the cell migration (using a Boyden chamber) but also the migration speed, measured by a wound healing assay, was raised, albeit weakly, in TMED10 knocked-down cells when cells received TGF-β signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that TMED10 interferes with TGF-β/Smad signaling. Having shown that TMED10 can interact not only with ALK5 but also with TβRII, we hypothesized that TMED10 could dissociate the complex between ALK5 and TβRII. Fig. 4A revealed that TMED10 disrupts the TGF-β receptor complex between ALK5 and TβRII when both receptors are overexpressed together with TMED10 in COS7 cells. After TGF-β binds to TβRII, TβRII recruits ALK5 to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in its GS domain close to the juxtamembrane region (47.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Mechanism of activation of the TGF-β receptor.Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). When ALK5/HA was transfected into 911 cells, we could observe the phosphorylation of serine residues in ALK5 1h after TGF-β stimulation. Co-transfection with TMED10 decreased the level of serine phosphorylation in ALK5 (Fig. 4B). We also checked whether TMED10 could disrupt ALK5 or TβRII homodimerization. Besides the assembly of heteromeric complexes between ALK5 and TβRII, both ALK5 and TβRII homodimer formations were attenuated upon introduction of TMED10 into cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, TMED10 inhibits not only ligand-independent homomeric but also TGF-β-induced heteromeric complex formation between ALK5 and TβRII. Because TMED10 blocks TGF-β receptor complex formation, there is a possibility that TMED10 also interferes with non-Smad pathways upon TGF-β receptor activation (12.Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Non-Smad TGF-β signals.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 13.Hoover L.L. Kubalak S.W. Holding their own: the noncanonical roles of Smad proteins.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe48Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14.Kang J.S. Liu C. Derynck R.

Non-Smad signaling pathways.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 347: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). As expected, the TGF-β-mediated JNK and p38 pathways could be inhibited by TMED10 (Fig. 4, E and F). To determine the binding region of TMED10 with the TGF-β receptor, we made several TMED10 mutants, as seen in Fig. 5A. Upon deletion of TMED10 from Gly81 to Val130 (TMED10Δ(G81-V130)), the interaction between ALK5ca and TMED10 was lost (Fig. 5B). Although TMED10Δ(V186-E219), which lacks a C-terminal region, became a secretory protein (Fig. 5C, bottom panel), ALK5ca could associate with TMED10Δ(V186-E219). Thus, the transmembrane and intracellular domains of TMED10 were not required for TMED10 to interact with ALK5 (Fig. 5C). Similarly, TβRII also required the same 50-amino acid-long region from Gly81 to Val130 in TMED10 to interact with TβRII (Fig. 5D). To further narrow the binding region of TMED10 with the TGF-β receptor, we performed a pulldown assay using three GST fusion proteins (Fig. 5E). As observed in Fig. 5F, the 30-amino acid-long peptide composed of the region between Gly81and Glu110 in TMED10 was sufficient for TMED10 to interact with ALK5. We next divided this region into two fragments, GST-TMED10(81–100) and GST-TMED10(91–110) (Fig. 5G). GST-TMED10(91–110), but not GST-TMED10(81–100) associated with ALK5 (Fig. 5H) as well as with TβRII (Fig. 5I). Because the 20-amino acid-long peptide derived from TMED10 is critical for TMED10 to interact with TGF-β receptors, it is possible that the peptides within these 20 amino acids disrupt TGF-β signaling. To test this possibility, three peptides were synthesized to investigate whether they could perturb TGF-β signaling (Fig. 6A). All three peptides inhibited TGF-β-mediated luciferase reporter activity to a certain extent. However, the addition of peptide in the media without Xfect protein transfection reagent did not significantly inhibit this response. Although we do not know the exact reasons, one possibility is that peptides incorporated into the Golgi apparatus and/or ER bind to immature biosynthetic intermediate TGF-β receptors (ALK5 and/or TβRII), thereby leading to decreased homodimer and/or heterodimer formations of TGF-β receptors at the cell surface. Among the three peptides, the peptide composed of 15 amino acids (Ala96–Glu110) was the most effective inhibitor (Fig. 6B). We do not know why Thr91–Glu110 has the weakest inhibitory activity among the three peptides. One possibility is that the active site (Ala96–Phe105) might be hidden because of the steric structure of Thr91–Glu110. Further experiments will be needed to confirm this possibility. When Ala96–Glu1"

As a rule though, children are not exposed piecemeal to individual or single risks but, rather, they are exposed to clusters of risk. Many of these clusters of risks are better thought of as comprising a developmental “circumstance” with a substantial duration, over which period, additional risk exposures also accumulate. In this paper we examined the distribution of 16 single risk exposures for low language ability using latent class analysis across a sample of approximately 4000 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. The best fitting model identified six distinct classes. 46% of children were in a Developmentally Enabled group, 20% were in a group typified as Working Poor families, 10% of children were in group typified as Overwhelmed group, 9% of children were in a group defined by Child Developmental Delay, 8% of children were in a group defined by Low Human Capital, and 7% of children were in a group defined by Resource Poor non-English Speaking background families. These groups had quantitatively and qualitatively distinct patterns of risk factors and showed different onward trajectories of receptive vocabulary. Our results demonstrate a range of multiple risk profiles in a population-representative sample of Australian children and highlight the mix of risk factors faced by children. Children with distinct patterns of risk factors have different onward trajectories of receptive vocabulary development."
https://openalex.org/W2582465198,"Neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the H2O2-dependent oxidation of chloride anion to generate hypochlorous acid, a potent antimicrobial agent. Besides its well defined role in innate immunity, aberrant degranulation of neutrophils in several inflammatory diseases leads to redistribution of MPO to the extracellular space, where it can mediate tissue damage by promoting the oxidation of several additional substrates. Here, we demonstrate that mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated cellular uptake and delivery of MPO to lysosomes of retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells acts to clear this harmful enzyme from the extracellular space, with lysosomal-delivered MPO exhibiting a half-life of 10 h. Lysosomal-targeted MPO exerts both cell-protective and cytotoxic functions. From a therapeutic standpoint, MPO catalyzes the in vitro degradation of N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine, a toxic form of retinal lipofuscin that accumulates in RPE lysosomes and drives the pathogenesis of Stargardt macular degeneration. Furthermore, chronic cellular uptake and accumulation of MPO in lysosomes coincides with N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine elimination in a cell-based model of macular degeneration. However, lysosomal-delivered MPO also disrupts lysosomal acidification in RPE cells, which coincides with nuclear translocation of the lysosomal stress-sensing transcription factor EB and, eventually, cell death. Based on these findings we predict that under periods of acute exposure, cellular uptake and lysosomal degradation of MPO mediates elimination of this harmful enzyme, whereas chronic exposure results in progressive accumulation of MPO in lysosomes. Lysosomal-accumulated MPO can be both cell-protective, by promoting the degradation of toxic retinal lipofuscin deposits, and cytotoxic, by triggering lysosomal stress and cell death.

Produced as a single chain precursor, MPO is post-translationally glycosylated in the Golgi, then cleaved into light and heavy chains in secretory azurophilic granules. The mature form of MPO is a dimer composed of two light chains and two heavy chains (1.McCormick S. Nelson A. Nauseef W.M.

In circulating neutrophils MPO catalyzes the H2O2-mediated oxidation of halide ions to predominantly form hypochlorous acid, a strong oxidant used to kill internalized bacteria and other pathogens. However, in some disease conditions degranulation of neutrophils leads to a redistribution of MPO to the extracellular space, where MPO can oxidize halide ions as well as other substrates to mediate tissue damage and pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including ocular inflammation, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (2.Soubhye J.

Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells play an essential phagocytic role in preserving the overall health of the retina by removing rod outer segments shed from the photoreceptor layer. Although the majority of rod outer segment material delivered to RPE lysosomes can be degraded and eliminated from RPE lysosomes by the natural cohort of lysosomal hydrolases, some material remains resistant to further lysosomal degradation and gradually accumulates inside lysosomes as lipofuscin. Later in life lysosomal accumulation of retinal lipofuscin can contribute to the dry form of age-related macular degeneration, which is a complex disease with many causes (5.Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Isolation and one-step prepapration of A2E and iso-A2E, fluorphores from human retinal pigment epithelum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In Stargardt disease (SD), the leading cause of macular degeneration and vision loss in children, the main component of lysosomal retinal lipofuscin is N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), a fluorescent derivative of vitamin A (6.Kennedy C.J. Rakoczy P.E. Constable I.J. Lipofuscin of the retinal pigment epithelium: a review.Eye. 1995; 9: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A2E normally arises at a very slow rate as a byproduct of the visual cycle from the reaction of two molecules of all-trans-retinal with phosphatidylethanolamine in rod outer segments to form N-retinylidene-N-retinyl phosphatidylethanolamine (A2-PE; Ref. 7.Sparrow J.R. Fishkin N. Zhou J. Cai B. Jang Y.P. Krane S. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. A2E, a byproduct of the visual cycle.Vis. Res. 2003; 43: 2983-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In healthy photoreceptors ABCA4 flippase activity present in the rod outer segment membrane transfers the majority of all-trans-retinal from rod outer segments to RPE cells for conversion back to 11-cis-retinal and further phototransduction. Consequently, all-trans-retinal levels are maintained at low levels in rod outer segments with normal ABCA4 transporter activity, resulting in only very small amounts of A2-PE formation over time. In contrast, a genetic deficiency of the ABCA4 transporter in SD patients accelerates the formation of A2-PE in rod outer segments. These A2-PE-filled rod outer segments are eventually delivered to RPE lysosomes by phagocytosis (8.Molday R.S. ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4: molecular properties and role in vision and macular degeneration.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In RPE lysosomes, a lysosomal-specific phosphatase converts newly delivered A2-PE to A2E (9.Sparrow J.R. Kim S.R. Cuervo A.M. Bandhyopadhyayand U.

A2E then remains resistant to further degradation in RPE lysosomes (9.Sparrow J.R. Kim S.R. Cuervo A.M. Bandhyopadhyayand U.

The accelerated lysosomal accumulation of A2E in SD promotes RPE cell death, inflammation, and the onset of retinal degeneration by several mechanisms; A2E is a major photo-sensitive chromophore for visible blue light, resulting in the generation of singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide, all of which may act as direct injury stimuli and the onset of chronic inflammation to the RPE (10.Radu R.A.

Oxidative damage and age-related macular degeneration.Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 32PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative damage arising from lysosomal A2E accumulation in RPE cells also compromises the phagocytic function of these cells (13.Vives-Bauza C. Anand M. Shiraz A.K. Shirazi A.K. Magrane J. Gao J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24770-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Accumulation of lysosomal lipofuscin also raises lysosomal pH and exerts a cationic detergent-like effect on cellular membranes (14.De S. Sakmar T.P. Interaction of A2E with model membranes: implications to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Currently, no effective treatment is available for SD. Ongoing clinical trials to prevent further accumulation of A2E include gene therapy (STARGEN), stem cell-based therapy (Ocata Therapeutics Inc.), and oral inhibitors of A2E formation (Alkeus Pharmaceuticals Inc.). However, none of these approaches will help to eliminate existing A2E that would have accumulated before diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. The peroxidase activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was previously shown to catalyze the H2O2-mediated oxidation, destabilization, and subsequent degradation of A2E in a cell-free system and in cells loaded with A2E (15.Wu Y. Zhou J. Fishkin N. Rittmann B.E. Sparrow J.R. Enzymatic degradation of A2E, a retinal pigment epithelial lipofuscin bisretinoid.J. Am. Chem.

Oxidative damage and age-related macular degeneration.Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 32PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that lysosomes filled with A2E in SD RPE cells may liberate sufficient H2O2 to permit the H2O2-dependent oxidation and degradation of this storage material by a lysosomal-targeted mammalian peroxidase therapeutic. Of the five known mammalian peroxidases, only neutrophil MPO is reported to be synthesized as a precursor molecule with phosphorylated glycans, a property that permits binding with the cell surface mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor, internalization into clathrin-coated vesicles, and delivery to lysosomes (16.Hasilik A. Pohlmann R. Olsen R.L. von Figura K. Myeloperoxidase is synthesized as larger phosphorylated precursor.EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2671-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17.Cieutat A.M. Lobel P.

Azurophilic granules of human neutrophilic leukocytes are deficient in lysosome-associated membrane proteins but retain the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker.Blood. 1998; 91: 1044-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we confirm by capillary zone electrophoresis that MPO contains low but sufficient amounts of phosphorylated oligomannose to permit its clearance from the extracellular space and delivery to lysosomes of RPE cells in a M6P receptor-dependent manner. We also identify A2E as a substrate for MPO, showing that MPO, like HRP, can degrade A2E both in vitro and after cellular uptake and delivery to RPE lysosomes preloaded with A2E. However, our results also reveal insight into how exogenous MPO can mediate cellular damage in inflammatory diseases; chronic cellular uptake and delivery of MPO to lysosomes disrupts lysosomal acidification and triggers the translocation of the lysosomal stress-sensing transcription factor EB (TFEB) from the cytosol to the nucleus, an indicator of lysosomal stress, which coincides with RPE cell death. Given that HRP has been reported to degrade A2E in vitro (15.Wu Y. Zhou J. Fishkin N. Rittmann B.E. Sparrow J.R. Enzymatic degradation of A2E, a retinal pigment epithelial lipofuscin bisretinoid.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we set out to determine if a mammalian peroxidase could be used as a targeted enzyme therapeutic to promote the degradation of retinal lipofuscin in SD. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis showed that commercially available MPO purified from human neutrophils was predominantly composed of the fully mature heavy and light chains under reducing conditions and as a >100-kDa dimer under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1, A–C). The peroxidase-specific activity of MPO was confirmed using ABTS substrate and shown to be comparable with that of HRP (MPO, 181 ± 2.4 units/mg; HRP, 196 ± 1.4 units/mg). A phosphorylated MPO precursor has previously been detected in 32P-labeled HL60 myeloid cells (16.Hasilik A. Pohlmann R. Olsen R.L. von Figura K. Myeloperoxidase is synthesized as larger phosphorylated precursor.EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2671-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), prompting us to directly analyze the glycan composition of this enzyme and its lysosomal targeting in RPE cells. Five consensus N-linked glycosylation sites on MPO have been reported, all of which are located on the heavy subunit of MPO (18.Van Antwerpen P. Slomianny M.C. Boudjeltia K.Z. Delporte C. Faid V. Calay D. Rousseau A. Moguilevsky N. Raes M. Vanhamme L. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Vanhaeverbeek M. Nève J. Michalski J.C. Glycosylation pattern of mature dimeric leukocyte and recombinant monomeric myeloperoxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16351-16359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). N-Linked oligosaccharide profiling of peptide N-glycosidase F-digested glycans by capillary zone electrophoresis demonstrated that MPO contains multiple glycan moieties (Fig. 1D). Some of the glycans present on MPO were digested to non-phosphorylated glycans after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1D). Compared with a reference lysosomal enzyme known to contain glycans with phosphorylated oligomannose, MPO contained a small amount of bis-phosphorylated oligomannose (BPM7) and mono-phosphorylated oligomannose (MPM5 and MPM6; Fig. 1D). However, the overall amount of phosphorylated oligomannose present on MPO corresponded to only 6.2% of the total oligosaccharide content. As a comparison, a well characterized reference lysosomal enzyme control included in the analysis contained 35–40% of its total glycan content as phosphorylated oligomannose using the same oligosaccharide profiling method (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that MPO contains a relatively low amount of phosphorylated oligomannose, the preferred glycan moiety for M6P receptor-dependent cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting. Despite the presence of only low amounts of phosphorylated oligomannose, MPO exhibited M6P receptor-dependent uptake in immortalized human RPE-derived ARPE-19 cells; MPO was not detected by activity (Fig. 2A) or by Western blotting (Fig. 2B) in untreated control ARPE-19 cells. Incubation of ARPE-19 cells with MPO resulted in a dose-dependent increase in MPO activity detected in cell lysates (Fig. 2A). MPO uptake was found to approximate Michaelis-Menten kinetics in ARPE-19 cells, with an average Kuptake of 33 nm ± 4.4 nm (n = 3) after 24 h of uptake (Fig. 2A). Uptake of MPO was also monitored by Western blotting, with the mature heavy (HC) and light (LC) chains of MPO readily detected in cell lysates after 24 h of exposure to 25 nm neutrophil-derived MPO (Fig. 2B). Importantly, uptake of MPO heavy- and light-chain isoforms into ARPE-19 cells was completely inhibited when ARPE-19 cells were treated with 5 mm M6P to block M6P receptor-mediated cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting (Fig. 2B). The internalized enzyme exhibited a short half-life of 10 h, as measured by activity (Fig. 2C) and coincided with reduced amounts of MPO protein detected in cell lysates by Western blotting over the post-uptake (chase) time (Fig. 2D). After 24 h of uptake into ARPE-19 cells MPO conjugated to AF488 partially co-localized with LysoTracker Red+-acidified organelles, which is suggestive of successful delivery of MPO to lysosomes (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results confirm that MPO purified from neutrophils contains low but sufficient amounts of phosphorylated oligomannose to permit M6P receptor-dependent cellular uptake and delivery to RPE lysosomes, the site of A2E accumulation in SD. To determine if MPO can degrade A2E in vitro, in a similar manner as reported for HRP (15.Wu Y. Zhou J. Fishkin N. Rittmann B.E. Sparrow J.R. Enzymatic degradation of A2E, a retinal pigment epithelial lipofuscin bisretinoid.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), chemically synthesized A2E was incubated for 4 h with HRP or MPO in the presence of H2O2. A2E was also incubated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the presence of H2O2 as a control protein that lacked peroxidase activity. By UPLC, chemically synthesized A2E incubated with BSA was predominantly composed of the intact parent molecule after 4 h (Fig. 3, A and quantified in Fig. 3D). As previously reported by Wu et al. (15.Wu Y. Zhou J. Fishkin N. Rittmann B.E. Sparrow J.R. Enzymatic degradation of A2E, a retinal pigment epithelial lipofuscin bisretinoid.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), incubation of A2E with HRP for 4 h resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of A2E parent molecule detected by UPLC and the appearance of several smaller degradation products to the left of the peak corresponding to the A2E parent molecule (Fig. 3, B and D). Wu et al. (15.Wu Y. Zhou J. Fishkin N. Rittmann B.E. Sparrow J.R. Enzymatic degradation of A2E, a retinal pigment epithelial lipofuscin bisretinoid.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) performed a detailed characterization to show that these smaller products corresponded to oxidized forms of the long and short arms of A2E, suggesting that HRP-mediated oxidation of A2E promotes its fragmentation and instability (15.Wu Y. Zhou J. Fishkin N. Rittmann B.E. Sparrow J.R. Enzymatic degradation of A2E, a retinal pigment epithelial lipofuscin bisretinoid.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to HRP, incubation of A2E with MPO also resulted in reduced amounts of the A2E parent molecule (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that like HRP, the peroxidase activity of mammalian MPO can catalyze the in vitro degradation of A2E, a toxic bis-retinoid that accumulates in RPE lysosomes and drives the pathogenesis of SD. We next examined the potential of exploiting MPO as a targeted enzyme therapy to degrade A2E in SD macular degeneration. To model macular degeneration in cultured cells, post-confluent ARPE-19 cells were loaded with chemically synthesized A2E using a previously published method, where the inherent autofluorescence of A2E is utilized to monitor its uptake and lysosomal delivery by phagocytosis (19.Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. A2E, a lipofuscin fluorophore, in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells in culture.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar). A2E uptake was monitored by A2E autofluorescence at an emission wavelength of 488 nm, a property also exploited to monitor disease progression in SD patients (19.Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M.

Ophthalmol. 2012; 130: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After 6 h of uptake followed by an overnight chase in growth medium, A2E autofluorescence was found to dose-dependently accumulate inside ARPE-19 cells by high content imaging, with the maximal A2E granular autofluorescence at 488 nm observed at 7.5 μm A2E in the absence of cytotoxicity (Fig. 4, A and C), as previously observed by Sparrow et al. (19.Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. A2E, a lipofuscin fluorophore, in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells in culture.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of A2E parent molecule was also dose-dependently detected in cell lysates prepared from A2E-loaded ARPE-19 cells by UPLC (Fig. 4B), further supporting the high content imaging results (Fig. 4, A–C). Incubation of ARPE-19 cells with A2E at higher concentrations (≥20 μm) did not further increase granularity but did promote a reduction in nuclei number by high content imaging in some experiments (results not shown), suggestive of cytotoxicity. Various forms of lysosomal stress, including lysosomal accumulation of storage material in multiple lysosomal storage diseases, have previously been shown to trigger a lysosomal stress response pathway, which involves the translocation of TFEB from the cytosol to the nucleus (21.Sardiello M.

To test this, we first set out to determine if ARPE-19 cells are responsive to lysosomal stress-induced TFEB translocation by inhibiting mTOR, a regulator of nutrient sensing at lysosomes (22.Roczniak-Ferguson A.

Under control conditions, the majority of TFEB in control-treated ARPE-19 cells was present in the cytosol-enriched fraction of ARPE-19 cells by Western blotting (Fig. 4D). Torin-1, an mTOR inhibitor and known inducer of TFEB dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation (22.Roczniak-Ferguson A. Petit C.S. Froehlich F. Qian S. Ky J. Angarola B. Walther T.C. Ferguson S.M. The transcription factor TFEB links mTORC1 signaling to transcriptional control of lysosome homeostasis.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra42Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), promoted a robust translocation of TFEB from the cytosol-enriched fraction to the nuclear-enriched fraction, suggesting that ARPE-19 cells are responsive to Torin-1-induced lysosomal stress and TFEB nuclear translocation (Fig. 4D). Like Torin-1, incubation of ARPE-19 cells with A2E for 6 h also promoted a dose-dependent translocation of TFEB from the cytosol to the nucleus in ARPE-19 cells, indicative of A2E-induced lysosomal stress (Fig. 4D). These results are in agreement with previous studies, demonstrating that A2E accumulation in RPE lysosomes compromises the function of these organelles and promotes cytotoxicity (10.Radu R.A. Hu J.

We used this cell-based model of macular degeneration to determine if cellular uptake and delivery of MPO to lysosomes could promote A2E clearance. ARPE-19 lysosomes were preloaded with 2.5, 5, or 7.5 μm A2E for 6 h, concentrations that promoted some translocation of TFEB to the nucleus (Fig. 4D) in the absence of cytotoxicity (Fig. 4C). Incubation of A2E-loaded cells with 25 nm MPO for 48 h promoted a significant reduction in A2E granularity when compared with control A2E-loaded cells in the absence of cytotoxicity (Fig. 4C). To further evaluate the kinetics of MPO-mediated A2E clearance, we loaded ARPE-19 cells with a constant dose of 5 μm A2E and then incubated cells for up to 21 days in the presence of MPO. Cells were replenished with MPO every 2 days. Incubation of A2E-loaded ARPE-19 cells with MPO for 21 days promoted a dose-dependent (Fig. 4E) and time-dependent (Fig. 4F) reduction in A2E+ granules, as measured by high content imaging. Furthermore, repeated low dose administration of M"

To increase the knowledge required for establishing efficient bioprocesses, dynamics of batch fermentation by the cellulolytic bacterium Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum were compared using three cellulosic materials, paper handkerchief, cotton discs and Whatman filter paper. Fermentation of paper handkerchief occurred the fastest and resulted in a specific metabolic profile: it resulted in the lowest acetate-to-lactate and acetate-to-ethanol ratios. By shotgun proteomic analyses of paper handkerchief and Whatman paper incubations, 151 proteins with significantly different levels were detected, including 20 of the 65 cellulosomal components, 8 non-cellulosomal CAZymes and 44 distinct extracytoplasmic proteins. Consistent with the specific metabolic profile observed, many enzymes from the central carbon catabolic pathways had higher levels in paper handkerchief incubations. Among the quantified CAZymes and cellulosomal components, 10 endoglucanases mainly from the GH9 families and 7 other cellulosomal subunits had lower levels in paper handkerchief incubations. An in-depth characterization of the materials used showed that the lower levels of endoglucanases in paper handkerchief incubations could hypothetically result from its lower crystallinity index (50%) and degree of polymerization (970). By contrast, the higher hemicellulose rate in paper handkerchief (13.87%) did not result in the enhanced expression of enzyme with xylanase as primary activity, including enzymes from the “xyl-doc” cluster. It suggests the absence, in this material, of molecular structures that specifically lead to xylanase induction. The integrated approach developed in this work shows that subtle differences among cellulosic materials regarding chemical and structural characteristics have significant effects on expressed bacterial functions, in particular the cellulolysis machinery, resulting in different metabolic patterns and degradation dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2579937840,"Objective Given the high prevalence and comorbidity of combat-related PTSD and TBI in Veterans, it is often difficult to disentangle the contributions of each disorder. Examining these pathologies separately may help to understand the neurobiological basis of memory impairment in PTSD and TBI independently of each other. Thus, we investigated whether a) PTSD and TBI are characterized by subcortical structural abnormalities by examining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics and volume and b) if these abnormalities were specific to PTSD versus TBI. Method We investigated whether individuals with PTSD or TBI display subcortical structural abnormalities in memory regions by examining DTI metrics and volume of the hippocampus and caudate in three groups of Veterans: Veterans with PTSD, Veterans with TBI, and Veterans with neither PTSD nor TBI (Veteran controls). Results While our results demonstrated no macrostructural differences among the groups in these regions, there were significant alterations in microstructural DTI indices in the caudate for the PTSD group but not the TBI group compared to Veteran controls. Conclusions The result of increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivity, and decreased fractional anisotropy in the caudate in absence of significant volume atrophy in the PTSD group suggests the presence of subtle abnormalities evident only at a microstructural level. The caudate is thought to play a role in the physiopathology of PTSD, and the habit-like behavioral features of the disorder could be due to striatal-dependent habit learning mechanisms. Thus, DTI appears to be a vital tool to investigate subcortical pathology, greatly enhancing the ability to detect subtle brain changes in complex disorders."

Genetic factors that link obesity to NAFLD remain obscure. Apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) is a lipid-binding protein with a pivotal role in triglyceride metabolism. Humans with APOC3 gain-of-function mutations and mice with APOC3 overproduction are associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Nonetheless, it remains controversial whether APOC3 is culpable for diet-induced NAFLD. To address this fundamental issue, we fed APOC3-transgenic and wild-type littermates a high fructose diet or high fat diet, followed by determination of the effect of APOC3 on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation and the progression of NAFLD. To gain mechanistic insight into NAFLD, we determined the impact of APOC3 on hepatic triglyceride synthesis and secretion versus fatty acid oxidation. APOC3-transgenic mice were hypertriglyceridemic, culminating in marked elevation of triglycerides, cholesterols, and non-esterified fatty acids in plasma. Despite the prevailing hypertriglyceridemia, APOC3-transgenic mice, relative to wild-type littermates, had similar weight gain and hepatic lipid content without alterations in hepatic expression of key genes involved in triglyceride synthesis and secretion and fatty acid oxidation. APOC3-transgenic and wild-type mice had similar Kupffer cell content without alterations in hepatic expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. APOC3 neither exacerbated diet-induced adiposity nor aggravated the degree of steatosis in high fructose or high fat-fed APOC3-transgenic mice. These effects ensued independently of weight gain even after 10-month high fat feeding. We concluded that APOC3, whose dysregulation is liable for hypertriglyceridemia, is not a predisposing factor for linking overnutrition to NAFLD in obesity.

https://openalex.org/W2582864038,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) regulate neuronal excitability by governing action potential (AP) generation and propagation. Recent studies have revealed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators decrease sensory neuron excitability, potentially by preventing sodium (Na+) channel phosphorylation by kinases such as ERK or via modulation of translation regulation pathways. The direct positive allosteric modulator A769662 displays substantially greater efficacy than other AMPK activators in decreasing sensory neuron excitability suggesting additional mechanisms of action. Here, we show that A769662 acutely inhibits AP firing stimulated by ramp current injection in rat trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. PT1, a structurally dissimilar AMPK activator that reduces nerve growth factor (NGF) -induced hyperexcitability, has no influence on AP firing in TG neurons upon acute application. In voltage-clamp recordings, application of A769662 reduces VGSC current amplitudes. These findings, based on acute A769662 application, suggest a direct channel blocking effect. Indeed, A769662 dose-dependently blocks VGSC in rat TG neurons and in Nav1.7-transfected cells with an IC50 of ~ 10 μM. A769662 neither displayed use-dependent inhibition nor interacted with the local anesthetic (LA) binding site. Popliteal fossa administration of A769662 decreased noxious thermal responses with a peak effect at 5 mins demonstrating an analgesic effect. These data indicate that in addition to AMPK activation, A769662 acts as a direct blocker/modulator of VGSCs, a potential mechanism enhancing the analgesic property of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W2582961509,"Most components of the cholinergic system are detected in skeletogenic cell types in vitro, yet the function of this system in skeletogenesis remains unclear. Here, we analyzed endochondral ossification in mutant murine fetuses, in which genes of the rate-limiting cholinergic enzymes acetyl- (AChE), or butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), or both were deleted (called here A-B+, A+B-, A-B-, respectively). In all mutant embryos bone growth and cartilage remodeling into mineralizing bone were accelerated, as revealed by Alcian blue (A-blu) and Alizarin red (A-red) staining. In A+B- and A-B- onset of mineralization was observed before E13.5, about 2 days earlier than in wild type and A-B+ mice. In all mutants between E18.5 to birth A-blu staining disappeared from epiphyses prematurely. Instead, A-blu+ cells were dislocated into diaphyses, most pronounced so in A-B- mutants, indicating additive effects of both missing ChEs in A-B- mutant mice. The remodeling effects were supported by in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments performed on cryosections from A-B- mice, in which Ihh, Runx2, MMP-13, ALP, Col-II and Col-X were considerably decreased, or had disappeared between E18.5 and P0. With a second approach, we applied an improved in vitro micromass model from chicken limb buds that allowed histological distinction between areas of cartilage, apoptosis and mineralization. When treated with the AChE inhibitor BW284c51, or with nicotine, there was decrease in cartilage and accelerated mineralization, suggesting that these effects were mediated through nicotinic receptors (α7-nAChR). We conclude that due to absence of either one or both cholinesterases in KO mice, or inhibition of AChE in chicken micromass cultures, there is increase in cholinergic signalling, which leads to increased chondroblast production and premature mineralization, at the expense of incomplete chondrogenic differentiation. This emphasizes the importance of cholinergic signalling in cartilage and bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2583076941,"A paradox in monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy is that despite the well-documented tolerogenic properties of deaggregated IgG, most therapeutic IgG mAb induce anti-mAb responses. To analyze CD4 T cell reactions against IgG in various physical states, we developed an adoptive transfer model using CD4+ T cells specific for a Vκ region-derived peptide in the hapten-specific IgG mAb 36–71. We found that heat-aggregated or immune complexes (IC) of mAb 36–71 elicited anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, while the deaggregated form was tolerogenic. All 3 forms of mAb 36–71 induced proliferation of cognate CD4+ T cells, but the aggregated and immune complex forms drove more division cycles and induced T follicular helper cells (TFH) development more effectively than did the deaggregated form. These responses occurred despite no adjuvant and no or only trace levels of endotoxin in the preparations. Physical analyses revealed large differences in micron- and nanometer-sized particles between the aggregated and IC forms. These differences may be functionally relevant, as CD4+ T cell proliferation to aggregated, but not IC mAb 36–71, was nearly ablated upon peritoneal injection of B cell-depleting antibody. Our results imply that, in addition to denatured aggregates, immune complexes formed in vivo between therapeutic mAb and their intended targets can be immunogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2580517595,"Species of Balaenophilus are the only harpacticoid copepods that exhibit a widespread, obligate association with vertebrates, i.e., B. unisetus with whales and B. manatorum with marine turtles and manatees. In the western Mediterranean, juveniles of the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta are the only available hosts for B. manatorum, which has been found occurring at high prevalence (>80%) on them. A key question is how these epibionts are transmitted from host to host. We investigated this issue based on experiments with live specimens of B. manatorum that were cultured with turtle skin. Specimens were obtained from head-started hatchlings of C. caretta from the western Mediterranean. Hatched nauplii crawled only on rough substrates and lacked the ability to swim. Only copepodites IV and V, and adults, were able to perform directional swimming. Legs 2, 3 and 4 played a major role in swimming and were only well-developed in these stages. Nauplii reared in wells with turtle skin readily fed on this item. Late copepodites and adults also fed on turtle skin but did not consume other potential food items such as fish skin, baleen plates or planktonic algae. Evidences suggest that the transmission of B. manatorum should rely on hosts’ bodily contacts and/or swimming of late developmental stages between spatially close hosts. The possibility of long-ranged dispersal is unlikely for two reasons. First, all developmental stages seem to depend on turtle skin as a food resource. Second, the average clutch size of ovigerous females was small (< 70 eggs) for free-living phases to successfully contact turtles that occur at very low densities (< 0.6 turtles·km−2) in the western Mediterranean. The high prevalence of B. manatorum in loggerhead turtles in this area raises the question whether these turtles have contacts, or tend to closely aggregate, more than is currently believed."

In this study, we investigated its usefulness as an immunotherapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods The expression of SART3 in hepatoma cell lines and HCC tissues was investigated by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses. Two peptides derived from SART3 (SART3109 and SART3315) were used for immunological analysis. T-cell responses were investigated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 47 patients, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 8 of 47 patients with HCC. The safety of immunotherapy using a SART3-derived peptide was investigated by vaccinations of SART3109 in 12 patients with HCC (trial registration: UMIN000005677). Results The immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses showed that SART3 was expressed in six HCC cell lines, and in HCC tissues including of alpha-fetoprotein-negative individuals. SART3-specific CTLs were generated by stimulating PBMCs with the peptides, and they showed cytotoxicity against HCC cells expressing the protein. Of the 47 HCC patients, 25.5% and 10.6% showed significant responses to SART3109 and SART3315, respectively. The infiltration of SART3109-specific IFN-γ-producing CTLs into the tumor site was confirmed. In the vaccination study, no severe adverse events were observed, and the peptide-specific CTLs were newly induced in four of five patients tested. Conclusions SART3 is an immunotherapeutic candidate, and peptides from this antigen may be applied in HCC immunotherapy. Trial Registration UMIN000005677"
https://openalex.org/W2582655381,"Vibroacoustic stimulation by a Body Monochord can induce relaxation states of various emotional valence. The skin conductance level (SCL) of the tonic electrodermal activity is an indicator of sympathetic arousal of the autonomic nervous system and thus an indicator of the relaxation response. Salivary cortisol is considered to be a stress indicator of the HPA-axis. The effects of the treatment with a Body Monochord and listening to relaxation music (randomized chronological presentation) on SCL and salivary cortisol in relation to the emotional valence of the experience were examined in patients with psychosomatic disorders (N = 42). Salivary cortisol samples were collected immediately before and after the expositions. Subjective experience was measured via self-rating scales. Overall, both the exposure to the Body Monochord as well as the exposure to the relaxation music induced an improvement of patients' mood and caused a highly significant reduction of SCL. A more emotionally positive experience of relaxation correlated with a slightly stronger reduction of the SCL. Both treatment conditions caused a slight increase in salivary cortisol, which was significant after exposure to the first treatment. The increase of salivary cortisol during a relaxation state is contrary to previous findings. It is possible that the relaxation state was experienced as an emotional challenge, due to inner images and uncommon sensations that might have occurred."

The distribution and angiographic circulation time of PRPD were assessed by UWFA. The frequencies of systemic and ophthalmologic comorbidities were compared between groups. Univariate and multivariate generalized estimation equation methods were used to determine the risk factors for PRPD.The patients with PRPD had a mean age of 75.7 ± 8.5 years (range, 59-93 years), whereas the patients without PRPD had a mean age of 60.1 ± 14.9 years (range, 9-92 years). All eyes with PRPD manifested the lesion in the superior nasal periphery with or without circumferential extension. Among those, only 16 eyes (45.7%) in the PRPD group showed distinctive features in the same location on fundus photographs. There was significant choroidal filling delay in the PRPD group when compared with the control group (1.42±1.22 vs. -0.02±1.05 seconds, P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that older age (P < 0.001), stroke (P = 0.018), ischemic optic neuropathy (P < 0.001), and age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with PRPD.UWFA may enhance the diagnostic sensitivity of PRPD. Choroidal vascular insufficiency with compromised systemic circulation in the elderly was related to the manifestation of PRPD. These results help to better understand the pathophysiology of PRPD. Co-existence of systemic and ophthalmic circulatory disorders should be considered in patients with PRPD."

In addition, the variations of the bacterial community in the biofilm on the longitudinal distribution of the biofilters were analysed by using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that NB waste gas was successfully degraded in the biofilter. High-throughput sequencing data suggested that the phylum Actinobacteria and genus Rhodococcus played important roles in the degradation of NB. The variations of the microbial community were attributed to the different intermediate degradation products of NB in each layer. The strains identified in this study were potential candidates for purifying waste gas effluents containing NB."
https://openalex.org/W2582478652,"A particular challenge to water safety in populous intertropical regions is the lack of reliable faecal indicators to detect microbiological contamination of water, while the numerical relationships of specific viral indicators remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the numerical relationships of FRNA-bacteriophage genotypes, adenovirus 41, and human adenoviruses (HADV) in Mexican surface water systems to assess sewage contamination. We studied the presence of HADV, HADV41 and FRNA bacteriophage genotypes in water samples and quantified by qPCR and RT-qPCR. Virus and water quality indicator variances, as analyzed by principal component analysis and partial least squared regression, followed along the major percentiles of water faecal enterococci. FRNA bacteriophages adequately deciphered viral and point source water contamination. The strongest correlation for HADV was with FRNA bacteriophage type II, in water samples higher than the 50th percentiles of faecal enterococci, thus indicating urban pollution. FRNA bacteriophage genotypes I and III virus indicator performances were assisted by their associations with electrical conductivity and faecal enterococci. In combination, our methods are useful for inferring water quality degradation caused by sewage contamination. The methods used have potential for determining source contamination in water and, specifically, the presence of enteric viruses where clean and contaminated water have mixed."
https://openalex.org/W2580791446,"Background S. pneumoniae is a leading cause of meningitis morbidity and mortality in the African meningitis belt, but little is known of its contribution to the burden of pneumonia in the region. We aimed to estimate the incidence of pneumococcal disease in children and adults in northern Togo, before the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Methods and findings From May 1st 2010 to April 30th 2013, we systematically enrolled all hospitalized patients meeting a case definition of suspected meningitis or clinical pneumonia, residing in Tone or Cinkasse districts, northern Togo and providing informed consent. We collected clinical data and tested biological specimens according to standardized procedures, including bacteriology and PCR testing of cerebro-spinal fluid for meningitis patients and blood cultures and whole blood lytA PCR for pneumonia patients. Chest X-rays (CXR) were interpreted using the WHO methodology. We included 404 patients with meningitis (104 <5 years of age) and 1550 with pneumonia (251 <5 years) over the study period. Of these, 78 (19%) had pneumococcal meningitis (13 <5 years), 574 (37%) had radiologically-confirmed pneumonia (83 <5 years) and 73 (5%) had culture-confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (2 <5 years). PCV13 serotypes caused 79% (54/68) of laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis and 83% (29/35) of culture-confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia. Serotype 1 predominated in meningitis (n = 33) but not in pneumonia patients (n = 1). The incidence of pneumococcal disease was 7.5 per 100,000 among children <5 years of age and 14.8 in persons 5 years of age and above in the study area. When considering CXR-confirmed and blood PCR-positive pneumonia cases as likely pneumococcal, incidence estimates increased to 43.7 and 66.0 per 100,000 in each of these age groups, respectively. Incidence was at least 3-fold higher when we restricted the analysis to the urban area immediately around the study hospitals. Conclusions Our findings highlight the important role of S. pneumoniae as a meningitis and pneumonia-causing pathogen in the African meningitis belt. Pneumococcal disease incidence in our population was substantially lower than expected from global models; we hypothesize that poor access to hospital care led us to substantially underestimate the burden of disease. Surveillance is ongoing and will enable an evaluation of PCV impact, providing novel, high quality data from the region."

Methods A total of 209 CHB patients with a prescription for TDF at the Seoul and Daejeon St. Mary’s hospitals were enrolled from December 2012 to October 2014. We compared the virological responses and evaluated the renal safety of treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Results An overall complete virological response (CVR) was achieved in 80.4% and 84.6% of patients at weeks 48 and 96, respectively. In a subgroup analysis, CVR at week 96 was present in 88.4%, 75.0%, 75.5%, and 83.3% of participants in the lamivudine-resistant (LAM-R) group, adefovir-resistant (ADV-R) group, multidrug-resistant (MDR) group, and suboptimal response group, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, ADV-R, MDR, hepatitis B virus DNA, and hepatitis B e antigen were independent predictors for CVR. With regard to renal safety, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and an initial low estimated glomerular filtration rate were independent factors affecting creatinine elevation (≥0.5 mg/dL). Moreover, two patients with DM and cirrhosis experienced TDF-related Fanconi syndrome. Conclusions TDF-based therapy demonstrated sustained viral suppression and favorable safety during a 2-year treatment period. The LAM-R and suboptimal response groups showed comparable efficacy to the naïve group, while the ADV-R and MDR groups were significantly associated with a low CVR. Close monitoring of renal safety should be mandatory when treating CHB patients receiving TDF, particularly those with DM and cirrhosis."

The results indicate that the above characters of Chinese endemic plants take on relative rule at the different geographical scales. Among the three big natural areas, Eastern Monsoon area has the highest endemic plants richness, whereas Northwest Dryness area is the lowest. For life forms, herbs dominate. In contrast, the proportion of herbs of Eastern Monsoon area is remarkable under other two areas. Correspondingly the proportions of trees and shrubs are substantially higher than other two. For angiosperm original families, the number is the highest in Eastern Monsoon area, and lowest in Northwest Dryness area. On the other hand, among the seven natural regions, the humid and subtropical zone in Central and Southern China has the highest endemic plants richness, whereas the humid, hemi-humid region and temperate zone in Northeast China has the lowest. For life forms, the proportion of herbs tends to decrease from humid, hemi-humid region and temperate zone in Northeast China to humid and tropical zone in Southern China. Comparably, trees, shrubs and vines or lianas increase with the same directions. This fully represents these characters of Chinese endemic plants vary with latitudinal gradients. Furthermore, as to the number of endemic plants belonging to angiosperm original families, the number is the most in humid and subtropical zone in Center and Southern China, and tropical zone in Southern China in the next place. In contrast, the endemic plant of these two regions relatively is richer than that of The Qinghai-Tibet alpine and cold region. All above results sufficiently reflect that the Chinese endemic plants mainly distribute in Eastern Monsoon area, especially humid and subtropical zone in Center and Southern China and tropical zone in Southern China. Furthermore, the flora of Eastern Monsoon area, in particular humid and subtropical zone in Center and Southern China and tropical zone in Southern China, is more ancient and original than that of Northwest Dryness area and Qinghai-Tibet alpine and cold area."
https://openalex.org/W2580563172,"Rectal enemas that contain prophylactic levels of anti-HIV microbicides such as tenofovir have emerged as a promising dosage form to prevent sexually transmitted HIV infections. The enema vehicle is promising due to its likely ability to deliver a large amount of drug along the length of the rectal canal. Computational models of microbicide drug delivery by enemas can help their design process by determining key factors governing drug transport and, more specifically, the time history and degree of protection. They can also inform interpretations of experimental pharmacokinetic measures such as drug concentrations in biopsies. The present work begins rectal microbicide PK modeling, for enema vehicles. Results here show that a paramount factor in drug transport is the time of enema retention; direct connectivity between enema fluid and the fluid within rectal crypts is also important. Computations of the percentage of stromal volume protected by a single enema dose indicate that even with only a minute of enema retention, protection of 100% can be achieved after around 14 minutes post dose. Concentrations in biopsies are dependent on biopsy thickness; and control and/or knowledge of thickness could improve accuracy and decrease variability in biopsy measurements. Results here provide evidence that enemas are a promising dosage form for rectal microbicide delivery, and offer insights into their rational design."

Compared with the S-haplotype, subjects with the P-haplotype produce higher levels of the IL-4 protein after non-surgical periodontal therapy. The present in vitro study aimed to investigate the functionality of IL-4 haplotypes in immune cells to obtain insight into the influence of these genetic variations in regulating immune responses to CP-associated bacteria. Peripheral blood was collected from 6 subjects carrying each haplotype, and their immune cells were challenged with periodontopathogens to compare responses of the different haplotypes with regard to gene expression, protein secretion and the immunophenotype of T helper responses. We found higher IL-4 mRNA and protein levels in the P-haplotype, which also presented higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, cells from S-haplotype subjects responded with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. S-haplotype individuals exhibited significantly greater polarization toward the Th1 phenotype, whereas the P-haplotype was associated with an attenuated response to periodontopathogens, with suggestive skewing toward Th2/M2 phenotypes. In conclusion, IL-4 genetic variations associated with susceptibility to or protection against chronic periodontitis are directly associated with influencing the response of immune cells to periodontopathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2582967321,"In early spring, red wood ants Formica polyctena are often observed clustering on the nest surface in large numbers basking in the sun. It has been hypothesized that sun-basking behaviour may contribute to nest heating because of both heat carriage into the nest by sun-basking workers, and catabolic heat production from the mobilization of the workers’ lipid reserves. We investigated sun-basking behaviour in laboratory colonies of F. polyctena exposed to an artificial heat source. Observations on identified individuals revealed that not all ants bask in the sun. Sun-basking and non-sun-basking workers did not differ in body size nor in respiration rates. The number of sun-basking ants and the number of their visits to the hot spot depended on the temperature of both the air and the hot spot. To investigate whether sun basking leads to a physiological activation linked with increased lipolysis, we measured respiration rates of individual workers as a function of temperature, and compared respiration rates of sun-basking workers before and two days after they were allowed to expose themselves to a heat source over 10 days, at self-determined intervals. As expected for ectothermic animals, respiration rates increased with increasing temperatures in the range 5 to 35°C. However, the respiration rates of sun-basking workers measured two days after a long-term exposure to the heat source were similar to those before sun basking, providing no evidence for a sustained increase of the basal metabolic rates after prolonged sun basking. Based on our measurements, we argue that self-heating of the nest mound in early spring has therefore to rely on alternative heat sources, and speculate that physical transport of heat in the ant bodies may have a significant effect."

With the help of modern genetic and histological methods, preserved fixed tissues from pathological collections can be used to re-evaluate former diagnoses. We analysed 25 specimens from our pathological collection with ages ranging from 78 to 112 years. The tissues originated from the oral cavity, lip, tongue, lung, bone, kidney, spleen, thymus, larynx, lymph node, penis and uterine cervix with an original diagnosis of epithelial cancers or tuberculosis. Amplifiable DNA was extracted and in epithelial cancers, potential HPV infection was investigated. Specimens with an original diagnosis of tuberculosis were examined for mycobacterial infection. The tissues were also examined using modern histological methods. Our data showed that in 24/25 specimens the histological structure was preserved and in 10/11 specimens the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma could be confirmed. Additionally, HPV type 16 was detected in 8 specimens. The histological pattern of tuberculosis was found in 11/14 specimens and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was ascertained in four specimens. Our study showed that pathogens such as HPV or Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be detected in historical pathological preparations, and that these collections are suitable for further epidemiological research."
https://openalex.org/W2581222107,"In this paper we explore a relational understanding of landscape qualities. We asked three independent groups of human observers to assess the expressive qualities of a range of landscapes in the UK and in Spain, either by means of personal visits or from a projected digital image. We employed a Free Choice Profiling (FCP) methodology, in which observers generated their own descriptive terminologies and then used these to quantify perceived landscape qualities on visual analogue scales. Data were analysed using Generalised Procrustes Analysis, a multivariate statistical technique that does not rely on fixed variables to identify underlying dimensions of assessment. The three observer groups each showed significant agreement, and generated two main consensus dimensions that suggested landscape ‘health’ and ‘development in time’ as common perceived themes of landscape expressivity. We critically discuss these outcomes in context of the landscape assessment literature, and suggest ways forward for further development and research."
https://openalex.org/W2582851012,"Breast cancer remains a lethal disease to women due to lymph node metastasis, the tumor microenvironment, secondary resistance and other unknown factors. Several important transcription factors involved in this disease, such as PTEN, p53 and beta-catenin, have been identified and researched in-depth as candidates for targeted therapy in breast cancer. TFDP3 is a new, promising candidate for transcriptional regulation in breast cancer, although it was first identified in hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we demonstrate that TFDP3 is expressed in a variety of malignancies, normal testis tissue and breast cancer cell lines and thus provide evidence that TFDP3 is a cancer-testis antigen. We illustrate that overexpression or silencing TFDP3 interferes with epithelial-mesenchymal transition but does not influence cell proliferation, indicating that the TFDP3 protein acts as a transcription factor during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These data highlight that TFDP3 is expressed in breast cancer, that it is a member of the cancer-testis antigen family and that it functions as a regulator in epithelial-mesenchymal transition."
https://openalex.org/W2581182868,"Influenza virus is estimated to cause 3–5 million severe complications and about 250–500 thousand deaths per year. Different kinds of anti-influenza virus drugs have been developed. However, the emergence of drug resistant strains has presented a big challenge for efficient antiviral therapy. Indole derivatives have been shown to exhibit both antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we adopted a cell-based system to screen for potential anti-IAV agents. Four indole derivatives (named 525A, 526A, 527A and 528A) were subjected to the antiviral screening, of which 526A was selected for further investigation. We reported that pre-treating cells with 526A protects cells from IAV infection. Furthermore, 526A inhibits IAV replication by inhibiting the expression of IAV genes. Interestingly, 526A suppresses the activation of IRF3 and STAT1 in host cells and thus represses the production of type I interferon response and cytokines in IAV-infected cells. Importantly, 526A also partially blocks the activation of RIG-I pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that 526A may be a potential anti-influenza A virus agent."
https://openalex.org/W2580713310,"The major subunit isoform of GABAA receptors is α1β2γ2. The subunits are thought to surround an ion pore with the counterclockwise arrangement α1γ2β2α1β2 as seen from the outside of the neuron. These receptors have two agonist sites and one high affinity drug binding site specific for benzodiazepines. Recently, this receptor was postulated to assume alternative subunit stoichiometries and arrangements resulting in only one agonist site and one or even two sites for benzodiazepines. In order to force a defined subunit arrangement we expressed a combination of triple and dual concatenated subunits. Here we report that these unconventional receptors express only small current amplitudes in Xenopus oocytes. We determined agonist properties and modulation by diazepam of two of these receptors that resulted in currents large enough for a characterization, that is, β2-α1-γ2/α1-γ2 and β2-α1-γ2/β2-γ2. The first pentamer predicted to have two benzodiazepine binding sites shows similar response to diazepam as the standard receptor. As expected for both receptors with a single predicted agonist site the concentration response curves for GABA were characterized by a Hill coefficient < 1. β2-α1-γ2/β2-γ2 displayed a mM apparent GABA affinity for channel opening instead of the expected μM affinity. Based on their subunit and binding site stoichiometry, that contradicts all previous observations, their unusual functional properties and their very low expression levels in oocytes, we consider it unlikely that these unconventional receptors are expressed in neurons to an appreciable extent."
https://openalex.org/W2582532387,"In order to optimize aircraft pushback management during rush hour, aircraft pushback slot allocation based on congestion pricing is explored while considering monetary compensation based on the quality of the surface operations. First, the concept of the ""external cost of surface congestion"" is proposed, and a quantitative study on the external cost is performed. Then, an aircraft pushback slot allocation model for minimizing the total surface cost is established. An improved discrete differential evolution algorithm is also designed. Finally, a simulation is performed on Xinzheng International Airport using the proposed model. By comparing the pushback slot control strategy based on congestion pricing with other strategies, the advantages of the proposed model and algorithm are highlighted. In addition to reducing delays and optimizing the delay distribution, the model and algorithm are better suited for use for actual aircraft pushback management during rush hour. Further, it is also observed they do not result in significant increases in the surface cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed model and algorithm."
