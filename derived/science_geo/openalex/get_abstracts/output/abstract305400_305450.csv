https://openalex.org/W2020440778,"The temporal and spatial patterns of anthocyanin pigmentation in the maize plant are determined by the presence or absence of the R protein product, a presumed transcriptional activator. At least 50 unique patterns of pigmentation, conditioned by members of the R gene family, have been described. In this study, microprojectiles were used to introduce into maize cells a vector containing the transcription unit from one of these genes (Lc) fused to a constitutive promoter. This chimeric gene induces cell autonomous pigmentation in tissues that are not normally pigmented by the Lc gene. As a reporter for gene expression studies in maize, R is unique because it can be quantified in living tissue simply by counting the number of pigmented cells following bombardment. R may also be useful as a visible marker for selecting stably transformed cell lineages that can give rise to transgenic plants."

The TlaPbbOc/TldPbeOf superlattices were deposited from a single aqueous solution at room temperature, and the layer thicknesses were galvanostatically controlled. The films showed strong preferred orientation and distinct first-order satellites around the Bragg reflections in the x-ray diffraction pattem. The modulation wavelengths calculated from the satellite spacings were in agreement with those calculated from Faraday's law. Because the modulation wavelengths are of electron mean free path dimensions, this dass of degenerate semiconductor metal-oxide superlattices may exhibit thickness-dependent quantum optical, electronic, or optoelectronic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2085744073,"A detailed comparison between molecular dynamics computer simulations and the experimental characterization of molecular motion through deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods has been carried out for the crystalline phase of nylon 66 (polyhexamethyleneadipamide) at room temperature and just below the melting point. The computer simulations agree quantitatively with the experimental results at room temperature and qualitatively near the crystalline melting point. Both methods demonstrate that individual methylene groups within the crystals exhibit librational motion, which becomes very large in amplitude near the melting point, rather than undergoing discrete conformational jumps; furthermore, the hydrogen-bonded amides are relatively immobile at all temperatures below 230 degrees Celsius. The simulations are shown to be particularly useful for examining the cooperativity of motion and for providing insight into structural-dynamical correlations. These aspects of the simulations are exemplified by the observation of concerted counterrotation of odd-numbered bonds within the methylene segments and the entropic stabilization of the crystal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1986510148,"A method is described for determining heats of heterolysis, ΔHhet, from the heats of reaction of resonancestabilized carbenium ions with carbanions in solution. These results can be converted into heats of homolysis, ΔHhomo, for the same bonds by combining ΔHhet values with electron transfer energies, ΔGET (ΔGET ≈ ΔHET), obtained from redox potentials of the reacting ions. The results provide a comprehensive tabulation of ΔHhet, ΔHhomo, and ΔGET values for an extended series of organic compounds and are examined in terms of their interrelationships and a number of related properties of the ions and radicals."
https://openalex.org/W2035331660,"The hydroperoxyl radical (HO(2)) plays a key role in stratospheric chemistry through the HOx catalytic cycle of ozone destruction. Earlier measurements of stratospheric HO(2) have given mixed results; some measured mixing ratios greatly exceed theoretical predictions. Measurements of HO(2) have now been made with a balloon-borne farinfrared spectrometer. The measured daytime profile is in excellent agreement with theory up to 40 kilometers; above this level the measurements exceed theory by 30 percent, perhaps because of underprediction of ozone at these altitudes. The nighttime HO(2) profile is strongly depressed with respect to the daytime profile, in general agreement with theory."
