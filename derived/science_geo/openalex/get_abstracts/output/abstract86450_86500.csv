https://openalex.org/W2043015697,"In cats, infection with T-lymphotropic retroviruses can cause T-cell proliferation and leukemia or T-cell depletion and immunosuppression. In humans, some highly T4 tropic retroviruses called HTLV-I can cause T-cell proliferation and leukemia. The subgroup HTLV-II also induces T-cell proliferation in vitro, but its role in disease is unclear. Viruses of a third subgroup of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses, collectively designated HTLV-III, have been isolated from cultured cells of 48 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The biological properties of HTLV-III and immunological analyses of its proteins show that this virus is a member of the HTLV family, and that it is more closely related to HTLV-II than to HTLV-I. Serum samples from 88 percent of patients with AIDS and from 79 percent of homosexual men with signs and symptoms that frequently precede AIDS, but from less than 1 percent of heterosexual subjects, have antibodies reactive against antigens of HTLV-III. The major immune reactivity appears to be directed against p41, the presumed envelope antigen of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1598199924,"Addition of vasopressin to rat hepatocytes prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol resulted in a very rapid decrease [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Ptd-Ins-4,5-P2) which was paralleled by increases of up to 3-fold in the levels of [3H]inositol trisphosphate (Ins-P3) and [3H]inositol bisphosphate (Ins-P2). Increases of [3H]inositol phosphate (Ins-P) were not detected until about 5 min after hormone addition. These data indicate that the major pathway for hormone-induced lipid breakdown in liver is through a phosphodiesterase for PtdIns-4,5-P2 and that decreases of phosphatidylinositol are a secondary result of increased PtdIns-4,5-P2 resynthesis. Using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Quin 2, cytosolic free Ca2+ increased from 160 nM to about 400 nM after vasopressin addition to hepatocytes and preceded the conversion of phosphorylase b to a. Half-maximal and maximal increases of cytosolic free Ca2+ and phosphorylase a activity were observed at 0.2 and 1 nM vasopressin, respectively. The dose-response curve for the initial rate of cytosolic free Ca2+ increase was very similar to those obtained for the initial rates of Ins-P3 production and PtdIns-4,5-P2 breakdown. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with Li+ caused a 3--4-fold potentiation of vasopressin-induced elevations of Ins-P, Ins-P2, and Ins-P3, with half-maximal effects at 0.5, 1, and 5 mM, respectively. The calculated maximal concentrations of Ins-P3 in cells treated with 20 nM vasopressin were 10 and 30 microM, respectively, without and with Li+. Lithium did not affect the initial rate of inositol polyphosphate production or Ca2+ mobilization. The increase of Ins-P3 which correlated with peak cytosolic free Ca2+ elevation was about 0.6 microM. In a saponin-permeabilized hepatocyte preparation, Ins-P3 (1 microM) caused Ca2+ release from a vesicular, ATP-dependent Ca2+ pool. The data presented here suggest that Ins-P3 may be a second messenger for the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by hormones in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2025884351,Rats never before exposed to opioids rapidly learned to press a lever for microinjections of morphine into the ventral tegmental area. Challenge by a narcotic antagonist produced no signs of physical dependence. Dependence was not seen after long-term morphine infusions into the ventral tegmentum but was seen after similar infusions into the periventricular gray region. Thus a major rewarding property of morphine is independent of the drug's ability to produce physical dependence. These data challenge models of drug addiction that propose physical dependence as necessary for the rewarding effects of opioids.
https://openalex.org/W1993349143,Electrical stimulation techniques were used to produce a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of na√Øve rabbits. Animals were then classically conditioned. Long-term potentiation of the hippocampus before training increased the rate at which animals subsequently learned the conditioning task. This result has significance for potential cellular mechanisms of associative learning.
https://openalex.org/W1604020381,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to the extreme COOH terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen gamma 400-411, (400)HHLGGAKQAGDV(411), have been used to analyze recognition specificities of the platelet-binding sites for fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. gamma 403-411 did not inhibit 125I-fibrinogen binding to platelets. In contrast, gamma 402-411 produced dose-dependent inhibition of fibrinogen binding to ADP and thrombin-stimulated living or fixed cells and was a competitive antagonist. Inhibitory activity was not modified by addition of one (gamma 401-411) or two (gamma 400-411) histidinyl residues to the NH2 terminus, but peptides with a trifluoroacetyl group on the epsilon-amino group of lysine 406 were inactive. 125I-Fibronectin and 125I-von Willebrand factor binding to thrombin-stimulated living or fixed cells was inhibited in the same dose range by the same set of peptides which inhibited fibrinogen binding and not by gamma 403-411 or trifluoroacetate-blocked peptides. The capacity of the peptides to inhibit binding to cells with an expressed receptor, i.e. fixed cells, excludes an effect on receptor induction. Thus, these results suggest that the three adhesive glycoproteins share a common site on thrombin-activated platelets, and a 10-amino acid peptide, corresponding to gamma 402-411, defines the recognition specificity of this site."
https://openalex.org/W1577465777,"The estrogen responsive human breast cancer MCF-7 cell culture was examined for its response to 2-hydroxyestrone a principal metabolite of estradiol. Addition of 2-hydroxyestrone to the cell cultures in concentration of 10(-9) - 10(-6) M had no effect on cell growth and proliferation because of rapid O-methylation of the catechol estrogen by catechol O-methyltransferase which is highly active in these cells. In the presence of quinalizarin, a potent catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor which reduces the O-methylation of the steroid, 10(-7) M and 10(-8) M 2-hydroxyestrone markedly suppresses the growth and proliferation of the cells. The tumor cell growth-inhibitory action of the catechol estrogen was neutralized by the presence of 10(-9) M estradiol. The catechol estrogen inhibition of cell growth is not observed in the estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-330 providing evidence that the inhibition is specific and is estrogen receptor-mediated. In contrast, the 16 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites of estradiol, estriol and 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone, are effective stimulators of MCF-7 cell proliferation with the latter exhibiting potency in excess of that expected from its estrogen receptor affinity. The present results represent the first observation of a specific receptor-mediated antiestrogenic action of 2-hydroxyestrone and suggest that the physiological regulation of the agonist activity of the primary estrogen may involve in situ generation of catechol estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1524926009,"The oxidation of L-cysteine by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of oxygen forms a thiyl free radical as demonstrated with the spin-trapping ESR technique. Reactions of this thiyl free radical result in oxygen consumption, which is inhibited by the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. Cysteine sulfinic acid, a cysteine metabolite, is a poorer substrate for horseradish peroxidase than cysteine and is oxidized to form both sulfur-centered and carbon-centered free radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1849951061,"With the use of cDNA probes reverse transcribed from purified glutathione S-transferase mRNA templates, four cDNA clones complementary to transferase mRNAs have been identified and characterized. Two clones, pGTB38 and pGTB34, have cDNA inserts of approximately 950 and 900 base pairs, respectively, and hybridize to a mRNA(s) whose size is approximately 980 nucleotides. In hybrid-select translation experiments, pGTB38 and pGTB34 select mRNAs specific for the Ya and Yc subunits of rat liver glutathione S-transferases. Clone pGTB33, which harbors a truncated cDNA insert, hybrid-selects only the Ya mRNA. All of the clones, pGTB38, pGTB34, and pGTB33, hybrid-select another mRNA which is specific for a polypeptide with an electrophoretic mobility slightly greater than the Ya subunit. The entire nucleotide sequence of the full length clone, pGTB38, has been determined and the complete amino acid sequence of the corresponding polypeptide has been deduced. The mRNA codes for a protein comprising 222 amino acids with Mr = 25,547. We have also identified a cDNA clone complementary to a Yb mRNA of the rat liver glutathione S-transferases. This clone, pGTA/C36, hybrid-selects only Yb mRNA(s) and hybridizes to a mRNA(s) whose size is approximately 1200 nucleotides. Although the Ya, Yb, and Yc mRNAs are elevated coordinately by phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene, the Ya-Yc mRNAs are induced to a much greater extent compared to the Yb mRNA(s). These data suggest that the mRNAs for each transferase isozyme are regulated independently."
https://openalex.org/W1590805502,"The hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues by the collagen hydroxylases is coupled with a stoichiometric decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate. Ascorbate is virtually a specific requirement for these enzymes, but previous studies have demonstrated that it is not consumed during most catalytic cycles. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase are known also to catalyze an uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate in the absence of the peptide substrate. It is shown here that, unlike the complete hydroxylation reaction, the uncoupled decarboxylation reaction involves stoichiometric ascorbate consumption. This stoichiometric ascorbate consumption was also seen when the rate of the uncoupled prolyl 4-hydroxylase reaction was enhanced by the addition of poly(L-proline). Since collagen hydroxylases may catalyze occasional uncoupled reaction cycles even in the presence of the peptide substrates, the main function of ascorbate in these reactions in vivo is suggested to be that of reactivating the enzymes after such uncoupled cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1549011458,"Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase of Mr = 120,000 is cleaved by limited proteolysis with alpha-chymotrypsin into two fragments of Mr = 54,000 (54K) and Mr = 66,000 (66K). When the native enzyme is modified with 3-(bromoacetyl)pyridine, both portions of the enzyme are alkylated; however, alkylation of the 54K portions of the enzyme is protected by the addition of the substrate, NAD, or its analog, nicotinamide, suggesting that the substrate-binding site is localized in the 54K fragment. When the enzyme previously automodified with a low concentration of [adenine-U-14C] NAD is digested with alpha-chymotrypsin, the radioactivity is detected exclusively in the 66K fragment. The 66K fragment thus labeled is further cleaved with papain into two fragments of Mr = 46,000 and Mr = 22,000. With these two fragments, the label is detected only in the 22K fragment, but not in the 46K fragment. The 46K fragment binds to a DNA-cellulose column with the same affinity as that of the native enzyme, while the 22K fragment and the 54K fragment have little affinity for the DNA ligand. These results indicate that poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase contains three separable domains, the first possessing the site for binding of the substrate, NAD, the second containing the site for binding of DNA, and the third acting as the site(s) for accepting poly(ADP-ribose)."
https://openalex.org/W1501021760,"Gelsolin is an actin-fragmenting cytoplasmic protein. A functionally similar protein has also been identified in plasma. We have compared the structure of the cytoplasmic and plasma forms of gelsolin and examined their biosynthetic relationships. Plasma gelsolin is larger than cytoplasmic gelsolin (Mr 93,000 versus 90,000, respectively) and is more positively charged. Partial amino acid sequencing analyses show that the two gelsolins share a common 29 amino acid sequence which lies at the NH2-terminal end of cytoplasmic gelsolin and spans residues 26-55 of plasma gelsolin. Compared with cytoplasmic gelsolin, plasma gelsolin contains an additional peptide of 25 amino acids at its NH2 terminus. The human hepatoma-derived cell line, HepG2, synthesizes both the 90-kDa and the 93-kDa gelsolins but secretes only the 93-kDa form. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the rate of disappearance of the 93-kDa gelsolin from the cells corresponds with the rate of appearance of the 93-kDa gelsolin in the medium, whereas the rate of disappearance of the 90-kDa gelsolin is independent of and slower than that of the secreted plasma protein. We conclude that cytoplasmic and plasma gelsolins are structurally similar but not identical, that after synthesis these proteins are processed independently, and that the fate of each is distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1994158536,"An ideal vaccine does not yet exist to prevent cholera, a significant health problem in many less developed countries. Vibrio cholerae, the agent of epidemic and endemic cholera, colonizes the small bowel and secretes a potent enterotoxin that consists of a single A subunit, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity, and five identical B subunits which bind to the ganglioside GM1 receptor of intestinal mucosal cells. Previous studies in man indicate that toxoid-derived antitoxic immunity by itself is insufficient to provide effective, long-lasting protection against cholera. Using recombinant DNA techniques we have now constructed a live, attenuated V. cholerae strain by deleting genes encoding the enterotoxin. Restriction enzyme fragments encoding cholera toxin were deleted in vitro from cloned vibrio chromosomal DNA and the resulting mutations introduced into the chromosome of a vibrio strain of proven immunogenicity. Recently, Mekalanos and coworkers have reported attenuated V. cholerae strains constructed by similar methods. It appears that recombinant DNA techniques offer a promising approach to the development of effective cholera vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1527256831,"The specific binding of 125I-PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) to intact fibroblasts becomes relatively nondissociable during incubation at 37 degrees C. To characterize the interaction of PDGF with its receptors under conditions in which there is no receptor internalization, we have studied the binding of 125I-PDGF to membrane preparations derived from mouse 3T3 cells and rat liver. The binding sites had the affinity and specificity characteristics expected of PDGF receptors. At 37 degrees C (but not at 4 degrees C) the specific binding of 125I-PDGF to membranes gradually became nondissociable as assessed by either dilution or by addition of excess unlabeled PDGF. This tight binding was not due to a covalent interaction since the polyanionic compound suramin readily dissociated specifically bound 125I-PDGF. This property of suramin was used to expose rat liver PDGF receptors which were occupied by endogenous PDGF. Affinity cross-linking studies demonstrated that the formation of the nondissociable state of 125I-PDGF binding was associated with the binding of 125I-PDGF to a 160,000-dalton protein and to a 110,000-dalton species. The cross-linked binding sites could be adsorbed to wheat germ agglutinin and to anion exchange resins. The isoelectric point of both cross-linked species determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was approximately 4.7. These data demonstrate that in membrane preparations, PDGF binds to an anionic 160,000-dalton glycoprotein which is likely to be the receptor. A high affinity state of PDGF binding, which is formed rapidly at 37 degrees C, can be dissociated by suramin."
https://openalex.org/W1521753997,"We have sequenced the yeast HSP90 gene, which encodes the (apparent) Mr = 90,000 heat shock-inducible protein of this organism. All sequences required for the heat shock-regulated expression of this gene reside on a segment of DNA containing no more than 273 nucleotides 5' to the transcription origin. Transcript mapping reveals that the mature hsp90 mRNA contains a 59-nucleotide 5' untranslated segment, a coding segment of 2130 nucleotides (sufficient to encode a protein of Mr = 81,419), and a 3' untranslated segment of 128 nucleotides. Although the sequences surrounding the coding region of the HSP90 gene are quite similar to those surrounding other sequenced yeast genes, we find as well a limited homology between sequences located 5' to this gene and the putative heat shock-regulatory sequences located 5' to the heat shock-inducible genes of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1609953571,"Cholesterol metabolism has been investigated in a strain of BALB/C mice that carry an autosomal recessive mutation associated with decreased sphingomyelinase and glucocerebrosidase activity and storage of sphingomyelin and glucocerebroside as well as cholesterol in lysosomes (Pentchev, P. G., Gal, A. E., Boothe, A. D., Omodeo-Sale, F., Fouks, J., Neumeyer, B. A., Quirk, J. M., Dawson, G., and Brady, R. O. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 619, 669-679). When affected animals are placed on a diet high in cholesterol, they develop hepatomegaly associated with an extensive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in the liver. Cultured skin fibroblasts derived from these mice also manifest a defect in cholesterol esterification although the uptake and intracellular location of exogenous cholesterol is comparable to that of controls. Microsomal fatty acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was normal or elevated in extracts of tissues from the affected animals. Furthermore, the subcellular distribution and membrane orientation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase appeared normal in microsomal preparations isolated from affected mice. The blockage of esterification of exogenous cholesterol in the presence of normal transferase activity is suggestive of a defect in a component involved in the intracellular disposition of this sterol. The attenuation in tissue levels of sphingomyelinase and glucocerebrosidase and the accumulation of sphingolipids may reflect alterations in lysosomal function resulting from an imbalance of unesterified cholesterol in these organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1589488717,"Because mitogenic stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) requires at least an 8--12-h exposure to commit the majority of the cells to divide, a number of complicating processes must be evaluated in an analysis of the relationship between receptor occupancy and the biological response. During this period, the number of cellular EGF receptors changes and the cells continuously bind, internalize, and degrade the hormone. To deal with these changes, we utilized our previously described steady state model that permits an analysis of EGF interactions with cells under steady state conditions. For these studies we derived and measured a number of steady state rate constants to describe the interaction of 125I-EGF with cultured human and mouse fibroblast-like cells. The validity of these constants was established by demonstrating the close agreement between experimentally determined results and predicted results from computer simulations using these constants. These approaches in conjunction with experiments on the mitogenic stimulation of the cells with EGF led to the conclusion that there is a linear relationship between mitogenic stimulation and EGF receptor occupancy at steady state, with no apparent spare EGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1506801516,"Vinculin phosphorylation in both chick embryo fibroblasts and Swiss 3T3 cells was increased by either calcium or biologically active phorbol esters. Increased phosphorylation of vinculin was noted as early as 10 min following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment and was maximal at about 1 h. Maximal increases in phosphorylation were noted at approximately 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (80 nM), a less potent phorbol ester, resulted in smaller increases in vinculin phosphorylation than phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at equimolar concentrations. Phorbol, dibutyryl cAMP, and dibutyryl cGMP had no significant effect on phosphorylation. No correlation was found between vinculin phosphorylation and the morphological changes induced by phorbol esters. Tryptic peptide analysis of vinculin revealed multisite phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of only three of the peptides was significantly increased following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed increases at both serine and threonine residues. The low level of phosphotyrosine present in control cells was not significantly increased by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. These findings combined with studies of vinculin phosphorylation by purified protein kinase C (Werth, D. K., Niedel, J. E., and Pastan I. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11423-11426) suggest the hypothesis that protein kinase C may be involved in regulation of phosphorylation of vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein."
https://openalex.org/W2108976360,"Heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli pathogenic for humans (LTh) or for piglets (LTp) and Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin (CT) are structurally and functionally similar toxins. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the toxA gene which encodes the subunit A of LTh (LTh A). The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 258 residues including a signal peptide of 18 residues. According to the previously completed LTh B sequence (103 residues), the predicted holotoxin (1A5B) of LTh comprises 755 residues and has Mr = 87,866. With respect to LTh A and LTh B, secondary structures, local hydrophilicity, and sites for antigenic determinants were predicted. Both codon usage and G + C content of the toxA gene and the LTh B gene (toxB) were markedly different from those observed with several E. coli chromosomal genes. Its relatively low G + C content was rather close to that of the V. cholerae chromosome. Although the toxA gene shares a common ancestor with the LTp A gene (eltA), the two genes are apparently distinguishable from each other in their sequences. Like LTh B reported previously, the predicted sequence of the catalytic fragment LTh A1 also showed more homology to that of CT A1 than did that of LTp A1. In contrast, unique sequences were found in LTh A2."
https://openalex.org/W1529550306,"Preferential interaction measurements between proteins and monosodium glutamate were carried out to arrive at an understanding of the mechanism of its strong effect on tubulin stability and self-assembly into microtubules. For all proteins studied, i.e. bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, beta-lactoglobulin, and calf brain tubulin, the protein showed a large preferential hydration in the presence of monosodium glutamate. The enhancement of tubulin self-association by monosodium glutamate can be interpreted in terms of the large unfavorable free energy of interaction between the additive and the protein. Preferential interactions were also examined for lysine hydrochloride, which also gave a preferential hydration of the proteins, except for tubulin. The dependence of the preferential hydration parameter on proteins was different for the two additives, suggesting the importance of net electrostatic charges of proteins in their interaction with glutamate anions and lysinium cations. The zero preferential interaction of lysine hydrochloride with tubulin indicates an affinity of the lysine cation for the protein. Both additives increased the transition temperature of proteins. This can be understood in terms of the unfavorable free energy of interaction between the additive and the protein surface, which should be even more unfavorable when the denaturation causes an increase in the surface area."
https://openalex.org/W1577479878,"Hypochlorous acid (HOC1) rapidly chlorinates fluorescein compounds forming, sequentially, the corresponding 4'-chlorofluorescein and 4',5'-dichlorofluoresceins. Chlorination by cell-free myeloperoxidase-catalyzed chloride peroxidation systems gives rise to these compounds as well as variable amounts of isomeric compounds chlorinated in the 2'- and 2',7'-positions. The fluorescence intensity of the dianionic form of the dye is partially quenched upon chlorination, and its proton equilibrium constants are shifted to more acidic values. Fluorescein covalently bound to zymosan (5-isothiocyanatofluorescein-zymosan) also formed these products when the unopsonized particles were incubated with phorbol myristate acetate- or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated human neutrophils. This reaction was associated with a fall in fluorescence intensity, which was not observed when cells from individuals with chronic granulomatous disease or myeloperoxidase deficiency were used or when azide or catalase were added to the reaction medium. Fluorescent changes accompanying phagocytosis of serum-opsonized 5-isothiocyanatofluorescein-zymosan were also consistent with chlorination of the label; the changes were shown to be myeloperoxidase-dependent by use of myeloperoxidase-deficient or azide-treated cells. Oxidative bleaching of the structurally similar sulfonphthalein dyes by HOCl also occurs at rates which parallel the dye basicities. Results are discussed in relation to the use of fluoresceinated particles and sulfonphthalein dyes in the measurement of intraphagosomal acidification."

They are recognized by antibodies from patients with adult T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, from healthy carriers of HTLV, and from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The latter finding has been one of the major reasons for suggesting an association of HTLV with AIDS. However, whether these antigens are of cellular or viral origin has not been clear. These antigens have now been shown to be associated with the presence of viral proteins in the cells, and a cross-reactive glycoprotein of molecular size of 46,000 daltons has been found to be a consistent structural part of viruses purified from several HTLV-producer cell lines. The findings thus suggest a viral (HTLV) origin of these antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1563589448,"A comparison of DNA polymerase III core enzyme (McHenry, C. S., and Crow, W. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1748-1753) prepared from wild type Escherichia coli and a strain harboring the mutator gene, mutD5 (Degnen, G. E., and Cox, E. C. (1974) J. Bacteriol. 17, 477-487) has revealed several differences in their properties. Among these are alterations in the heat stability, divalent cation requirement, pH optimum, 3'----5'-single strand exonuclease activity, and DNA-dependent conversion of a deoxynucleoside triphosphate to its corresponding monophosphate (turnover). The decrease in the 3'-single strand exonuclease and turnover indicate a defect in the editing function of the mutD strain, which is at least in part responsible for the high spontaneous mutation rate in mutD. Transformation of mutD by a hybrid plasmid, pRD3, constructed from an EcoRI restriction fragment of E. coli and pBR322, cures mutD of its abnormally high mutation rate, and simultaneously restores its 3'-exonuclease activity. These observations are consistent with the notion that the mutD gene product is a subunit of DNA polymerase III, and it either contains the catalytic site for the 3'-exonuclease or modulates its activity. From a consideration of the known molecular weights of the subunits in DNA polymerase III core (McHenry C. S., and Crow, W. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1748-1753) the molecular weights of the two proteins translated in maxicells transformed with pRD3, and from a comparison of our results with those obtained with the mutator dnaQ (Horiuchi, T., Maki, H., Maruyama, M., and Sekiguchi, M.

(Echols, H., Lu, C., and Burgers, P. M. J. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 2189-2192) we tentatively assign the mutD gene product to the epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III."

https://openalex.org/W1493756240,"In this article we demonstrate receptors for parathyroid hormone in circulating mononuclear leukocytes using the radioiodinated analogue (8,18 norleucine, 34 tyrosine) bPTH 1-34 (bovine parathyroid hormone 1-34). Specific binding, which is reversible and saturable, equilibrates within 5 min at 0-4 degrees C with a calculated KD of 8.9 X 10(-11) M. This binding has a pH maximum of 7.0, is magnesium-dependent, and is inversely related to medium calcium concentration. Such binding is completely inhibited by simultaneous addition of 4 ng/ml of bovine parathyroid hormone 1-34, 5 ng/ml of bovine parathyroid hormone 1-84, or 5 ng/ml (8,18 norleucine, 34 Tyr) of 3-34 bPTH, but is unaffected by a biologically inactive parathyroid hormone fragment or other unrelated peptide hormones. Cyclic AMP accumulation increases 3-fold after 5 min exposure of mononuclear leukocytes to bPTH 1-34 in concentrations as low as 1 X 10(-9) M. Lymphocytes appear to be the circulating cells which interact with PTH as indicated by the observations that: 1) lymphocyte-enriched preparations bind three times as much radioligand/cell as do mixed mononuclear leukocytes, 2) monocytes, platelets, granulocytes, and erythrocytes do not bind PTH, and 3) monocytes, but not lymphocytes, degrade the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1509510175,"The product of the Escherichia coli sex factor F traT gene (TraTp), an outer membrane protein of Mr = 25,000, is covalently modified in vivo by the addition of glycerol and fatty acids. Consistent with this result, and as would be expected for a bacterial lipoprotein, the novel amino acid glycerylcysteine can be detected in purified TraTp. Being a secreted protein, TraTp is made from a signal sequence containing precursor, and glycerol and fatty acids can be detected in both the precursor and mature (processed) species of TraTp. The peptide antibiotic globomycin inhibits the cleavage of the pro-TraTp signal sequence, but not the glycerol and fatty acid modification. Diglyceride modification of the Cys residue at the site of signal sequence cleavage probably precedes and is a prerequisite for processing of the TraTp signal sequence. Thus, TraTp appears to be a typical E. coli lipoprotein, having a pathway for modification and processing that is similar to that of Braun's lipoprotein (the major outer membrane lipoprotein)."
https://openalex.org/W1555051030,"Two forms of pyrophosphate:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase have been isolated from wheat seedlings. One of these enzymes, termed PFP-1, has been purified to homogeneity. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the enzyme is composed of two different polypeptide chains of Mr = 67,000 (alpha) and 60,000 (beta). PFP-1 has been assigned a molecular structure consisting of alpha 2 beta 2 based on an estimated Mr of 234,000 for the native enzyme. PFP-2, the other form of phosphotransferase, has also been purified extensively. Preliminary data suggest that the active form of PFP-2 is probably a dimer of a polypeptide chain of Mr = 60,000. Immunological studies indicate that the two enzyme preparations share common antigenic determinants. The two forms of enzyme have very similar kinetic properties. The phosphotransferases are activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) which lowers the Km of the enzymes for fructose 6-phosphate but not that for PPi. Interestingly, PFP-1 is significantly more active than PFP-2 in the absence of Fru-2,6-P2. Also, PFP-1 exhibits a greater affinity (Ka = 7 nM) than PFP-2 (Ka = 26 nM) for the activator. Based on kinetic, immunological, and physicochemical parameters, it is suggested that the two enzymic forms are related in that they share the same catalytic moiety, i.e. the 60,000-dalton or beta subunit. The beta subunit when in complex formation with the alpha subunit, as in PFP-1, becomes more active in the absence of Fru-2,6-P2 as well as exhibits a greater sensitivity toward the effector."
https://openalex.org/W1619909436,"A highly purified cytochrome b-c1 complex from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides R-26 was isolated by a procedure involving Triton X-100 solubilization, calcium phosphate column chromatography, and ammonium sulfate fractionation. The purified enzyme complex contains, in nanomoles/mg of protein, cytochrome b, 8.3; cytochrome c1, 8.3; iron-sulfur protein, 15; phospholipids, 182; and ubiquinone, 5. Four major polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 48,000, 30,000, 24,000, and 12,000 were detected in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Mr = 48,000 and 30,000 proteins are cytochromes b and c1, respectively. The enzyme complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c with a specific activity of 12.6 mumol of cytochrome c reduced per min/mg of protein at 23 degrees C. This is lower than that of the mitochondrial enzyme, although both systems have similar essential redox components and a similar Km for ubiquinol. The activity is fully sensitive to antimycin A and 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4, 7-dioxobenzothiazole. The enzyme complex is stable at neutral pH and at lower temperatures, but became less stable when the incubation temperature was raised. At 37 degrees C, the half-life is 15 min. The enzymatic activity was insensitive to treatment with N',N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. No p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate-alkylable sulfhydryl groups were detected. The major phospholipids associated with the purified enzyme complex are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol with molar per cent distributions of 25, 21, and 35, respectively. About 60% of the enzymatic activity was abolished upon treatment with phospholipase A2. The phospholipase A2-inactivated activity can be partially restored by the addition of EDTA followed with phospholipids prepared from either the cytochrome b-c1 complex of the same source or a mixture of phosphatidylglycerol and asolectin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2106613586,"Abstract Cloned cDNAs containing sequences coding for the beta subunit of bovine thyrotropin have been identified. The complete nucleotide sequence of the largest of the beta subunit cDNA inserts has been determined. This cDNA contains 35 nucleotides from the 5' untranslated region of thyrotropin beta subunit mRNA and 60 nucleotides coding for an NH2-terminal precursor segment. This is followed by 339 nucleotides which code for the published amino acid sequence of the thyrotropin beta subunit. Following the 339 nucleotide beta subunit coding sequence, no termination codon is encountered for another 15 nucleotides. Thus, the cDNA codes for a thyrotropin beta subunit containing an additional 5 amino acids at the COOH terminus. The cDNA also contains 82 nucleotides of 3' untranslated sequence followed by a short poly(A) segment. Comparison of the bovine cDNA sequence to the recently described mouse thyrotropin beta subunit cDNA sequence reveals considerable homology throughout the coding sequence, including the COOH-terminal extension. These findings suggest the possibility that a thyrotropin beta subunit precursor is processed at both the NH2 and COOH termini."
https://openalex.org/W1603945993,"The site specificity of bacteriophage T4-induced type II DNA topoisomerase action on double-stranded DNA has been explored by studying the sites where DNA cleavages are induced by the enzyme. Oxolinic acid addition increases the frequency at which phi X174 duplex DNA is cut by the enzyme by about 100-fold, to the point where nearly every topoisomerase molecule causes a double-stranded DNA cleavage event. The effect of oxolinic acid on the enzyme is very similar to its effect on another type II DNA topoisomerase, the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase. A filter-binding method was developed that allows efficient purification of topoisomerase-cleaved DNA fragments by selecting for the covalent attachment of this DNA to the enzyme. Using this method, T4 topoisomerase recognition of mutant cytosine-containing T4 DNA was found to be relatively nonspecific, whereas quite specific recognition sites were observed on native T4 DNA, which contains glucosylated hydroxymethylcytosine residues. The increased specificity of native T4 DNA recognition seems to be due entirely to the glucose modification. In contrast, E. coli DNA gyrase shows a high level of specificity for both the mutant cytosine-containing DNA and native T4 DNA, recognizing about five strong cleavage sites on both substrates. An unexpected feature of DNA recognition by the T4 topoisomerase is that the addition of the cofactor ATP strongly stimulates the topoisomerase-induced cleavage of native T4 DNA, but has only a slight effect on cleavage of cytosine-containing T4 DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1484296744,"[3H]Nitrendipine and high intensity ultraviolet irradiation have been used to photoaffinity label the protein component of the high affinity nitrendipine-binding site in subcellular membrane fractions from canine cardiac muscle. Irradiation of isolated cardiac membranes in the presence of [3H]nitrendipine resulted in the covalent labeling of a protein component that migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular weight of 32,000. Incorporation of [3H]nitrendipine did not occur in the absence of irradiation. The photoaffinity labeling of the 32,000-Da protein by [3H]nitrendipine was inhibited by excess unlabeled nitrendipine, nifedipine, or verapamil. EDTA, ATP, and La3+, which are known to reduce high affinity nitrendipine binding, also inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of this membrane protein by [3H]nitrendipine. The 32,000-Da [3H]nitrendipine-labeled protein was found to be enriched in the ryanodine-sensitive fraction of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and absent from the ryanodine-insensitive fraction of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum which is known to lack high affinity nitrendipine binding. Therefore, the 32,000-Da photoaffinity-labeled [3H]nitrendipine-binding protein exhibits properties identical to those expected for the protein component of the high affinity nitrendipine-binding site in isolated cardiac membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2098519549,"A nuclear gene (CBP1) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae involved in 5' end processing of the cytochrome b pre-mRNA has been cloned and sequenced. The gene was originally selected by transformation of cbp1 mutants with a recombinant plasmid bank of random fragments of yeast nuclear DNA ligated to a plasmid vector with autonomous replicative function in yeast. The recombinant plasmid pG60/T10 with a nuclear DNA insert of 6.7 kilobase pairs (kb) was used to construct a new plasmid pool with the CBP1 gene on smaller fragments of nuclear DNA. A number of subclones have been isolated with plasmids carrying inserts of 2.4 to 6.1 kb. The plasmid designated pG60/T31 confers respiratory competency to cbp1 mutants and restores their ability to synthesize mature cytochrome b mRNA. The pG60/T31 plasmid has a nuclear DNA insert of 2.4 kb. The sequence of the cloned fragment reveals only one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein. The reading frame is 1962 nucleotides long and codes for a basic polypeptide with a molecular weight of 76,140. A transcript of a size commensurate with the length of the gene has been detected in wild type yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1595691405,"[125I-Tyr10]Monoiodoglucagon [( 125I]MIG) was cross-linked to liver membrane glucagon receptors with hydroxysuccinimidyl-p-azidobenzoate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Autoradiograms of the gel obtained after a 24-h exposure showed one major band at Mr = 63,000 that was sensitive to GTP and excess unlabeled glucagon. Exposure for 7 days showed labeling of an additional Mr = 33,000 species that was also sensitive to excess unlabeled glucagon. The Mr = 33,000 peptide can be obtained by subtilisin, trypsin, elastase, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease treatment of the [125I]MIG-occupied receptor in the membrane or in Lubrol-PX solution. In contrast, limited proteolysis of membranes containing vacant receptors results in labeling of a Mr = 24,000 peptide. The Mr = 24,000 peptide specifically binds [125I]MIG in a GTP-sensitive manner. The Mr = 33,000 peptide also retains GTP sensitivity since it releases bound [125I]MIG upon addition of GTP. Elastase treatment of the electroeluted Mr = 33,000 peptide yields the Mr = 24,000 and 15,000 fragments. The Mr = 15,000 peptide is the smallest fragment of the receptor as yet identified. Treatment of the Mr = 63,000 receptor with [125I]MIG cross-linked to it with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F results in four distinct fragments with Mr values of 61,000, 56,000, 51,000, and 45,000; prolonged treatment resulted in the accumulation of the last two. Neither the Mr = 33,000 nor the Mr = 24,000 fragment appeared to be substrates for endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F. These data indicate that glucagon receptor is a glycoprotein of approximately 60,000 daltons which contains at least four N-linked glycans accounting for 18,000 daltons of its mass. Both its glucagon binding function and its capacity to interact with the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase are contained within a fragment of only approximately 21,000 daltons that does not contain any N-linked glycans. Hormone occupancy of the receptor results in a conformational change so as to expose a region that is susceptible to proteolysis by proteases of varying specificities to yield a peptide of approximately 30,000 daltons that also does not contain N-linked glycans."
https://openalex.org/W1480938252,"A method was developed to isolate flagella with intact membranes from sea urchin sperm to further study the mechanism of the Na+-dependent H+ extrusion which increases the intracellular pH and triggers motility. Based on cytochrome c oxidase activity and cell count, the flagellar preparation contained at most 0.05% of the sperm heads present in the initial homogenate. The isolated flagella retained a Na+-dependent H+ extrusion mechanism which, like that of intact sperm, was inhibitable by high external potassium and with an ionic selectivity in the order of Na+ greater than Li+ much greater than Rb+ approximately equal to Cs+ (essentially ineffective). Two methods were employed to measure the change in intraflagellar pH (pHi): the accumulation of [14C]methylamine and a spectrofluorimetric technique using acridine orange. Flagella isolated from sperm suspended in Na+-free seawater (pH 7.90) maintained a pHi of 6.72 +/- 0.05 which increased by 0.5 to 0.6 pH unit following a Na+ (10 mM)-dependent release of H+ (114 +/- 18 nmol/mg) and an uptake of 22Na+ (134 +/- 36 nmol/mg). Both ionic movements were inhibitable by high external K+, suggesting a coupled exchange mechanism. This study provides direct evidence for the alkalinization of the flagellar pH under a condition compatible with motility initiation and shows that the isolated flagella is a useful model system for studying its mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1511226628,"Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.3) expression has been examined in an acellular protein-synthesizing system programmed with a plasmid DNA carrying thrS, infC, pheS, and pheT, the gene for threonyl-tRNA synthetase, initiation factor 3, and the two protomers of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.20), respectively. The initial rate of synthesis of L-[35S]methionine-labeled threonyl-tRNA synthetase is markedly reduced by the addition of homogeneous RNase-free threonyl-tRNA synthetase to the assay, not by that of phenylanyl- or tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.1). The inhibition is 50% in the presence of 0.25 microM threonyl-tRNA synthetase and reaches 90% with 2 microM enzyme. Synthesis of mRNA in the acellular DNA-dependent protein-synthesizing system has been measured by molecular hybridization to gene-specific lambda DNA probes corresponding to thrS, pheS, and pheT. The addition to the assay of 2 microM threonyl-tRNA synthetase does not affect the extent of mRNA hybridizing to the thrS-specific DNA probe. This result is interpreted as reflecting an effect of the synthetase on its expression at the translational level. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the thrS gene predicts several potential secondary structures capable of forming in the thrS mRNA. One of these potential structures is a cloverleaf. The possible role of such structures in controlling expression of thrS is discussed."

Cellular concentrations of the monophosphate and bisphosphate are proportional to the concentration of 2,5-anhydromannitol and are decreased by gluconeogenic substrates but not by glucose. Rat liver phosphofructokinase-1 phosphorylates 2,5-anhydromannitol-1-P; the rate is less than that for fructose-6-P but is stimulated by fructose-2,6-P2. At 1 mM fructose-6-P, bisphosphate compounds activate rat liver phosphofructokinase-1 in the following order of effectiveness: fructose-2,6-P2 much greater than 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2 greater than fructose-1,6-P2 greater than 2,5-anhydroglucitol-1,6-P2. High concentrations of fructose-1,6-P2 or 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2 inhibit phosphofructokinase-1. Rat liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is inhibited competitively by 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2 and noncompetitively by 2,5-anhydroglucitol-1,6-P2. The AMP inhibition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is potentiated by 2,5-anhydroglucitol-1,6-P2 but not by 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2. Rat liver pyruvate kinase is stimulated by micromolar concentrations of 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2; the maximal activation is the same as for fructose-1,6-P2. 2,5-Anhydroglucitol-1,6-P2 is a weak activator. 2,5-Anhydromannitol-1-P stimulates pyruvate kinase more effectively than fructose-1-P. Effects of glucagon on pyruvate kinase are not altered by prior treatment of hepatocytes with 2,5-anhydromannitol. Pyruvate kinase from glucagon-treated hepatocytes has the same activity as the control pyruvate kinase at saturating concentrations of 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2 but has a decreased affinity for 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-P2 and is not stimulated by 2,5-anhydromannitol-1-P. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis and enhancement of glycolysis from gluconeogenic precursors in hepatocytes treated with 2,5-anhydromannitol can be explained by an inhibition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, an activation of pyruvate kinase, and an abolition of the influence of phosphorylation on pyruvate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1536268728,"HeLa cells, when exposed to 5 mM sodium butyrate, increased their responsiveness to isoproterenol and their number of beta-receptors. As untreated HeLa cells have a substantial number of receptors but respond poorly to isoproterenol, the effect of butyrate could be due to quantitative or qualitative changes in beta-receptors or other components of the adenylate cyclase system. Receptors were analyzed by membrane/membrane and membrane/cell fusion techniques. HeLa donor membranes, treated to inactivate regulatory and catalytic components of adenylate cyclase, were fused with Fc cells, which lack beta-receptors. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the fusates was proportional to the number of receptors present. There appeared to be only quantitative but not qualitative differences in beta-receptors from control and butyrate-treated HeLa. Prostaglandin E1 receptors from neuroblastoma cell membranes were similarly coupled to HeLa adenylate cyclase. The hybrid prostaglandin E1-stimulated activity was lower when acceptor membranes were from control HeLa than when they were from butyrate-treated HeLa cells. These results suggested that butyrate was altering the ability of the regulatory component to interact with receptors. HeLa membranes were extracted with sodium cholate and the extracts used to reconstitute effector-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in S49 cyc- membranes, which lack a functional regulatory component. Whereas extracts from control and butyrate-treated HeLa were equally effective in restoring NaF-stimulated activity in cyc- membranes, extracts from control HeLa were less efficient in reconstituting isoproterenol- and prostaglandin E1-stimulated activities. We conclude that the poor response of control HeLa to beta-agonists is due to a limited activity of the regulatory component but not the receptor. Butyrate induces quantitative changes in the receptor and qualitative changes in the regulatory component that facilitate its ability to couple to receptors but do not alter its ability to interact with the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1607619848,"Abstract The spike protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, G protein, is a 68,000-Da glycoprotein which mediates viral binding, membrane fusion, and hemolysis. In an attempt to define the protein domain involved in membrane destabilization and fusion, a 25-amino acid peptide corresponding to the NH2 terminus of G protein was synthesized. We show here that this peptide is a pH-dependent hemolysin and that the pH and temperature optima for hemolysis by peptide and virus are similar. Antiserum prepared against this peptide is nonneutralizing and nonreactive with native G protein. Antipeptide antibodies, however, do react with sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured protein, suggesting that the G protein NH2 terminus is masked in the native protein. The hemolytic activity of the synthetic peptide may reflect an analogous function of the NH2 terminus of G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1506222015,"A tropomyosin kinase has been partially purified from the leg muscle of 11-day-old chick embryos by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE and phosphocellulose chromatography. The tropomyosin kinase requires Mg2+ for its activity, but Ca2+ and cyclic AMP are not needed. Increase in KC1 concentration decreased the tropomyosin kinase activity with over 90% inhibition at 0.2 M KC1. The alpha-tropomyosin subunit from rabbit and chicken skeletal muscle was phosphorylated about five times faster than the beta-tropomyosin subunit. Smooth muscle tropomyosin from chicken gizzard was not phosphorylated. The in vitro phosphorylation site in rabbit and chicken skeletal tropomyosins is a single serine residue close to the COOH terminus, a region intimately engaged in the head to tail polymerization of tropomyosin. Since the amino acid sequences of rabbit alpha- and beta-tropomyosin and chicken alpha-tropomyosin in this region are known, their phosphorylation sites can be unambiguously assigned as the penultimate residue, serine 283."
https://openalex.org/W1528220447,"The histidine-selective reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate and dye-sensitized photooxidation have been used to study the functional role of histidines in cytochrome c peroxidase. Of the 6 histidines in cytochrome c peroxidase, 5 are modified by diethyl pyrocarbonate at alkaline pH and 4 by photooxidation. The sixth histidine serves as the proximal heme ligand and is unavailable for reaction. Both modification reactions result in the loss of enzymic activity. However, photooxidized peroxidase retains its ability to react with H2O2 and to form a 1:1 cytochrome c peroxidase-cytochrome c complex. It is, therefore, concluded that the extra histidine modified by diethyl pyrocarbonate is the catalytic site distal histidine, His 52. In the presence of cytochrome c, no enzymic activity is lost by photooxidation and a single histidine, His 181, is protected from oxidative destruction. This finding provides strong support for the hypothetical model of the cytochrome c peroxidase-cytochrome c complex in which His 181 lies near the center of the intermolecular interface where it seems to provide an important link in the electron transfer process."
https://openalex.org/W1482287962,"Vanadyl, the tetravalent state of vanadium and a divalent cation, VO2+, was a relatively powerful inhibitor of highly purified membrane-bound sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase. The sensitivity of the ATPase activity to vanadyl characteristically correlated positively with the specific activity of the enzyme preparation. Inhibition ranged from nearly complete inhibition at less than 5 microM vanadyl for some of the purest fractions (specific activity approximately 45 mumol/min/mg of protein) to no observable inhibition at 300 microM vanadyl in one crude preparation of the enzyme with a specific activity of 10 mumol/min/mg of protein. The level of free vanadyl was reduced by incubation with these membranes, but this reduction was not sufficient to account for the low sensitivity to vanadyl observed in crude preparations. A reduction in specific activity by partial inactivation of a sensitive preparation by treatment with FeCl3 and ascorbate reduced its sensitivity to vanadyl. Anionic ligands of the enzyme, vanadate or ATP, increased the rate of recovery from inhibition after chelation of free vanadyl. At pH 6.1, the inhibition was characteristically fully reversible (t1/2 approximately 10 min), whereas at pH 8.1 it was stable for hours. The degree and stability of enzyme inhibition by vanadyl increased for several hours during incubation of the vanadyl-enzyme mixture, and at pH 6.1 the properties of the inhibitor itself also changed with time. Preincubation of the ion at that pH for 5 h before addition of the enzyme produced a more stable inhibition. The time- and pH-dependent changes in the degree and stability of enzyme inhibition probably relate to the complex chemistry of the vanadyl ion in solution."

Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited at threshold concentrations but not at higher concentrations. The antibody also inhibited aggregation and secretion in response to thromboxane A2 or the stable endoperoxide analog, U46619.

https://openalex.org/W1501250249,"Utilizing histone phosphorylation as the basis for a quantitative assay, the insulin-stimulated protein kinase in human placenta has been characterized. The kinase copurifies through wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose in constant ratio to the insulin binding function. Both activities are bound to the same extent on insulin-Sepharose, and the immobilized kinase, after extensive washing, exhibits activity versus histone, which closely approaches that of the insulin-stimulated, solubilized kinase. In addition, the bound kinase retains the ability to phosphorylate the Mr = 95,000 subunit of the bead-bound receptor. Elution of the beads with sodium dodecyl sulfate yields on electrophoresis two major peptides of Mr = 130,000 and 95,000. Thus, insulin binding and insulin-stimulated histone kinase copurify in a constant stoichiometric ratio in close physical relation and are likely functional expressions of the same molecule. After the DEAE step, the insulin-stimulated kinase phosphorylates histone subfraction 2b exclusively on tyrosine residues. Insulin increases the Vmax for H2b by 3-5-fold and increases the rate of the histone phosphorylation in direct correspondence to the steady state level of specifically bound insulin. ATP is the preferred phosphate donor. The reaction is supported by either Mn2+ or Mg2+. At [ATP] less than 0.5 mM, insulin-stimulated kinase is substantially higher with Mn2+ as the sole divalent cation, as compared to Mg2+. At [ATP] greater than or equal to 0.5 mM, the rates observed with Mn2+ have plateaued, whereas the rates in the presence of Mg2+ show a continued increase such that maximal activity is seen with Mg2+ and 2-3 mM ATP. Under these conditions, the estimated turnover number of the kinase ranges between 30 and 100 pmol of 32P transferred per min/pmol of insulin bound. Thus, the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor is quantitatively comparable to that estimated for several serine protein kinases and is unlikely to reflect the side reaction of another enzymatic function."
https://openalex.org/W1584554035,"Detailed studies on the effects of the ionophore monensin upon synthesis, maturation, and intracellular transport of pro-opiomelanocortin in cultures of rat pituitary intermediate lobe cells have been carried out. When added at concentrations larger than 5 X 10(-8) M monensin significantly inhibited protein synthesis by cultured intermediate lobe cells. Pro-opiomelanocortin synthesis was also reduced proportionally to the overall rate of protein synthesis. During pulse-chase experiments, monensin when added at a concentration of 10(-5) M at the beginning of the chase incubation completely inhibited the proteolytic processing of pro-opiomelanocortin. Using a subcellular fractionation procedure of intermediate lobe cell extracts on Percoll gradients, we were able to show that after the addition of monensin (10(-5) M), labeled pro-opiomelanocortin molecules synthesized during a 15-min pulse-incubation were recovered intact after a 2-h chase, in the fractions of the density gradient corresponding to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi elements. No maturation products or precursor molecules entered the granule fractions as observed in nontreated cells. Taken together these results strongly suggest that monensin blocks the intracellular transport of newly synthesized pro-opiomelanocortin molecules at the Golgi level and that inhibition of proteolytic processing is due to the failure of the prohormone to enter the cell compartment (probably the secretion granules) where maturation proteases are located."

Sealed vesicles sedimented at higher density than unsealed vesicles after equilibration with CsCl. Vesicles containing inside-out oriented enzyme sedimented at lower density than vesicles containing right-side-out oriented enzyme after the internally trapped Cs+ had been pumped out during an incubation with Mg2+ and ATP. Pools of gradient fractions representing unsealed vesicles and sealed vesicles containing inside-out and right-side-out oriented protein were characterized with respect to orientation and degree of sealing by determination of the ATPase activity, the rate of ATP-dependent Na+ uptake, and the inhibition of ATPase activity by ouabain. The accessibilities of sialic acid and of a tryptic site in the vesicle populations were in agreement with the proposed orientations of the protein. The structure of the reconstituted (Na+,K+)-ATPase was examined by proteolysis with trypsin and chymotrypsin over a range of reconstitution protocols.

We compared the Ad7 amino acid sequence with those reported for the Ad5 (Kruijer, W., van Schaik, F.M.A., and Sussenbach, J.S. (1981) Nucleic Acids Res. 9, 4439-4457) and Ad12 (Kruijer, W., van Schaik, F.M.A., Speijer, J.G., and Sussenbach, J.S. (1983) Virology 128, 140-153) DNA-binding proteins. A greater amount of amino acid sequence homology was found in the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain of the molecule. This homology is 61% between Ad7 and Ad5 and 49% when Ad12 was included in the comparison. The NH2-terminal domain of DBP retained a 49% homology between Ad7 and Ad5 and a 23% homology for all three serotypes. The greatest difference between the Ad7 and Ad5 DBPs is the absence, in the Ad7 protein, of 12 amino acids located between the two functional domains in the Ad5 protein (amino acids 151-162). In addition, three regions of high amino acid conservation between Ad5, Ad7, and Ad12 consisting of 9 (178-186), 9 (322-330), and 12 (464-475) consecutive amino acids (numbers refer to Ad5) in the DNA-binding portion of the molecule were revealed. These three regions contain a centrally located basic amino acid (183, 326, and 470) as well as an aromatic amino acid residue (181, 324, and 469). Since basic and aromatic amino acids have been implicated in other single-stranded DNA-binding protein/DNA interactions (Anderson, R.A., Nakashima, V., and Coleman, J.E.

The evidence that the single-stranded DNA cleavage activity is intrinsic to the topoisomerase includes: 1) protein linkage to the 5' ends of the newly cleaved DNA; 2) coelution of essentially homogeneous topoisomerase and the DNA cleavage activity; 3) inhibition of both single-stranded DNA cleavage and double-stranded DNA relaxation by oxolinic acid; and 4) inhibition of duplex DNA relaxation by single-stranded DNA. The major cleavage sites on phi X174 viral DNA substrates have been mapped, and several cleavage sites analyzed to determine the exact nucleotide position of cleavage. Major cleavage sites are found very near the base of predicted hairpin helices in the single-stranded DNA substrates, suggesting that DNA secondary structure recognition is important in the cleavage reaction. On the other hand, there are also many weaker cleavage sites with no obvious sequence requirements. Many of the properties of the single-stranded DNA cleavage reaction examined here differ from those of the oxolinic acid-dependent, double-stranded DNA cleavage reaction catalyzed by the same enzyme."
