https://openalex.org/W2157010562,"Paneth cells, specialized cells found in the intestinal epithelium, are known to protect stem cells by producing bactericidal compounds. Now another crucial function is reported: they provide the essential niche signals (EGF/TGFα, Notch and Wnt) for Lgr5-expressing stem cells in the small intestine. Multipotent stem cells expressing Lgr5 generate all intestinal epithelium cell types — Paneth cells included. Stem-cell niches are often seen as pre-existing sites to which stem cells migrate; this work shows that intestinal stem cells receive niche support from their own progeny. Multipotent stem cells expressing Lgr5 are known to generate all cell types of the intestinal epithelium (enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells). A new study shows that Paneth cells have an essential role for intestinal crypt and stem cell maintenance by supplying essential niche signals to the Lgr5-expressing cells. Homeostasis of self-renewing small intestinal crypts results from neutral competition between Lgr5 stem cells, which are small cycling cells located at crypt bottoms1,2. Lgr5 stem cells are interspersed between terminally differentiated Paneth cells that are known to produce bactericidal products such as lysozyme and cryptdins/defensins3. Single Lgr5-expressing stem cells can be cultured to form long-lived, self-organizing crypt–villus organoids in the absence of non-epithelial niche cells4. Here we find a close physical association of Lgr5 stem cells with Paneth cells in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. CD24+ Paneth cells express EGF, TGF-α, Wnt3 and the Notch ligand Dll4, all essential signals for stem-cell maintenance in culture. Co-culturing of sorted stem cells with Paneth cells markedly improves organoid formation. This Paneth cell requirement can be substituted by a pulse of exogenous Wnt. Genetic removal of Paneth cells in vivo results in the concomitant loss of Lgr5 stem cells. In colon crypts, CD24+ cells residing between Lgr5 stem cells may represent the Paneth cell equivalents. We conclude that Lgr5 stem cells compete for essential niche signals provided by a specialized daughter cell, the Paneth cell."
https://openalex.org/W2105031631,"Yoshiya Kawaguchi and colleagues show that a Sox9-positive progenitor pool located in the epithelia of the biliary and pancreatic ducts of adult mice serves as a continuous source of intestinal cells, hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells, identifying a shared pathway underlying the cellular renewal of these adult endodermal organs. The liver and exocrine pancreas share a common structure, with functioning units (hepatic plates and pancreatic acini) connected to the ductal tree. Here we show that Sox9 is expressed throughout the biliary and pancreatic ductal epithelia, which are connected to the intestinal stem-cell zone. Cre-based lineage tracing showed that adult intestinal cells, hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells are supplied physiologically from Sox9-expressing progenitors. Combination of lineage analysis and hepatic injury experiments showed involvement of Sox9-positive precursors in liver regeneration. Embryonic pancreatic Sox9-expressing cells differentiate into all types of mature cells, but their capacity for endocrine differentiation diminishes shortly after birth, when endocrine cells detach from the epithelial lining of the ducts and form the islets of Langerhans. We observed a developmental switch in the hepatic progenitor cell type from Sox9-negative to Sox9-positive progenitors as the biliary tree develops. These results suggest interdependence between the structure and homeostasis of endodermal organs, with Sox9 expression being linked to progenitor status."
https://openalex.org/W2053352181,"Loss of telomeres, the protective tips on the ends of chromosomes, causes tissue atrophy and other damage. A growing body of evidence points to telomere defects as a driver of age-associated organ decline and disease. Ronald DePinho and colleagues now show that reactivation of endogenous telomerase in mice extends telomeres, reduces DNA damage signalling, allows resumption of proliferation in quiescent cultures and eliminates degenerative phenotypes in many organs including the brain. Regenerative strategies that restore telomerase integrity may therefore be capable of slowing, halting or reversing age-related tissue degeneration — although as the authors point out, prolonged telomerase reactivation or applications in later life could provoke carcinogenesis. Here it is shown that reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity in mice extends telomeres, reduces DNA damage signalling, allows resumption of proliferation in quiescent cultures, and eliminates degenerative phenotypes across multiple organs including testes, spleens and intestines. Accumulating evidence implicating telomere damage as a driver of age-associated organ decline and disease and the reversal of damage observed here support the development of regenerative strategies designed to restore telomere integrity. An ageing world population has fuelled interest in regenerative remedies that may stem declining organ function and maintain fitness. Unanswered is whether elimination of intrinsic instigators driving age-associated degeneration can reverse, as opposed to simply arrest, various afflictions of the aged. Such instigators include progressively damaged genomes. Telomerase-deficient mice have served as a model system to study the adverse cellular and organismal consequences of wide-spread endogenous DNA damage signalling activation in vivo1. Telomere loss and uncapping provokes progressive tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure and impaired tissue injury responses1. Here, we sought to determine whether entrenched multi-system degeneration in adult mice with severe telomere dysfunction can be halted or possibly reversed by reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity. To this end, we engineered a knock-in allele encoding a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase-oestrogen receptor (TERT-ER) under transcriptional control of the endogenous TERT promoter. Homozygous TERT-ER mice have short dysfunctional telomeres and sustain increased DNA damage signalling and classical degenerative phenotypes upon successive generational matings and advancing age. Telomerase reactivation in such late generation TERT-ER mice extends telomeres, reduces DNA damage signalling and associated cellular checkpoint responses, allows resumption of proliferation in quiescent cultures, and eliminates degenerative phenotypes across multiple organs including testes, spleens and intestines. Notably, somatic telomerase reactivation reversed neurodegeneration with restoration of proliferating Sox2+ neural progenitors, Dcx+ newborn neurons, and Olig2+ oligodendrocyte populations. Consistent with the integral role of subventricular zone neural progenitors in generation and maintenance of olfactory bulb interneurons2, this wave of telomerase-dependent neurogenesis resulted in alleviation of hyposmia and recovery of innate olfactory avoidance responses. Accumulating evidence implicating telomere damage as a driver of age-associated organ decline and disease risk1,3 and the marked reversal of systemic degenerative phenotypes in adult mice observed here support the development of regenerative strategies designed to restore telomere integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2093522627,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Btk mediates inflammation are poorly understood. Here we describe the discovery of CGI1746, a small-molecule Btk inhibitor chemotype with a new binding mode that stabilizes an inactive nonphosphorylated enzyme conformation. CGI1746 has exquisite selectivity for Btk and inhibits both auto- and transphosphorylation steps necessary for enzyme activation. Using CGI1746, we demonstrate that Btk regulates inflammatory arthritis by two distinct mechanisms. CGI1746 blocks B cell receptor-dependent B cell proliferation and in prophylactic regimens reduces autoantibody levels in collagen-induced arthritis. In macrophages, Btk inhibition abolishes FcγRIII-induced TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 production. Accordingly, in myeloid- and FcγR-dependent autoantibody-induced arthritis, CGI1746 decreases cytokine levels within joints and ameliorates disease. These results provide new understanding of the function of Btk in both B cell- or myeloid cell-driven disease processes and provide a compelling rationale for targeting Btk in rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2164330524,"Development of cheap, high-throughput and reliable gene synthesis methods will broadly stimulate progress in biology and biotechnology. Currently, the reliance on column-synthesized oligonucleotides as a source of DNA limits further cost reductions in gene synthesis. Oligonucleotides from DNA microchips can reduce costs by at least an order of magnitude, yet efforts to scale their use have been largely unsuccessful owing to the high error rates and complexity of the oligonucleotide mixtures. Here we use high-fidelity DNA microchips, selective oligonucleotide pool amplification, optimized gene assembly protocols and enzymatic error correction to develop a method for highly parallel gene synthesis. We tested our approach by assembling 47 genes, including 42 challenging therapeutic antibody sequences, encoding a total of ∼35 kilobase pairs of DNA. These assemblies were performed from a complex background containing 13,000 oligonucleotides encoding ∼2.5 megabases of DNA, which is at least 50 times larger than in previously published attempts."
https://openalex.org/W2021346090,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). ApoE4 assumes a pathological conformation through an intramolecular interaction mediated by Arg-61 in the amino-terminal domain and Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain, referred to as apoE4 domain interaction. Because AD is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the effect of apoE4 domain interaction on mitochondrial respiratory function. Steady-state amounts of mitochondrial respiratory complexes were examined in neurons cultured from brain cortices of neuron-specific enolase promoter-driven apoE3 (NSE-apoE3) or apoE4 (NSE-apoE4) transgenic mice. All subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complexes assessed were significantly lower in NSE-apoE4 neurons compared with NSE-apoE3 neurons. However, no significant differences in levels of mitochondrial complexes were detected between astrocytes expressing different apoE isoforms driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, leading to our conclusion that the effect of apoE4 is neuron specific. In neuroblastoma Neuro-2A (N2A) cells, apoE4 expression reduced the levels of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I, IV, and V. Complex IV enzymatic activity was also decreased, lowering mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mutant apoE4 (apoE4-Thr-61) lacking domain interaction did not induce mitochondrial dysfunction in N2A cells, indicating that the effect is specific to apoE4-expressing cells and dependent on domain interaction. Consistent with this finding, treatment of apoE4-expressing N2A cells with a small molecule that disrupts apoE4 domain interaction restored mitochondrial respiratory complex IV levels. These results suggest that pharmacological intervention with small molecules that disrupt apoE4 domain interaction is a potential therapeutic approach for apoE4-carrying AD subjects."

https://openalex.org/W2081752871,"TMEM16A (anoctamin 1, Ano1), a member of a family of 10 homologous proteins, has been shown to form an essential component of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels. TMEM16A-null mice exhibit severe defects in epithelial transport along with tracheomalacia and death within 1 mo after birth. Despite its outstanding physiological significance, the mechanisms for activation of TMEM16A remain obscure. TMEM16A is activated on increase in intracellular Ca(2+), but it is unclear whether Ca(2+) binds directly to the channel or whether additional components are required. We demonstrate that TMEM16A is strictly membrane localized and requires cytoskeletal interactions to be fully activated. Despite the need for cytosolic ATP for full activation, phosphorylation by protein kinases is not required. In contrast, the Ca(2+) binding protein calmodulin appears indispensable and interacts physically with TMEM16A. Openers of small- and intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels known to interact with calmodulin, such as 1-EBIO, DCEBIO, or riluzole, also activated TMEM16A. These results reinforce the use of these compounds for activation of electrolyte secretion in diseases such as cystic fibrosis."

SMS1-null mice exhibited moderate neonatal lethality, reduced body weight, and loss of fat tissues mass, suggesting that they might have metabolic abnormality. Indeed, analysis on glucose metabolism revealed that they showed severe deficiencies in insulin secretion. Isolated mutant islets exhibited severely impaired ability to release insulin, dependent on glucose stimuli. Further analysis indicated that mitochondria in mutant islet cells cannot up-regulate ATP production in response to glucose. We also observed additional mitochondrial abnormalities, such as hyperpolarized membrane potential and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mutant islets. Finally, when SMS1-null mice were treated with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine, we observed partial recovery of insulin secretion, indicating that ROS overproduction underlies pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in SMS1-null mice.

The function of ceramide in apoptosis is clinically significant, because many cancer chemotherapies apparently induce ceramide-dependent apoptosis (9Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev.

Although perturbance of ceramide homeostasis is related to many diseases, the function of ceramide in these conditions remains uncharacterized. Sphingolipids are synthesized vectorially in cells. The initial step involves condensation of serine and a fatty acyl-Co-A, generating ceramide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CERT, ceramide transfer protein; SMS1, sphingomyelin synthase 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GTT, glucose tolerance test; ITT, insulin tolerance test; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; KO, knock-out; WAT, white adipose tissue. followed by a series of reactions (supplemental Fig. S1) (12Menaldino D.S.

Sphingomyelin is then transferred to the plasma membrane by exocytic vesicles and reversibly converted into ceramide by sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) on the plasma membrane. Recently, several investigators have used mutant mice to analyze ceramide trafficking. CERT mutant mice exhibit embryonic lethality attributable to mitochondrial degeneration (17Wang X. Rao R.P.

However, the effect of SMS1 ablation in vivo has not been examined, although it has been analyzed in cultured cells in which investigators found that SMS1 plays a critical role in proliferation of mouse lymphoid cells (16Yamaoka S.

Membrane sphingomyelin is reportedly important for Fas clustering through aggregation of lipid rafts, leading to Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Miyaji M. Jin Z.X. Yamaoka S. Amakawa R. Fukuhara S.

Suppression of SMS1 also results in enhanced ceramide production and apoptosis after photodamage (22Separovic D. Semaan L. Tarca A.L. Awad Maitah M.Y. Hanada K. Bielawski J. Villani M. Luberto C. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1860-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we generated SMS1 knock-out (SMS1-KO) mice. They exhibited moderate neonatal lethality, reduced body weight, and loss of fat tissues mass, suggesting that they might have metabolic abnormality. Then, we first analyzed glucose metabolism of the mice, and found that SMS1-KO mice showed severe deficiencies in insulin secretion. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the analysis to reveal the reason why insulin secretion was reduced in SMS1-KO mice. Isolated SMS1-KO islets exhibited severe deficiency in insulin release dependent on glucose stimuli. SMS1-KO islet mitochondria showed abnormalities, such as decreased ATP production, hyperpolarized membrane potential, and increased ROS. These results suggest that increased ROS production followed by mitochondrial dysfunction impairs insulin secretion in SMS1-KO mice. Strikingly, insulin release deficiency was rescued when SMS1-KO mice were supplied an anti-oxidant reagent, suggesting that ROS over-production underlies mitochondrial dysfunction of SMS1-KO pancreatic β-cells. Altogether, our data suggest that SMS1 is important for controlling ROS generation, and that SMS1 is required for normal mitochondrial function and normal insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. All reagents were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich or Wako (Osaka, Japan), unless otherwise stated. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured using an ELISA kit (Nikken Seil, Shizuoka, Japan). N-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-6-aminocaproyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-NBD-ceramide) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Genomic DNA clones of the Sms1 locus were isolated from a mouse 129/Svj genomic library (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) using full-length Sms1 cDNA as a probe. Exon 2, which encodes the translation initiation codon, the SAM domain and two SMS1 transmembrane regions, was replaced with a neo cassette. An 8-kbp EcoRI fragment containing the intron between exons 2 and 3 as a long arm and a 1 kbp EcoRI/PstI fragment of regions upstream of exon 2 as a short arm were inserted into pPGKneo(wt). The gene encoding the diphtheria toxin A fragment (DT-A) from pMC1-DT-A was inserted into the end of the long arm as a negative selection marker. The targeting vector was linearized, electroporated into D3 embryonic stem (ES) cells, and clones were selected in G418. Targeting events were screened by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Recombinant cells were karyotyped to ensure that 2N chromosomes were present in most metaphase spreads. Chimeric mice derived from correctly targeted ES cells were mated with C57BL/6 mice to obtain F1 Sms1+/− mice. All experiments were performed using F3 generation mice. PCR primers used to distinguish targeted from wild-type alleles were: GOR2SAp3, 5′-TTTGAGGAGAGAGGCCTTGAGTCTC-3′; GOR2-R1, 5′-AGGCAGCCACTTCCAGCAGCCAG-3′; and PGKneoS, 5′-TCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGAC-3′. GOR2SAp3 and GOR2-R1 primers amplified a 381 bp DNA fragment from the wild-type allele, whereas GOR2SAp3 and PGKneoS primers amplified a 552-bp fragment from the targeted allele. PCR was carried out with 30 cycles consisting of 94.5 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min. To confirm the homologous recombination, PCR was performed. For detection short arm, KOD-Fx (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primer sequences are as follows; (a) GOR2-SA1, 5′-GGGCTATCAGAAACTTCTTGATG-3′, (b) GOR2-R1, 5′-AGGCAGCCACTTCCAGCAGCCAG-3′, (c) PGKneoS, 5′-TCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGAC-3′. Long-accurate (LA)-PCR was performed for confirm the recombination in long arm. The protocol for the LA-PCR is as follows; an initial denature step, 95 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles of 98 °C, 10 s and 68 °C, 15 min, using LA-Taq (TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan). The primers used are as follows; (d) GOR2WT-LA-2F, 5′-GAGTGGTTTCCTGGTGTTGGATAAAGTC-3′, (e) NML1, 5′-GCCTACCCGCTTCCATTGCTCAGC-3′, (f) GOR2-FLA-2R, 5′-CCTGTTTAGAGCTTCGTCTCTTACTC-3′. Total RNA was isolated from embryonic fibroblasts using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed and blotted onto nylon membrane. The hybridization was performed using full-length (FL) or a PCR fragment (ex2) corresponding to SAM domain of mouse SMS1 cDNA as a 32P-labeled probe. The washed membranes were exposed to imaging plates, and the signals were developed by BAS2000 system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Genes for wild-type SMS1 and mutant SMS1 (SMS1 Δex2), in which exon 2 region encoding the translation initiation codon, the SAM domain and two SMS1 transmembrane regions was deleted, were transducted in WR19L/Fas-SM(−) cells by retro virus system (16Yamaoka S.

The cells were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates containing 100 μg of cell protein were added to a reaction solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm C6-NBD-ceramide, 120 μm phosphatidylcholine (PC), and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), applied on the thin-layer chromatgraphy (TLC) plates, and developed with solvent containing chloroform/methanol/12 mm MgCl2 in H2O (65:25:4). The fluorescent lipids were visualized by LAS-1000 system (Fujifilm). Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum unless noted. Mice were fed a normal diet (CE-2; CLEA, Japan). NAC (40 mm) was administered in drinking water. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Kumamoto University. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed as described (24Oike Y. Akao M. Yasunaga K. Yamauchi T. Morisada T. Ito Y. Urano T. Kimura Y. Kubota Y. Maekawa H.

For GTT, mice were deprived of food for 16 h and injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg/kg glucose. For ITT, mice were administered 1 unit/kg of human insulin by intraperitoneal injection. Blood was withdrawn from the supraorbital plexus at times indicated in figures. Blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method (Sanwa Kagaku, Nagoya, Japan), and serum insulin was measured by using an ELISA kit (Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Yokohama, Japan). Pancreas tissues isolated from wild-type or mutant mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and random sections were generated. Islet number per unit area of pancreas and islet size were measured using hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated with anti-insulin guinea pig IgG (Affinity BioReagents, Rockford, IL) and anti-glucagon rabbit polyclonal antibody (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 1:200 dilutions. Samples were then incubated in Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence for insulin and glucagon was observed using a Biorevo BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion as described (25Wollheim C.B. Meda P. Halban P.A.

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of thiopental sodium. Collagenase (collagenase type S-1, 0.6 mg/ml; Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solutions (Sigma) with 800 KI units/ml aprotinin (Wako). Collagenase solution was injected into the common bile duct. Pancreata were dissected and incubated in collagenase solution at 37 °C for 20 min with shaking. The solution was then mixed with ice-cold isotonic sucrose buffer and chilled on ice for 20 min. Precipitated islets were collected for further experiments. Total RNA from islet tissues was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed with a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Osaka, Japan), following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products were analyzed using a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time system (Takara Bio), and transcript abundance was normalized to that of β-actin mRNA. PCR oligonucleotides and gene abbreviations are listed in supplemental Table S1. Groups of 10–15 islets were incubated for 1 h in Ca2+-containing HEPES-added Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (HKRB) solution (129 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 4.7 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH7.4, with 0.05% bovine serum albumin) with 2.2 mm glucose at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere stabilization, followed by test incubation for 1 h in HKRB with 2.2 or 22 mm glucose. The concentration of secreted insulin was determined by using an ELISA kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories). To measure ATP content in islet cells, groups of 20–30 islets were incubated for 1 h in HKRB with 2.2 mm or 22 mm glucose at 37 °C. ATP in islets was extracted in 0.1% trichloroacetic acid and neutralized in 0.1 m Tris acetate. ATP levels were measured using a Cellular ATP Assay Kit (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) using Luminometer Model TD-20/20 (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA). To measure mitochondrial membrane potential, groups of 20–30 islets were loaded with JC-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by incubation in HKRB with 2.2 or 22 mm glucose at 37 °C for 1 h. Red and green fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Red fluorescence was also monitored in a plate-reader fluorometer, Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Labsystem, Helsinki, Finland). To measure ROS production in islets, groups of 20–30 islets were incubated in HKRB with 2.2 mm glucose in the presence of CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen). Green fluorescence derived from ROS generation was monitored in a plate-reader fluorometer. Mitochondria were isolated as described (27Yano M. Hoogenraad N. Terada K. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7205-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Yano M. Terada K. Gotoh T. Mori M. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3767-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Pancreas tissues were isolated and minced in mitochondria isolation buffer (3 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EGTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Samples were disrupted using a tissue grinder (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan), and homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet. The pellet was suspended in mitochondria isolation buffer and purified by consecutive centrifugations (500 × g for 5 min twice to recover the supernatant and at 10,000 × g three times to recover the pellet). All procedures were performed under ice-cold conditions. Total lipids from islets or pancreas mitochondria from wild-type and SMS1-KO mice were extracted with 1 ml methanol for 1 h at room temperature. In this process, 1 nmol of sphingomyelin (d18:1/12:0) and ceramide (d18:1/12:0) were added as internal standards. Extracts were centrifuged at 10000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected and re-dissolved with chloroform:methanol (2:1; v/v) after drying under a gentle nitrogen stream. LC/ESI-MS analysis was performed using a quadrapole/time of flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-TOF micro) with an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The scan range was set at m/z 200–1100 and scan duration of MS and MS/MS at 0.5 s in negative ion mode (29Houjou T. Yamatani K. Imagawa M. Shimizu T. Taguchi R. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 2005; 19: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Ikeda K. Oike Y. Shimizu T. Taguchi R. J. Chromatogr. B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2009; 877: 2639-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The capillary voltage was set at 2.5 kV, cone voltage at −30 V and collision energy for MS/MS analysis at −30 V. Reverse-phased LC separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.0 × 150 mm i.d., Waters Corporation) at 45 °C. 2 μl of total lipids normalized to protein content were individually injected. The mobile phase was acetonitrile/methanol/water (19/19/2) (0.1% formic acid + 0.028% ammonia) (A), and isopropanol (0.1% formic acid + 0.028% ammonia) (B), and the composition was produced by mixing these solvents. The gradient consisted of holding in (A/B: 90/10) solvent for 7.5 min, and then linearly converting to solvent (A/B: 70/30) for 32.5 min and finally converting to solvent (A/B: 40/60) for 50 min. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 40–50 μl/min. MS data processing was applied using Mass++ software to detect each chromatogram peak with quantitative accuracy. Isolated islets were solubilized in PBS containing 1% SDS. Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed with ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, England). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-Hsc70 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-Complex I NDUFA9 (αs9) antibody (Invitrogen), anti-Complex II 70 kDa subunit (Fp) antibody (Invitrogen), or anti-Complex III subunit core 2 (QCR2) antibody (Invitrogen). Data were analyzed using Student's t test and reported as means ± S.E., unless stated. Indicated significance levels are: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. To analyze the effect of SMS1 ablation in vivo, we generated SMS1-null (SMS1-KO) mice (Fig. 1). Exon 2 of SMS1 gene, which encodes the translation initiation codon, the SAM domain and two transmembrane regions, was replaced with a neo cassette (Fig. 1A). The allele, designated SMS1-KO, was established and confirmed by LA-PCR (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the region corresponding to exon 2 in SMS1 mRNA derived from SMS1-KO mice was confirmed by northern-blot analysis (Fig. 1C). To confirm that this SMS1-KO construct, which may express N-terminal deletion mutant of SMS1 (SMS1Δex2), does not exhibit sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity, we measured SMS activity of SMS1Δex2 in SMS activity null cells (Fig. 1D). Although wild-type SMS1 produce a significant amount of sphingomyelin (SM) derivative (NDB-SM), SMS1Δex2 did not, suggesting that SMS1Δex2 has no SMS activity. Thus, we concluded that the activity of SMS1 was completely disrupted in SMS1-KO mice used in this study. Conventionally, we used PCR technique to distinguish wild-type, heterozygous, and KO mice (Fig. 1E). We initially observed growth of SMS1-KO mice. They showed moderate neonatal lethality with half of mice dead by 10 weeks (Fig. 2A), suggesting that SMS1 gene is important for normal growth of mice. And, we found that the body weight of SMS1-KO mice was reduced (Fig. 2B). To investigate the reason, we anatomically analyzed and found that the mass of white adipose tissue (WAT) was significantly reduced (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that SMS1-KO mice might have metabolic deficiency. Then, we next examined the possibility whether blood glucose homeostasis was affected by SMS1 ablation. Blood tests indicated that SMS1-KO mice exhibited hyperglycemia after 16 h of fasting, suggesting impaired glucose homeostasis (Fig. 2D). Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) further indicated that glucose uptake of SMS1-KO mice was impaired (Fig. 2E). Analysis of insulin in serum samples obtained from GTTs showed that glucose-induced insulin release was significantly reduced in SMS1-KO mice (Fig. 2F). However, SMS1-KO mice exhibited higher insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type mice based on insulin tolerance tests (ITT) (Fig. 2G). Therefore, we concluded that lower glucose uptake seen in SMS1-KO mice was due to impaired insulin secretion. In the following experiments, we focused on the analysis to reveal the reason why insulin secretion was reduced in SMS1-KO mice. Because SMS1 ablation will enhance accumulation of ceramide, an enzymatic substrate of SMS1, we first measured the amount of sphingolipid species in SMS1-KO islets by LC/ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 3, A–C). As expected, the amount of sphingomyelin species was reduced (Fig. 3A), whereas the amount of ceramide species was increased in SMS1-KO islets (Fig. 3B). The amount of phosphatidylcholine, another substrate of SMS1, seemed to be a little increased (about 1.2-fold), but the increment was not significant (data not shown). The amount of GM3, a glycosphingolipid, was also increased (Fig. 3C), suggesting that accumulated ceramide species were alternatively metabolized into glycosphingolipid species. However, we could not find any significant change of expression of mRNAs for sphingolipid metabolisms (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1). Because ceramide reportedly promotes cell death (31Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 32Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), we estimated that loss of insulin secretion in SMS1-KO mice might be attributable to ceramide-induced death of pancreatic β-cells. To test this possibility, we examined expression of mRNAs related to apoptosis. However, no significant changes were observed in expression of apoptosis-inducing factors (Bax and CHOP) or apoptosis-inhibiting factors (Bip, Bcl-2, Bcl-X and Mcl-1) (Fig. 3E and supplemental Table S1). In addition, we observed no difference in islet size (Fig. 3F), density (Fig. 3G), or morphology (Fig. 3, H and I). These results suggest that pancreatic β-cell death does not underlie the insulin secretion deficiency seen in SMS1-KO mice. To determine the primary cause of insulin secretion deficiency seen in SMS1-KO mice, we asked whether insulin secretion was reduced in SMS1 deficient islets. First, by an ELISA, we confirmed that the total amount of insulin in isolated SMS1-KO islets was equivalent to that seen in wild-type islets (Fig. 4A). When islets were incubated under high glucose (22 mm) conditions, SMS1-KO islets released only low levels of insulin, whereas wild-type islets released large amounts (Fig. 4B). Thus, we concluded that insulin secretion deficiency observed in SMS1-KO mice was attributed to insulin secretion deficiency of pancreatic β-cells. Because SMS1 resides in the Golgi complex, we hypothesized that other intracellular organelles might be damaged by SMS1 deletion. Indeed, intracellular levels of ceramide in ER and mitochondria are reportedly increased when the ceramide transfer protein, CERT, is ablated (17Wang X. Rao R.P. Kosakowska-Cholody T. Masood M.A. Southon E. Zhang H. Berthet C. Nagashim K. Veenstra T.K. Tessarollo L. Acharya U. Acharya J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Then, we focused in particular on the effect of SMS1 loss on mitochondria, because mitochondria are important for insulin secretion (33Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 34Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were highly purified from pancreas (supplemental Fig. S2). Analysis using LC/ESI-MS revealed that the amounts of some kinds of sphingomyelin species were reduced in pancreatic mitochondria of SMS1-KO mice (Fig. 4C), whereas some kinds of ceramide species were increased (Fig. 4D), suggesting that SMS1-KO mitochondria might exhibit dysfunction. Because mitochondrial activation and up-regulated ATP synthesis are key steps in insulin secretion (33Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 34Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we analyzed islet ATP content (Fig. 4E). When islets were incubated in low glucose (2.2 mm) condition, no significant difference in ATP content was observed between wild-type and SMS1-KO islets. However, when islets were incubated in high glucose (22 mm) condition, SMS1-KO islets exhibited significantly lower ATP con"

We performed a genome-wide association study using pooled DNA from 436 individuals with hypospadias (cases) and 494 controls of European descent and selected the highest ranked SNPs for individual genotyping in the discovery sample, an additional Dutch sample of 133 cases and their parents, and a Swedish series of 266 cases and 402 controls. Individual genotyping of two SNPs (rs1934179 and rs7063116) in DGKK, encoding diacylglycerol kinase κ, produced compelling evidence for association with hypospadias in the discovery sample (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, P = 2.5 × 10⁻¹¹ and OR = 2.3, P = 2.9 × 10⁻⁹, respectively) and in the Dutch (OR = 3.9, P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁵ and OR = 3.8, P = 3.4 × 10⁻⁵) and Swedish (OR = 2.5, P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸ and OR = 2.2, P = 2.7 × 10⁻⁶) replication samples. Expression studies showed expression of DGKK in preputial tissue of cases and controls, which was lower in carriers of the risk allele of rs1934179 (P = 0.047).

This finding suggests that evolution of complex I via addition of supernumerary or “accessory” subunits started before the original endosymbiotic event that led to the creation of the eukaryotic cell. It also provides further confirmation that α-proteobacteria are the closest extant relatives of mitochondria. IntroductionMost eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, which are thought to be the remnants of an ancient endosymbiotic event about 1.5–2 billion years ago, when a respiring bacterium entered a host proto-eukaryotic cell (1Andersson S.G. Kurland C.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Margulis L. Origin of Eukaryotic Cells. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1970Google Scholar, 3John P. Whatley F.R. Nature. 1975; 254: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons suggest that the closest modern relatives of the proto-mitochondrion are α-proteobacteria, Gram-negative bacteria that can exist as a free-living bacteria, although the majority of members of this group live as symbionts or parasites of plants and animals (4Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Members of the rickettsial subdivision of the α-proteobacteria, a group of intracellular parasites, are considered to be the closest known eubacterial relatives of mitochondria (5Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A. Andersson J.O. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Alsmark U.C. Podowski R.M. Näslund A.K. Eriksson A.S. Winkler H.H. Kurland C.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic evidence suggests that all mitochondrial genomes descended from a common ancestor, implying that mitochondria originated only once in evolution (4Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Energy production in the form of ATP is the major mitochondrial function and can be traced directly to the α-proteobacterial ancestor. The respiratory chain complexes of these bacteria are thus most closely related to the mitochondrial enzymes.Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first and the largest component of the respiratory chain, catalyzing transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, coupled to the translocation of four protons (current consensus value) across the membrane (6Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 7Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 8Sazanov L.A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In doing so, it provides about 40% of the proton-motive force used by ATP synthase for the generation of ATP. Because of its central role in bioenergetics and the high energy demand in neuronal tissues, complex I is implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases and possibly in aging (11Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). Bacterial complex I resides in the plasma membrane and is thought to consist of a minimal set of 14 different subunits of about 550 kDa in total. One known exception is complex I from Thermus thermophilus, which contains an additional frataxin-like subunit Nqo15 (12Hinchliffe P. Carroll J. Sazanov L.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 14 “core” subunits are also present in the mitochondrial enzyme, which resides in the inner membrane and contains up to 31 additional subunits, bringing the total molecular mass to about 1 MDa (13Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32724-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The core subunits are well conserved and contain all the redox centers of the complex (flavin mononucleotide and 8–9 Fe-S clusters). Furthermore, bacterial and mitochondrial enzymes have a similar distinctive L-shape and catalyze the same reaction. Therefore, bacterial complex I is a valid “minimal” model of the mitochondrial enzyme. Seven of the core subunits are hydrophilic and form the peripheral arm of the complex, containing all the redox centers, which are involved in the electron transfer from NADH to quinone. The other seven core subunits are highly hydrophobic and form the membrane arm of the enzyme, containing proton-translocating machinery. We have determined the crystal structures of both domains separately, as well as that of the entire complex (at the backbone level for the membrane domain), suggesting the likely mechanisms for electron transfer and proton translocation (14Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 15Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 29773-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The additional, so-called “supernumerary” or “accessory,” subunits are generally thought to have been acquired by complex I during the evolution of eukaryotes (17Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Their specific roles are not clear but are likely to include assistance in the assembly, stability, and regulation of the complex. Some supernumerary subunits may confer additional functions to the mitochondrial enzyme; the 39-kDa subunit (bovine nomenclature is used here for these subunits) contains tightly bound NADPH and is homologous to short chain dehydrogenases (18Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 105-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar); the SDAP subunit is homologous to acyl-carrier proteins, and subunit B16.6 is identical to GRIM-19, an apoptosis-inducing factor (6Walker J.E.

Previous bioinformatic analyses identified a group of 16 “extra” subunits and two assembly factors that are common to all eukaryotic species, likely representing supernumerary subunits of a primitive ancient eukaryotic complex I (20Gabaldón T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). After the diversification of eukaryotes, complex I in plants, fungi, and metazoans acquired different sets of yet more subunits. It was also noted that α-proteobacterial genomes contain proteins that are homologous to five supernumerary subunits (20Gabaldón T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, they were not expected to be incorporated into complex I, as, in the sequenced genomes, they never occur in operons with complex I proteins (20Gabaldón T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Without direct characterization of the enzyme, it is not possible to establish whether these proteins were already components of complex I in the proto-mitochondrion or were recruited later in evolution into a primitive eukaryotic complex I.Paracoccus denitrificans is a well characterized model α-proteobacterial soil organism with a fully sequenced genome (strain Pd 1222, img.jgi.doe.gov). Complex I from this species is relatively well studied in terms of activity, subunit topology and proximity, characteristics of Fe-S clusters and mutagenesis (9Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Yagi T. Yano T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the intact complex was never purified previously due to its apparent fragility upon solubilization (22Yagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Dupuis A. Chevallet M. Darrouzet E. Duborjal H. Lunardi J. Issartel J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the nqo operon, encoding core complex I subunits Nqo1–14, also revealed the presence of six unidentified reading frames within the operon (24Xu X. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, their putative products, if any, are not related to known complex I subunits and were not expected to form part of the complex (23Dupuis A. Chevallet M. Darrouzet E. Duborjal H. Lunardi J. Issartel J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Xu X. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clearly, to establish subunit composition, the intact complex has to be purified. One of the reasons to study P. denitrificans complex I is its high sequence similarity to the mammalian enzyme, which makes it a very good bacterial model to study, for example, pathological mutations in human complex I. Indeed, sequence identities to the human enzyme for many hydrophilic subunits are in the range of 60–70% for complex I from P. denitrificans but are only 30–40% for Escherichia coli or T. thermophilus (Table 1).TABLE 1Sequence comparisons of the 14 core complex I subunits from different speciesDomainSubunitBovineP. denitrificansT. thermophilusE. coli%%%%Dehydrogenase51 kDa/Nqo197 (99)64 (77)43 (57)38 (56)24 kDa/Nqo296 (98)36 (52)33 (54)34 (56)75 kDa/Nqo397 (99)52 (64)23 (39)16 (29)49 kDa/Nqo495 (99)59 (77)44 (64)27 (42)30 kDa/Nqo589 (94)51 (66)25 (38)8 (15)ConnectingPSST/Nqo686 (91)69 (81)47 (67)36 (51)TYKY/Nqo993 (95)72 (82)31 (43)29 (41)ND3/Nqo774 (83)28 (50)21 (41)22 (41)MembraneND1/Nqo878 (88)35 (54)35 (51)35 (56)ND6/Nqo1062 (75)17 (33)15 (31)17 (36)ND4L/Nqo1173 (90)24 (49)23 (42)19 (46)ND5/Nqo1269 (81)28 (41)31 (46)28 (45)ND4/Nqo1374 (85)26 (47)24 (40)26 (44)ND2/Nqo1463 (81)14 (29)19 (31)16 (32) Open table in a new tab Here, we report the first purification and characterization of the intact complex I from P. denitrificans.

Despite many attempts by several research groups, intact proteobacterial complex I has not been isolated previously. The crucial parameters that allowed purification were appropriate choice of pH, the presence of glycerol throughout the procedure, and addition of divalent cations in relatively high concentrations.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and T. thermophilus (15Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) in a concentration of about 2 mm, the effect appears to be more pronounced in P. denitrificans, and 10 mm CaCl2 was required for optimal stability.The preparation shows robust NADH:decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, which is inhibited by piericidin-A and rotenone, classical indicators of complex I integrity. Single particle analysis of EM images produced a familiar L-shaped molecule, as observed for complexes I from all species studied. The features of the EM reconstruction are relatively well defined, and the enzyme is stable over several days, indicating that the preparation is likely to be stable enough for crystallization trials and further structural studies. All 14 core subunits of complex I, coded in the nqo operon, were identified in the preparation, further confirming the purification of intact enzyme.The most unexpected result of this work is that complex I from P. denitrificans was found to consist of 17 subunits, containing 3 supernumerary subunits in addition to the 14 expected core subunits. These subunits are clearly homologous to the bovine complex I subunits B17.2 (PdN7BM), AQDQ (PdNUYM), and 13 kDa (PdNUMM) (Table 6). The sequence identity (∼30–35%) is lower than for most hydrophilic core subunits, but it is higher than for most membrane subunits. Database comparisons with these subunits using BLASTP show, as expected, the highest similarity scores for homologous proteins from various α-proteobacteria, such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Table 6). These are followed by homologous complex I subunits from eukaryotes, including mammals, plants, and fungi. However, there is no strict distinction in the degree of similarity between α-proteobacteria and eukaryotes, as some α-proteobacterial proteins (including NUMM and N7BM homologues from members of the rickettsial subdivision) show lower similarity scores to P. denitrificans subunits than some eukaryotes. Subunits from fungi show lower similarity than those from animals (Table 6). Furthermore, proteins closely related to these three subunits were not found in any bacteria other than α-proteobacteria.TABLE 6Sequence comparisons of the three novel supernumerary subunits of complex I from P. denitrificans with other speciesP. denitrificansR. sphaeroidesHumanBovineYarrowia lipolyticaNeurospora crassa%%%%%PdNUMM (13 kDa) gi 11938459156 (73)27 (44)29 (44)21 (35)24 (37)PdNUYM (AQDQ) gi 11938405464 (77)35 (55)35 (54)29 (48)12 (25)PdN7BM (B17.2) gi 11938401269 (81)31 (45)31 (45)23 (37)21 (34) Open table in a new tab These findings suggest that a precursor of eukaryotic complex I, composed of at least 17 subunits, is present in modern α-proteobacteria. It was noted previously that sequences coding for N7BM, NUYM, and NUMM homologues, as well as for homologues of ACPM (bovine SDAP) and NUEM (39 kDa) subunits of complex I, are present in the α-proteobacterial genomes (20Gabaldón T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It was not known, however, whether they actually became incorporated into complex I. The genomic context did not hint at their association with the complex because these genes never occur in the same operon as core subunits (20Gabaldón T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that three of these proteins form part of complex I in P. denitrificans. All three subunits are encoded in different parts of chromosome 1, far separated from the nqo operon. It cannot be excluded that in α-proteobacteria most closely related to eukaryotes, such as Rickettsia prowazekii (5Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A. Andersson J.O. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Alsmark U.C. Podowski R.M. Näslund A.K. Eriksson A.S. Winkler H.H. Kurland C.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar), the ACPM and NUEM homologues are also incorporated into complex I.The function of supernumerary subunits in complex I has not been established, apart from some similarities to proteins of known function, noted in the Introduction. The three subunits that we have identified in P. denitrificans enzyme are hydrophilic and are found in the peripheral arm of the bovine complex I (45Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 46Hirst J. Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Because of the small size of the subunits, a comparison of our EM reconstruction to other bacterial species, lacking these subunits, is not likely to reveal their exact location. It cannot be excluded that these three subunits, incorporated together into complex I, contact each other and form a subdomain within the complex. It remains to be established whether the apparent higher stability of the complex (as compared with the E. coli enzyme) is due to the presence of supernumerary subunits or due to intrinsic properties of the core subunits.Subunit B17.2 is one of five complex I subunits identified with nitrated tyrosine residues when mitochondria are incubated with peroxynitrite (47Murray J. Taylor S.W. Zhang B. Ghosh S.S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37223-37230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Subunit AQDQ was suggested to be phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner (48Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17578-17582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the phosphorylated subunit was identified subsequently as ESSS (49Chen R. Fearnley I.M. Peak-Chew S.Y. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26036-26045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Interestingly, subunit PdNUMM (13-kDa analogue) is listed in NCBI as a member of the zf-CHCC (PF10276 in Pfam data base) superfamily of small zinc finger proteins. The members of this superfamily contain a zinc finger motif CX8–9HX14–15CX2C, likely to bind zinc or other metals, fully conserved in homologues of 13-kDa subunit from all species, including human. This superfamily belongs to the rubredoxin clan (CL0045 in Pfam data base), which also includes subunit Vb of bovine cytochrome c oxidase. This small intramembranous subunit coordinates tightly bound zinc atom by four cysteines from its zinc finger motif, forming a β-barrel structure (50Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). This compact conformation did not suggest any specific physiological role for the bound zinc and zinc finger domain.Bovine complex I also contains one tightly bound zinc atom (39Shinzawa-Itoh K. Seiyama J. Terada H. Nakatsubo R. Naoki K. Nakashima Y. Yoshikawa S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), apparently coordinated by Cys and His residues (51Giachini L. Francia F. Boscherini F. Pacelli C. Cocco T. Papa S. Venturoli G. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5645-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We have not identified any bound zinc atoms in the structure of the core hydrophilic subunits of complex I from T. thermophilus (14Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 16Berrisford J.M. Sazanov L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29773-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Several NMR structures of close α-proteobacterial homologues of PdNUMM protein were determined by the Northeast Structural Genomics consortium. These are from R. sphaeroides (PDB 2JVM), Silicibacter pomeroyi (PDB 2JRR), and with the bound zinc atom from Bartonella henselae (PDB 2JZ8). Because this protein can now be assigned as a component of complex I, these structures represent only the second known structure of the supernumerary subunit in complex I (the other being the NMR structure of subunit B8 (52Brockmann C. Diehl A. Rehbein K. Strauss H. Schmieder P. Korn B. Kühne R. Oschkinat H. Structure. 2004; 12: 1645-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). In PDB 2JZ8, the zinc atom is coordinated by the three Cys and one His residue from the conserved zinc finger motif, in a similar conformation to oxidase subunit Vb. Therefore, it is likely that tightly bound zinc found in bovine complex I is coordinated by the 13-kDa subunit. Our MS data, mentioned above, show that upon protein denaturation and tryptic digestion, two neighboring coordinating cysteines are likely to make a disulfide bridge.Thus, it appears that both complexes I and IV of the respiratory chain contain on their matrix side subunits with a similar zinc-coordinating fold. Zinc inhibits complex I in relatively high concentrations (53Sharpley M.S. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a process that is not likely to involve the tightly bound zinc atom, as it remains bound in the presence of EDTA (39Shinzawa-Itoh K. Seiyama J. Terada H. Nakatsubo R. Naoki K. Nakashima Y. Yoshikawa S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether the 13-kDa subunit, if it indeed coordinates zinc, has any regulatory role.In summary, our findings suggest that the evolution of the respiratory complex I by the addition of supernumerary subunits began before the original symbiotic event and has not happened exclusively within eukaryotic lineages, as has been thought previously. Three of these subunits are found in complex I from P. denitrificans, from five possible candidates present in α-proteobacterial genomes. One reason why these subunits were never incorporated into nqo operons could be that they perform additional functions, not as part of complex I. Our findings also confirm that α-proteobacteria are the closest extant relatives of the proto-mitochondrion, in agreement with the endosymbiotic theory. IntroductionMost eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, which are thought to be the remnants of an ancient endosymbiotic event about 1.5–2 billion years ago, when a respiring bacterium entered a host proto-eukaryotic cell (1Andersson S.G. Kurland C.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Margulis L. Origin of Eukaryotic Cells. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1970Google Scholar, 3John P. Whatley F.R. Nature. 1975; 254: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons suggest that the closest modern relatives of the proto-mitochondrion are α-proteobacteria, Gram-negative bacteria that can exist as a free-living bacteria, although the majority of members of this group live as symbionts or parasites of plants and animals (4Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Members of the rickettsial subdivision of the α-proteobacteria, a group of intracellular parasites, are considered to be the closest known eubacterial relatives of mitochondria (5Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A. Andersson J.O. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Alsmark U.C. Podowski R.M. Näslund A.K. Eriksson A.S. Winkler H.H. Kurland C.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic evidence suggests that all mitochondrial genomes descended from a common ancestor, implying that mitochondria originated only once in evolution (4Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Energy production in the form of ATP is the major mitochondrial function and can be traced directly to the α-proteobacterial ancestor. The respiratory chain complexes of these bacteria are thus most closely related to the mitochondrial enzymes.Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first and the largest component of the respiratory chain, catalyzing transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, coupled to the translocation of four protons (current consensus value) across the membrane (6Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 7Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 8Sazanov L.A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In doing so, it provides about 40% of the proton-motive force used by ATP synthase for the generation of ATP. Because of its central role in bioenergetics and the high energy demand in neuronal tissues, complex I is implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases and possibly in aging (11Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). Bacterial complex I resides in the plasma membrane and is thought to consist of a minimal set of 14 different subunits of about 550 kDa in total. One known exception is complex I from Thermus thermophilus, which contains an additional frataxin-like subunit Nqo15 (12Hinchliffe P. Carroll J. Sazanov L.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 14 “core” subunits are also present in the mitochondrial enzyme, which resides in the inner membrane and contains up to 31 additional subunits, bringing the total molecular mass to about 1 MDa (13Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32724-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The core subunits are well conserved and contain all the redox centers of the complex (flavin mononucleotide and 8–9 Fe-S clusters). Furthermore, bacterial and mitochondrial enzymes have a similar distinctive L-shape and catalyze the same reaction. Therefore, bacterial complex I is a valid “minimal” model of the mitochondrial enzyme. Seven of the core subunits are hydrophilic and form the peripheral arm of the complex, containing all the redox centers, which are involved in the electron transfer from NADH to quinone. The other seven core subunits are highly hydrophobic and form the membrane arm of the enzyme, containing proton-translocating machinery. We have determined the crystal structures of both domains separately, as well as that of the entire complex (at the backbone level for the membrane domain), suggesting the likely mechanisms for electron transfer and proton translocation (14Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 15Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 29773-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The additional, so-called “supernumerary” or “accessory,” subunits are generally thought to have been acquired by complex I during the evolution of eukaryotes (17Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Their specific roles are not clear but are likely to include assistance in the assembly, stability, and regulation of the complex. Some supernumerary subunits may confer additional functions to the mitochondrial enzyme; the 39-kDa subunit (bovine nomenclature is used here for these subunits) contains tightly bound NADPH and is homologous to short chain dehydrogenases (18Fearnley I.M.

https://openalex.org/W2007994150,"The construction of synthetic biological systems involving millions of nucleotides is limited by the lack of high-quality synthetic DNA. Consequently, the field requires advances in the accuracy and scale of chemical DNA synthesis and in the processing of longer DNA assembled from short fragments. Here we describe a highly parallel and miniaturized method, called megacloning, for obtaining high-quality DNA by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology as a preparative tool. We demonstrate our method by processing both chemically synthesized and microarray-derived DNA oligonucleotides with a robotic system for imaging and picking beads directly off of a high-throughput pyrosequencing platform. The method can reduce error rates by a factor of 500 compared to the starting oligonucleotide pool generated by microarray. We use DNA obtained by megacloning to assemble synthetic genes. In principle, millions of DNA fragments can be sequenced, characterized and sorted in a single megacloner run, enabling constructive biology up to the megabase scale."

Despite considerable efforts, the interactions between HPV and the heparan sulfate oligosaccharides that initiate infection are poorly understood. Here, we determined the co-crystal structure of HPV16 and HPV18 capsids bound to oligomeric heparin. We found that the highly negatively charged heparin fragment binds to multiple locations on the capsid surface mainly through charge-charge interactions. On the basis of the structure, we generated mutant virus to disrupt the interactions with heparin. ECM and cell binding assays combined with infectivity measurements showed that substitution of key HPV residues involved in binding the oligosaccharide receptor decreased virus binding to the ECM and cell surface and/or reduced viral infectivity. The results of the mutational and functional analyses provide evidence supporting the biological relevance of the molecular interactions of the viral capsid with the heparin fragment observed in the crystal structure. The assembly-deficient mutants of HPV16 L1 and HPV18 L1 were cloned and purified as described by Bishop et al. (13Bishop B. Dasgupta J. Chen X.S. Virol.

Briefly, the L1 proteins were expressed as GST-L1 fusion proteins in Escherichia coli using 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction overnight at room temperature. After cell lysis by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm PMSF), urea (ultrapure grade) was slowly added to the lysate to a final concentration of 3.0 m. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking and then dialyzed against three changes of buffer over an 18-h period at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 75 min, the supernatant was passed through a glutathione affinity column to bind GST-L1 fusion proteins. After cleaving L1 from the GST fusion protein by thrombin, the free L1 pentamer was purified by Superdex 200 (60/16 column) size-exclusion chromatography. The purified L1 pentamers of HPV16 and HPV18 were used for co-crystallization with size-defined heparin oligosaccharides of 8 and 10 monosaccharide units (8- and 10-mers, respectively). The size-defined oligosaccharides were prepared from bovine lung heparin by partial deamination at pH 1.5 for 3 h on ice, followed by reduction with NaBH4 for 2 h at room temperature and separation on a P-10 column essentially as described (15Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Heparin oligosaccharides were quantified by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using the meta-hydroxydiphenyl method with glucuronic acid as a standard and converted by an arbitrary factor of 3 to saccharide mass (16Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). Purified L1 pentamers of HPV16 and HPV18 were concentrated to 8–10 mg/ml in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. L1 pentamers and purified heparin oligosaccharides were mixed at a 1:10 molar ratio. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 18 °C before setting up crystallization trays. Crystallization trials were given using NeXtal crystallization screens. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, followed by incubation at 18 °C for 10–21 days in the presence of only the 10-mer heparin oligosaccharide for both HPV16 and HPV18 capsids under the crystallization conditions tested. Crystals of HPV16 and HPV18 capsids bound to the heparin oligosaccharide were obtained under different buffer conditions.

The electron density maps were well featured because of the powerful phase improvement method of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (5-fold for the HPV16-heparin complex and 15-fold for the HPV18-heparin complex) used at the early stages of the refinement and model building of the protein part to improve the phases. The heparin oligosaccharides were built into the electron density calculated from the improved L1 model. The heparin coordinate (Protein Data Bank code 2AXM (20DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I.

A final round of refinement resulted in good statistics, as shown in Table 1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PfuUltra hotstart polymerase (Stratagene). Introduction of mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Pseudoviruses harboring pEGFP were generated using the 293TT cell line as described (21Buck C.B. Pastrana D.V. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Particles were characterized by L1- and L2-specific Western blotting, by real-time PCR, and by ELISA using anti-HPV16 virus-like particle (VLP) polyclonal and monoclonal antisera. For infection assays, identical amounts of particles were used, yielding up to 30% infection rates for the WT (1 × 107 pseudoviral genome equivalents/well). Where indicated, heparin chains (>15 kDa) or size-defined fragments were added to WT HPV16 pseudovirus prior to infection of 293TT cells. Infection of 293TT cells was monitored by flow cytometry 72 h post-infection. Infection of HaCaT cells was measured by visually counting GFP-expressing cells 72 h post-infection. Infectivity data given were based on at least four different virus preparations with three replicates each. For cell and ECM binding assays, HaCaT cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days. For ECM binding assays, cells were completely dislodged and removed by EDTA (0.5 mm in Dulbecco's PBS). The ECM deposited onto the glass slide was incubated with rabbit anti-laminin 5 antibody (Abcam ab14509) for 30 min at 37 °C. Preincubation with anti-laminin 5 antisera was used to prevent binding to laminin 5. In addition, it was used to identify ECM depositions for the subsequent quantitative analysis. Pseudovirions (1 × 107 pseudoviral genome equivalents/well) were added in complete DMEM. After 1 h of binding at 37 °C, unbound particles were washed out with PBS, and HPV16-specific monoclonal antibody H16.56E was used to detect bound pseudovirions. For cell binding assays, cells were incubated with anti-laminin 5 antisera, and HPV16 pseudovirions were subsequently added for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and primary antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor-labeled goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Images were captured by confocal microscopy (Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope). Within individual experiments, the same microscope settings and exposure times were used. For quantification of pixel number and area size, the LSM server software provided with the confocal microscope was used. The ability of particles to bind to the ECM was expressed as the number of pixels of capsid-specific signal in the area normalized to laminin 5. Binding to the cell was measured based on projections of three z-stacks for one sample and expressed as the number of pixels of capsid-specific signal normalized to phalloidin staining. The average region of interest analyzed was not significantly different among groups. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t test. Heparin (50 μg/ml) dissolved in double-distilled H2O was coated onto heparin glycosaminoglycan binding plates (Iduron, Manchester, United Kingdom) overnight in the dark at room temperature, washed, and blocked with PBS and 1% BSA. Equal amounts of the indicated particles diluted in PBS and 1% BSA were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, rabbit polyclonal antiserum K75 (1:5000) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound antibody was subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antisera (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. The reaction was stopped with 1 n HCl, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. HPV VLPs or pseudovirions can be assembled from pentameric L1 capsids in vivo or in vitro (22Hagensee M.E. Yaegashi N.

Crystal structural studies showed that the surface structural features of the pentameric L1 units are identical to those of the pentamers in the assembled small VLPs (14Bishop B. Dasgupta J. Klein M.

These structural similarities led us to use the pentamer for co-crystallization with a size-defined heparin oligosaccharide to study HPV-receptor interactions presented in this work. We determined the crystal structures of HPV16 and HPV18 L1 capsids in complex with heparin oligosaccharide at resolutions of 2.8 Å for HPV16 (Fig. 1, a–c, and Table 1) and 3.4 Å for HPV18 (Fig. 1, d–f, and Table 1). The pentameric L1 capsids of HPV16 and HPV18 in complex with heparin oligosaccharide have the same surface loop conformation as heparin-free capsids (14Bishop B. Dasgupta J. Klein M. Garcea R.L.

Most of the heparin fragments built in the model were shorter than the full 10-sugar residues used for the crystallization. This is possibly due to the flexibility of the heparin chain such that only those residues interacting with the HPV capsid have defined electron density and the rest of the fragment is invisible. All of the heparin molecules were found to bind only to the outer surface of the pentameric L1 capsid in both HPV types, even though the interior sides are also accessible for heparin molecules. One striking feature observed in these co-crystal structures is that there are multiple sites with different sets of residues on the surface of L1 capsids to bind the heparin fragment for both HPV16 (Fig. 1, a–c) and HPV18 (Fig. 1, d–f). All of the bound heparin fragments are located primarily on the top outer rim or the lateral surface (side wall) of the viral capsid for both viruses (Fig. 1, a–f). On the side wall, extended heparin oligosaccharide chains bind to the L1 capsids from the top to the base of the pentamer (Fig. 1, c and f). The structures show no heparin molecule binding near the top surface area around the pentameric central hole for both HPV16 (Fig. 1a) and HPV18 (Fig. 1d), where highly negatively charged surface areas are located. For both HPV16 and HPV18, all heparin-binding sites are conformational, consisting of residues scattered on more than one surface loop and more than one subunit on the primary sequences. They come together in the three-dimensional structure to form the binding patches. The surface loops of the pentameric L1 capsid participating in binding heparin are colored in Fig. 2a, all of which are on the outer rim of the pentamer, away from the pentameric hole. For HPV16, the four different types of binding modes for the heparin oligosaccharides are shown in Fig. 2 (b–e), with two located on the top rim (b and c) and two on the side wall (d and e) of the pentameric capsid. For the two binding sites on the top rim of the capsid, one is composed of residues from FG/HI-loops of two neighboring monomers (Lys-278, Thr-266, Asn-285, and Lys-361) (Fig. 2b), and the other is composed of residues from FG/HI/BC-loops of two monomers (Lys-356, Thr-358, Thr-266, Lys-54, and Asn-56) (Fig. 2c). For the two types of binding sites on the side wall, the heparin fragments bind almost vertically (Fig. 2, d and e). Both start on the BC-loop (Asn-57 and Lys-59) and reach down to the base of the pentamer, where they interact with residues on the α4-loop (Lys-443 or Asn-450/Lys-452). The residues participating in binding the heparin fragment are either positively charged lysines (Lys-54, Lys-59, Lys-278, Lys-356, and Lys-361) that are conserved between HPV16 and HPV18 or the less conserved polar residues Asn, Gln, and Thr (such as Asn-57, Gln-194, and Thr-358). Through these positively charged lysines or other polar residues, the viral capsid forms charge-charge interactions and polar interactions (hydrogen bonds) with the negatively charged heparin molecule. The overall heparin-binding mode of the HPV18 capsid is similar to that of HPV16, involving the same surface loops as shown in Fig. 2a, even though the residues may differ. Four different types of binding sites for the heparin oligosaccharides are located on similar locations on the surface of the viral capsid (Fig. 3, a–d). Two of the binding sites are located on the top rim, interacting with residues either from FG/HI-loops (Fig. 3a) or from HI/EF-loops coming from two neighboring subunits (Fig. 3b). The two types of heparin-binding sites, located on the side wall of the pentameric capsid, interact with EF- or BC/EF-loops on the top part of the capsid and with the α4-loop (Lys-439–Lys-453) near the bottom of the capsid (Fig. 3, c and d). Similar to HPV16, the residues of HPV18 interacting with the heparin fragment are also charged residues and polar residues on these surface loops (Fig. 1g). To verify the biological relevance of the interactions of the viral capsid with heparin observed in the crystal structure, we generated virus mutants with Ala mutations of the key residues of HPV16 L1 involved in heparin binding. We used these mutant viruses to examine ECM binding, cell binding, and infectivity (Table 2). For these studies, we utilized the pseudovirus system, which is well accepted for studying infectious entry of HPV. It uses 293TT cells harboring high copy numbers of a marker plasmid to express capsid proteins, which self-assemble and encapsidate the plasmid (21Buck C.B. Pastrana D.V. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Summary of cell binding and infectivity assays of mutant HPV16 virusECM bindingCell bindingInfectivity293TTHaCaTWT100 (±19.8)100 (±39.4)100 (±2.0)100 (±14.7)Lys-278/Lys-3614.3 (±2.0)ap < 0.0001.3.9 (±2.7)ap < 0.0001.0.3 (±0.3)ap < 0.0001.NTLys-54/Lys-35687.5 (±19.0)137.1 (±42.7)13.1 (±5.3)ap < 0.0001.12.6 (±9.2)ap < 0.0001.Lys-54/Lys-278/Lys-361/Lys-3560.6 (±0.2)ap < 0.0001.9.8 (±4.0)ap < 0.0001.0.1 (±0.2)ap < 0.0001.0 (±0)ap < 0.0001.Asn-57/Lys-59/Lys-442/Lys-443121.6 (±31.8)54.7 (±13.4)5.9 (±1.0)ap < 0.0001.16.5 (±8.2)ap < 0.0001.a p < 0.0001. Open table in a new tab Except for the Asn-450/Lys-452 mutant, all mutants were stably expressed and assembly-competent as measured by encapsidation of DNA, incorporation of L2, and the presence of conformational neutralizing epitopes (data not shown). Compared with the WT, all mutant viruses showed significantly reduced infectivity to various extents in both cell lines used (Table 2). However, only mutants with exchanges at Lys-278 and Lys-361 had strongly reduced binding to ECM (Fig. 4a and Table 2) and cells (Fig. 4b and Table 2). Cell but not ECM binding was consistently reduced for Asn-57/Lys-59/Lys-442/Lys-443, even though it did not reach significance. Similar results were obtained using a heparin-based ELISA. The Lys-278/Lys-361 mutant particles showed only residual binding, whereas WT and the other mutant particles bound efficiently (Fig. 5a). These data support the crystal structure that shows heparin binding by Lys-278/Lys-361 on the very accessible top surface of the L1 pentamer. Surprisingly, WT HPV16 pseudoviral infection was not inhibited by heparin oligomers used for the crystallization studies even when present at high concentrations, in contrast to high molecular weight heparin (Fig. 5b). However, we have previously demonstrated that oligomeric heparin binds to HPV16 VLPs (12Knappe M. Bodevin S. Selinka H.C. Spillmann D. Streeck R.E. Chen X.S. Lindahl U. Sapp M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27913-27922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results suggest that the affinity of the short oligomeric heparin binding to pseudovirions is not high enough to compete with the binding to the long chain ECM- and cell surface-resident heparan sulfate. This is in line with our unpublished observations pointing to the existence of an extended interaction of long heparin chains with all three binding sites accompanied by potential conformational changes of the L1 capsid protein. 5J. Dasgupta, M. Bienkowska-Haba, M. E. Ortega, H. D. Patel, S. Bodevin, D. Spillmann, B. Bishop, M. Sapp, and X. S. Chen, unpublished data. The results of the mutational and functional analyses provide evidence supporting the biological relevance of the molecular interactions of the viral capsid with the heparin fragment observed in the crystal structure.FIGURE 5Interaction of mutant HPV16 with heparin. a, binding of WT and mutant HPV16 pseudoparticles to heparin-coated ELISA plates. b, sensitivity of WT HPV16 pseudoviral infection to high molecular weight heparin (Hep-hmw) and 10-mer heparin (Hep-10mer) (50 μg/ml final concentration). Unlike the high molecular weight heparin, which has long oligosaccharide chains, the 10-mer heparin somehow did not block the infectivity, possibly due to the inability of the short oligomer to compete with the much longer oligosaccharides on the EMC and the cell surface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HPV16 and HPV18 use heparan sulfate chains as primary receptors for attachment to the cell surface to initiate subsequent infection. We used x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and functional assays to understand the virus-receptor interactions that are important for the infection of these tumor viruses. The co-crystal structures of the two HPV capsids revealed that heparin oligosaccharides bind to the virus surface mainly through charge-charge and polar interactions. Perhaps the highly negatively charged nature and the chain flexibility of the heparin fragment allow this molecule to bind to more than one location on the capsid surface that carries a net positive charge. The receptor-binding mode with multiple binding sites is different from the previously reported receptor binding by other viruses in which a single type of receptor “pocket” is used to bind a particular cell-surface receptor that can be either a polysaccharide or polypeptide (27Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 28Roelvink P.W. Mi Lee G. Einfeld D.A. Kovesdi I. Wickham T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1568-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This structural information may explain previous observations suggesting that different heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface are sequentially used during HPV16 infection (26Selinka H.C. Florin L. Patel H.D. Freitag K. Schmidtke M. Makarov V.A. Sapp M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10970-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All heparin-binding sites for both HPV types are conformational and are composed of residues from a combination of two or three of the BC-, EF-, FG-, or HI-loops on the top rim of the pentamer surface and the α4-loop near the base of the pentamer surface (Fig. 1, a–e). Most of the heparin-binding sites are formed by the residues coming from two or even three different subunits within a pentamer, as predicted in a previous study (29Rommel O. Dillner J. Fligge C. Bergsdorf C. Wang X. Selinka H.C. Sapp M. J. Med. Virol. 2005; 75: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite the overall similarity of heparin-binding modes between HPV16 and HPV18, there are some differences in the detailed interactions (Fig. 1, a–f). The residues involved in heparin binding for HPV16 and HPV18 are only moderately conserved (Fig. 1g). For example, among the interacting residues located on the BC-loop region, only Asn-58 and Lys-59 in HPV16 (indicated by rectangles) are absolutely conserved in HPV18 (indicated by ovals), and other residues on this loop involved in heparin binding are conserved only in the sense of being polar. Similarly, the absolutely conserved residues in both viruses that contact heparin include HPV16 Lys-278 in the FG-loop region, HPV16 Lys-361 in the HI-loop region, and HPV16 Lys-443/Lys-452 in the helix α4-loop region (Fig. 1g). Interestingly, despite the multiple site-binding mode, no heparin molecule binds to the large open area around the pentameric center of L1 capsids of both HPV types (Fig. 1, a and d). The surface electrostatics of the capsids clearly indicates that this large area for both HPV types has a high density of negative charge (negative charge colored in red in Fig. 1, a and d). This highly negatively charged area should exert repulsion to the negatively charged heparin oligosaccharides. Interestingly, we noticed that this predominantly negatively charged area around the pentameric center is also a conserved feature among other HPV types with known structures (HPV35 and HPV11) (14Bishop B. Dasgupta J. Klein M. Garcea R.L. Christensen N.D. Zhao R. Chen X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31803-31811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that this area should not bind a heparan sulfate receptor for other HPV types and may be required for other conserved functions for HPVs, such as for binding other cellular factors during viral infection. A comparison between the L1 capsid structures with and without heparin binding revealed no obvious conformational change for both HPV16 and HPV18 (data not shown), except for the slight movements of the surface loops and the residues directly involved in oligosaccharide binding. Previous indirect evidence for L1 particle conformational changes following cell attachment was reported (30Selinka H.C. Giroglou T. Nowak T. Christensen N.D. Sapp M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12961-12967Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although this issue would require further investigation, one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the longer high molecular weight heparin and/or additional cellular factors may be required for the possible induction of certain changes in L1 particle conformation. Our structure-guided mutagenesis suggests that Lys-278–Lys-361 on the top of the pentamer probably serve as the primary heparan sulfate-mediated ECM and cell attachment site. Even though the other two sites on the side of the pentamer do not seem to be essential for primary attachment, they are important for infectious entry. The side wall location of these two sites on the pentamer may mean that their interaction with heparin occurs after the primary attachment on the top, which is consistent with our unpublished observations that suggest their contribution as an extended binding site.5 There are some discrepancies between some of the binding and infectivity data presented here and the data in our initial characterization of HPV16 mutants that included lysine residues at positions 278, 356, and 361 (12Knappe M. Bodevin S. Selinka H.C. Spillmann D. Streeck R.E. Chen X.S. Lindahl U. Sapp M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27913-27922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In our initial studies, we used pseudovirus particles that were not fully matured. In contrast to mature virions, immature HPV16 pseudoviruses treated with furin convertase do not require heparan sulfate for infection (31Day P.M. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 12565-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Buck C.B. Thompson C.D. Pang Y.Y. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2839-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The presence of immature particles in the preparations used previously by Knappe et al. (12Knappe M. Bodevin S. Selinka H.C.

Chem. 2007; 282: 27913-27922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) may explain the residual infectivity observed in that study. In addition, cell binding assays were performed differently using COS-7 cells and Western blotting instead of HaCaT cells and immunofluorescence to measure particle binding. In summary, the crystal structures of the complexes of HPV16 and HPV18 capsids with the heparin fragment reveal that heparin oligosaccharides bind to multiple sites located on the readily accessible virus surface areas on the top rim and side walls of the pentameric capsids. Both HPV types interact with the highly negatively charged heparin fragment through its positively charged and polar residues, which come from two or three subunits to form conformational binding sites. Mutational and functional studies of the mutant virus based on the virus-receptor structures support the biological role of the residues involved in heparin binding for viral infectivity.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Almost all AQPs have two highly conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs in each subunit, and these represent the signature motifs of the AQPs (1Carbrey J.M. Agre P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Walz T. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi K. Koike S. Kondo S. Hara S. Tanaka Y. J. Med. Invest. 2009; 56: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of AQP1, the first AQP molecule to be identified, has shown that these motifs reside on opposite sides of the AQP1 monomer and are important for water-selective pore formation (2Walz T. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). So far, sequence analysis has revealed 13 functionally and phylogenetically distinct members of the AQP family in mammals, comprising three subgroups: the water-selective AQPs (AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, AQP5, AQP6, and AQP8), aquaglyceroporins (AQP3, AQP7, AQP9, and AQP10), and a recently proposed third group (AQP11 and AQP12) (1Carbrey J.M. Agre P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Walz T. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi K. Koike S. Kondo S. Hara S. Tanaka Y. J. Med. Invest. 2009; 56: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The water-selective AQPs are all permeated by water molecules, but AQP6 is additionally permeable to a wide range of anions, and AQP8 can facilitate the movement of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide across the plasma membrane (1Carbrey J.M. Agre P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi K. Koike S. Kondo S. Hara S. Tanaka Y. J. Med. Invest. 2009; 56: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The aquaglyceroporins are characterized by permeability to water and neutral solutes, in particular glycerol (1Carbrey J.M. Agre P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi K. Koike S. Kondo S. Hara S. Tanaka Y. J. Med. Invest. 2009; 56: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Compared with the water-selective AQPs and aquaglyceroporins, the sequence alignments of mammalian AQPs indicate that AQP11 and AQP12 are the most distantly related paralogs. At the amino acid level, AQP11 is ∼10% identical and AQP12 is ∼25% identical to the previously characterized members (6Morishita Y. Matsuzaki T. Hara-chikuma M. Andoo A. Shimono M. Matsuki A. Kobayashi K. Ikeda M. Yamamoto T. Verkman A. Kusano E. Ookawara S. Takata K. Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7770-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Gorelick D.A. Praetorius J. Tsunenari T. Nielsen S. Agre P. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Itoh T. Rai T. Kuwahara M. Ko S.B. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). AQP11 is most similar to AQP12 (with ∼23% identity). When compared with the signature motifs of other mammalian AQPs, the C-terminal NPA motif is conserved in both AQP11 and AQP12, but the N-terminal NPA motif is deviated to an Asn-Pro-Cys (NPC) motif for AQP11 and to an Asn-Pro-Thr (NPT) motif for AQP12. Because of their low homologies and deviation from the N-terminal NPA motif, it is difficult to include both AQP11 and AQP12 in the water-selective AQP or aquaglyceroporin subgroup. Furthermore, similar orthologs have been found in nematodes, fruit fly, fish, frog, and chicken (5Ishibashi K. Koike S. Kondo S. Hara S. Tanaka Y. J. Med. Invest. 2009; 56: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that AQP11 and AQP12 together with similar orthologs should be classified into a third AQP group (2Walz T. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi K. Koike S. Kondo S. Hara S. Tanaka Y. J. Med. Invest. 2009; 56: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Of the AQPs thought to belong to the third group, mammalian AQP11 is the most characterized. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that AQP11 may work as a sort of intracellular AQP molecule in certain tissues, such as the kidney and brain (6Morishita Y. Matsuzaki T. Hara-chikuma M. Andoo A. Shimono M. Matsuki A. Kobayashi K. Ikeda M. Yamamoto T. Verkman A. Kusano E. Ookawara S. Takata K. Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7770-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Gorelick D.A. Praetorius J. Tsunenari T. Nielsen S. Agre P. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). AQP11-null mice die in the neonatal period due to renal failure with progressive renal cyst formation, suggesting the importance of AQP11 in mammalian kidney development (6Morishita Y. Matsuzaki T. Hara-chikuma M. Andoo A. Shimono M. Matsuki A. Kobayashi K. Ikeda M. Yamamoto T. Verkman A. Kusano E. Ookawara S. Takata K. Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7770-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Tchekneva E.E. Khuchua Z. Davis L.S. Kadkina V. Dunn S.R. Bachman S. Ishibashi K. Rinchik E.M. Harris R.C. Dikov M.M. Breyer M.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 1955-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that AQP11 also played significant roles in mammalian spermatogenesis and salivary gland development (10Yeung C.H. Cooper T.G. Reproduction. 2010; 139: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Larsen H.S. Ruus A.K. Schreurs O. Galtung H.K. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2010; 118: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus AQP11 is thought to be an important intracellular molecule for the development of certain organs. For the channel properties, no data for the third AQP group other than AQP11 have yet been reported. A reconstruction vesicle study has revealed that AQP11 is permeable to the water molecule, suggesting that AQP11 is a water channel and that the NPC motif of AQP11 and the corresponding N-terminal NPA motif found in water-selective AQPs are exchangeable (12Yakata K. Hiroaki Y. Ishibashi K. Sohara E. Sasaki S. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the role of its divergent motif of AQP11 is still unclear. In order to gain insight into the nature of the divergent motif of AQP11, we examined its role in the subcellular localization, oligomerization, and water permeability of the molecule in transfected mammalian cells. Furthermore the role was also evaluated using zebrafish. Our data indicate that the NPC motif of AQP11, unlike the NPA motif of known AQPs, is essential for full functional expression of the molecule. The Myc-, GFP-, or V5-tagged AQP11 construct was made by in-frame subcloning of mouse AQP11 cDNA into the pCMV-Myc (BD Biosciences Clontech), pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech), pcDNA-DEST47 (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST (Invitrogen), or pcDNA-DEST40 (Invitrogen) vector. The pDsRed2-ER vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used for fluorescent labeling of the ER. The mutations of the constructs were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). CHO-K1 cells (obtained from ATCC, catalog no. CCL-61) were transfected at 50–60% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (13Ikeda M. Beitz E. Kozono D. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Yasui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39873-39879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cultured cells on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes were observed 24 h post-transfection using an FV-300 confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). After transfection, CHO-K1 cells were biotinylated in 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 10–15 min as described previously (14Ikeda M. Fong P. Cheng J. Boletta A. Qian F. Zhang X.M. Cai H. Germino G.G. Guggino W.B. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2006; 18: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After washing, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the cell lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was precipitated with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce). Transfected CHO-K1 cells were lysed, and the lysate was incubated with anti-Myc (Sigma) or anti-V5-agarose beads (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). After washing, the beads were mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 0.2 m DTT at 37 °C for 60 min. Transfected CHO-K1 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4% sodium deoxycholate, Complete protease inhibitor mixture), and the lysate was incubated with 150 μm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) at room temperature (25 °C) for 30 min. Ethanolamine (final concentration 50 mm) was then added to the lysate, and the lysate was mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) supplemented with or without 0.1 m DTT at 37 °C for 20 min. For cross-linking with paraformaldehyde, cells were incubated with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After washing, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture), and the lysate was then mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 0.1 m DTT at 37 °C for 20 min. One day after transfection, CHO-K1 cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA for 15 s to create a round cell shape, allowing easy calculation of cell volume. The cells were then washed and immersed in an extracellular solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris). The cells expressing GFP were identified under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FV300). Osmotic swelling was induced at 25 °C by puff application of a hypotonic solution made by dilution of extracellular solution 1:1 in MilliQ water. The puff application was performed using a nearby pipette of 30–35 μm diameter. An image frame of the cell was recorded every 1.12 s using a time lapse image capture system attached to the microscope. Pf was calculated from osmotic swelling data obtained between 1.12 and 15.68 s using the formula, Pf=(V0×d(V/V0)/dt)/(S×Vw×(osmin−osmout))(Eq. 1) where V0 and S are the initial cell volume and surface area, respectively, d(V/V0)/dt is the slope of linear fit for the plot of cell volume versus time between 1.12 and 15.68 s during osmotic swelling, and Vw × (osmin − osmout) is the osmolality gradient. Zebrafish experiments were performed as described previously (15Uechi T. Nakajima Y. Chakraborty A. Torihara H. Higa S. Kenmochi N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). The sequences of the MOs used in this study were as follows (see Fig. 6A): MO2, 5′-CAAAAACTAATCCAGACAGGCAACT-3′; MO3, 5′-AAACGCAGTGATTCTACAAACCCGC-3′; MO4, 5′-TGTCCACCTTTACAAAACACAACAC-3′; MO5, 5′-TGTTGTAATTCTGCTCACCTAGTAT-3′; control MO, 5-bp mismatched MO5, 5′-TcTTcTAATTCTcCTCAgCTAcTAT-3′ (lowercase letters indicate mismatched bases in MO5). A total amount of 2 or 4 ng of each MO was injected into one-cell-stage embryos. In vitro transcribed 5′-capped mRNAs encoding GFP, human AQP11 (hAQP11), and hAQP11 with Cys101 mutated to Ala (hAQP11-C101A) were synthesized using a mMessage mMachine® T7 kit (Ambion), and 80–150 pg of capped mRNA was injected. For the RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from 24-h postfertilization larvae using an RNeasy® Protect minikit (Qiagen, MD). The zebrafish AQP11-specific primers used were as follows: forward, TTCATCATCTCGGTGGTTCA; reverse, TCATCTTTTTCTTCTTGAGTCCA. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the protein on the membrane associated with antibodies was detected by a SuperSignal® chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Antibodies used in this study were anti-Myc antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech), anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), and anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). All other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals (Japan). It has been reported that AQP11 is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (6Morishita Y. Matsuzaki T. Hara-chikuma M. Andoo A. Shimono M. Matsuki A. Kobayashi K. Ikeda M. Yamamoto T. Verkman A. Kusano E. Ookawara S. Takata K. Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7770-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the introduction of a mutation at Cys101, replacing it with Ala, affected the subcellular localization of AQP11. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with C-terminal GFP-tagged human AQP1 (hAQP1-GFP), N-terminal GFP-tagged mouse AQP11 (GFP-AQP11), C-terminal GFP-tagged AQP11 (AQP11-GFP), and GFP-AQP11-C101A expression plasmids together with a plasmid encoding an ER marker protein. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were observed with a confocal microscope. AQP1-GFP was clearly localized in the cytoplasm as well as at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the localizations of GFP-AQP11 (Fig. 1B) and AQP11-GFP (data not shown) virtually overlapped that of the ER marker. These data confirmed a previous report that AQP11 is localized mainly in the ER (6Morishita Y. Matsuzaki T. Hara-chikuma M. Andoo A. Shimono M. Matsuki A. Kobayashi K. Ikeda M. Yamamoto T. Verkman A. Kusano E. Ookawara S. Takata K. Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7770-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, even when a larger protein molecule, such as GFP, was used to tag the N or C terminus of AQP11, its subcellular localization was unchanged. As shown in Fig. 1C, GFP-AQP11-C101A was clearly localized in the ER, indicating that the NPC motif might not be related to the intracellular localization of AQP11. Cell surface expression levels of Myc-AQP11 and Myc-AQP11-C101A were further assessed by biotinylation experiments. The abundance of the biotinylated protein did not differ between Myc-AQP11 and Myc-AQP11-C101A (Fig. 1, D and E), confirming the intracellular localization of GFP-AQP11-C101A revealed by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the presence of a significant amount of cell surface Myc-AQP11 and Myc-AQP11-C101A was noteworthy. So far, biochemical and structural analyses have revealed that the water-selective AQPs have a tetrameric structure (2Walz T. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). A sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation experiment by Gorelick et al. (7Gorelick D.A. Praetorius J. Tsunenari T. Nielsen S. Agre P. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) has also shown that AQP11 sediments in fractions similar, but not identical, to those of AQP4, which is known to form tetramers (16Neely J.D. Christensen B.M. Nielsen S. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11156-11163Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting that AQP11 may also be capable of tetramer formation. We therefore examined the oligomerization state of AQP11 using techniques other than sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, such as co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with either or both of the expression plasmids Myc-AQP11 and AQP11-V5, and 24 h later, the cellular proteins were precipitated using anti-Myc- or anti-V5-agarose beads. The precipitates were then subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, after precipitation with anti-Myc-agarose beads, only the precipitates from cells expressing both Myc-AQP11 and AQP11-V5 were reactive with the anti-V5 antibody. Also, after precipitation with anti-V5-agarose beads, only the precipitates from cells expressing both proteins were reactive with the anti-Myc antibody. These results clearly indicate that Myc-AQP11 interacts with AQP11-V5. Because a chemical cross-linking experiment with DSP has shown that AQP4 has an oligomeric structure (16Neely J.D. Christensen B.M. Nielsen S. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11156-11163Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), DSP was used to further investigate the oligomeric structure of AQP11-V5. Without DSP treatment, only a 25 kDa protein band was observed (Fig. 2B). However, after treatment of cell lysate with DSP, Western blotting analysis yielded a band at ∼50 kDa in addition to a band at ∼25 kDa. This 50 kDa protein band disappeared when the cell lysate was further incubated with DTT, a strong reducing agent. Therefore, the 50 kDa band was likely to be dimerized AQP11. In some experiments, we observed a band at ∼75 kDa, apparently corresponding to trimeric AQP11 (data not shown). Paraformaldehyde, a fixative, has been reported to be a useful cross-linker for detection of the oligomeric structure of membrane proteins (17Hannah M.J. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Methods. 1998; 16: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore used paraformaldehyde as another cross-linker to evaluate the oligomeric structure of AQP11. After the fixation of cells expressing Myc-AQP11, cellular proteins were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 2C shows a representative result. As observed, paraformaldehyde was able to produce a band at ∼50 kDa in addition to a band at ∼25 kDa. In some cases with paraformaldehyde, we observed bands at ∼75 and 120 kDa, which corresponded to the trimeric and tetrameric structures of AQP11 as shown with AQP11-V5 (Fig. 2D). These results were very similar to those obtained with DSP. However, because use of paraformaldehyde is a first approach to study the oligomerization of AQP family proteins, we needed to check the legitimacy of this approach. Therefore, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation combined with paraformaldehyde fixation. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with either or both of the expression plasmids Myc-AQP11 and AQP11-V5, and 24 h after transfection, lysates prepared from the cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were precipitated using anti-Myc-agarose beads. The precipitates were then evaluated by Western blotting analysis using anti-V5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2E, only the precipitates from cells expressing both Myc-AQP11 and AQP11-V5 produced bands corresponding to monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric AQP11. These data clearly indicate that paraformaldehyde cross-links the AQP11 subunits and produces visible oligomerized bands. Taken together, these results indicated that AQP11 exists as a multimerized protein, most likely a tetramer, as is the case for AQP1 and other AQPs (2Walz T. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 190: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 16Neely J.D. Christensen B.M. Nielsen S. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11156-11163Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the oligomerization state of the AQP11-C101A mutant. As shown in Fig. 3A, after precipitation with anti-Myc-agarose beads, the abundance of protein detected by the anti-V5 antibody was lower in cells co-expressing Myc- and V5-AQP11-C101A in comparison with the wild-type form. Reciprocally, after precipitation with anti-V5-agarose beads, the precipitation of Myc-AQP11-C101A was reduced. On the other hand, the expression levels of V5- or Myc-tagged proteins in the two groups were quite similar. These results clearly indicate that C101A mutation in the NPC motif reduces the oligomerization of AQP11. We also examined the oligomerization state of AQP11-C101A using cross-linkers. Chemical cross-linking with DSP (data not shown) or paraformaldehyde (Fig. 3, B and C) resulted in less multimer formation by V5-AQP11-C101A, compared with the wild-type form. Furthermore, we evaluated the oligomerization between Myc-AQP11-C101A and AQP11-V5-C101A or Myc-AQP11-C101A and GFP-AQP11-C101A in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in Fig. 3, D and E, even when we used different tags, reduced oligomer formation of AQP11-C101A was observed. We examined the extent of oligomerization between the wild-type form and AQP11-C101A. The precipitate obtained with anti-Myc-agarose beads from cells co-expressing AQP11-V5 and Myc-AQP11-C101A reacted weakly with anti-V5 antibody (lane 4 of the lower panel in Fig. 4A), compared with that from cells co-expressing AQP11-V5 and Myc-AQP11 (lane 2). On the other hand, the expression levels of V5- or Myc-tagged proteins in the two groups were quite similar, as shown in the lanes that were loaded with lysates. These results indicate that the C101A mutant forms oligomers poorly with wild-type AQP11. Finally, we examined the effect of mutations in and around the NPC motif on the degree of oligomerization between wild-type AQP11 and the mutants. As shown in Fig. 4B, the V5-AQP11-C101T and -N99D mutants formed oligomers poorly with wild-type AQP11. On the other hand, no reduction of oligomer formation by V5-AQP11-G102V with the wild-type form was observed. These findings again indicate the importance of the NPC motif in the oligomerization of AQP11. As mentioned earlier, cell surface biotinylation experiments with CHO-K1 cells expressing AQP11 revealed that AQP11 was expressed mainly in intracellular components. However, a significant amount of AQP11 was also detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, D and E), thus possibly allowing measurement of the water permeability of AQP11 using a conventional cell swelling assay. We therefore measured the osmotic water permeability of cells expressing GFP-AQP11 using the method. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with a hypotonic solution caused swelling more rapidly in cells expressing GFP-AQP11 than in mock cells. The Pf values (Fig. 5B), shown as mean ± S.E., were 8.0 ± 0.7 cm/s × 10−4 (n = 12) for cells expressing GFP-AQP11 and 4.8 ± 0.8 cm/s × 10−4 (n = 12) for the mock cells. Because it proved possible to measure the water permeability of AQP11 using this assay, we then used it to measure the osmotic water permeability of cells expressing GFP-AQP11-C101A. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, cells expressing GFP-AQP11-C101A showed no significant water permeability (Pf = 3.8 ± 0.9 cm/s × 10−4, n = 12), compared with that of mock cells. Because the plasma membrane expression level of AQP11-C101A was not significantly different from that of mock cells (Fig. 1E), these data indicate that the NPC motif of AQP11 plays an important role in the water permeability function of the molecule. It has been reported that, in zebrafish, disruption of endogenous AQP11 by MO results in body axis curvature of the morphants and that this phenotype was rescued by co-injecting hAQP11 mRNA (18Morrical S.O. Kane M.E. DeChant B.T. Ishibashi K. Obara M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 538A-539AGoogle Scholar). We therefore employed this system to evaluate the importance of Cys101 for the function of AQP11. Because the nucleotide sequence around the initiation codon of zebrafish aqp11 was ambiguous in the NCBI and Ensembl databases (19Tingaud-Sequeira A. Calusinska M. Finn R.N. Chauvigné F. Lozano J. Cerdà J. BMC Evol. Biol. 2010; 10: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we originally designed four MOs that would be potentially capable of blocking sites involved in splicing the pre-mRNA of zebrafish aqp11 and screened them. Among these four MOs (MO2–MO5), MO5 was found to be the most effective for splice inhibition, as judged by RT-PCR and sequence analysis, and also for inducing a higher number of morphants showing body axis curvature. Therefore, we used MO5 for further experiments. We injected MO5 into one-cell-stage embryos and macroscopically observed the phenotype at days 1–5 after injection. Fig. 6A summarizes the data in the same batches of morphants at 2 days after injection. When the control MO (5-bp mismatched MO5) was injected into the embryos, only 4.5% of the morphants exhibited body axis curvature. In contrast, more than 70% of morphants with MO5 did so. However, this malformation was observed in only 24% of morphants that had received a co-injection of both MO5 and hAQP11 cap RNA. Similar results were obtained at the other time points studied. These data are in good agreement with the previous observations and suggest that the functions of human and zebrafish AQP11 are interchangeable. Using this technique, we next examined the effect of hAQP11-C101A cap RNA on the MO5-induced phenotype. In Fig. 6, B–D show representative photographs, E summarizes the data from the same batches of morphants at 2 days after injection. When MO5 and GFP cap RNA (as a control cap RNA) were co-administered, 76% of the morphants showed body axis curvature. The frequency of occurrence of the abnormal phenotype was reduced when we used hAQP11 instead of GFP cap RNA. After co-administration of hAQP11-C101A with MO5, 52% of the morphants showed body axis curvature, suggesting that the AQP11-C101A mutant had reduced ability to rescue the malformation induced by MO5 compared with that of the wild-type AQP11. Both water-selective AQPs and aquaglyceroporins are known to have two highly conserved NPA motifs that represent the signature motifs of the AQP family (1Carbrey J.M. Agre P. Handb. Exp.

Despite the importance and conserved nature of this protein, the characteristics of the centromeric nucleosome are still poorly understood. In particular, the stoichiometry and DNA-binding properties of the CenH3 nucleosome have been the subject of some debate. We have characterized the budding yeast centromeric nucleosome by biochemical and biophysical methods and show that it forms a stable octamer containing two copies of the Cse4 protein and wraps DNA in a left-handed supercoil, similar to the canonical H3 nucleosome. The DNA-binding properties of the recombinant nucleosome are identical to those observed <i>in vivo</i> demonstrating that the octameric structure is physiologically relevant."

LDs 4The abbreviations used are: LD, lipid droplet; DOMS, direct organelle mass spectrometry; TAG, triacylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; SIMS, secondary ion MS; DESI, desorption electrospray ionization. are organelles that are specialized for the storage of neutral lipids and as such provide energy-rich reserves in all cellular organisms (1Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Understanding LD ontogeny is of major importance to human physiology; on the one hand, seed oils, packaged in LDs, make up a growing proportion of daily caloric intake in most diets around the world, and on the other hand, the regulation of lipid storage and mobilization underlies significant human health issues: obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although storage is considered the principal role of neutral lipids, LDs in nonfat storing tissues recently have become more appreciated for their dynamic nature and functional roles independent of storage. These roles include acyl reserves for phospholipid recycling (2Bartz R. Li W.H. Venables B. Zehmer J.K. Roth M.R. Welti R. Anderson R.G. Liu P. Chapman K.D. J.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1646-1651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These various functions attributed to LDs vary with cell type and likely are manifested by differences in droplet composition. The basic structural model of LDs in plant seeds provides a thermodynamically stable organization that is thought to be conserved throughout eukaryotes, although the nature of the lipids and proteins associated with droplets varies with cell/tissue type. The structure describes a neutral lipid core (triacylglycerols in plant seeds and/or steryl esters in other organisms or cell types) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with specific proteins associated with the LD surface (8Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Although the endoplasmic reticulum is considered by most to be the major cellular location for LD biogenesis, droplets associate frequently with other subcellular compartments, presumably to carry out unique functions (9Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28005-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The recent emphasis on studying the formation and turnover of these organelles and the importance of this compartment to general cellular physiology has prompted the development of advanced analytical tools for these organelles. Visualization of cytosolic LDs has commonly been carried out by conventional light microscopy and confirmed by histochemical and/or fluorescent neutral lipid specific stains (e.g. Sudan III, Nile Red, and BODIPY derivatives (10Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Fukumoto S. Fujimoto T. Histochem.

Nature. 2008; 453: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar)). Electron microscopy, such as transmission electron microscopy or freeze-fracture and low temperature scanning electron microscopy, have supported the description of the fine ultrastructure of LDs within various plant and mammalian tissues yielding information on structural variability among an assortment of mutants and under a range of environmental conditions (13Slack C.R.

Acta. 2009; 1791: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recently, third-harmonic generation microscopy (17Débarre D. Supatto W. Pena A.M. Fabre A. Tordjmann T. Combettes L. Schanne-Klein M.C. Beaurepaire E. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and high resolution, nonresonant confocal Raman microscopy (18van Manen H.J. Kraan Y.M. Roos D. Otto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10159-10164Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) have been developed to selectively image unstained LDs unveiling novel interactions in complex cellular environments. In combination with two-photon and second-harmonic generation microscopy, third-harmonic generation microscopy offers three-dimensional spatial resolution that can be used to visualize LDs for long periods. Raman-based microcopy can even provide some molecular composition information for LDs within single cells. The rapidly developing field of lipidomics has led to a renewed effort to analyze triacylglycerol (TAG) prevalence and composition within LDs by mass spectrometric approaches (2Bartz R. Li W.H. Venables B. Zehmer J.K. Roth M.R. Welti R. Anderson R.G. Liu P. Chapman K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Many studies have now detailed the complex fragmentation patterns for the complete structural elucidation and quantification of TAGs (19Cheng C. Gross M.L. Pittenauer E. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Schmelzer K. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Dennis E.A.

Supported by advances in bioinformatics (LIPID MAPS) (22Sud M. Fahy E. Cotter D. Brown A. Dennis E.A. Glass C.K. Merrill Jr., A.H. Murphy R.C. Raetz C.R. Russell D.W. Subramaniam S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D527-D532Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), improvements in mass spectrometry, and availability of unique purified standards, it is now feasible to achieve comprehensive lipid identification and quantification directly from complex mixtures. For lipidomics applications, lipids most often are extracted from tissues or cell lines in organic solvents, losing the spatial information of lipid organization within the original sample. Others have combined mass spectrometry with microscopy approaches such as MALDI-MS (23Murphy R.C. Hankin J.A. Barkley R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S317-S322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), secondary ion MS (SIMS) (24Brunelle A. Laprévote O. Anal. Bioanal.

B. 2009; 877: 2883-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to preserve spatial context with composition information, but the resolution currently remains at the cellular/tissue level, and the compositional analysis is limited and incomplete. Here, we have developed a novel technique for direct organelle mass spectrometry (DOMS) that couples direct visualization with detailed mass spectrometric analysis of organelles. A multifaceted nanomanipulator, previously demonstrated to extract peptides from a single bead (26Brown J.M. Hoffmann W.D. Alvey C.M. Wood A.R. Verbeck G.F. Petros R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2010; 398: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and extract and analyze trace fiber analytes (27Ledbetter N.L. Walton B.L. Davila P. Hoffmann W.D. Ernest R.N. Verbeck G.F. J. Forensic Sci. 2010; 55: 1218-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was equipped with glass nanospray emitters prefilled with organic solvent capable of extracting the lipid contents out of LDs. Here, this approach is illustrated with LDs from diverse plant sources (Gossypium hirsutum and Arabidopsis thaliana). We demonstrate the capability to directly sample populations of purified LDs as well as perform single-organelle mass spectrometry and lipid characterization. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we show a compositional shift in TAG profiles in LDs purified from modified oleic cottonseed lines previously generated in our laboratory (dominant-negative expression of Bnfad2 (28Chapman K.D. Austin-Brown S. Sparace S.A. Kinney A.J. Ripp K.G. Pirtle I.L. Pirtle R.M. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 2001; 78: 941-947Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Chapman K.D. Neogi P.B. Hake K.D. Stawska A.A.

Crop Sci. 2008; 48: 1470-1481Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), the presence of cyclic fatty acids in TAGs of cotton root LDs, and the molecular comparison between Arabidopsis seed and leaf LDs. These new approaches complement existing analytical and cell biology techniques and can be extended to the analysis of LDs and organelles from other organisms. This approach will help facilitate new studies about LD heterogeneity and the molecular nature of subcellular compartments in cellular systems. Cottonseeds were propagated under air-conditioned greenhouse conditions at 30 °C and supplemented with sodium vapor lamps to extend day length to 16 h. Opened bolls were harvested, and seeds were delinted in a table top, 10-saw laboratory gin. Seeds were from cultivar Coker 312 (nontransgenic) or were from transgenic lines (T5 generation) in the Coker 312 background, expressing a nonfunctional allele of the Brassica napus Δ12-desaturase (Bnfad2) under the control of a seed-specific promoter (28Chapman K.D.

These seeds displayed reduced oil, elevated oleic acid phenotype relative to Coker 312 seeds (28Chapman K.D. Austin-Brown S. Sparace S.A. Kinney A.J. Ripp K.G. Pirtle I.L. Pirtle R.M. J. Am.

Roots were collected on ice from germinated cottonseeds (cv. Coker 312) grown in the dark at 30 °C for 48–72 h. Arabidopsis wild type (Col 0) seeds were obtained from the Arabidopsis stock center at Ohio State University and propagated in house. Plants were grown in soil at 21 °C in a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle (between 45 and 65 μmol/m2/s). LDs were imaged by confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy using BODIPY 493/503 to selectively visualize LDs in situ. All tissues were fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and stained with 1–10 μg/ml BODIPY 493/503. For BODIPY imaging, excitation of BODIPY was at 493 nm. Emission wavelength for BODIPY-stained LDs was 520 nm, exposed for 0.4–10 s with no gain. In leaves, chloroplast autofluorescence was acquired with an excitation of 493 nm and an emission wavelength at 692 nm exposed for 0.4 s. Images were acquired with a Zeiss 200 m optical microscope fitted with a CSU-10 Yokogawa confocal scanner (McBain Instruments) and captured with a digital camera (Hamamatsu, Phoenix, AZ). LD morphology and localization were characterized using the McMaster Biophotonics Facility and NIH ImageJ software (version 1.43T). LDs from unfixed embryos of mature cottonseeds were isolated and purified in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 600 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, essentially as described by Chapman and Trelease (30Chapman K.D. Trelease R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and based on methods developed by Huang (31Tzen J.T. Lai Y.K. Chan K.L. Huang A.H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Embryos were chopped into ∼1-mm pieces with a razor blade in ice-cold buffer and purified through a sequential series of three floatations through 500 mm sucrose at 10,000 × g (Sorvall SS-34 rotor or HB-6 rotor in a Sorvall RC 5C centrifuge or in a Centronix Microcentrifuge 1236V for smaller sample sizes). LDs were purified in a similar manner from cotton roots (at least 500 mg fresh weight) of 48–72-h-old seedlings, Arabidopsis leaves of 40-day-old plants (∼8 g of fresh weight), or Arabidopsis seeds (10 mg). LDs from Arabidopsis leaves are few in number, and a final ultracentrifugation step (TLA-100 rotor at 100,000 × g for 1 h, with a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge) helped to enrich these organelles in the top layer. For some experiments, 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, buffer was employed for homogenization and floatation. For all purifications, the fat pads were carefully collected with a spatula, and the LDs were suspended in buffer on ice. LDs were stained with 0.1–1 μg/ml of BODIPY 493/503 in 50 mm PIPES buffer. The Biometric L200 nanomanipulator work station developed by Zyvex (Richardson, TX) and the Verbeck group combines four nanopositioners with a piezo voltage source and a PM 2000B programmable four-channel pressure injector (Microdata Instruments, South Plainfield, NJ) situated on an inverted microscope stage (TE2000U, Nikon, Melville, NY, diagrammed in Fig. 1). The nanomanipulator has two modes of motion along the x, y, and z axes. The fine mode has 100 microns of travel in the x and z axis and 10 microns of travel in the y axis with 3.4 nm resolution controlled by piezoelectric crystals. The coarse mode has 12 mm of travel in the x axis and z axis and 28 mm of travel in the y axis with 100-nm resolution. The positioners consist of end effectors made up of six isolated, low impedance electrical connections and two glass capillary attachments. The end effectors are used for manipulation and, if needed, low impedance electrical characterization. Probes and capillaries attached to the positioners can be manually landed onto the sample and manipulated electronically using a joystick to control the position of the end effector. The capillaries are connected by Teflon tubing to a PM 2000B programmable four-channel pressure injector. LDs were visualized by epifluorescence, bright field, or differential scanning interference optics during collection (Nikon NIS elements), and the lipids were microextracted in 10 mm ammonium acetate in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) in the capillary before MS. For single-lipid droplet analysis, the extraction solution was spiked with a Tri 15:0 TAG standard at a final concentration of 2 μm. A Proxeon nanospray source (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) was mounted on a Thermo LCQ Deca XP Plus quadrupole ion trap (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The lipids in the nanospray emitters (New Objective (Woburn, MA) Econo12 PicoTipTM Emitter platinum-coated or PROT12 break-to-open platinum emitters (tip opening diameters were 1 ± 0.2 μm and 1–10 μm, respectively) were subjected to typical ion source conditions consisting of a potential of 0.8 to 1.5 kV, capillary temperature of 200 °C, and capillary voltage of 3.0 V. Mass spectra were acquired using the LCQ Tune software program in the positive ion mode with three microscans and a continuous acquisition time. The mass spectra were analyzed with the XCalibur software package (version 2.0). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses were used to confirm the identity of the triacylglycerols by a characteristic diacylglycerol fragment. Tandem spectra were acquired in positive ion mode with a typical isolation width of 3.0 m/z, normalized collision energy of 35%, activation Q of 0.250, and an activation time of 30 ms. Quantitative estimates of molecular compositions were calculated in Microsoft Excel with in house algorithms integrating peak areas, correcting for isotopic overlap, and when available normalizing to internal standards. Total lipids were extracted from LDs purified from mature embryos of desiccated seeds (cv. Coker 312, without and with a Brassica FAD2 nonfunctional allele) using the method of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref Google Scholar). Total lipid extracts were dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) and characterized by nanospray mass spectrometry or converted to fatty acid methyl esters and analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (30Chapman K.D. Trelease R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Additional total lipid extracts of the purified LD fractions were converted into fatty acid methyl esters. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by transesterification with 1 n methanolic HCL at 85 °C for 2 h. A heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) standard was added to aid quantification. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated on a 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter Supelcowax 10 fused silica capillary column on a HP 5890 Series II Plus gas chromatograph with an initial oven temperature of 200 °C increasing at a rate of 1.3 °C/min to a final temperature of 230 °C. Because the ion trap is limited in its ability to carry out precursor-product scans, additional acyl chain information was derived from analysis of total lipid extracts of LD fractions purified from cotton (seed, root) and Arabidopsis tissues (seed, leaf) using a Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). Typical scanning conditions for a direct infusion rate of 10–20 μl/min were carried out in positive ion mode with a 3–3.5 kV spray voltage, 40 V cone voltage, and a scan range of 750 to 1000 m/z. The desolvation and source temperatures were maintained at 200 and 80 °C, respectively, and the desolvation and cone gas flows were set at 300 and 80 liters/hr, respectively. Tandem scans (MS/MS), whether detecting the precursor ions that lost a particular acyl chain in neutral loss mode or single precursor-product species, were performed with collision energy of 30 V with a scan range from 400 to 1000 m/z. Interfacing direct organelle sampling with nanospray mass spectrometry required the incorporation of nanospray emitters that could control the liquid flux at the tip opening in contact with the sample of interest while also sufficiently concentrating the extracted lipids to detect their composition with high resolution. The development of a nanomanipulator apparatus (Fig. 1) (26Brown J.M. Hoffmann W.D. Alvey C.M. Wood A.R. Verbeck G.F. Petros R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2010; 398: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) coordinated the positioning of up to four emitters in a three-dimensional plane situated on the stage of an inverted light microscope for maximum working distance. Emitters, prefilled with an organic microextraction solution that served the dual purpose of extracting the lipids from the droplets and facilitating the formation of nanospray droplets, were positioned adjacent to purified LDs (Fig. 1a). Direct interfacing the emitter with a dynamic pressure injector provided the sensitivity necessary to fill nanoliter volumes (usually between 5–30 psi of fill pressure) and selectively capture individual organelles (supplemental Movie 1). After sampling LDs, the emitters were remounted onto the nanospray apparatus (Fig. 1b) for chemical analysis. To test the DOMS approach, LDs were purified from mature cotton embryos (cv. Coker 312) due to their abundance within seed tissues, relative ease of purification and the known composition of TAGs in standard cottonseed oil (33Lísa M. Holcapek M. J. Chromatogr. A. 2008; 1198–1199: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These LDs, suspended in ∼100 μl, were somewhat variable in size (∼0.5–2.0 μm diameter) (Fig. 1a) but retained similar spherical morphology to that observed in situ. A random sampling of approximately two dozen LDs produced a high resolution spectrum of TAGs (Fig. 2a). The TAG molecular species under these conditions were of sufficient concentration to analyze by MS/MS and confirm/assign acyl composition (Fig. 2, b and c). Tandem MS of TAG precursor ions produce diacylglycerol product ions that lead to a high confidence of acyl chain identification (34Byrdwell W.C. Lipids. 2005; 40: 383-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The TAG acyl chain distribution in purified cottonseed LDs primarily consisted of linoleic (18:2), oleic (18:1), and palmitic acids (16:0). Most LDs share a similar spherical morphology despite some significant alterations in the composition of their neutral lipid core or surrounding phospholipid/protein-lined monolayer (8Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 12Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P.

Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and/or metabolic state (12Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P.

Purification of these LDs was verified by bright field (Fig. 3, c and d) and epifluorescence microscopy (stained with a neutral lipid specific fluorescent dye, BODIPY 493/503) (Fig. 3, e and f). Direct sampling of these Bnfad2 LDs showed a distinct shift toward increased oleic acid (18:1) acyl chain distribution within TAG at the expense of linoleic acid (18:2) (Fig. 3g) that was confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively with conventional chemical extractions of total seed lipids (Fig. 4) and analysis of total fatty acid content by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (supplemental Fig. 1), consistent with suppression of endogenous oleic acid desaturation by FAD2 (dominant-negative mutation). Hence, with this approach, it was possible to demonstrate directly a change in molecular composition at the organelle level in these metabolic mutants.FIGURE 4Validation of DOMS with conventional total lipid extracts. Representative TAG profiles from total lipid extracts of purified LDs from mature cotton embryos of Coker 312 wild type (a) and Bnfad2 transgenic (b) lines. Dominant TAG species are identified as ammonium adducts [M + NH4]+ with peaks labeled according to the total number of carbons followed by the total number of double bonds for that particular TAG mass-to-charge ratio. Quantitative comparison of molecular TAG content (c, Coker 312; d, Bnfad2) acquired through direct organelle mass spectrometry of small LD populations (10–25 LDs) relative to conventional total lipid extracts. Predominant acyl chain combinations were quantified by integrating the absolute intensities of peaks identified through tandem MS, correcting for isotopic overlap, and converting to molecular percentages.

The overall variability in TAG composition from sampling small, random populations of cottonseed LDs (10–25 droplets per sample) was relatively low (Fig. 4, c and d). Direct visualization and sampling of a single Bnfad2 LD (Fig. 5a) as demonstrated in supplemental Movie 2 required fine tuning the filling conditions to prevent multiple LDs from entering the tip and obscuring the final suspension of LD. To assess the heterogeneity of individual LDs isolated from cottonseed embryos, LDs were sampled individually for both the Coker 312 and Bnfad2 (TABLE 1, TABLE 2 and Fig. 5). Representative TAG spectra from single Coker 312 (Fig. 5b, top) and single Bnfad2 (Fig. 5b, bottom) LD showed identifiable TAG profiles of single LD. There was a substantial difference in mol % of TAG species (normalized to Tri 15:0 internal standard) among individual LD, both within the Coker 312 seeds and the Bnfad2 seeds (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). The average TAG molecular composition (Fig. 5C; TABLE 1, TABLE 2) of seven individual LDs combined were distinctly different from one another (Coker 312 versus Bnfad2), and the average composition of each variety approached that of the composition varieties when multiple LDs were sampled together. However, there was considerable heterogeneity among purified seed lipid droplets, suggesting a complexity in the biogenesis of LD not able to be appreciated until now. In other words, the overall average lipid composition of these seeds comes from discrete LD packages with variable TAG profiles.

AβOs have been shown to impact synapse function by inhibiting long term potentiation, facilitating the induction of long term depression and inducing internalization of both AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, critical players in plasticity mechanisms. Because activation of dopamine D1/D5 receptors plays important roles in memory circuits by increasing the insertion of AMPA and NMDA receptors at synapses, we hypothesized that selective activation of D1/D5 receptors could protect synapses from the deleterious action of AβOs. We show that SKF81297, a selective D1/D5 receptor agonist, prevented the reduction in surface levels of AMPA and NMDA receptors induced by AβOs in hippocampal neurons in culture. Protection by SKF81297 was abrogated by the specific D1/D5 antagonist, SCH23390. Levels of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 phosphorylated at Ser845, which regulates AMPA receptor association with the plasma membrane, were reduced in a calcineurin-dependent manner in the presence of AβOs, and treatment with SKF81297 prevented this reduction. Establishing the functional relevance of these findings, SKF81297 blocked the impairment of long term potentiation induced by AβOs in hippocampal slices.

Although much is known about the pathophysiology of AD, there is still no cure or effective treatment capable of slowing the progression of the disease. For this reason, development of novel pharmacological strategies for treatment is of critical importance.Considerable evidence indicates that soluble oligomers of the amyloid-β peptide (AβOs) accumulate in the brains of AD patients and are responsible for synapse dysfunction and memory loss in AD (3Haass C.

Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). The D1 family comprises D1 and D5 receptor subtypes, which are mostly coupled to Gαs and stimulate production of the second messenger cyclic AMP, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (17Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). D1/D5 receptors play important roles in cognition, mediating plasticity and specific aspects of cognitive function, including working and spatial learning and memory processes (18Dalley J.W. Everitt B.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Stimulation of D1/D5 receptors promotes the insertion of AMPA receptors into the plasma membrane through phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 at the PKA target site Ser845 (19Gao C. Sun X. Wolf M.E. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Smith W.B. Starck S.R. Roberts R.W. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 765-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because recruitment of new AMPA receptors into the synapse is critical to the establishment of LTP (21Shepherd J.D. Huganir R.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), this likely accounts for the molecular basis of the effects of dopaminergic neurotransmission on learning and memory.In the present study, we show that SKF81297, a selective D1/D5 receptor agonist, prevents AβO-induced removal of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors from the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture. Results further show that AβOs reduce the levels of GluR1 phosphorylated at Ser845 (pS845-GluR1), which regulates membrane association of AMPA receptors and that this effect can be prevented by SKF81297 and by the calcineurin inhibitor, FK-506. Finally, we show that treatment with SKF81297 prevents AβO-induced impairment of LTP in hippocampal slices, providing functional evidence for the protection of synapse function by D1/D5 receptor activation.DISCUSSIONDriven by previous reports showing that Aβ oligomers impair synapse function (30Yamin G.

Sci. 2003; 1003: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the present study was designed to investigate whether pharmacological manipulation of D1/D5 receptors could represent a novel mechanism to protect synapses from damage instigated by Aβ oligomers.Among several aspects of synapse function reported to be affected by AβOs is the internalization of AMPA and NMDA receptors. Both receptors exhibit reduced surface levels upon in vitro exposure of neurons to different AβO preparations and reduced total levels in transgenic mouse models of AD and in AD brains (10Zhao W.Q.

AMPA and NMDA receptors are essential for glutamatergic synaptic transmission and play key roles in LTP and LTD, cellular mechanisms of plasticity thought to underlie learning, memory, and cognition (36Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). Current results show that activation of D1/D5 receptors by SKF81297 prevents AβO-induced loss of GluR1 and NR1 from dendrites. The fact that total levels of GluR1 and NR1 were unaffected by exposure to AβOs suggests that changes in their surface levels are a consequence of altered regulation of trafficking rather than changes in expression or stability of these receptors.It is well established that NMDA receptors and D1/D5 receptors interact physically and functionally in the brain (37Castner S.A. Williams G.V. Brain Cognition. 2007; 63: 94-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 38Missale C. Fiorentini C. Busi C. Collo G. Spano P.F. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This interaction accounts for several aspects of dopaminergic regulation of cognitive function, including reward, addiction, and working memory (37Castner S.A. Williams G.V. Brain Cognition. 2007; 63: 94-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Activation of D1/D5 receptors enhances PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 at Ser897, which signals synaptic insertion of NMDA receptors (39Chen B.S. Roche K.W. Neuropharmacology. 2007; 53: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 40Snyder G.L. Fienberg A.A. Huganir R.L. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10297-10303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in increased NMDA currents and synaptic potentiation (41Granado N. Ortiz O. Suárez L.M. Martín E.D. Ceña V. Solís J.M. Moratalla R. Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Preventing the removal of NMDA receptors from synaptic membranes, as accomplished by D1/D5 receptor activation, is thus critical for the integrity of synaptic plasticity.AMPA receptors are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, and their levels at synapses are highly dynamic and regulated (42Malenka R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1003: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). AMPA receptor trafficking is critically engaged in modulating synaptic strength; for example, recruitment of new AMPA receptors occurs during LTP (43Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A. Ehlers M.D. Science. 2004; 305: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), whereas they are removed by endocytosis from synaptic membranes upon induction of LTD (42Malenka R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1003: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). From its insertion into the synaptic membrane to receptor endocytosis, AMPA receptor subunits are regulated mainly by two mechanisms: phosphorylation at specific sites and interaction with scaffolding proteins, which confer stability to the receptor at the postsynaptic membrane (44Groc L. Choquet D. Cell Tiss. Res. 2006; 326: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Among the four distinct subunits that may form AMPA receptors, GluR1 is the one whose trafficking depends directly on neuronal activity, whereas GluR2 is more prone to undergo constitutive, activity-independent recycling (45Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2003; 40: 361-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Membrane insertion of GluR1 is regulated by two phosphorylation sites in the intracellular C-terminal tail: Ser845 and Ser831, targets of PKA and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, respectively (46Song I. Huganir R.L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 578-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated, Ser845 signals AMPA receptor insertion at extrasynaptic sites, and Ser831 signals subsequent translocation to synaptic sites (21Shepherd J.D. Huganir R.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 47He K. Song L. Cummings L.W. Goldman J. Huganir R.L. Lee H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845 is required for the induction of LTP (49Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Han J.S. Man H. Kim C.H. Rumbaugh G. Yu S. Ding L. He C. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Gallagher M. Huganir R.L. Cell. 2003; 112: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), whereas its dephosphorylation is essential for NMDA receptor-dependent LTD (48Lee H.K. Takamiya K. He K. Song L. Huganir R.L. J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Our finding that AβOs induce loss of surface AMPA receptors and a parallel reduction in pS845-GluR1 levels is consistent with the fact that AβOs facilitate LTD and induce long lasting depression of synaptic activity (8Li S. Hong S. Shepardson N.E. Walsh D.M. Shankar G.M. Selkoe D. Neuron. 2009; 62: 788-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 50Cerpa W. Farías G.G. Godoy J.A. Fuenzalida M. Bonansco C. Inestrosa N.C. Mol. Neurodegen. 2010; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This impact of AβOs may be part of the underlying mechanism by which AβOs facilitate/induce LTD, inhibit LTP, and cause synapse failure. Giving further support to this notion is the observation that reduction in pS845-GluR1 levels induced by AβOs was blocked by a calcineurin inhibitor, FK-506. It is well established that dephosphorylation of GluR1 by calcineurin and other phosphatases, such as protein phosphatases-1 and -2A, cause removal of AMPA receptors from the plasma membrane (51Lee H.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 112: 810-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Calcineurin can also act indirectly, through the relief of protein phosphatase-1 inhibition by DARPP-32 (52Greengard P. Allen P.B. Nairn A.C. Neuron. 1999; 23: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Specifically, previous works have shown that calcineurin may be involved in the deleterious synaptic effects of AβOs, including LTP impairment, LTD facilitation, and induction of AMPA receptor endocytosis (8Li S. Hong S. Shepardson N.E. Walsh D.M. Shankar G.M. Selkoe D. Neuron. 2009; 62: 788-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 10Zhao W.Q. Santini F. Breese R. Ross D.

Mem. 2002; 77: 354-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on the present data, we propose that AβOs cause a reduction in pS845-GluR1 levels mediated by activation of calcineurin, triggering AMPA receptor removal and synapse failure.Current results show that activation of D1/D5 receptors prevents the reduction in pS845-GluR1 and loss of surface GluR1 induced by AβOs. D1/D5 receptor activation leads to increased cyclic AMP levels and increased PKA activity (17Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar), favoring phosphorylation of GluR1 (54Chao S.Z. Lu W. Lee H.K. Huganir R.L. Wolf M.E. J.

Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This may explain why D1/D5-selective agonists prevent LTD (55Mockett B.G. Guévremont D. Williams J.M. Abraham W.C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2918-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and facilitate the induction of LTP (41Granado N. Ortiz O. Suárez L.M. Martín E.D. Ceña V. Solís J.M. Moratalla R. Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PKA activity is known to be affected by Aβ (29Vitolo O.V. Sant'Angelo A. Costanzo V. Battaglia F. Arancio O. Shelanski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13217-13221Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and this is likely the kinase involved in mediating the protective effect of SKF81297 on the surface levels of AMPA receptor. However, other kinases thought to be involved in AD pathogenesis, including GSK3β (56Decker H. Lo K.Y. Unger S.M. Ferreira S.T. Silverman M.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), have been implicated in Aβ effects on AMPA receptor trafficking (57Rui Y. Gu J. Yu K. Hartzell H.C. Zheng J.Q. Mol. Brain. 2010; 3: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible roles of GSK3β and other kinases in the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking by D1/D5 receptors merits further investigation.Finally, we found that SKF81297 prevented AβO-induced impairment of LTP in hippocampal slices, further substantiating the notion that activation of D1/D5 receptors prevents synapse dysfunction induced by AβOs. LTP is a central event in learning and memory processes, and it is known to be compromised in AD (30Yamin G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87: 1729-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that synaptic recruitment of AMPA receptors is necessary for LTP (45Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2003; 40: 361-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 is required for delivery of new AMPA receptors into perisynaptic sites (36Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar), which precedes full expression of LTP (58Yang Y. Wang X.B. Frerking M. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11388-11393Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, D1/D5 receptor-mediated extrasynaptic insertion of AMPA receptors (19Gao C. Sun X. Wolf M.E. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) via Ser845 phosphorylation of GluR1 by PKA (59Man H.Y. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Huganir R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3579-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) is likely the mechanism involved in prevention of AβO-induced LTP impairment by SKF81297.In conclusion, we have established a novel connection between dopaminergic signaling and AD by demonstrating that activation of D1/D5 receptors prevents pathological changes in synapse composition and function induced by AβOs. One of the implications of this connection is that dopamine D1/D5 receptors may constitute a target for the development of novel approaches to combat synapse failure in AD. Also of interest is that dopaminergic neurotransmission, which is reduced with aging (60de Keyser J. De Backer J.P. Vauquelin G. Ebinger G. Brain Res. 1990; 528: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), plays important roles in nonpharmacological strategies aimed to improve age-related cognitive decline, such as environmental enrichment and physical exercise (61van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Previous works have suggested that such strategies could be beneficial to ameliorate AD symptoms (62Schaeffer E.L. Novaes B.A. da Silva E.R. Skaf H.D. Mendes-Neto A.G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2009; 33: 1087-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, investigating the relationship between dopamine D1/D5 receptor activation and relief of AD symptoms achieved by either pharmacological tools or nonpharmacological approaches may be an interesting avenue for future investigations.

Although much is known about the pathophysiology of AD, there is still no cure or effective treatment capable of slowing the progression of the disease. For this reason, development of novel pharmacological strategies for treatment is of critical importance.Considerable evidence indicates that soluble oligomers of the amyloid-β peptide (AβOs) accumulate in the brains of AD patients and are responsible for synapse dysfunction and memory loss in AD (3Haass C.

Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). The D1 family comprises D1 and D5 receptor subtypes, which are mostly coupled to Gαs and stimulate production of the second messenger cyclic AMP, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (17Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). D1/D5 receptors play important roles in cognition, mediating plasticity and specific aspects of cognitive function, including working and spatial learning and memory processes (18Dalley J.W. Everitt B.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Stimulation of D1/D5 receptors promotes the insertion of AMPA receptors into the plasma membrane through phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 at the PKA target site Ser845 (19Gao C. Sun X. Wolf M.E. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Smith W.B. Starck S.R. Roberts R.W. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 765-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because recruitment of new AMPA receptors into the synapse is critical to the establishment of LTP (21Shepherd J.D. Huganir R.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), this likely accounts for the molecular basis of the effects of dopaminergic neurotransmission on learning and memory.In the present study, we show that SKF81297, a selective D1/D5 receptor agonist, prevents AβO-induced removal of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors from the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture. Results further show that AβOs reduce the levels of GluR1 phosphorylated at Ser845 (pS845-GluR1), which regulates membrane association of AMPA receptors and that this effect can be prevented by SKF81297 and by the calcineurin inhibitor, FK-506. Finally, we show that treatment with SKF81297 prevents AβO-induced impairment of LTP in hippocampal slices, providing functional evidence for the protection of synapse function by D1/D5 receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1982195246,"Proteins of the cytohesin/Arno/Grp1 family of Arf activators are positive regulators of the insulin-signaling pathway and control various remodeling events at the plasma membrane. Arno has a catalytic Sec7 domain, which promotes GDP to GTP exchange on Arf, followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Previous studies have revealed two functions of the PH domain: inhibition of the Sec7 domain and membrane targeting. Interestingly, the Arno PH domain interacts not only with a phosphoinositide (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate) but also with an activating Arf family member, such as Arf6 or Arl4. Using the full-length membrane-bound forms of Arf1 and Arf6 instead of soluble forms, we show here that the membrane environment dramatically affects the mechanism of Arno activation. First, Arf6-GTP stimulates Arno at nanomolar concentrations on liposomes compared with micromolar concentrations in solution. Second, mutations in the PH domain that abolish interaction with Arf6-GTP render Arno completely inactive when exchange reactions are reconstituted on liposomes but have no effect on Arno activity in solution. Third, Arno is activated by its own product Arf1-GTP in addition to a distinct activating Arf isoform. Consequently, Arno activity is strongly modulated by competition with Arf effectors. These results show that Arno behaves as a bistable switch, having an absolute requirement for activation by an Arf protein but, once triggered, becoming highly active through the positive feedback effect of Arf1-GTP. This property of Arno might provide an explanation for its function in signaling pathways that, once triggered, must move forward decisively.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PS, phosphatidylserine; PH, pleckstrin homology; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; mant, methylanthraniloyl. promote the exchange of GDP by GTP on small G proteins (1Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). In many GEFs, the catalytic domain responsible for the nucleotide exchange activity is flanked by domains that promote binding to cellular membranes. Membrane targeting is favorable for the exchange reaction because most small G proteins are anchored to lipid membranes. In addition, GEFs integrate inputs of different nature through quaternary conformational changes. The combination of membrane translocation and quaternary conformational changes is a recurrent theme in signaling molecules that interact with small G proteins (2Canagarajah B. Leskow F.C. Ho J.Y.

However, only a few examples have been dissected so far, given the difficulty in handling multidomain proteins and lipid-modified G proteins on reconstituted membranes. Arno proteins (Arno, cytohesin, and Grp1) are the simplest GEFs for Arfs, a subfamily of small G proteins involved in membrane traffic (11Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S.

Arno contains a N-terminal coiled-coil region, a central Sec7 domain and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Numerous studies suggest a clear division of labor between the Sec7 domain, which is responsible for the exchange activity, and the PH domain, which promotes membrane recruitment. The Sec7 domain of Arno is among the most efficient GEFs in vitro (kcat/Km ∼106 m−1 s−1), and the mechanism by which it expels GDP from Arf1 is known in great detail (14Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S.

The interaction of the PH domain of Arno with lipids is also well understood. It contains a basic pocket for phosphoinositides, and splice variants that differ by a unique glycine residue are either specific for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) or bind equally well to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or PIP3 (17Ogasawara M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, a polybasic region downstream of the PH domain interacts with negatively charged lipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) (20Nagel W. Schilcher P. Zeitlmann L. Kolanus W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Macia E. Paris S. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Santy L.C. Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1173-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The respective roles of the Sec7 and PH domains of Arno in exchange activity and membrane binding are clearly established. However, their biochemical properties lead to a dilemma when considered in a cellular context. The PH domain binds to a combination of lipids (PS + PIP2 or PIP3) that is found at the plasma membrane (18Cronin T.C. DiNitto J.P. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3711-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas the Sec7 domain is much more active on Arf1, localized predominantly to the Golgi, than on Arf6, which is found at the cell periphery (17Ogasawara M. Kim S.C. Adamik R. Togawa A. Ferrans V.J. Takeda K. Kirby M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Macia E. Chabre M. Franco M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24925-24930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To explain this discrepancy, one hypothesis is that the preference of Arno for Arf1 versus Arf6 in vitro is counteracted by additional factors in the cell and notably by subcellular localization effects (24Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Arno might activate Arf1 at the plasma membrane under specific circumstances. For instance, it has been reported that Arf1 translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin or EGF and also has a role in some endocytic events (25Li H.S. Shome K. Rojas R. Rizzo M.A. Vasudevan C. Fluharty E. Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Romero G. BMC Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Boulay P.L. Cotton M. Melançon P. Claing A. J. Biol.

In any case, tight control mechanisms are required to prevent random Arf1 activation. Recent studies reveal two types of mechanism that, in addition to the recognition of phosphoinositides, could regulate Arno: (i) autoinhibition of the Sec7 domain by the PH domain and (ii) binding of Arf6-GTP of Arl4-GTP to the Arno PH domain (29Várnai P.

Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the Sec7-PH tandem of Grp1 reveals that this very close Arno homologue adopts an autoinhibited conformation in solution, where a C-terminal helix downstream of the PH domain covers the Arf-binding site of the Sec7 domain (30DiNitto J.P.

This implies that Arno family members open at the surface of lipid membranes through quaternary conformational changes to become active. A second unexpected finding is that the PH domain of Arno interacts not only with lipids but also with some Arf proteins (Arf6 and Arl4) in the GTP-bound conformation (29Várnai P. Bondeva T. Tamás P. Tóth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Cohen L.A. Honda A. Varnai P. Brown F.D. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, Arno has a dual character, being not only an exchange factor for Arf proteins through its Sec7 domain but also an Arf effector through its PH domain. Collectively, these findings raise novel hypotheses for the spatiotemporal activation of Arf proteins by Arno. The interaction of its PH domain with defined Arf subtypes suggests cascades, akin to Rab cascades (34Grosshans B.L. Ortiz D. Novick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11821-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), in which Arno could serve to change the repertoire of Arf subtypes bound to a membrane. The fact that Arno adopts an autoinhibited conformation suggests that its response to phosphoinositides, PS, and Arf subtypes could be highly synergistic because these membrane determinants could cooperate in opening the structure. These putative mechanisms, which are intimately linked to the membrane environment, have been previously inferred from experiments using minimal soluble components (lipid polar headgroups and truncated forms of Arfs) (30DiNitto J.P.

Here we have studied the mutual regulation between full-length Arno and two myristoylated Arf subtypes, Arf1 and Arf6, at the surface of model liposomes. Our results reveal that Arno is very sensitive to the surface density of not only Arf6-GTP but also its own product, Arf1-GTP, and competes with Arf effectors. These results suggest a model in which Arno behaves as a bistable switch, mobilizing a large amount of Arf molecules only under specific circumstances. This model should help in understanding the physiological function of Arno. Full-length human Arno (“three-glycine” form) and its PH domain (amino acids 261–400) were expressed in a pET-8c vector and purified by nickel-NTA chromatography (Qiagen). After elution with imidazole, Arno was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl (500 mm in the case of the PH domain), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol, followed by ultracentrifugation to remove aggregates. Mutants were generated with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Myristoylated Arf1-GDP was purified from Escherichia coli co-expressing bovine Arf1 and N-myristoyltransferase through ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE chromatography, and MonoS chromatography (35Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Myristoylated Arf6 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was purified by nickel-NTA chromatography. In pilot experiments, we compared this form with a non-tagged version of myristoylated Arf6-GTP (36Chavrier P. Franco M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and observed similar activation of Arno on liposomes. Chromatography on a MonoQ column after protein denaturation showed that purified Arf1 was in the GDP-bound state, whereas Arf6 was in the GTP-bound state. The effect of GDP or GTP addition on the fluorescence of the two proteins confirmed this difference. Egg phosphatidylcholine, liver phosphatidylethanolamine, brain PS, and brain phosphoinositides were from Avanti Polar Lipids. All liposomes contained 20 mol % phosphatidylethanolamine, 0 or 30 mol % PS, and the indicated percentage of PIP2 or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (up to 5 mol %). The remaining lipid was phosphatidylcholine. Lipids in chloroform were first mixed in pear-shaped glassware. The glassware was attached to a rotary evaporator and immersed in a water bath at 34 °C for 5 min before evaporation. This step improves PIP2 homogenization with other lipids (37Wang J. Gambhir A. Hangyás-Mihályné G. Murray D. Golebiewska U. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34401-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A lipid film was produced by rapid evaporation of chloroform under vacuum. The lipid film was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, 120 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.2. The suspension (4 mm lipids) was submitted to five cycles of freezing/thawing and extruded through polycarbonate filters (pore size = 0.1 μm). Liposomes were stored at room temperature and used within 2 days. Nucleotide exchange on Arf1 was followed by tryptophan fluorescence (excitation, 297.5 nm; emission, 340 nm) or by FRET between Arf1 and mant-nucleotides (excitation, 297.5 nm; emission, 455 nm). The fluorimeter was equipped with injection and stirring instruments. Experiments were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 120 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μm CaCl2, 100 μm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.2. Calculations suggest that, at the protein/lipid ratio used in the experiments, the majority of the liposome surface should remain accessible. Therefore, the kinetics should not be affected by crowding effects. An Arf molecule (4.8 × 3.8 × 3.7 nm3) occupies a surface of ∼15 nm2 corresponding to a monolayer of ∼20 lipids. At the highest concentration of Arf1 and Arf6 used here (0.4 and 0.9 μm, respectively) the two proteins should cover ∼30 μm lipids (i.e. 30% of the liposome surface, assuming that half of the lipids are in the external leaflet (total lipid concentration = 200 μm)). The activation of Arf1 by Arno on liposomes follows complex kinetics because of the involvement of a positive feedback loop. The rate constant shown in the plots corresponds to the initial rate, which was determined from the slope of the initial fluorescence increase or from a semilog plot. When Arf6-GTP was present, the reaction followed first order kinetics, and the rate constant was determined from a monoexponential fit. For very slow reactions, we took into account the slow decay in fluorescence that arises from photobleaching. Most experiments were performed on liposomes containing limiting amounts of PIP2 (0.5 or 1 mol %). We noticed large variations (up to 5-fold) in the absolute activity of wild-type Arno on different preparations of liposomes with the same limiting amount of PIP2 despite the use of protocols to improve its distribution in liposomes (37Wang J. Gambhir A. Hangyás-Mihályné G. Murray D. Golebiewska U. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34401-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The origin of these variations is not well understood but is probably linked to the liposomes because the kinetics of [Δ17]Arf1 activation in solution in the presence of Arno was very reproducible (±10%). Note that on a relative scale, the variations observed between different batches of liposomes were minor compared with the overall range of Arno activity on liposomes of different composition (3 orders of magnitude; see supplemental Fig. S1A). Each figure panel presents kinetics recordings performed the same day with the same liposome batch. When independent experiments were compared, the exchange activity of wild-type Arno was arbitrarily set at 1. Protein binding to liposome was assessed by a flotation assay (38Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The protein of interest (1 μm) was incubated at 37 °C, for 15 min with liposomes (1 mm, containing 0.2% fluorescent lipid 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-phosphatidylethanolamine) in the same buffer as that used in fluorescence experiments. Thereafter, the suspension was adjusted to 33% (w/v) sucrose and overlaid with two cushions of decreasing density (25 and 0% sucrose, respectively). The sample was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a swing rotor (Beckman TLS 55) for 1 or 2 h. The bottom, middle, and top fractions were collected using a Hamilton syringe and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Sypro Orange staining. 4-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole fluorescence of the various fractions showed that about 95% of the lipids was recovered in the top fraction. Arno with mCherry at the N terminus was constructed in a pmCherryC1 vector. Arf1 with a GFP at the C terminus was constructed in a pEGFP-N1 vector. Arf6 with an HA tag at the C terminus was in a pcDNA3 vector (gift of Michel Franco). Telomerase-immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were grown in DMEM plus glutaMAX medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and processed for immunofluorescence 18 h after transfection. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde during 25 min in PBS, treated with 0.5% saponin in PBS, and then treated with 10% horse serum, 0.05% saponin in PBS. Arf6-HA was revealed by an anti-HA 3F10 antibody (Roche Applied Science) and an anti-rat Fluoprobe642 antibody (Interchim). The cells were examined under a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. For morphological analysis, we focused on cells expressing comparable levels of wild-type and mutated forms of Arno. Three independent experiments were used to compare the distribution of Arf1-GFP in cells cotransfected with wild-type Arno or the triple AAE mutant, and about 300–400 cells were examined in each experiment. Fig. 1A shows a schematic representation of the Sec7-PH tandem of Arno based on the crystal structure of the close homologue Grp1, which is 85.5% identical in primary sequence with Arno (30DiNitto J.P. Delprato A. Gabe Lee M.T. Cronin T.C. Huang S. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 569-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this conformation, Arno cannot promote nucleotide exchange on Arf because the catalytic site of the Sec7 domain is covered by the C-terminal helix. However, as schematized in Fig. 1A, this conformation is compatible with membrane recruitment; the phosphoinositide-binding site of the PH domain is accessible, and residues of the PH domain (e.g. Lys336) that are believed to contact Arf6-GTP or Arl4-GTP (29Várnai P.

Biol. 2007; 17: 711-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) are solvent-exposed. Moreover, the relative position of these two binding sites seems compatible with a dual interaction; the PH domain could simultaneously engage a “bottom” contact with PIP2 and a “side” contact with membrane-bound Arf6-GTP. How these contacts cooperate in opening Arno structure is not known, but these considerations suggest that a membrane surface should provide a favorable environment for the stimulatory effect of Arf6-GTP on Arno. To test the effect of the lipid membrane environment on the activity of Arno, we performed nucleotide exchange reactions on liposomes of defined composition using myristoylated Arf1-GDP as a substrate of Arno and myristoylated Arf6-GTP as a potential activator. The three-glycine variant of Arno, which recognizes PIP2, was used in all experiments (17Ogasawara M. Kim S.C. Adamik R. Togawa A. Ferrans V.J. Takeda K. Kirby M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Cronin T.C. DiNitto J.P. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We followed GDP to GTP exchange on Arf1 by tryptophan fluorescence. Because Arf6 was already in the GTP-bound conformation, it did not contribute to the fluorescence change, and its fluorescence level was subtracted for clarity. Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1 show three sets of experiments aimed at testing the effect of Arf6-GTP on the activity of full-length Arno in a minimal membrane environment. Overall, these experiments show that Arf6-GTP acts in synergy with anionic lipids (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) and that Arf6-GTP is a much more potent activator of Arno on lipid membranes than in solution. On liposomes containing 0.5 mol % PIP2 and 30 mol % PS, the half-maximal stimulatory effect of Arf6-GTP was 43 ± 10 nm (Fig. 1B). This value corresponds to a 300-fold increase in efficiency compared with what has been reported for [Δ12]Arf6-GTP in solution (half-stimulatory effect of 14 μm) (30DiNitto J.P. Delprato A. Gabe Lee M.T. Cronin T.C. Huang S. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 569-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In line with this, [Δ13]Arf6-GTP at submicromolar levels had no effect on Arno in our liposome system (Fig. 1B). We conclude that the membrane environment strongly facilitates the stimulatory effect of Arf6-GTP on Arno. The strong synergy between membrane-bound Arf6-GTP and phosphoinositides were compatible with the model of Fig. 1A. However, other observations were more disconcerting. Fig. 1C compares exchange reactions performed with wild-type Arno and with a mutant (K336A) lacking a lysine of the PH domain critical for Arf6-GTP binding (31Cohen L.A. Honda A. Varnai P. Brown F.D. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The liposomes contained 30 mol % PS and 1 mol % PIP2. Under these conditions, wild-type Arno displayed robust exchange activity on Arf1, which was further increased 6-fold by the addition of Arf6-GTP. If, as schematized in Fig. 1A, Lys336 of Arno was solely involved in Arf6-GTP binding, the K336A mutation should abolish the stimulatory effect of Arf6-GTP (red traces) without changing the activity level of Arno in the absence of Arf6-GTP (blue traces). Surprisingly, however, the K336A mutation rendered Arno inactive regardless of the presence of Arf6-GTP (Fig. 1C). This observation was puzzling because the K336A mutant was indistinguishable from wild type Arno in other biochemical assays (Fig. 1, D and E). Although mostly autoinhibited, Arno displays some activity in solution on a soluble form of Arf1 ([Δ17]Arf1). This activity is detectable at higher concentration than on liposomes (100 and 7.5 nm, respectively) and gives, when compared with the activity of the isolated Sec7 domain, an estimate of the inhibitory constraint imposed by the PH domain (30DiNitto J.P. Delprato A. Gabe Lee M.T. Cronin T.C. Huang S. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 569-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In solution, both wild-type Arno and the K336A mutant displayed 7% of the exchange activity of the isolated Sec7 domain (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the mutation did not induce gross structural defects in Arno. In line with this, we observed no difference between wild-type Arno and the K336A mutant by size exclusion chromatography and limited proteolysis (supplemental Fig. S2). Liposome-binding experiments also showed that the K336A mutant bound to PIP2 plus PS liposomes as well as wild-type Arno (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, the K336A mutation is puzzling because it totally prevents Arno from activating Arf1 on a membrane surface, whereas it affects neither the interaction of Arno with lipids nor the level of autoinhibition as tested in solution. The surprising behavior of Arno K336A prompted us to examine other mutants. We focused on three surfaces of Arno PH domain (Fig. 2A). Region 1 corresponds to the phosphoinositide-binding site (18Cronin T.C. DiNitto J.P. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3711-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Region 2 includes K336 and other neighboring residues, such as Ile303, that are important for the interaction of the isolated PH domain with Arf6 and Arl4 (29Várnai P. Bondeva T. Tamás P. Tóth B.

New strategies for beneficial anti-inflammatory therapies would be highly desirable. Apolipoprotein (apo) E has immunomodulatory effects and synthetically derived apoE-mimetic peptides are beneficial in models of sepsis and neuroinflammation. We have reported that the antennapedia-linked apoE-mimetic peptide COG112 inhibits the inflammatory response to the colitis-inducing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium in vitro by inhibiting NF-κB activation. We now determined the effect of COG112 in mouse models of colitis. Using C. rodentium as an infection model, and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as an injury model, mice were treated with COG112 by intraperitoneal injection. With C. rodentium, COG112 improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight, colon weight, and histologic injury. With DSS, COG112 ameliorated the loss of body weight, reduction in colon length, and histologic injury, whether administered concurrently with induction of colitis, during induction plus recovery, or only during the recovery phase of disease. In both colitis models, COG112 inhibited colon tissue inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), KC, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17 mRNA expression, and reduced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. IκB kinase (IKK) activity was also reduced, which is necessary for activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Isolated colonic epithelial cells exhibited marked attenuation of expression of iNOS and the CXC chemokines KC and MIP-2. These studies indicate that apoE-mimetic peptides such as COG112 are novel potential therapies for IBD."

https://openalex.org/W2013907875,"To find a common pathogenetic trait induced by polyQ-expanded proteins, we have used a conditional expression system in PC12 cells to tune the expression of these proteins and analyze the early and late consequences of their expression. We find that expression for 3 h of a polyQ-expanded protein stimulates cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and significantly reduces the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. 24-36 h later, ROS induce DNA damage and activation of the checkpoint kinase, ATM. DNA damage signatures are reversible and persist as long as polyQ-expanded proteins are expressed. Transcription of neural and stress response genes is down-regulated in these cells. Selective inhibition of ATM or histone deacetylase rescues transcription and restores the expression of silenced genes. Eventually, after 1 week, the expression of polyQ-expanded protein also induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. As to the primary mechanism responsible for ROS generation, we find that polyQ-expanded proteins, including native Ataxin-2 and Huntingtin, are selectively sequestered in the lipid raft membrane compartment and interact with gp91, the membrane NADPH-oxidase subunit. Selective inhibition of NADPH oxidase or silencing of H-Ras signaling dissolves the aggregates and eliminates DNA damage. We suggest that targeting of the polyQ-expanded proteins to the lipid rafts activates the resident NADPH oxidase. This triggers a signal linking H-Ras, ROS, and ERK1/2 that maintains and propagates the ROS wave to the nucleus. This mechanism may represent the common pathogenetic signature of all polyQ-expanded proteins independently of the specific context or the function of the native wild type protein."

Agonist-stimulated GPCRs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors that stimulate G protein α subunit (Gα) GDP release. Subsequent GTP binding to Gα causes heterotrimer dissociation or rearrangement so that Gα-GTP and Gβγ adopt states for efficient activation of downstream effector enzymes. Purified G protein subunits have been essential reagents used to develop the current understanding of G protein function, structure, and signaling pathways (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Current knowledge of traditional G protein signaling network complexity is expanding, and G proteins have been assigned new nontraditional signaling roles including regulation of cell division through unique classes of effector and modulatory enzymes (3Blumer J.B.

As cross-disciplinary G protein research proliferates, the need for purified components to elucidate G protein functionality is significant. G protein-coupled receptor adenylyl cyclase β-adrenergic receptor G protein αs short isoform guanosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate phospholipase Cβ yellow fluorescent protein 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid [inositol-2-3H(N)]-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. G protein heterotrimers are classified by the identity of the guanine nucleotide-binding subunit: Gα. There are four classes of Gα subunits: Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13. Efficient procedures are in place to produce most Gαi class subunits and Gαs from Escherichia coli (6Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G.

Members of the Gαq and Gα12/13 classes can be prepared from an insect cell expression system using a Gβγ co-purification procedure. This method involves tagging the Gγ subunit with a His6 tag, isolating the trimeric G protein by metal chelate chromatography, and eluting the Gα with high specificity using GTP mimicry. This method is tried and true but rather laborious and involves extensive steps of cell membrane preparation, washing, and detergent extraction. The procedure also results in low Gα yields (≤50–200 μg of protein/liter of cell culture) (8Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G.

To our knowledge, the prime target of the largest class of GPCRs, olfactory-specific Gαolf (a Gαs family member) has not been purified in sufficient, active quantity to permit its characterization. While characterizing the G protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Ric-8 (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8), a series of observations were made that led us to hypothesize that Ric-8 proteins could be used as molecular tools to prepare recombinant Gα subunits: 1) Ric-8A and Ric-8B collectively bound all four Gα subunit classes (12Klattenhoff C. Montecino M. Soto X. Guzmán L. Romo X. García M.A. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Hinrichs M.V. Olate J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Tall G.G.

Gαi1 formed a stable complex with GST-Ric-8A in the presence of GDP but was dissociated by GTP(γS) (13Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Here we introduce a method for Gα subunit purification that substantially improves upon established methods in its simplicity, uniformity of application toward all Gα subunit classes, and yield and purity of G protein obtained. Co-expression of GST-tagged Ric-8A or B and Gα subunits in insect cells permitted the isolation of GST-Ric-8·Gα complexes from whole cell detergent lysates with glutathione-Sepharose. Gα subunits were recovered specifically from this matrix by elution with AlF4− and desalted. This procedure allowed the first production of active Gαolf, an olfactory/brain-specific stimulator of adenylyl cyclase. Using in vitro effector enzyme reconstitution assays, we show that the Gα subunits produced by these means are functional proteins and demonstrate that Gαolf is a less potent and efficacious activator of adenylyl cyclase isoforms than equivalently produced Gαs short. HEK293 cells were co-transfected as described (21Oner S.S. Maher E.M. Breton B. Bouvier M. Blumer J.B. J. Biol.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested with Tyrode's solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% glucose (m/v)) and distributed in triplicate at 1 × 105 cells/well into gray 96-well plates. Total fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 535 nm) was measured to quantify Gαi1-YFP or Gαs-YFP expression using a TriStar LB 941 plate reader (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). The data are plotted in relative fluorescent units and are the averages of three independent transfection experiments. GST-tagged Ric-8A and untagged G protein α subunit baculoviruses were described previously (8Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G.

A GST-Ric-8B baculovirus-targeting construct was created using linker-based PCR to amplify full-length mouse Ric-8B from a purchased clone (Invitrogen LLAM collection clone 6490136 in pCMV-Sport6). The amplified product was digested and ligated into the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pFASTBac GST-tobacco etch virus (13Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The resultant amino acid sequences of the tagged Ric-8 proteins were N′-GST-tobacco etch virus site -Glu(E)-Phe(F)-Ric-8-C′. If cleaved by tobacco etch virus protease digestion, the sequences become N′-Gly(G)-Glu(E)-Phe(F)-Ric-8-C′. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced after transfection of adherent Sf9 cells per the manufacturer's instructions (Bac-to-Bac system; Invitrogen). The transfection viral medium supernatants were harvested after 9 days, and 1100 culture volumes were amplified twice for 5 days in log phase Sf9 suspension cells grown in shake flasks at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml. Suspension Sf9 cells were grown in IPL41 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS. Secondarily amplified viruses (5–10 ml of GST-Ric-8 and 5–15 ml of Gα) were used to co-infect 1-liter High Five insect cell cultures growing at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen). After 48 h expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g and stored as a cell paste at −80 °C until use. The optimal amounts and ratios of secondary amplified viruses used were determined empirically in smaller sized culture (50–200 ml) prior to conducting large scale (1 liter) preparations (supplemental Fig. 1S). High Five insect cells (200 ml) grown in suspension to a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml were infected with 1100 volumes of twice amplified GST-Ric-8A and/or Gαq baculovirus stocks for 48 h. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g and lysed in 200 ml of Buffer N (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 11 mm CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture) by Parr bomb nitrogen cavitation. The detergent whole cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, passaged through a 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a 5-ml Hi trap Q column at 1 ml/min using a Bio-Rad Duoflow system. The column was washed with Buffer N and eluted with a linear gradient to 500 mm NaCl in Buffer N. Fractions of the eluate were collected as the gradient developed. Fractions containing Gαq were analyzed by Western blot with anti-Gαq/11 antibody, C-19 (Santa Cruz, Inc. SC-392), Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis, and the GTPγS nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Cell pastes were suspended in 300 ml of detergent lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (m/v) Genapol C100 detergent (Calbiochem), containing protease inhibitor mixture; (23 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, 21 μg/ml l-1-p-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl-chloromethyl ketone, 3.3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3.3 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor)) and stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The detergent lysates were homogenized/disrupted by nitrogen cavitation using a Parr Bomb (Parr Instrument, Moline, IL), or by tight pestle Dounce homogenization (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). The lysates were centrifuged sequentially at 3000 × g for 10 min and 100,000 × g for 45 min. The clarified detergent supernatants were loaded onto packed 5-ml bed volume glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns driven by gravity. The column flow through was reapplied to this matrix one time. The columns were washed with 20 column volumes of CHAPS buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 11 mm CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture) and then warmed to 22 °C. To elute Gα subunits, 50 ml of 30 °C AMF buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 30 μm AlCl3, 11 mm CHAPS, and 100 μm GTP) was applied to the columns and allowed to flow through slowly. Gα subunits were typically eluted in the first 10–15 ml with this elution buffer. Ric-8 proteins were then eluted with CHAPS buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. Gα yield was measured by Bradford assay, and purity was estimated by Image J (version 10.2) analysis of full Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel lanes. AlF4− and excess MgCl2 removal could be accomplished by passaging Gα subunits through PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare). Gα subunits in AMF buffer were concentrated in Vivaspin-20 30,000 molecular weight cut-off ultrafiltration centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Goettingen, Germany) to a final volume of 2.5 ml (no more than 5 mg/ml protein) and passaged onto a PD-10 column pre-equilibrated with CHAPS storage buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μm GDP, and 11 mm CHAPS). Gα subunits were eluted by gravity in 3.5 ml of storage buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Aliquoted Gα concentrated proteins were snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The preferred method of AlF4− and MgCl2 removal was gel filtration of concentrated Gα subunits through Superdex 75 and 200 10/300 GL columns arranged in tandem (GE Healthcare). Superdex chromatography thoroughly removed the chemical and some minor protein impurities. Gα subunits (2.5 mg) eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose columns with Mg·GDP·AlF4 were concentrated to 550 μl in CHAPS storage buffer by ultrafiltration. The Superdex columns were equilibrated with CHAPS storage buffer and precalibrated with gel filtration sizing standards (Bio-Rad). Gα subunits were pumped through the columns at 0.3 ml/min using a Bio-Rad Duoflow System, and fractions of the column eluate were collected using a fraction collector. Fractions containing monomeric Gα subunits were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. High Five insect cells (25 ml of suspension culture) were grown to 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in Sf900 II medium (Invitrogen) and infected with 250 μl of twice amplified Gαi1, and GST or GST-Ric-8A baculovirus stocks. The cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 12.5 ml of detergent-free buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) by nitrogen cavitation using a Parr bomb. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g, and the membranes were then separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation of the 500 × g supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Reducing Laemmli sample buffer was added to the supernatant (soluble) and membrane fractions, and the samples were boiled and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 4 m urea in the resolving gel. The gels were Western blotted with anti-Gαi1/2 antiserum (BO84) to detect myristoylated and unmodified Gαi1 (25Mumby S.M. Kahn R.A. Manning D.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Gα subunits (2.5 μm each) were incubated with 100 μm GDP in HEDL buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% m/v deionized polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (C12E10)) alone or in HEDL buffer containing 30 μm AlCl3, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF on ice for 30 min. Gα subunits were then incubated for 10 or 30 min with the following concentrations of trypsin that had been pretreated with 25 ng/ml l-1-p-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl-chloromethyl ketone; Gαq, 0.1% (m/v) (22 °C); Gα13, 0.25% (m/v) (22 °C); Gαi1, 0.25% (m/v) (30 °C); and Gαs short and Gαolf, 0.5% (m/v) (30 °C). The reactions were quenched by the addition of 40 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor and reducing SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the protein fragments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Intrinsic and Ric-8-assisted GTPγS binding assays were performed as reported previously (13Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Duplicate aliquots were taken from the reactions at specific time points, quenched in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 0.08% (m/v) deionized polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether C12E10, and filtered onto BA-85 nitrocellulose filters (GE Healthcare). The filters were washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, dried, and subjected to scintillation counting. To quantify the amount of GTPγS-binding proteins present in the HiTrap Q Gαq column eluate fractions, 400 nm purified Ric-8A was mixed with each fraction, and the assay was performed for 30 min at 30 °C. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described previously so that the final reaction (60 μl) contained 200 μm phosphatidylethanolamine and 50 μm [inositol-2-3H(N)]-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at 6–8000 cpm/assay (31Lehmann D.M. Yuan C. Smrcka A.V. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). PLCβ2 or PLCβ3 were added at 10 ng/assay. Gαq was diluted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μm GDP, and 0.15% (m/v) β-octylglucoside (final assay concentration). To activate Gαq, Gαq was diluted in the same buffer but with 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3. The PLC reactions were initiated by the addition of 2.8 mm CaCl2 (1 μm free Ca2+), and the samples were incubated at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10% (m/v) trichloroacetic acid, followed by the addition of 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA. Precipitated proteins and lipids were centrifuged, and 300 μl of the inositol trisphosphate-containing supernatant was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. In all assays, blank solutions corresponding to the storage buffers for each of the proteins were included such that all of the reactions had exactly the same solution components. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant adenylyl cyclase (AC) 3, 5, or 6 baculoviruses. The cells were collected 48 h after infection, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture), and lysed by nitrogen cavitation using a Parr bomb. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min to isolate total cell membranes. The membranes were washed and homogenized into membrane storage buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 20% (m/v) sucrose, 1 mm DTT + protease inhibitor mixture) using a Dounce homogenizer with tight pestle. Membrane homogenates were frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. G proteins were loaded with [35S]GTPγS and isolated by gel filtration chromatography as described previously (14Tall G.G. Gilman A.G.

We tested whether the expression of Gαs short or Gαi1 was up-regulated by co-overexpression of Ric-8 homologs. Ric-8A or two Ric-8B isoforms were co-transfected in HEK293 cells with YFP-tagged Gαs short or Gαi1 subunits. Fluorescence intensity measurements of intact cells were used (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 535 nm) to quantify the relative amounts of expressed YFP-Gα in each condition of Ric-8 expression. Ric-8BFL specifically potentiated YFP-Gαs expression, whereas Ric-8A and, to a lesser degree, Ric-8BFL potentiated YFP-Gαi expression (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with the observed Ric-8 binding specificities to Gα subunits, with the exception that Ric-8BΔ9 binds Gαs but did not enhance its expression. The insect cell protein expression system is the method of choice for purification of G protein subunits resistant to expression in E. coli (8Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G.

Purification of many insect cell-expressed Gα subunits (Gαq and Gα12/13 families) is laborious and results in low yield of final product. We know of no example in which Gαolf has been purified by this method successfully. Because Ric-8 proteins promoted Gα subunit expression in mammalian cells, we tested whether they could also potentiate recombinant Gα subunit expression in insect cells for the eventual purpose of using this system to develop an enhanced method of Gα subunit purification. High Five insect cells were infected with untagged Gαq, or Gαq and GST-Ric-8A recombinant baculoviruses. Whole detergent lysates of pelleted cells were prepared, clarified, and chromatographed over HiTrap Q anion exchange columns. The columns were washed and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. Consecutive fractions of the column eluates that contained Gαq were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained or Western blotted with an anti-Gαq/11 antibody. Co-expression of GST-Ric-8A with Gαq dramatically potentiated the amount of Gαq recovered from the column ∼25-fold in comparison with the condition where GST-Ric-8A was not expressed (Fig. 1B). The Gαq obtained from this one-step purification procedure was ≥50% pure and was tested functionally in respect to its capacity to bind GTPγS in a Ric-8A-dependent manner. An equal portion of each HiTrap Q column eluate fraction was supplemented with purified Ric-8A (400 nm) and allowed to bind radiolabeled GTPγS for 30 min at 25 °C. The amount of active G protein present in each fraction was determined by quantifying the amount of protein-bound nucleotide using a nitrocellulose filter binding method.

We recently described that Vav3, an activator of Rho/Rac GTPases, is an Ahr transcriptional target in embryonic fibroblasts. These results prompted us to compare the Ahr−/− and Vav3−/− mouse phenotypes to investigate the implications of this functional interaction in vivo. Here, we show that Ahr is important for Vav3 expression in kidney, lung, heart, liver, and brainstem regions. This process is not affected by the administration of potent Ahr ligands such as benzo[a]pyrene. We also report that Ahr- and Vav3-deficient mice display hypertension, tachypnea, and sympathoexcitation. The Ahr gene deficiency also induces the GABAergic transmission defects present in the Vav3−/− ventrolateral medulla, a main cardiorespiratory brainstem center. However, Ahr−/− mice, unlike Vav3-deficient animals, display additional defects in fertility, perinatal growth, liver size and function, closure, spleen size, and peripheral lymphocytes. These results demonstrate that Vav3 is a bona fide Ahr target that is in charge of a limited subset of the developmental and physiological functions controlled by this transcriptional factor. Our data also reveal the presence of sympathoexcitation and new cardiorespiratory defects in Ahr−/− mice.

Although the biological cause of most of those defects remains unknown, recent reports have linked some of them to specific Ahr transcriptional targets. For example, the liver fibrosis seems to be mediated by the derepression of latent TGF-β-binding protein 1 in Ahr−/− mice (30Corchero J. Martín-Partido G. Dallas S.L. Fernández-Salguero P.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Santiago-Josefat B. Mulero-Navarro S. Dallas S.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. J.

Biol. 2008; 380: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The increased wound healing observed in the skin of Ahr−/− mice has also been linked to increased TGF-β signaling in keratinocytes (33Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Roman A.C. Cerezo-Guisado M.I. Rico-Leo E.M. Martin-Partido G. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, the high retinoic acid content of livers from neonate Ahr−/− mice has been associated with reduced expression of the Cyp2C39 gene, a cytochrome P450 family member that displays retinoic acid 4-hydrolase activity (34Andreola F. Hayhurst G.P. Luo G. Ferguson S.S. Gonzalez F.J. Goldstein J.A. De Luca L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3434-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the transcriptional deregulation of other Ahr gene targets could contribute to additional dysfunctions present in Ahr-deficient mice. We have recently reported that Ahr regulates the constitutive expression levels of the Vav3 proto-oncogene in MEFs and immortalized fibroblasts (35Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Mulero-Navarro S. Roman A.C. Sauzeau V. Merino J.M. Bustelo X.R. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene encodes a tyrosine phosphorylation GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rho/Rac family GTPases that plays important roles in cytoskeleton-linked signaling events activated by transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (36Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 37Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Recent genetic experiments using knock-out mice have revealed that this GDP/GTP exchange factor is important for cardiovascular homeostasis (38Sauzeau V. Sevilla M.A. Rivas-Elena J.V. de Alava E.

Cooperating with other Vav family members (Vav1 and Vav2), Vav3 also participates in the development, selection, and antigen responses of lymphocytes (43Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), the effector functions of other hematopoietic lineages, angiogenesis (43Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev.

Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2005; 46: 205-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The regulation of Vav3 by Ahr relies on the recognition of one of the three XRE sites present in the Vav3 gene promoter and, unexpectedly, takes place in a ligand-independent manner (35Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Mulero-Navarro S. Roman A.C. Sauzeau V. Merino J.M. Bustelo X.R. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vav3 appears to be a bona fide Ahr target, because Ahr−/− and Vav3−/− MEFs show similar cytoskeletal defects (35Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Mulero-Navarro S. Roman A.C. Sauzeau V. Merino J.M. Bustelo X.R. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the defective cytoskeletal properties of Ahr-deficient MEFs can be rescued by overexpressing Vav3 (35Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Mulero-Navarro S. Roman A.C. Sauzeau V. Merino J.M. Bustelo X.R. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These above observations prompted new questions, including the issues of whether Ahr controls Vav3 expression in other cell types and tissues, the actual physiological relevance of this new functional relationship, and whether the lack of Vav3 expression can recapitulate some of the phenotypic defects found in Ahr-deficient mice. To approach those issues, we decided to focus our attention on the side-by-side comparison of Ahr- (25Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W.

Here, we provide evidence indicating that Ahr controls the expression of Vav3, but not other Vav family members, in a tissue-dependent manner in vivo. We also report previously unknown functions for Ahr in the control of brainstem-dependent functions, including cardiovascular and breathing activity, that mimic those observed in Vav3-deficient mice. Ahr and Vav3 knock-out mice have been reported previously (25Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

Unless otherwise stated, 4-month-old mice were used in experiments. When appropriate, and depending on the experiment performed, animals were anesthetized with either sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg body weight, Sigma) or urethane (2 mg/kg body weight, Sigma). All animal work was carried out following regulations set forth by the respective Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Salamanca University, and Extremadura University Animal Care and Use Committees. Vav3, Vav2, and Ahr mRNA levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in indicated tissues. To this end, total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), retrotranscribed (QuantiTech SYBR Green RT-PCR kit, Qiagen), and amplified in an iCycler iQ apparatus (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green as the fluorescent probe. PCR controls included amplifications of RpLp0 mRNA. Sequences of primers used are available upon request. Wild type mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg of body weight of benzo[a]pyrene (Sigma) and euthanized 24 h later for tissue extraction. In the case of direct determinations, mice were slightly anesthetized with urethane (1 mg/kg body weight). In stereotaxic experiments, mice were deeply anesthetized with urethane (see under “Animal Use”). In both cases, mice were connected in their diaphragm region with a flexible wire to a force transducer. Breathing parameters under study were collected using a digital data recorder (MacLab/4e, AD Instruments) and integrated using the Chart version 3.4 software (AD Instruments). Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and arterial pressures recorded by catheterization of the right carotid artery with a pressure probe connected to a digital data recorder (MacLab/4e, AD Instruments), as described previously (49Jerkic M. Rivas-Elena J.V. Prieto M. Carrón R. Sanz-Rodríguez F. Pérez-Barriocanal F. Rodríguez-Barbero A. Bernabéu C. López-Novoa J.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 609-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recordings were subsequently analyzed with the Chart version 3.4 software (AD Instruments). Blood pressure and heart rates were recorded after a 20-min-long stabilization period of animals after catheterization. Blood pressure and heart frequency were also recorded in conscious mice using the tail-cuff method with an automated multichannel system and a photoelectric sensor (Niprem 546, Cibertec SA). Angiotensin converting enzyme activities in heart extracts were determined using a luminescence method (50Chevillard C. Brown N.L. Mathieu M.N. Laliberté F. Worcel M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 147: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ELISA kits were used to measure plasma levels of AngII (angiotensin II ELISA kit, SPI Bio), adrenaline (CatCombi ELISA, IBL), and noradrenaline (CatCombi ELISA, IBL). In the case of catecholamine determinations, animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital before euthanasia. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and paraffin-embedded. 2–3-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma). For immunohistochemical experiments, tissue sections were incubated with commercial antibodies obtained from either Millipore/Chemicon (tyrosine hydroxylase, v-GAT, GAD65, and GAD67) or Sigma (GABAA receptor, GABA). In the case of Vav3, a homemade rabbit polyclonal antibody was used (36Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 39Quevedo C. Sauzeau V. Menacho-Márquez M. Castro-Castro A. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1125-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After overnight incubations, tissue slides were rinsed with PBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a milk/phosphate-buffered saline solution containing a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare), rinsed with PBS, and developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako). Alternatively, we used Cy5- and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) to visualize the recognized proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. Quantifications of immunohistochemical experiments were done blindly using the Metamorph-Metaview software (Molecular Devices). Quantification of fluorescence signals was done using the LSM Image Browser software (version 3.2.0.115, Zeiss). For quantification of the total collagen present in tissues, the hydroxyproline content was determined using a spectrophotometric method (51Flores O. Arévalo M. Gallego B. Hidalgo F. Vidal S. López-Novoa J.M. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Total collagen was calculated assuming that collagen contains a 12.7% of hydroxyproline. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, treated with proteinase K (Dako), washed with PBS, and soaked in 2× SSC. Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled Ahr and Vav3 sense and antisense cRNA probes were synthesized using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Template plasmids for the reverse transcription were pVS27 (for Ahr, nucleotides 915–1413) (52Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe N. Chujoh Y. Matsushita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and pVS2 (for Vav3, nucleotides 2181–2661) (36Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After the probe hybridization for 6 h at room temperature, signals were detected using the digoxigenin nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The terminology used for mouse brainstem regions was taken from a well known brain atlas (53Frankin B.J. Paxinos G.T. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). The RVLM was considered as the VLM region limited medially by the gigantocellular reticular nucleus and the inferior olive; laterally by the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract; ventrally by the ventral medullar surface; dorsally by the nucleus ambiguus and the reticular formation; caudally by the rostral pole of the lateral reticular nucleus; and rostrally by the caudal pole of the facial motor nucleus. The CVLM was considered as the brainstem area flanked by the lateral reticular nucleus rostral wings and located immediately caudal to the RVLM. Mice were anesthetized with urethane, cannulated in the carotid artery to monitor in real time arterial pressure variations, and gently placed in a stereotaxic device (Kopf). After exposing the skull, the position of the head was adjusted under the visual guidance of a microscope in the stereotaxic apparatus so that the height of the skull surface at the lambda and bregma was the same (53Frankin B.J. Paxinos G.T. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). The interaural and midlines were taken as landmarks for the stereotaxic coordinates as follows: RVLM (3.05 mm caudal and 0.20 mm ventral to the interaural line and 1.20 mm lateral to the midline) and CVLM (3.45 mm caudal and 0.1 mm ventral relative to the interaural line and 1.15 mm lateral to the midline). After drilling a window in the occipital bone, we microinjected bilaterally buffered vehicle (30 nl), bicuculline (50 pmol in 30 nl, Sigma), and/or l-glutamate (100 pmol in 30 nl, Sigma) using a 40-μm internal diameter glass micropipette attached to a Hamilton syringe. When muscimol (Sigma) was used, 10 pmol in 30 nl were microinjected unilaterally. Environmental conditions (light, temperature, and background noise) were kept constant during experiments. Optimal targeting of the RVLM region in the l-glutamate experiments was confirmed by injecting the same neurotransmitter in the CVLM, since this molecule is known to induce different effects in both blood pressure levels and breathing rates if injected in each of those areas. Furthermore, we also introduced the same drug in areas close to the initial injection site to confirm that the physiological response obtained in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems was restricted to the targeted VLM area (in the case of wild type animals) or, alternatively, to verify that the absence of physiological responses in Ahr−/− and Vav3−/− mice was not due microinjections made outside the desired VLM region. Finally, we also microinjected in the targeted regions 30 nl of a 1% solution of Fast Green FCF104022 (Merck) and, after sacrificing the mice, obtained tissue sections from the brainstem to verify the localization of the marker by direct microscope examination. Experimental data were analyzed using either the one-tailed Student's t test or the one-way analysis of variance test depending on the type of experiment performed. p values lower than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. In all figures, values are given as the mean ± S.E. We have shown previously that Ahr is required for the constitutive expression of Vav3 in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (35Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Mulero-Navarro S. Roman A.C. Sauzeau V. Merino J.M. Bustelo X.R. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To verify whether this is a general effect in other cell types, we evaluated by RT-PCR the expression levels of Vav3 transcripts in a number of tissues obtained from adult wild type and Ahr−/− mice. We observed that Vav3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the kidney, lung, heart, and liver of Ahr-deficient mice relative to those found in control tissues (see supplemental Fig. S1A). Such effect was tissue-specific, since we found no statistically significant variations in Vav3 transcript levels in samples obtained from Ahr−/− cerebella (supplemental Fig. S1A). Ahr was only required for proper expression of this Vav family member, because no significant changes were observed in Vav2 mRNA levels between Ahr−/− and control samples (supplemental Fig. S1B). We found no changes in the expression of the Ahr mRNA in tissues obtained from wild type and Vav3-deficient mice (supplemental Fig. S1C), indicating that the Ahr/Vav3 functional interaction is established in a unidirectional manner. Confirming previous cell culture experiments using MEFs (35Carvajal-Gonzalez J.M. Mulero-Navarro S. Roman A.C. Sauzeau V. Merino J.M. Bustelo X.R. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed no elevation of Vav3 mRNA levels upon intraperitoneal administration of a strong Ahr activator (benzo[a]pyrene) to wild type mice (supplemental Fig. S1D). These results indicate that, unlike other Ahr transcriptional targets (1Denison M.S. Nagy S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 4Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mimura J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), the regulation of the constitutive expression of the Vav3 proto-oncogene does not seem to entail activation of Ahr by xenobiotics.

https://openalex.org/W2050409652,"In response to blood vessel injury, hemostasis is initiated by platelet activation, advanced by thrombin generation, and tempered by fibrinolysis. The primary fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, can be activated either on a fibrin-containing thrombus or on cells. Annexin A2 (A2) heterotetramer (A2·p11)(2) is a key profibrinolytic complex that assembles plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator and promotes plasmin generation. We now report that, in endothelial cells, plasmin specifically induces activation of conventional PKC, which phosphorylates serine 11 and serine 25 of A2, triggering dissociation of the (A2·p11)(2) tetramer. The resulting free p11 undergoes ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thus preventing further translocation of A2 to the cell surface. In vivo, pretreatment of A2(+/+) but not A2(-/-) mice with a conventional PKC inhibitor significantly reduced thrombosis in a carotid artery injury model. These results indicate that augmentation of fibrinolytic vascular surveillance by blockade of serine phosphorylation is A2-dependent. We also demonstrate that plasmin-induced phosphorylation of A2 requires both cleavage of A2 and activation of Toll-like receptor 4 on the cell surface. We propose that plasmin can limit its own generation by triggering a finely tuned ""feedback"" mechanism whereby A2 becomes serine-phosphorylated, dissociates from p11, and fails to translocate to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1998926494,"Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a critical activator of multiple prosurvival and oncogenic protein kinases and has garnered considerable interest as an oncology drug target. Despite progress characterizing PDK1 as a therapeutic target, pharmacological support is lacking due to the prevalence of nonspecific inhibitors. Here, we benchmark literature and newly developed inhibitors and conduct parallel genetic and pharmacological queries into PDK1 function in cancer cells. Through kinase selectivity profiling and x-ray crystallographic studies, we identify an exquisitely selective PDK1 inhibitor (compound 7) that uniquely binds to the inactive kinase conformation (DFG-out). In contrast to compounds 1–5, which are classical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors (DFG-in), compound 7 specifically inhibits cellular PDK1 T-loop phosphorylation (Ser-241), supporting its unique binding mode. Interfering with PDK1 activity has minimal antiproliferative effect on cells growing as plastic-attached monolayer cultures (i.e. standard tissue culture conditions) despite reduced phosphorylation of AKT, RSK, and S6RP. However, selective PDK1 inhibition impairs anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and cancer cell migration. Compound 7 inhibits colony formation in a subset of cancer cell lines (four of 10) and primary xenograft tumor lines (nine of 57). RNAi-mediated knockdown corroborates the PDK1 dependence in cell lines and identifies candidate biomarkers of drug response.

https://openalex.org/W2095004364,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is considered to be a major factor contributing to liver fibrosis. We have previously shown that nuclear translocation of YB-1 antagonizes the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling in regulating collagen gene expression. More recently, we have demonstrated that the novel small compound HSc025 promotes nuclear translocation of YB-1, resulting in the improvement of skin and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we presented evidence as to the mechanism by which HSc025 stimulates nuclear translocation of YB-1 and the pharmacological effects of HSc025 on a murine model of hepatic fibrosis. A proteomics approach and binding assays using HSc025-immobilized resin showed that HSc025 binds to the amino acid sequence within the C-tail region of YB-1. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays identified poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) as one of the cytoplasmic anchor proteins of YB-1. HSc025 directly binds to YB-1 and interrupts its interaction with PABP, resulting in accelerated nuclear translocation of YB-1. Transfection of cells with PABP siRNA promoted nuclear translocation of YB-1 and subsequently inhibited basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen gene expression. Moreover, HSc025 significantly suppressed collagen gene expression in cultured activated hepatic stellate cells. Oral administration of HSc025 to mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis improved liver injury as well as the degree of hepatic fibrosis.

Altogether, the results provide a novel insight into therapy for organ fibrosis using YB-1 modulators. Irrespective of the initial stimuli, excessive deposition of extracellular matrix is a common hallmark of fibrotic disease in various organs, including the liver (1Inagaki Y. Okazaki I. Gut. 2007; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Hepatic fibrosis is a common response to chronic liver injury, which ultimately leads to cirrhosis and is often associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. When fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis, a number of life-threatening complications associated with portal hypertension and liver failure occur, including variceal bleeding, ascites formation, and the hepatorenal syndrome (2Albanis E. Friedman S.L. Am. J. Transplant. 2006; 6: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although multiple factors play a role in fibrogenesis, it is well recognized that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is the key molecule accelerating hepatic fibrosis (1Inagaki Y. Okazaki I. Gut. 2007; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). TGF-β stimulates gene expression of profibrogenic molecules such as collagen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Identification and characterization of Smad proteins, intracellular mediators of the signal transduction of TGF-β superfamily members, have led to a better understanding of the precise mechanisms of TGF-β actions from the viewpoint of its intracellular signaling pathway and cross-talk with other cytokines (3Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Gene Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). We have been studying a number of growth factors and cytokines that antagonize TGF-β/Smad signaling as well as their application in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. For example, hepatocyte growth factor, which was originally identified as a potent mitogen for adult rat hepatocytes, has subsequently been revealed to suppress experimental hepatic fibrosis (4Matsuda Y. Matsumoto K. Ichida T. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Yasuda H. Imai E. Shiota A. Fujise N. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 636-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that hepatocyte growth factor suppresses profibrogenic signal transduction via nuclear export of Smad3 with galectin-7 (6Inagaki Y. Higashi K. Kushida M. Hong Y.Y. Nakao S.

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a pleiotropic cytokine produced by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, is also antagonistic to TGF-β in the transcriptional regulation of extracellular matrix genes, including collagen type I (7Kähäri V.M.

Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of YB-1 driven by a collagen enhancer suppressed the progression of hepatic fibrosis and enhanced the antifibrotic effects of IFN-γ (14Inagaki Y. Kushida M.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a novel small compound HSc025 stimulates nuclear translocation of YB-1 and improves skin and pulmonary fibrosis (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M.

This study was conducted to elucidate the mechanism by which HSc025 promotes nuclear translocation of YB-1 resulting in the blockage of TGF-β signaling. A combination of proteomics studies and immunoprecipitation followed by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assays suggested that HSc025 interrupts the interaction between YB-1 and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) 2The abbreviations used are: PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; APRIL, acidic protein rich in leucine; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; CSD, cold shock domain. through its direct binding to YB-1. Moreover, we demonstrated that HSc025 improves liver injury and fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injections in mice. These findings provide novel insights into possible treatment strategies for hepatic fibrosis using YB-1 modulators. Normal human dermal fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Rat hepatic stellate cells were isolated and purified from the livers of normal rats as described previously (16Kawada N. Kuroki T. Kobayashi K. Inoue M. Kaneda K. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1996; 41: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were excised, digested with Pronase and collagenase, filtered through a nylon mesh, and then centrifuged. The pellet was suspended in Nycodenz solution, and hepatic stellate cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Bacterial expression plasmids were prepared by ligating the respective coding sequence into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pET28a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Rabbit anti-YB-1 and anti-PABP polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan), respectively. Rabbit anti-SET polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. K. Nagata, Tsukuba University (17Saito S. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Nagata K. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HSc025 and its analogs were synthesized in our laboratory (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S.

A Stealth RNAi negative control medium GC duplex was used as a control (Invitrogen). Normal human dermal fibroblasts were transfected with 2 μg of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I.

Forty eight hours later, further transfection was carried out in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h. The amounts of mRNA were quantified using TaqMan probes as described previously (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol.

The relative mRNA expression level of each gene was normalized against that of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene in the same RNA preparation. HSc025-immobilized beads were prepared as described previously (18Tamura T. Terada T. Tanaka A. Bioconjug. Chem. 2003; 14: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, HSc025 was dissolved in 1,3-dioxane and then incubated with 10 mg of beads at room temperature overnight and masked with 2-ethanolamine in N,N-dimethylformamide at room temperature for 2 h. Immobilized beads were stored in 50% methanol at 4 °C. Cytoplasmic extracts from 2 × 108 human fibroblasts were dialyzed against extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgC12, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. For purification of HSc025-binding proteins, 0.5 mg of cytoplasmic extracts was first incubated with 1 mg of nonimmobilized beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound extracts were incubated with nonimmobilized beads again and then reacted with HSc025-immobilized beads three times. Protein-bound beads were washed with extraction buffer five times in each cycle, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli dye, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then visualized by silver staining. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from human fibroblasts as described previously (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-YB-1 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins bound to beads were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then visualized by silver staining. Desired bands were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and solvent extracted, and the resulting MS/MS spectra were searched using the MASCOT search engine as described previously (6Inagaki Y.

Animals used in this study received human care in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Hepatic fibrosis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal injections of 0.1 ml/kg body weight of CCl4 twice a week for 8 weeks as described previously (19Inagaki Y. Nemoto T. Kushida M. Sheng Y. Higashi K. Ikeda K. Kawada N. Shirasaki F. Takehara K. Sugiyama K. Fujii M. Yamauchi H. Nakao A. de Crombrugghe B. Watanabe T. Okazaki I. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 890-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were treated with either 3, 15, and 75 mg/kg/day of HSc025 or vehicle for 4 weeks after injections of carbon tetrachloride for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, liver weights and serum ALT levels were determined. In addition, sections prepared from excised liver specimens were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Azan-Mallory staining. H&E sections were randomly selected and blindly analyzed for the degree of necrosis or hepatocellular vacuolization as markers of hepatic injury. To evaluate the degree of necrosis, a scoring system based on the severity in the centrilobular zone was employed (0; none, 1; less than one hepatocyte layer, 2; one to two layers, 3; three layers and more). Hepatocellular vacuolization was graded based on the proportion of affected hepatocytes (0; none, 1; <25%, 2; 25–50%, 3; 50–75%, 4; >75%). The degree of hepatic fibrosis was semi-quantified using Azan-Mallory-stained sections. Acid-insoluble collagen contents were determined as described previously (20Hirayama C. Morotomi I. Hiroshige K. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised livers were freeze-dried, weighed, and homogenized in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After centrifugation, sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5) was added to pellets, and the acid-insoluble pellets were hydrolyzed with HCl for 20 h at 105 °C, and chloramine T solution was added to desiccated hydrolysates. After adding Ehrlich's solution, each sample was incubated for 15 min at 65 °C and read at 550 nm. Various amounts of hydroxyproline were used as standards. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. The Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical differences between groups, and the Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of histological findings. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. We previously showed that acceleration of nuclear translocation of YB-1 represses collagen gene expression (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43470-43479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, adenovirus-mediated YB-1 expression under the control of the collagen enhancer/promoter significantly suppressed the progression of hepatic fibrosis (14Inagaki Y. Kushida M. Higashi K. Itoh J. Higashiyama R. Hong Y.Y. Kawada N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Bou-Gharios G. Watanabe T. Okazaki I. Ikeda K. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Random screening of a chemical library and modification of hit compounds using the YB-1-dependent collagen promoter assay system revealed that cinnamoyl derivatives activate the nuclear translocation of YB-1. Based on these findings, we recently assessed the actions of a novel form, HSc025 (Fig. 1A), and we showed it to repress TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression in human dermal fibroblasts (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we first examined the inhibitory effects of HSc025 on extracellular matrix gene expression in rat hepatic stellate cells using real time RT-PCR assays. Purified hepatic stellate cells were treated with HSc025 for 6 days, and the expression levels of extracellular matrix genes were determined. As shown in Fig. 1B, exposure of cells to HSc025 significantly ameliorated the spontaneously enhanced gene expression for collagen types I and IV. In addition, consistent with the results of a previous study (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), treatment of cells with HSc025 markedly reduced fibronectin gene expression (Fig. 1B). However, no inhibitory effects were evident on cell proliferation as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (data not shown). The results described above led us to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for nuclear translocation of YB-1 by HSc025. We first searched for interacting proteins using HSc025-immobilized affinity beads (18Tamura T. Terada T. Tanaka A. Bioconjug. Chem. 2003; 14: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After removal of nonspecifically bound proteins by two treatments with nonimmobilized resins, the interacting proteins were purified using HSc025-immobilized resins and identified by mass spectrometry. Interestingly, YB-1 itself was identified as one of the HSc025-binding proteins. Others included several acidic proteins such as SET and APRIL (acidic protein rich in leucine) (data not shown). To confirm the physical interaction with HSc025, pulldown assays using recombinant proteins were performed (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, YB-1 specifically bound to HSc025 resin, and this binding was completely eliminated in the presence of free HSc025. Although SET proteins were associated with HSc025 resin, these interactions were not significantly inhibited in the presence of HSc025. Similarly, APRIL showed a very weak interaction with HSc025 (Fig. 2B). To define the interacting regions of YB-1 with HSc025, YB-1 deletion mutants were prepared, as described previously (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43470-43479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and incubated with HSc025 resin. YB-1 protein has three independent domains as follows: an N-terminal region, a DNA binding region called a cold shock domain (CSD), and a C-tail region (Fig. 2C). The CSD is a highly conserved nucleic acid recognition domain, whereas the C-tail region is thought to interact with other cellular proteins (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43470-43479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The full-length YB-1 protein showed interaction with HSc025, but a deletion mutant deprived of the C-terminal region (N+CSD) did not (Fig. 2C). Although both C and ΔC regions of YB-1 showed interaction with HSc025, further deletion of the amino acid sequence between 204 and 271 led to a complete diminution of binding to HSc025. These results indicated that HSc025 directly binds to the C-tail region of YB-1. A previous study suggested the existence of an anchoring protein responsible for retention of YB-1 in the cytoplasm (21Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because HSc025 directly binds to the C-tail region of YB-1, we anticipated that HSc025 might have effects on associations between YB-1 and any anchoring proteins. To identify the proteins that retain YB-1 in the cytoplasm, we performed immunoprecipitation of HSc025-treated cytoplasmic extracts with anti-YB-1 antibodies. Consistent with the results of a previous study (22Matsumoto K. Tanaka K.J. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1779-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a number of proteins that interact with YB-1 were detected by silver staining (Fig. 3A). However, only one protein with molecular mass of 70 kDa disappeared dramatically on treatment with HSc025 for 1 or 6 h (Fig. 3A). The relevant band was excised, analyzed by mass spectrometry, and identified as PABP. In addition, immunoprecipitation was performed after incubation of nontreated cytoplasmic extracts with HSc025. Interestingly, HSc025 stimulated the dissociation of PABP from YB-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Both YB-1 and PABP are known to be major components of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (23Chernov K.G. Curmi P.A. Hamon L. Mechulam A. Ovchinnikov L.P. Pastré D. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2875-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether HSc025 interrupts the binding between YB-1 and PABP in the absence of mRNA. To this end, we performed GST pulldown assays using GST-fused PABP protein (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, binding between YB-1 and PABP was observed, whereas YB-1 did not associate with GST itself. When HSc025 was added to a solution containing YB-1 and PABP, the interaction between YB-1 and PABP totally disappeared (Fig. 3D). Although the N+CSD region of YB-1 had no interaction with PABP, association between the C-tail region of YB-1 and PABP was observed. As expected, this interaction was completely blocked in the presence of HSc025 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggested that HSc025 interrupts the binding between YB-1 and PABP through its direct binding to the C-tail region of YB-1. The above results suggested that the displacement of PABP by HSc025 accelerates nuclear translocation of YB-1 and subsequently represses fibrotic signaling. To examine this possibility, we employed the RNA interference technique using PABP-specific double-stranded RNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of human fibroblasts with PABP siRNA significantly decreased their expression of PABP protein. On the other hand, down-regulation of PABP expression did not affect the cell number or morphology (data not shown). Under this experimental condition, treatment of cells with PABP siRNA decreased the amounts of cytoplasmic YB-1, whereas it increased the nuclear YB-1 content (Fig. 4B). As expected, down-regulation of PABP expression significantly inhibited basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen gene expression (Fig. 4C) but had no effect on the expression level of YB-1 (data not shown). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the HSc025-induced displacement of PABP promoted nuclear translocation of YB-1, resulting in transcriptional repression of collagen gene. We have recently demonstrated that oral administration of HSc025 prevents tissue fibrosis in murine models of systemic sclerosis (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the last set of experiments, we examined whether HSc025 suppressed the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Mice were treated with HSc025 for 4 weeks after initial CCl4 injections for 4 weeks. Although oral administration of HSc025 had no effect on body weight or food intake throughout the experiments (data not shown), treatment of mice with HSc025 reduced the relative liver weight in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The serum ALT levels were also significantly decreased in HSc025-treated mice as compared with control animals (Fig. 5B). Necropsy showed that the pale color of the injured liver surface tended to improve on treatment with HSc025 (data not shown). In addition, protective effects of HSc025 on CCl4-induced liver injury were estimated by histological examination. Exposure to CCl4 caused remarkable changes in the morphology of hepatocytes. Hepatocytes undergo necrosis in the centrilobular area (zone 3), and formation of fibrous septa was also observed. In addition, many hepatocytes were severely vacuolated, and some of them showed a balloon appearance in CCl4-treated mice (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5C, oral administration of HSc025 to CCl4-treated mice clearly reduced necrosis and vacuolization of hepatocytes. The degree of necrosis and hepatocellular vacuolization as representative markers of hepatic injury was significantly decreased by HSc025 administration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). The antifibrotic potential of HSc025 was further evaluated by histological examination. Consistent with a previous study (19Inagaki Y. Nemoto T. Kushida M. Sheng Y. Higashi K. Ikeda K. Kawada N. Shirasaki F. Takehara K. Sugiyama K. Fujii M. Yamauchi H. Nakao A. de Crombrugghe B. Watanabe T. Okazaki I. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 890-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), progressive hepatic fibrosis was induced by repeated CCl4 injections (Fig. 5E, Control). Oral administration of HSc025 to CCl4-treated mice reduced the extracellular matrix deposition (Fig. 5E). Semi-quantitative analyses of Azan-Mallory-stained sections indicated that the relative fibrotic area was significantly decreased by oral administration of HSc025 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5F). Finally, the amounts of collagen deposition in liver tissue were estimated as hydroxyproline contents in the acid-insoluble fraction. In parallel with the progression of fibrosis, the extracellular matrix in the liver begins to resemble that of hard tissues, including insoluble elements (24Kawaguchi H. Kitabatake A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 201-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5G, treatment of HSc025 at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day significantly decreased the hydroxyproline content. These results suggested that HSc025 treatment prevents liver injury and hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis represents the generic wound healing response to a wide range of underlying injurious processes, including excessive alcohol consumption, chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis and immune-mediated liver injury. Although there are currently no approved antifibrotic agents for hepatic fibrosis in humans, several potential therapeutic approaches have been tested, largely classifiable into the following: 1) inhibition of activation, proliferation, and fibrogenesis of hepatic stellate cells; 2) enhancement of extracellular matrix degradation; and 3) attenuation of hepatic inflammation. Ideal therapies will be those that are orally available, well tolerated during chronic usage, and not simply preventing the progression of fibrosis but rather regressing scarring, leading to stabilization or improvement in liver function (25Ghiassi-Nejad Z. Friedman S.L. Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2008; 2: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that a novel small compound HSc025 inhibited collagen gene expression in hepatic stellate cells, and oral administration of HSc025 to mice with CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis exhibited repression of extracellular matrix deposition as well as attenuation of hepatic inflammation. TGF-β regulates many aspects of cellular functions and consequently has diverse effects on a variety of cell types and tissues. In the liver, TGF-β inhibits proliferation of hepatocytes, while stimulating proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (26Date M. Matsuzaki K. Matsushita M. Tahashi Y. Furukawa F. Inoue K. Gut. 2000; 46: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that YB-1 abrogates TGF-β signaling through its direct interaction with Smad3 followed by repression of collagen gene expression (9Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Fujimori K. Nakao A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43470-43479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that a novel small compound HSc025 stimulates nuclear translocation of YB-1 and improves skin and pulmonary fibrosis (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HSc025 rapidly induced the nuclear translocation of YB-1, but the translocation returned to the basal levels within 24 h. HSc025 had no effects on YB-1 gene expression levels (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which HSc025 activates nuclear translocation of YB-1, we first tried to identify proteins with which it associates using chemical compound-immobilized resins as described previously (18Tamura T. Terada T. Tanaka A. Bioconjug. Chem. 2003; 14: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All the proteins identified by mass spectrometry analyses were acidic except for YB-1. We found that HSc025 directly binds to YB-1, although direct association of HSc025 with SET or APRIL was not observed. Consistent with our findings, another acidic protein YBAP1 is reported to associate with YB-1 in the chicken DT40 cells (21Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that SET and APRIL are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins interacting with the nuclear export factor CRM1 (27Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1348-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2810-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that both SET and APRIL contribute to the nuclear import and export of YB-1. The effects of SET or APRIL on the HSc025-induced translocation of YB-1 are now under investigation. A previous study suggested the existence of an anchoring protein responsible for retention of YB-1 in the cytoplasm (21Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, we tried to identify the anchoring protein for YB-1 that is dissociated in the presence of HSc025. The results of immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the treatment of human fibroblasts with HSc025 stimulated the dissociation of YB-1 from PABP in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In addition, incubation of cytoplasmic extracts with HSc025 also enhanced this dissociation (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the direct interaction between YB-1 and PABP was abolished in the presence of HSc025 (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that HSc025 physically disrupts the interaction between YB-1 and PABP. Several lines of evidence indicate that YB-1 is a major general translation regulator through mRNA structure arrangement and packaging. PABP is an evolutionarily conserved protein, which binds to the poly(A) tract with a periodicity of ∼27 nucleotides. Recently, Svitkin et al. (29Svitkin Y.V. Evdokimova V.M. Brasey A. Pestova T.V. Fantus D. Yanagiya A. Imataka H. Skabkin M.A. Ovchinnikov L.P. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the major mRNA ribonucleoprotein YB-1 has a pivotal function in the regulation of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4G activity by PABP, suggesting functional relations between YB-1 and PABP. Moreover, our experiments using PABP siRNA clearly indicated that the displacement of PABP promoted nuclear translocation of YB-1 and subsequently inhibited basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen gene expression (Fig. 4). Collectively, it can be postulated that HSc025 interferes with the association between YB-1 and PABP, and the complex of YB-1/shuttling proteins is thereby dissociated from PABP and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where YB-1 represses collagen gene transcription. The dynamic balance between production and degradation of collagen is rigorously controlled by several growth factors and cytokines (1Inagaki Y. Okazaki I. Gut. 2007; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that HSc025 inhibits TGF-β-induced collagen and fibronectin gene expression in human fibroblasts (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, orally administered HSc025 reduced hypodermal thickness and hydroxyproline content in the tight skin mouse and markedly decreased the histological fibrotic score and hydroxyproline content in the lung tissue with bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oral administration of HSc025 at a dose of 15 mg/kg to Thy-1-induced kidney fibrosis rats significantly decreased the histological fibrotic score, collagen gene expression, and hydroxyproline content. 3K. Higashi, Y. Tomigahara, H. Shiraki, and K. Kaneko, unpublished data. Consistent with the results of these previous studies, we showed here that HSc025 inhibits collagen gene expression in cultured hepatic stellate cells, the major collagen producers in fibrotic liver (Fig. 1B). It also reduced the relative fibrotic areas and decreased hydroxyproline content in liver tissue in a murine model of hepatic fibrosis (Fig. 5, F and G). Overall, we conclude that oral administration of HSc025 to experimental fibrotic animals ameliorates organ fibrosis. Treatment of mice with HSc025 significantly reduced the relative liver weight and decreased the serum ALT levels (Fig. 5, A and B). Our previous study showed that oral administration of HSc025 to normal rats at doses of up to 800 mg/kg for 14 days had no effect on the relative liver weight or serum ALT levels (supplemental Table). In addition, histological examination of several tissues, including liver in HSc025-treated rats, showed no significant alterations (data not shown). Furthermore, oral administration of HSc025 to normal dogs at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg for 14 days showed no adverse effects (data not shown). From these findings, administration of HSc025 itself does not seem to affect the liver weight, serum ALT levels, or liver morphology, and the decrease in the relative liver weight observed in HSc025-treated mice rather represents anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of HSc025. We have previously shown that oral administration of HSc025 exhibits direct anti-fibrotic effects on noninflammatory skin fibrosis in Tsk mice (15Hasegawa M. Matsushita Y. Horikawa M. Higashi K. Tomigahara Y. Kaneko H. Shirasaki F. Fujimoto M. Takehara K. Sato S. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this study revealed a significant decrease in the serum ALT levels and a reduction of hepatocellular necrosis/vacuolization in HSc025-treated mice (Fig. 5, B and D), suggesting that it exerts hepatotoxicity-protective effects as well. Kupffer cells, the liver's tissue-specific macrophage population, are important effector cells in the inflammatory response (25Ghiassi-Nejad Z. Friedman S.L. Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2008; 2: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation in Kupffer cells drives the expression of a number of inflammatory genes. Raj et al. (30Raj G.V. Safak M. MacDonald G.H. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5944-5953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that YB-1 regulates the association of p50/p65 to the NF-κB DNA-binding element. In addition, oxidative stress, through the generation of reactive oxygen species, plays an important role in producing liver damage and hepatic fibrosis (25Ghiassi-Nejad Z. Friedman S.L. Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2008; 2: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is well known that reactive oxygen species participate in the p38 MAPK pathway, which is involved in inflammatory responses. A previous study suggested that Y-box proteins also regulate the redox signaling pathway (31Duh J.L. Zhu H. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Puga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30499-30507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine the broad pharmacological profile of HSc025, we performed 100 distinct in vitro assays and found that HSc025 inhibits p38 MAPK activity.3 These findings raised the possibility that HSc025 represses hepatic injury independent of YB-1 action. The precise mechanisms by which HSc025 might exhibit cytoprotective effects against liver injury continue to be the topic for investigation. In summary, we showed that HSc025 promotes nuclear translocation of YB-1 through direct binding to YB-1. This is followed by disruption of the association between YB-1 and PABP. Treatment of spontaneously activated stellate cells with HSc025 attenuated collagen gene expression, and oral administration of HSc025 exhibited antifibrotic efficacy and hepatocellular protection against liver injury in an experimental model of murine hepatic fibrosis. Because the results of these early preclinical studies demonstrated several advantages of HSc025, including bioavailability and a good safety profile, HSc025 or its analogs could be a promising candidate for clinical trials in treating organ fibrosis.

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are responsible for action potential repolarization. Glycans can be attached to glycoproteins through N- and O-linkages. Previous reports described the impact of N-glycans on voltage-gated ion channel function. Here, we show that sialic acids attached through O-linkages modulate gating of Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3. The conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships for each isoform were shifted uniquely by a depolarizing 8–16 mV under conditions of reduced sialylation. The data indicate that sialic acids modulate Kv channel activation through apparent electrostatic mechanisms that promote channel activity. Voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation was unaffected by changes in sialylation. N-Linked sialic acids cannot be responsible for the G-V shifts because Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 cannot be N-glycosylated, and immunoblot analysis confirmed Kv2.1 is not N-glycosylated. Glycosidase gel shift analysis suggested that Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 were O-glycosylated and sialylated. To confirm this, azide-modified sugar residues involved specifically in O-glycan and sialic acid biosynthesis were shown to incorporate into all three Kv channel isoforms using Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition chemistry. Together, the data indicate that sialic acids attached to O-glycans uniquely modulate gating of three Kv channel isoforms that are not N-glycosylated. These data provide the first evidence that external O-glycans, with core structures distinct from N-glycans in type and number of sugar residues, can modulate Kv channel function and thereby contribute to changes in electrical signaling that result from regulated ion channel expression and/or O-glycosylation.

The orchestrated activities of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are responsible for the repolarizing phases of the AP, with regulated or aberrant changes in Kv channel activity often modifying AP repolarization (1.Hille, B., (ed) (2001) Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, 3rd Ed., pp. 25–60, 131–158, 646–660, Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA.Google Scholar).

Ion channels undergo significant post-translational modification, including glycosylation, which comprises upwards of 30% of the total channel mass (9Schmidt J.W. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Such studies were possible because an external consensus site for N-glycosylation has been identified. On the other hand, little is known about the role of O-glycosylation in voltage-gated ion channel activity. The enzymes regulating O-glycosylation are complex, and O-glycosylation does not have a recognized consensus sequence (22Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycoconj. J. 2009; 26: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The most prevalent form of extracellular O-glycosylation is the mucin-type, in which a GalNAc is bound to hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine side chains (19Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 23Hanisch F.G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). All previous efforts to study the impact of glycosylation on Kv channel function concentrated on determining the effects of N-glycosylation or generic sialylation (13Johnson D. Bennett E.S.

To our knowledge, no one has reported a role for external O-glycans in Kv channel function. Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are members of the Shal subfamily of Kv channels and are rapidly activating and inactivating (A-type) channels (1.Hille, B., (ed) (2001) Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, 3rd Ed., pp. 25–60, 131–158, 646–660, Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA.Google Scholar). The putative external sequences of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 do not contain potential N-glycosylation sites; therefore, neither isoform can be N-glycosylated. Kv2.1 is a delayed rectifier with one N-glycosylation site located on the S3-S4 linker. Based on recent structural models, this site may be inaccessible to the glycosylation machinery of the cell (24Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 25Long S.B. Tao X. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2007; 450: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar); consistently, brain Kv2.1 was shown to contain no N-glycans (26Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether and how sialic acids modulate gating of Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3, and we probed for the presence of sialylated O-glycans using two independent methods, Click chemistry and glycosidase treatment. The data show for the first time that Kv channel isoforms are uniquely modulated by sialic acid residues attached to the channel through O-linkages. Pro5 and Lec2 cells were grown in minimal medium and transfected with channel cDNA as described previously (13Johnson D. Bennett E.S. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated at 25–50% confluence on 35-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection with 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 8 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), 0.25 μg of enhanced GFP, and 2.5 μg of channel cDNA (rat) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. 24 h post-transfection, the media were replaced with growth medium, consisting of α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with (Pro5) and without (Lec2) ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 48 h prior to commencing electrophysiological recordings. The Pro5/Lec2 expression system previously was used successfully to determine the effects of sialic acids on channel gating (10Bennett E.S. J.

Whole cell current recordings were performed using pulse protocols, solutions, whole cell patch clamp techniques, and data analyses as described previously (13Johnson D. Bennett E.S. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Schwetz T.A. Norring S.A. Bennett E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted at room temperature, ∼22 °C. Drummond capillary tubes were pulled into electrodes with a resistance of 1–2 megohm using a Model P-97 Sutter electrode puller. Series resistance was compensated 95–98%. The extracellular solution was (in mm) 65 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 155 sucrose, 5 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3); and the intracellular solution used was (in mm) 70 KCl, 65 KF, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3). The extracellular low divalent cation solution was similar to the extracellular solution listed above, with the exception of a 0.2 mm concentration of CaCl2 and a 0.1 mm concentration of MgCl2. To ensure complete dialysis of the intracellular solution, data were collected at least 10 min after attaining whole cell configuration. The steady-state and kinetic gating parameters were examined through the use of standard pulse protocols and solutions previously described by our laboratory (13Johnson D. Bennett E.S. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Schwetz T.A. Norring S.A. Bennett E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were held at −120 mV, stepped to more depolarized potentials (−100 to +40 mV in 10-mV increments) for 100 ms (Kv4.2 and Kv4.3) and 200 ms (Kv2.1), and returned to the holding potential. Consecutive pulses were stepped every 1.5 s, and the data were leak-subtracted using the P/4 method, stepping negatively from the holding potential. Steady-state whole cell conductance values (G) were determined using Ohm's law (G = I/(V − Ek)), where I is the measured peak current at a test potential, V. Ek is the predicted K+ Nernst equilibrium potential (+84 mV) for the set of intra- and extracellular solutions used. The maximum conductance generated by each cell was used to normalize the data for each cell to its maximum conductance by fitting the data to a single Boltzmann distribution (Equation 1, solving for maximal conductance). These single Boltzmann distributions were used to determine the average Va ± S.E. and Ka ± S.E. values listed in Table 1. The normalized data were averaged with those from the other cells, and the resulting average G-V curve was fit via least squares using the following Boltzmann relationship,=(1+exp(−(V−Va/Ka)))−1(Eq. 1) where V is the membrane potential; Va is the voltage of half-activation, and Ka is the slope factor.TABLE 1Measured gating parameters for Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and Kv2.1Isoform ± SAnVaKaViKimVmVmVmVKv4.2 +SA8−20.7 ± 1.715.6 ± 0.9−66.2 ± 2.8−7.8 ± 0.6Kv4.2 −SA11−4.5 ± 2.2*16.9 ± 0.6#−67.2 ± 2.6#−6.7 ± 0.4#Kv4.3 +SA10−16.4 ± 2.213.3 ± 0.6−51.3 ± 2.1−5.9 ± 0.9Kv4.3 −SA13−8.3 ± 1.3*14.2 ± 0.5#−57.3 ± 2.5#−6.1 ± 0.4#Kv2.1 +SA14−12.9 ± 1.913.6 ± 0.3−39.3 ± 4.9 (n = 3)−14.4 ± 0.9Kv2.1 −SA12−3.7 ± 1.8*13.3 ± 0.4#−36.4 ± 5.1# (n = 3)−12.8 ± 1.0# Open table in a new tab To determine the steady-state channel availability for the fast-inactivating Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 isoforms, cells were prepulsed from −120 to +20 mV (10-mV increments) for 1000 ms, then stepped to +60 mV for 100 ms, and returned to the holding potential (−120 mV). To discern the effects of glycosylation on Kv2.1 steady-state slow inactivation, cells were pre-pulsed from −110 mV to +40 mV (10 mV increments) for 5 s, stepped to +30 mV for 500 ms, and returned to the holding potential (−120 mV) for 15 s, similar to that described previously (28McEwen D.P.

For both protocols, the maximum current generated by each cell was used to normalize the data for each cell to its maximum current by fitting the data to a single Boltzmann distribution (Equation 2, solving for maximal current), from which the mean Vi ± S.E. and Ki ± S.E. values listed in Table 1 were determined.fraction of maximal current=(1+exp−((V−Vi)/Ki))−1(Eq. 2) where V is the membrane potential; Vi is the voltage of half-inactivation, and Ki is the slope factor. Cells were held at −120 mV and stepped to +60 mV for 100 ms and then stepped to a −140-mV recovery potential for various time intervals (10–200 ms in 10-ms increments). The membrane potential then was stepped to +60 mV for 100 ms. Peak currents measured during the +60-mV depolarizations were compared, and the fractional peak current that remained during the second depolarization was plotted as a function of the recovery pulse duration, representative of the fraction of channels recovered from inactivation during the recovery interval. Kv2.1 vector construction and mutagenesis were performed similar to that described previously (13Johnson D. Bennett E.S. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Schwetz T.A. Norring S.A. Bennett E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A Kv2.1 plasmid encoding the 857-amino acid form of the channel protein was utilized throughout this study. The asparagine residue located at site 283 was mutated to glutamine. Generally, the cDNA containing the α-subunit open reading frame was inserted into pcDNA3.1. Using the Stratagene QuikChange IIXL site-directed mutagenesis kit, mutagenesis was completed, and the constructs were sequenced. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and incubated for 5 min in ice-cold sodium pyrophosphate buffer with protease inhibitors as described previously (13Johnson D. Bennett E.S. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Schwetz T.A. Norring S.A. Bennett E.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g in a Beckman bench-top centrifuge. The supernatant was centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 100,000 × g after which the pellet was resuspended in an appropriate volume of sodium pyrophosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were then stored at −80 °C. Protein levels were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. Several sets of glycosidases were used to remove N- and O-glycans and sialic acids. For experiments shown in Fig. 3, two different N-glycanase enzymes were used, PNGase-F (5 units/10 μg of protein, Sigma) and N-glycanase (5 milliunits/10 μg of protein for Kv1.4; 5 milliunits/2 μg of protein for Kv2.1, Glyko). Lysates were treated for 3 h at 37 °C. For removal of sialic acids and O-glycans, as done in Fig. 6 and Table 2, lysates were treated for 3 h at 37 °C with at least 1 milliunit/10 μg of protein O-glycanase and with at least 4 milliunits/10 μg of protein sialidase A (both from Glyko). Sialic acids must be removed from O-glycans in order for O-glycanase to work properly, and therefore, the O-glycanase-treated samples were treated with sialidase A for 1.5 h at 37 °C prior to O-glycanase treatment.FIGURE 6Glycosidase gel shift analyses suggest that Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 are O-glycosylated and sialylated.

Briefly, cell homogenates (2–25 μg/lane) were combined with 1 volume of 2× sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, and 12.5% upper Tris buffer) and denatured for 3 min in boiling water. Samples were then run on a 6.0–6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 90 min at 75–110 mV and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Monoclonal anti-Kv2.1, anti-Kv4.2, and anti-Kv4.3 antibodies (1:500–1000 dilution; NeuroMab) were utilized to detect Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3, respectively. After incubation with primary antibody, the blot was treated with a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:25,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Click-iT glycoprotein metabolic labeling reagents and detection kits were utilized for these reactions (Invitrogen). Pro5 cells were transfected with each of the Kv channel isoforms and with the expression vector pcDNA3.1 alone, as described previously (10Bennett E.S. J.

Eight hours post-transfection, the cells were re-plated in the presence of the tetraacetylated azido sugar of interest at a concentration of 2.5 million cells/100-mm dish and incubated for 48–72 h at 37 °C. Tetraacetylated azido-modified sugars were incorporated into protein glycan structures through the permissive characteristics of oligosaccharide synthesis. N-Azidoacetylgalactosamine (Ac4GalNAz) was metabolically integrated into O-glycosylation structures through the GalNAc salvage pathway. N-Azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac4ManNAz) was utilized to incorporate a modified sugar into the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway. The cells were then harvested and lysed. Azide-modified glycoprotein samples were labeled with a biotin-alkyne and precipitated (30Tornøe C.W. Christensen C. Meldal M. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (7287) Google Scholar, 31Laughlin S.T. Agard N.J. Baskin J.M. Carrico I.S. Chang P.V. Ganguli A.S. Hangauer M.J. Lo A. Prescher J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The precipitated sample was resolubilized and incubated on streptavidin-bound Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Because of the strong interaction between streptavidin and biotin, this step allowed for the isolation of only those proteins with the modified sugar incorporated into their glycosylation structures. Immunoblot analysis was performed on the samples, and channel-specific antibodies were used to probe for channels of interest (1:100–1000 dilution) as described above. Three different controls were used. 1) Samples from the first wash following incubation of the biotinylated-modified glycoprotein samples with streptavidin-bound beads were run on the gel. Little to no signal was detected in the wash samples upon incubation with channel-specific antibody, indicating that biotin-labeled Kv channel proteins bound to streptavidin specifically and with apparent high efficiency. 2) The pcDNA3.1-transfected Pro5 cell line was treated identically to the Kv channel transfectants. No bands were observed for any of the pcDNA3.1-transfected blots. 3) Cells were not incubated with the azido-modified sugars, but all other steps of the process were completed. As shown in Fig. 6, no bands were observed. The three controls combined with the positive bands observed in the experimental samples indicate that azido-modified sugars incorporated specifically into each of the three Kv channel isoforms. The experiment was repeated at least five times for each Kv channel isoform, with nearly identical results. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Pulse/PulseFit (HEKA) and Sigma Plot (SSPS Inc.) as described previously (10Bennett E.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 675-6"
https://openalex.org/W2157753411,"Covalent modification of α7 W55C nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) with the cysteine-modifying reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+) produces receptors that are unresponsive to acetylcholine, whereas methyl methanethiolsulfonate (MMTS) produces enhanced acetylcholine-gated currents. Here, we investigate structural changes that underlie the opposite effects of MTSET+ and MMTS using acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a homolog of the extracellular domain of the nAChR. Crystal structures of Y53C AChBP show that MTSET+-modification stabilizes loop C in an extended conformation that resembles the antagonist-bound state, which parallels our observation that MTSET+ produces unresponsive W55C nAChRs. The MMTS-modified mutant in complex with acetylcholine is characterized by a contracted C-loop, similar to other agonist-bound complexes. Surprisingly, we find two acetylcholine molecules bound in the ligand-binding site, which might explain the potentiating effect of MMTS modification in W55C nAChRs. Unexpectedly, we observed in the MMTS-Y53C structure that ten phosphate ions arranged in two rings at adjacent sites are bound in the vestibule of AChBP. We mutated homologous residues in the vestibule of α1 GlyR and observed a reduction in the single channel conductance, suggesting a role of this site in ion permeation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that targeted modification of a conserved aromatic residue in loop D is sufficient for a conformational switch of AChBP and that a defined region in the vestibule of the extracellular domain contributes to ion conduction in anion-selective Cys-loop receptors.

IntroductionCys-loop receptors (CLRs) 2The abbreviations used are: CLR, Cys-loop receptor; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; MMTS, methyl methanethiolsulfonate; MTSET+, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate; RMSD, root mean square deviation from ideal geometry. belong to a class of ligand-gated ion channels that are involved in fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. This transmission can either be excitatory or inhibitory depending on the charge of ions that pass through the ion conduction pathway of the channel. Excitatory transmission is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and 5-HT3 serotonin receptors, which selectively pass cations. On the other hand, inhibitory transmission is mediated by glycine receptors (GlyR) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA and GABAC) receptors, which selectively conduct anions. In both types of receptors, the ion conduction pathway lies along the central axis formed by five channel subunits, which can either be identical for homomeric CLRs or non-identical for heteromeric CLRs. Opening and closing of the ion conduction pathway is controlled by a gate that is allosterically coupled to the extracellular ligand-binding domain (for a recent review see Ref. 1Taly A. Corringer P.J. Guedin D. Lestage P. Changeux J.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 733-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar).Detailed structural data are still lacking for an intact eukaryotic CLR, but structural information has been obtained from 4 Å resolution electron microscopic images of the Torpedo nAChR (2Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar) and higher resolution x-ray crystal structures of AChBP, a molluscan homolog of the extracellular domain of nAChRs (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and two prokaryotic homologs ELIC (6Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2008; 452: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and GLIC (7Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2009; 457: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 8Bocquet N. Nury H.

Despite their different pharmacological properties, these CLRs share a common architectural arrangement of aromatic residues in their ligand-binding site. The ligand-binding site for CLRs is found at the interface between two subunits and ligands interact with amino acids from both the principal face (containing loops A, B, and C) and complementary face (containing loops D, E, and F). We have focused our attention on an aromatic residue that lies on the complementary face of the binding pocket and is highly conserved among eukaryotic and prokaryotic CLRs.Recently, we found that the tryptophan residue at position 55 of the rat α7 nAChR (Trp-55) was the site where synthetic peptides derived from apolipoprotein E non-competitively inhibited α7 receptors through hydrophobic interactions (9Gay E.A. Bienstock R.J. Lamb P.W. Yakel J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, when Trp-55 was mutated to alanine, the α7 W55A nAChR desensitized more slowly and recovered from desensitization more rapidly than wild-type receptor (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutating Trp-55 to other aromatic residues (Phe or Tyr) had no significant effect on the kinetics of desensitization, whereas mutation to various hydrophobic residues (Ala, Cys, or Val) significantly decreased the rate of onset and increased the rate of recovery from desensitization (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To gain insight into possible structural rearrangements during desensitization, we probed the accessibility of Trp-55 by mutating Trp-55 to cysteine (α7 W55C) and tested the ability of various sulfhydryl reagents to react with this cysteine (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Modification with several positively charged sulfhydryl reagents, including [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), produced α7 W55C nAChRs that became unresponsive to acetylcholine, whereas a neutral sulfhydryl reagent methyl methanethiolsulfonate (MMTS) enhanced acetylcholine-activated currents by nearly 60% (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Trp-55 plays an important role in both the onset and recovery from desensitization in the rat α7 nAChR, and suggested that Trp-55 may be a potential target for modulatory agents operating via hydrophobic interactions.However, these data left unresolved how modification of loop D with MTSET+ or MMTS leads to two clearly distinct functional effects. MTSET+ modification renders α7 W55C receptors unresponsive to acetylcholine, whereas MMTS modification produces receptors with enhanced responses to acetylcholine. In this study, we used AChBP to determine x-ray crystal structures of the homologous Y53C mutant modified either with MTSET+ alone or MMTS in the presence of acetylcholine. We investigated whether structural changes of methanethiosulfonate (MTS)-modified AChBP correlate with the opposing functional effects of MTSET+ and MMTS observed on α7 W55C nAChRs.DISCUSSIONSubstituted cysteine accessibility scanning (SCAM) is a widely used method to study the relationship between structure and function of ion channels (24Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). With the availability of an increasing number of x-ray crystal structures for ion channels, SCAM is now frequently employed to test the validity of three-dimensional models in the context of channel dynamics and their lipid membrane environment (25Gandhi C.S. Clark E. Loots E. Pralle A. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2003; 40: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Ahern C.A. Horn R. Neuron. 2005; 48: 25-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Broomand A. Elinder F. Neuron. 2008; 59: 770-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SCAM has powerful advantages in that the method allows real-time monitoring of the reaction speed between the MTS reagent and the targeted cysteine residue for the closed, open, or desensitized state of the channel. However, this reaction is typically followed indirectly by measuring changes in the functional properties of ion channels such as ion conduction, voltage dependence of activation or ligand activation. Because of the indirect nature of this method, it is not always possible to establish a clear relationship between the observed functional effects of MTS modification and the underlying conformational changes of the channel.In this study, we report the first x-ray crystal structures of an MTS-modified cysteine mutant of the nAChR homolog AChBP. We used the homologous mutant of α7 W55C nAChRs, which is oppositely regulated by two different MTS reagents, namely MTSET+ and MMTS (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), to investigate the correlation between structure and function. We previously demonstrated that modification of α7 W55C nAChRs with MTSET+ produces receptors that become unresponsive to saturating concentrations of acetylcholine (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MTSET+-modified Y53C AChBP shows that loop C is stabilized in a conformational state that resembles the antagonist-bound state. This result suggests that the unresponsive behavior of MTSET+-modified α7 W55C nAChRs may arise from a similar stabilization of the receptor in an antagonist-bound state. This also suggests that the conformation of loop C is correlated with the activational state of the receptor. In contrast to MTSET+-modified α7 W55C nAChRs, we previously showed that modification of α7 W55C nAChRs with MMTS enhances acetylcholine-evoked currents by nearly 60% (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MMTS-modified Y53C AChBP shows that loop C is strongly contracted, similar to other agonist-bound structures. We also observed that two acetylcholine molecules occupy the binding pocket, which possibly explains the potentiating effect of acetylcholine on MMTS-modified α7 W55C nAChRs. One of these acetylcholine molecules faces the principal binding site and occupies a position that overlaps with the binding mode observed in the related carbamylcholine-bound structure of AChBP. The second acetylcholine molecule interacts with residues of the complementary face, including the MMTS-modified side chain of Cys-53. Therefore, we propose that the potentiating effect of MMTS on α7 W55C nAChRs arises from a favorable interaction with the MMTS-modified side chain that stabilizes two acetylcholine molecules in the ligand-binding site. Together, both AChBP crystal structures parallel our observations from functional studies on α7 W55C nAChRs, and offer possible explanations for the opposing effects of MTSET+ and MMTS. Our results suggest that targeted modification of a single residue in loop D is sufficient to trigger conformational changes of AChBP.The functional importance of residues in loop D has been demonstrated by mutagenesis studies in different CLRs. Mutation of the homologous W55 residue in the GABAA-R γ2-subunit, F77C, abolished binding by [3H]Ro15–1788 and the benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam. Mutation of neighboring residues in loop D, A79C and T81C, caused a 10-fold reduction in the affinity of the tranquilizers eszopiclone and zolpidem (28Hanson S.M. Morlock E.V. Satyshur K.A. Czajkowski C. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 7243-7252Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the GABAA-R α1-subunit, it was shown that for the homologous Trp-55 subtle changes were caused by unnatural amino acid mutations (29Padgett C.L. Hanek A.P. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Lummis S.C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the muscle nAChR it was shown that mutation W57F in the δ-subunit and W55F in the ϵ-subunit have only minor effects on acetylcholine-sensitivity but mainly affect channel gating by reducing the channel opening rate (30Akk G. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In insect nAChRs, it was shown that the basic Arg and Lys residues at positions +2 and +4 of the homologous W55 residue are responsible for the high affinity of the insecticide imidacloprid and related neonicotinoids (31Shimomura M. Yokota M. Ihara M. Akamatsu M. Sattelle D.B. Matsuda K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mutation of loop D residues N55S and V56I in the human nAChR β4-subunit, which are at positions −2 and −1 of the homologous Trp-55 residue, abolishes sensitivity to TMAQ, a novel agonist for β4-containing nAChRs (32Young G.T. Broad L.M. Zwart R. Astles P.C. Bodkin M. Sher E. Millar N.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a related study it was shown that mutations N55S, V56I, T59K, and E63T in the human nAChR β2-subunit reduce the affinity of acetylcholine and nicotine, while having little to no effect on the affinity of epibatidine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) (33Parker M.J. Harvey S.C. Luetje C.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to loop D, accumulating evidence implicates loop C as a structural component that is key to both ligand binding and subsequent conformational changes underlying CLR activation, inhibition, and desensitization (34Hibbs R.E. Johnson D.A. Shi J. Taylor P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2006; 30: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The important role of loop C derives from a large body of work using x-ray crystallography (11Ulens C. Hogg R.C. Celie P.H. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Loop C assumes a contracted configuration with agonists bound (corresponding to either the open or desensitized state of the receptor) and takes on an extended configuration with antagonists bound (corresponding to the closed state of the channel (11Ulens C. Hogg R.C. Celie P.H. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3615-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 35Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G.

Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More recent work suggests that the degree of loop C movement may correspond to agonist efficacy (37Hibbs R.E. Sulzenbacher G. Shi J. Talley T.T. Conrod S. Kem W.R. Taylor P. Marchot P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3040-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Movement in the ligand binding domain is thought to propagate from the extracellular domain to the pore region to allow activation or inhibition of ion flux. This transduction of signal can be understood both as a sequence of chemical events (47Sine S.M. Engel A.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) or as coordinated movements or rotations of the whole extracellular domain (40Yi M. Tjong H. Zhou H.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8280-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 48Law R.J. Henchman R.H. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 2007; 446: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Unexpectedly, we observed electron density that could be interpreted as phosphate ions in the vestibule of AChBP at a location that is very near to the interface with the transmembrane domain in integral Cys-loop receptors. The contribution of rings of charged amino acids to channel conductance has previously been demonstrated in the Torpedo nAChR (50Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), but detailed insight into the mechanism of ion conduction was lacking. Structural insight into selection of ions in the extracellular domain of Cys-loop receptors was obtained from a crystal structure containing 5 sulfate ions near residue Arg-95 in the vestibule of AChBP (23Hansen S.B. Wang H.L. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36066-36070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hansen et al. demonstrated that this residue, which corresponds to a highly conserved Asp in cation-selective Cys-loop receptors, affects single channel conductance upon charge reversal mutations in the muscle nAChR. In our structure, we observe 10 phosphate ions bound to a cluster of charged residues that involve Lys-40, Glu-47, Asp-49, and Arg-95. The phosphate ions are arranged in two pentagonal layers separated by a distance of less than 4 Å. The 5 phosphate ions in the upper layer (ring 1) occupy the same positions as the sulfate ions in the study from Hansen et al. and are arranged at a distance of 9 Å apart. Phosphate ions in the lower layer (ring 2) are spaced at a distance 7 Å apart and interact with Lys-40, Glu-47, and Asp-49. The observation that sulfates as well phosphates bind in a defined location of the vestibule of AChBP suggests that this region functions as a general anion-binding site. One of the binding site residues, Glu-47, is strictly conserved as a negatively charged amino acid (Asp or Glu) in anion-selective Cys-loop receptors, and hydrophobic (M, I, or V) in cation-selective Cys-loop receptors. Therefore, we hypothesized that chloride anions may interact in a similar manner with conserved negatively charged residues in anion-selective Cys-loop receptors, such as GABAA-R and GlyR. We demonstrated that mutation of homologous residues in ring 1 and ring 2 of the α1 GlyR causes a pronounced reduction in the single channel conductance. This result suggests a functional role of the extracellular domain of α1 GlyR in selection and permeation of anions. Our observation fits with molecular dynamics simulations of the nAChR (51Wang H.L. Cheng X. Taylor P. McCammon J.A. Sine S.M. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the bacterial homolog GLIC (52Nury H. Poitevin F. Van Renterghem C.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6275-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which demonstrated the existence of one or more cation reservoirs in the extracellular domain of these cation-selective Cys-loop receptors.In conclusion, our study shows a good correlation between structure and function, and offers possible explanations for the opposite effects of MTSET+ and MMTS on α7 W55C nAChRs. We show that targeted modification of loop D plays a key role in defining the conformational state of AChBP. This hints at a contribution of a conserved aromatic residue in loop D that goes beyond its established role of shaping the ligand-binding site. This residue may contribute to a structural switch that discriminates between the activated and non-activated state of Cys-loop receptors. In addition, the unexpected observation of phosphate anions bound in the vestibule of AChBP parallels the functional role of two rings of charged residues in the extracellular domain of the α1 GlyR that contribute to ion selection and permeation. IntroductionCys-loop receptors (CLRs) 2The abbreviations used are: CLR, Cys-loop receptor; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; MMTS, methyl methanethiolsulfonate; MTSET+, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate; RMSD, root mean square deviation from ideal geometry. belong to a class of ligand-gated ion channels that are involved in fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. This transmission can either be excitatory or inhibitory depending on the charge of ions that pass through the ion conduction pathway of the channel. Excitatory transmission is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and 5-HT3 serotonin receptors, which selectively pass cations. On the other hand, inhibitory transmission is mediated by glycine receptors (GlyR) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA and GABAC) receptors, which selectively conduct anions. In both types of receptors, the ion conduction pathway lies along the central axis formed by five channel subunits, which can either be identical for homomeric CLRs or non-identical for heteromeric CLRs. Opening and closing of the ion conduction pathway is controlled by a gate that is allosterically coupled to the extracellular ligand-binding domain (for a recent review see Ref. 1Taly A.

Despite their different pharmacological properties, these CLRs share a common architectural arrangement of aromatic residues in their ligand-binding site. The ligand-binding site for CLRs is found at the interface between two subunits and ligands interact with amino acids from both the principal face (containing loops A, B, and C) and complementary face (containing loops D, E, and F). We have focused our attention on an aromatic residue that lies on the complementary face of the binding pocket and is highly conserved among eukaryotic and prokaryotic CLRs.Recently, we found that the tryptophan residue at position 55 of the rat α7 nAChR (Trp-55) was the site where synthetic peptides derived from apolipoprotein E non-competitively inhibited α7 receptors through hydrophobic interactions (9Gay E.A. Bienstock R.J. Lamb P.W. Yakel J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, when Trp-55 was mutated to alanine, the α7 W55A nAChR desensitized more slowly and recovered from desensitization more rapidly than wild-type receptor (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutating Trp-55 to other aromatic residues (Phe or Tyr) had no significant effect on the kinetics of desensitization, whereas mutation to various hydrophobic residues (Ala, Cys, or Val) significantly decreased the rate of onset and increased the rate of recovery from desensitization (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To gain insight into possible structural rearrangements during desensitization, we probed the accessibility of Trp-55 by mutating Trp-55 to cysteine (α7 W55C) and tested the ability of various sulfhydryl reagents to react with this cysteine (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Modification with several positively charged sulfhydryl reagents, including [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), produced α7 W55C nAChRs that became unresponsive to acetylcholine, whereas a neutral sulfhydryl reagent methyl methanethiolsulfonate (MMTS) enhanced acetylcholine-activated currents by nearly 60% (10Gay E.A. Giniatullin R. Skorinkin A. Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Trp-55 plays an important role in both the onset and recovery from desensitization in the rat α7 nAChR, and suggested that Trp-55 may be a potential target"

Our recent study showed that RBX1 silencing triggered a DNA damage response (DDR) leading to G2-M arrest, senescence, and apoptosis, with the mechanism remaining elusive. Here, we show that, in human cancer cells, RBX1 silencing causes the accumulation of DNA replication licensing proteins CDT1 and ORC1, leading to DNA double-strand breaks, DDR, G2 arrest, and, eventually, aneuploidy. Whereas CHK1 activation by RBX1 silencing is responsible for the G2 arrest, enhanced DNA damage renders cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, RBX-1 silencing causes CDT-1 accumulation, triggering DDR in intestinal cells, which is largely abrogated by simultaneous CDT-1 silencing. RBX-1 silencing also induces lethality during development of embryos and in adulthood.

https://openalex.org/W2035353973,"The Josephin domain is a conserved cysteine protease domain found in four human deubiquitinating enzymes: ataxin-3, the ataxin-3-like protein (ATXN3L), Josephin-1, and Josephin-2. Josephin domains from these four proteins were purified and assayed for their ability to cleave ubiquitin substrates. Reaction rates differed markedly both among the different proteins and for different substrates with a given protein. The ATXN3L Josephin domain is a significantly more efficient enzyme than the ataxin-3 domain despite their sharing 85% sequence identity. To understand the structural basis of this difference, the 2.6 Å x-ray crystal structure of the ATXN3L Josephin domain in complex with ubiquitin was determined. Although ataxin-3 and ATXN3L adopt similar folds, they bind ubiquitin in different, overlapping sites. Mutations were made in ataxin-3 at selected positions, introducing the corresponding ATXN3L residue. Only three such mutations are sufficient to increase the catalytic activity of the ataxin-3 domain to levels comparable with that of ATXN3L, suggesting that ataxin-3 has been subject to evolutionary restraints that keep its deubiquitinating activity in check."
https://openalex.org/W2169595012,"Among bacterial species demonstrated to have protein O-glycosylation systems, that of Bacteroides fragilis and related species is unique in that extracytoplasmic proteins are glycosylated at serine or threonine residues within the specific three-amino acid motif D(S/T)(A/I/L/M/T/V). This feature allows for computational analysis of the proteome to identify candidate glycoproteins. With the criteria of a signal peptidase I or II cleavage site or a predicted transmembrane-spanning region and the presence of at least one glycosylation motif, we identified 1021 candidate glycoproteins of B. fragilis. In addition to the eight glycoproteins identified previously, we confirmed that another 12 candidate glycoproteins are in fact glycosylated. These included four glycoproteins that are predicted to localize to the inner membrane, a compartment not previously shown to include glycosylated proteins. In addition, we show that four proteins involved in cell division and chromosomal segregation, two of which are encoded by candidate essential genes, are glycosylated. To date, we have not identified any extracytoplasmic proteins containing a glycosylation motif that are not glycosylated. Therefore, based on the list of 1021 candidate glycoproteins, it is likely that hundreds of proteins, comprising more than half of the extracytoplasmic proteins of B. fragilis, are glycosylated. Site-directed mutagenesis of several glycoproteins demonstrated that all are glycosylated at the identified glycosylation motif. By engineering glycosylation motifs into a naturally unglycosylated protein, we are able to bring about site-specific glycosylation at the engineered sites, suggesting that this glycosylation system may have applications for glycoengineering."
https://openalex.org/W2055008180,"In previous studies, we reported that N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) activity and the enzyme product, bisected N-glycans, both were induced in cells cultured under dense conditions in an E-cadherin-dependent manner (Iijima, J., Zhao, Y., Isaji, T., Kameyama, A., Nakaya, S., Wang, X., Ihara, H., Cheng, X., Nakagawa, T., Miyoshi, E., Kondo, A., Narimatsu, H., Taniguchi, N., and Gu, J. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 13038-13046). Furthermore, we found that α-catenin, a component of the E-cadherin-catenin complex, was also required for this induction (Akama, R., Sato, Y., Kariya, Y., Isaji, T., Fukuda, T., Lu, L., Taniguchi, N., Ozawa, M., and Gu, J. (2008) Proteomics 8, 3221-3228). To further explore the molecular mechanism of this regulation, the roles of β-catenin, an essential molecule in both cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and canonical Wnt signaling, were investigated. Unexpectedly, shRNA knockdown of β-catenin resulted in a dramatic increase in GnT-III expression and its product, the bisected N-glycans, which was confirmed by RT-PCR and GnT-III activity and by E4-PHA lectin blot analysis. The induction of GnT-III expression increased bisecting GlcNAc residues on β1 integrin, which led to down-regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cell migration. Immunostaining showed that nuclear localization of β-catenin was greatly suppressed; intriguingly, the knockdown of β-catenin in the nuclei was more effective than that in cell-cell contacts in the knockdown cells, which was also confirmed by Western blot analysis. Stimulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by the addition of exogenous Wnt3a or BIO, a GSK-3β inhibitor, consistently and significantly inhibited GnT-III expression and its products. Conversely, the inhibition of β-catenin translocation into the nuclei increased GnT-III activation. Taken together, the results of the present study are the first to clearly demonstrate that GnT-III expression may be precisely regulated by the interplay of E-cadherin-catenin complex-mediated cell-cell adhesion and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which are both crucial in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2083969404,"Nonvisual arrestins are regulated by direct post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and nitrosylation. However, whether arrestins are regulated by other post-translational modifications remains unknown. Here we show that nonvisual arrestins are modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) upon activation of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR). Lysine residues 295 and 400 in arrestin-3 fall within canonical SUMO consensus sites, and mutagenic analysis reveals that Lys-400 represents the main SUMOylation site. Depletion of the SUMO E2 modifying enzyme Ubc9 blocks arrestin-3 SUMOylation and attenuates β<sub>2</sub>AR internalization, suggesting that arrestin SUMOylation mediates G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis. Consistent with this, expression of a SUMO-deficient arrestin mutant failed to promote β<sub>2</sub>AR internalization as compared with wild-type arrestin-3. Our data reveal an unprecedented role for SUMOylation in mediating GPCR endocytosis and provide novel mechanistic insight into arrestin function and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2091312128,"The protein folding problem is often studied by comparing the mechanisms of proteins sharing the same structure but different sequence. The recent design of the two proteins G(A)88 and G(B)88, displaying different structures and functions while sharing 88% sequence identity (49 out of 56 amino acids), allows the unique opportunity for a complementary approach. At which stage of its folding pathway does a protein commit to a given topology? Which residues are crucial in directing folding mechanisms to a given structure? By using a combination of biophysical and computational techniques, we have characterized the folding of both G(A)88 and G(B)88. We show that, contrary to expectation, G(B)88, characterized by a native α+β fold, displays in the denatured state a content of native-like helical structure greater than G(A)88, which is all-α in its native state. Both experiments and simulations indicate that such residual structure may be tuned by changing pH. Thus, despite the high sequence identity, the folding pathways for these two proteins appear to diverge as early as in the denatured state. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby protein topology is committed very early along the folding pathway, being imprinted in the residual structure of the denatured state."
https://openalex.org/W2111471455,"Galectins are a family of metazoan proteins that show binding to various β-galactoside-containing glycans. Because of a lack of proper tools, the interaction of galectins with their specific glycan ligands in the cells and tissues are largely unknown. We have investigated the localization of galectin ligands in Caenorhabditis elegans using a novel technology that relies on the high binding specificity between galectins and their endogenous ligands. Fluorescently labeled recombinant galectin fusions are found to bind to ligands located in diverse tissues including the intestine, pharynx, and the rectal valve. Consistent with their role as galactoside-binding proteins, the interaction with their ligands is inhibited by galactose or lactose. Two of the galectins, LEC-6 and LEC-10, recognize ligands that co-localize along the intestinal lumen. The ligands for LEC-6 and LEC-10 are absent in three glycosylation mutants bre-1, fut-8, and galt-1, which have been shown to be required to synthesize the Gal-β1,4-Fuc modifications of the core N-glycans unique to C. elegans and several other invertebrates. Both galectins pull down the same set of glycoproteins in a manner dependent on the presence of these carbohydrate modifications. Endogenous LEC-6 and LEC-10 are expressed in the intestinal cells, but they are localized to different subcellular compartments that do not appear to overlap with each other or with the location of their glycan targets. An altered subcellular distribution of these ligands is found in mutants lacking both galectins. These results suggest a model where LEC-6 and LEC-10 interact with glycoproteins through specific glycans to regulate their cellular fate."
https://openalex.org/W2086160260,"The multiple transferable resistance (MTR) pump, from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is typical of the specialized machinery used to translocate drugs across the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. It consists of a tripartite complex composed of an inner-membrane transporter, MtrD, a periplasmic membrane fusion protein, MtrC, and an outer-membrane channel, MtrE. We have expressed the components of the pump in Escherichia coli and used the antibiotic vancomycin, which is too large to cross the outer-membrane by passive diffusion, to test for opening of the MtrE channel. Cells expressing MtrCDE are not susceptible to vancomycin, indicating that the channel is closed; but become susceptible to vancomycin in the presence of transported substrates, consistent with drug-induced opening of the MtrE channel. A mutational analysis identified residues Asn-198, Glu-434, and Gln-441, lining an intraprotomer groove on the surface of MtrE, to be important for pump function; mutation of these residues yielded cells that were sensitive to vancomycin. Pull-down assays and micro-calorimetry measurements indicated that this functional impairment is not due to the inability of MtrC to interact with the MtrE mutants; nor was it due to the MtrE mutants adopting an open conformation, because cells expressing these MtrE mutants alone are relatively insensitive to vancomycin. However, cells expressing the MtrE mutants with MtrC are sensitive to vancomycin, indicating that residues lining the intra-protomer groove control opening of the MtrE channel in response to binding of MtrC."

Here we describe conversion of the Cl(-)-independent prokaryotic tryptophan transporter TnaT to a fully functional Cl(-)-dependent form by a single point mutation, D268S. Mutations in TnaT-D268S, in wild type TnaT and in serotonin transporter provide direct evidence for the involvement of each of the proposed residues in Cl(-) coordination. In both SERT and TnaT-D268S, Cl(-) and Na(+) mutually increased each other's potency, consistent with electrostatic interaction through adjacent binding sites.

In current models of mammalian cell cycle control, E2f activators (E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3) are portrayed as the ultimate transcriptional effectors that commit cells to enter and progress through S phase. Using conditional gene knock-out strategies, we show that E2f1-3 are not required for the proliferation of early myeloid progenitors. Rather, these E2fs are critical for cell survival and proliferation at two distinct steps of myeloid development. First, E2f1-3 are required as transcriptional repressors for the survival of CD11b(+) myeloid progenitors, and then they are required as activators for the proliferation of CD11b(+) macrophages. In bone marrow macrophages, we show that E2f1-3 respond to CSF1-Myc mitogenic signals and serve to activate E2f target genes and promote their proliferation. Together, these findings expose dual functions for E2f1-3 at distinct stages of myeloid development in vivo, first as repressors in cell survival and then as activators in cell proliferation. In summary, this work places E2f1-3 in a specific signaling cascade that is critical for myeloid development in vivo."

For example, in the heart KCNQ1 is modulated by β-adrenergic signaling through cAMP-mediated channel phosphorylation. However, this effect results in physiological changes in potassium current only when certain KCNE subunits are also expressed (12Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Kurokawa J. Bankston J.R. Kaihara A. Chen L. Furukawa T. Kass R.S. Channels. 2009; 3: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Elucidating other functional and biochemical events that accompany KCNE modulation of KV channels is important for understanding the physiological importance of this accessory subunit family. A comprehensive understanding of KCNQ1 regulation by KCNE proteins may require that we consider properties of these interactions in the context of the relevant intracellular milieu such as the cycling of internal Ca2+ concentration that occurs in cardiac myocytes. Each ionic component of the cardiac action potential, including IKs, is a potential target for feedback regulation by intracellular Ca2+. Indeed, calmodulin (CaM), the ubiquitous Ca2+-transducing protein (14Haitin Y. Yisharel I. Malka E. Shamgar L. Schottelndreier H. Peretz A. Paas Y. Attali B. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Circ.

Of note, KCNQ1 interacts biochemically with CaM through a domain in the channel C terminus, and pharmacological disruption of the KCNQ1-CaM interaction causes complete suppression of KCNQ1 current, suggesting that CaM is required for KCNQ1 activity (15Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A. Wiener R. Hirsch J. Pongs O. Attali B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether certain KCNE accessory subunits might interact biochemically or functionally with CaM. Specifically, because the dramatic inhibitory modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE4 resembles the effect of disrupting the binding of CaM to KCNQ1, we hypothesized that an interaction between KCNE4 and CaM could be involved in the modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE4. Our results demonstrate that KCNE4, but not KCNE1, can biochemically interact with CaM and that this interaction requires a tetraleucine motif in the juxtamembrane region of the KCNE4 C terminus. Furthermore, mutation of this tetraleucine motif abolishes CaM association with KCNE4 and impairs functional interactions of KCNE4 with KCNQ1. Our findings have potential relevance to KCNQ1 regulation by an important and ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecule. Full-length KCNQ1 was expressed from the pIRES2-DsRed vector, whereas KCNE1 and KCNE4 were subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), as described previously (3Lundquist A.L. Manderfield L.J. Vanoye C.G. Rogers C.S. Donahue B.S. Chang P.A. Drinkwater D.C. Murray K.T. George Jr., A.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A triple HA epitope (YPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPDYAGSYPYDVPDYA) was introduced into the KCNE4 vector and a triple FLAG epitope (DYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) into the KCNE1 cDNA, immediately upstream of the stop codon. HA sequence was PCR-amplified from a plasmid provided by Sabina Kupershmidt (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN); FLAG sequence was PCR-amplified from p3×FLAG-CMVTM-13 (Sigma). Addition of the epitope tags did not affect the modulatory properties of KCNE4 or KCNE1, as reported previously (21Manderfield L.J. George Jr., A.L. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1336-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Point mutations were engineered using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by complete sequencing of the open reading frames. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in F-12 nutrient mixture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), penicillin (50 units ml−1)/streptomycin (50 μg ml−1), and l-glutamine (2 mm). CHO cells stably expressing KCNQ1 were generated using transposon-mediated gene transfer (22Kahlig K.M. Saridey S.K. Kaja A. Daniels M.A. George Jr., A.L. Wilson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stable clones were identified by G418 resistance, tested by patch clamp recording, and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in CHO cell medium plus 600 μg/ml G418. Unless otherwise stated, all tissue culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. CHO cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For electrophysiology studies shown in Fig. 5, cells were transfected with a 2:1 ratio of KCNQ1 to E4-ha, L(69–72)A-ha, or empty vector DNA. Forty eight hours post-transfection, CHO cells were lysed for recovery of protein as described previously (21Manderfield L.J. George Jr., A.L. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1336-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, one 100-mm dish of cells for each transfected construct was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), then lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and supplemented with Complete mini protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged twice at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Total protein concentration was quantified using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). CaM inhibitory peptides CaMKII-P, LKKFNARRKLKGAILTTMLA (Enzo Life Sciences) and MLCK-P, RRKWQKTGHAVRAIGRL, and control peptide CTRL-P, RRKEQKTGHAVRAIGRE (Calbiochem), were used in biochemical and functional experiments in Figs. 1 and 3. In a previous characterization of MLCK-P (“Trp peptide”), the Kd value of calmodulin and MLCK-P was calculated to be 6 pm from assay of MLCK inhibition, yielding the conclusion that the peptide inhibits MLCK by trapping calmodulin and leaving free calmodulin concentrations very low (23Török K. Cowley D.J. Brandmeier B.D. Howell S. Aitken A. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6188-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, prior characterization of CaMKII-P (“peptide 290–309”) determined that CaMKII-P inhibits CaMKII and CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase activity by peptide interaction with CaM and not by a direct effect on the enzyme (24Payne M.E.

Our experiments in Figs. 1 and 3 make use of the ability of these peptides to bind CaM and induce its dissociation from KCNQ1 or KCNE4. CTRL-P is an analog of MLCK-P with two amino acid substitutions that disrupt its interaction with CaM (23Török K. Cowley D.J. Brandmeier B.D. Howell S. Aitken A. Trentham D.R.

Protein was incubated with beads for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking, in the presence or absence of CaM inhibitory peptides CaMKII-P, MLCK-P, or CTRL-P. Beads were pelleted, and supernatant was reserved as an unbound fraction. Beads were washed six times in 1 ml of CaCl2 or EGTA + EDTA wash buffer and then resuspended in 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 m urea). Proteins were eluted from beads by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. As described previously (21Manderfield L.J. George Jr., A.L. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1336-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), 10 μg of antibody were combined with 750 μl of borate buffer (200 mm sodium tetraborate decahydrate, pH 9.0), and 50 μl of protein-G-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and rocked at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed with borate buffer supplemented with 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride and rocked for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by 1 h of incubation with 200 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.0. Beads were washed in PBS and stored at 4 °C until use. Cellular lysates were pre-cleared with protein-G-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of cross-linked antibody. Beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer plus protease inhibitors and then proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 55 °C. Forty eight hours after transfection, CHO cells were bathed in 1.5 mg·ml−1 sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 1 h on ice. The biotinylation reaction was quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS and then cellular lysates were prepared, as described above, in ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with a Complete mini-protease inhibitor tablet). Lysates were incubated with ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was reserved as the nonbiotinylated fraction. Beads were washed three times and then biotinylated proteins were eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis on pre-cast 4–20% Tris-HCl gels and then transferred to Immun-BlotTM PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T before applying the appropriate primary antibody in 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T as follows: 1:5000 mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Covance), 1:200 goat polyclonal anti-KCNQ1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:2000 mouse monoclonal anti-calmodulin (Millipore Corp.), or 1:1000 rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin (Sigma). Membranes were washed in TBS-T and then probed with the appropriate secondary antibody in 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T as follows: 1:5000 goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP, rabbit anti-goat IgG-HRP, or goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were washed in TBS-T, and HRP signal was detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) and Kodak BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein band densitometry was performed on scanned films using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Differences among groups were determined by one-way ANOVA, with Tukey post-test for pairwise comparison. Currents were measured in CHO cells using the broken patch, whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar). For experiments using transiently transfected cells (Fig. 5), only yellow fluorescent cells (positive for both dsRed-MST and EGFP fluorescence) were recorded. Whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature (20–23 °C) using Axopatch 200 and 200B amplifiers (MDS Analytical Technologies). Pulses were generated using Clampex 8.1 (MDS Analytical Technologies), and whole-cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz and acquired at 5 kHz. The access resistance and apparent membrane capacitance were estimated as described previously (26Lindau M. Neher E. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were not leak subtracted. Unless otherwise indicated, whole-cell currents were measured during a series of 2-s voltage steps from a holding potential of −80 mV to test potentials ranging from −80 to +60 mV (in 10-mV increments) followed by a 1-s step to −30 mV to record tail currents. The extracellular solution contained (in mm) the following: 132 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The standard intracellular solution contained (in mm) the following: 110 K+ aspartate, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, and 5 K2ATP, pH 7.35. Pipette solution was diluted 5–10% to prevent activation of swelling-activated currents. For experiments using CaM-inhibitory peptides, 50 μm peptide was added to the diluted pipette solution. For experiments using varying concentrations of intracellular free Ca2+ (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S1), see supplemental Table S1 for composition of intracellular solution. We also tested the effects of including EDTA along with EGTA to the 30 nm [Ca+2]i pipette solution (supplemental Fig. S1) to control for nonspecific effects of EDTA. Patch pipettes were pulled from thick wall borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) with a multistage P-97 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) and heat-polished with a Micro Forge MF 830 (Narashige). After heat polishing, the resistance of the patch pipettes was 2–5 megohms in the standard solutions. As a reference electrode, a 2% agar bridge with composition similar to the control bath solution was used. Junction potentials were zeroed with the filled pipette in the bath solution. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Data were collected for each experimental condition from at least three distinct transient transfections and analyzed using a combination of Clampfit (MDS Analytical Technologies), OriginPro 7 (OriginLab Corp.), and SigmaPlot 2000 (Systat Software, Inc.). Steady-state current at each test potential was measured 1.9 s following the voltage step, and current density was obtained by normalizing steady-state current to cell capacitance. Voltage dependence of activation was determined by normalizing peak tail current for each test potential to the maximal value for each cell, and plotting normalized peak tail current versus voltage. Activation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann function to determine the voltage for half-maximal activation (V½) and slope (k). To analyze kinetics of activation, the current recorded between 0.075 and 0.475 s after the voltage step to +60 mV was fitted with a single exponential function to determine the time constant, τ. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat 2.03 (Systat Software, Inc.). To demonstrate that KCNQ1 interacts biochemically with CaM in our experimental system (i.e. heterologous expression in CHO cells), we used CaM-agarose beads to pull down KCNQ1 in the presence of either CaCl2 or the Ca2+ chelators EGTA and EDTA. KCNQ1 was immunodetected robustly in eluate from beads incubated in the presence of CaCl2, but less was detectable when the incubation was performed in the presence of Ca2+ chelators (Fig. 1A). To examine the specificity of this finding, we performed pulldown assays in the presence of CaCl2 plus either of two CaM-inhibitory peptides, CaMKII-P and MLCK-P (named according to the binding regions of calmodulin-dependent kinase II and myosin light chain kinase, respectively), or a control peptide, CTRL-P. Compared with the peptide-free condition, both CaM-inhibitory peptides impeded pulldown of KCNQ1 by CaM-agarose, whereas CTRL peptide did not diminish the interaction (Fig. 1B). We next examined the functional significance of the interaction between KCNQ1 and CaM in CHO cells. We recorded whole-cell currents in CHO cells transiently transfected with KCNQ1, using the MLCK inhibitory peptide in the pipette solution to disrupt the biochemical interaction between KCNQ1 and CaM. In the presence of 50 μm MLCK peptide, steady-state current amplitude decayed rapidly over time, whereas cells dialyzed with 50 μm CTRL or with no peptide showed minimal decay (Fig. 1C). We also observed that KCNQ1 function is Ca2+-sensitive. Specifically, we observed no effect of varying [Ca2+]i on current density, but a shift toward more depolarized voltage dependence of activation was observed at lower intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (supplemental Fig. S1). Overall, our results demonstrate a Ca2+-dependent interaction of KCNQ1 with CaM that is necessary for channel activity. The suppression of KCNQ1 current resulting from CaM inhibition closely resembles the effects of KCNE4 co-expression with the channel. We hypothesized that the mechanism of KCNQ1 inhibition by KCNE4 may involve the ability of KCNE4 to mimic a CaM-inhibitory peptide. To test this hypothesis, we first sought to demonstrate interaction between KCNE4 and CaM. We used multiple biochemical approaches to assess whether KCNE4 can interact with CaM. First, CaM-agarose pulldown assays using lysates from CHO cells transiently transfected with epitope-tagged KCNE4 (KCNE4-ha) revealed that KCNE4-ha interacts with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Next, we validated the biochemical interaction between KCNE4-ha and CaM by co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-CaM primary antibody. KCNE4-ha was detected following immunoprecipitation performed in the presence of CaCl2 but not Ca2+ chelators, whereas CaM was detectable in the immunoprecipitate regardless of Ca2+ availability (Fig. 2B). Finally, we demonstrated that the interaction of KCNE4-ha with CaM could be significantly disrupted by CaM-inhibitory peptides but not by the control peptide (Fig. 3). These data indicate that KCNE4-ha and CaM biochemically interact in CHO cells. We also tested whether another KCNE subunit can interact biochemically with CaM by CaM-agarose pulldown using CHO cells transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged KCNE1. No signal was detected in the bound fraction, regardless of whether the pulldown was performed in the presence of CaCl2 or Ca2+ chelators (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that CaM interaction is not a universal property of all KCNE subunits. To survey where CaM might interact with KCNE4, we examined the full-length KCNE4 amino acid sequence using an on-line CaM-binding site prediction algorithm (Calmodulin Target Database at the Ontario Cancer Institute). Based upon various peptide properties, including hydropathy, α-helical propensity, residue weight, side chain charge, and helical class, we identified one potential CaM interaction site located between KCNE4 residues 44 and 73. This candidate interaction site spans part of the transmembrane domain plus 15 residues of the adjacent intracellular juxtamembrane region of the KCNE4 C terminus (Fig. 4A). Because critical binding energy in protein-protein interactions involving CaM is often provided by bulky hydrophobic amino acids (27Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), we targeted a tetraleucine motif (residues 69–72) within the candidate-binding site for disruption of the interaction between KCNE4 and CaM. Specifically, we mutated the four leucine residues to alanines (designated L(69–72)A-ha) and then performed CaM pulldown assays to determine effects on the protein-protein interaction. CaM-agarose assays comparing pulldown of wild-type KCNE4-ha to L(69–72)A-ha demonstrated that this juxtamembrane tetraleucine motif is required for the biochemical interaction of KCNE4 with CaM (Fig. 4B) most likely because this sequence is part of a CaM-binding site. Importantly, this tetraleucine motif is conserved in KCNE4 orthologues across mammals, birds, and amphibians. Similar motifs are absent in the other KCNE subunits, and this is consistent with the observed lack of KCNE1 biochemical interaction with CaM (supplemental Fig. S2). To test whether disruption of the biochemical interaction between KCNE4 and CaM is accompanied by any functional consequences, we compared whole-cell currents recorded from CHO cells expressing KCNQ1 + empty vector, KCNQ1 co-expressed with wild-type KCNE4-ha, and KCNQ1 co-expressed with L(69–72)A-ha. Representative current traces and a current density-voltage plot illustrate that the dramatic KCNQ1 suppression normally exerted by wild-type KCNE4 is not evident with L(69–72)A-ha (Fig. 5, A and B). The degree of KCNQ1 suppression was significantly less for L(69–72)A-ha than for wild-type KCNE4. Interestingly, L(69–72)A-ha exerts other modulatory effects on KCNQ1, including a significant shift in the voltage dependence of activation curve to more depolarized potentials (Fig. 5C; Table 1) and a significant slowing of the kinetics of activation (Fig. 5D).TABLE 1Electrophysiological parameters characterizing E4-ha versus L(69–72)A-ha modulation of KCNQ1nCurrent density, +60 mVV½kτMean ± S.E.pMean ± S.E.pMean ± S.E.pMean ± S.E.ppA/picofaradmVmVmsQ1 + empty vector832.0 ± 5.10.02−7.0 ± 1.90.00510.4 ± 0.50.00466.4 ± 11.20.001Q1 + L(69–72)A-ha615.3 ± 2.1NA2.4 ± 2.0NA15.6 ± 1.5NA141.6 ± 15.1NAQ1 + E4-ha73.3 ± 1.00.001 Open table in a new tab It is important to note that cell-surface biotinylation assays revealed that L(69–72)A-ha is detectable at the cell surface (Fig. 5E), albeit at a reduced level. However, the modulatory effects of L(69–72)A-ha on KCNQ1 described in Fig. 5, C and D, imply that mutant KCNE4 subunits still associate with KCNQ1 at the plasma membrane to a significant extent. Overall, these findings demonstrate that disrupting the KCNE4-CaM interaction hinders the inhibition of KCNQ1 by KCNE4 and suggests possible mechanisms for the regulation of KCNQ1 function. To assess whether KCNE4 inhibition of KCNQ1 is sensitive to [Ca2+]i, we compared whole-cell currents recorded from CHO cells stably expressing KCNQ1 and transiently transfected with KCNE4 or empty vector, measured using a pipette solution that contained either 10 or 3 nm free [Ca2+]. Representative current traces and a current density versus voltage plot (Fig. 6) illustrate that KCNE4 fails to completely inhibit KCNQ1 current when [Ca2+]i is chelated acutely. CHO cells expressing KCNE4 in the absence of KCNQ1 generated no current when recorded using 3 nm [Ca2+] pipette solution, suggesting that the recorded currents illustrated in Fig. 6 are not from endogenous channels activated by low [Ca2+]i (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the Ca2+ sensitivity of the biochemical interaction between KCNE4 and CaM (Fig. 1A) and the impaired KCNQ1 inhibition by KCNE4 upon disrupting interactions between KCNE4 and CaM by mutagenesis. Importantly, the impairment of KCNE4 inhibition of KCNQ1 upon acutely chelating [Ca2+]i is unlikely explained by an acute decrease in KCNE4 cell-surface expression, favoring the interpretation that the KCNE4 function is directly affected by disrupting its interaction with CaM. Regulation of KCNQ1 is physiologically important especially in heart where this protein constitutes the pore-forming subunit required to generate IKs, an essential repolarizing current. KCNQ1 is part of a macromolecular complex containing accessory subunits and regulatory proteins such as yotiao (28Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S.

Interactions between accessory subunits (e.g. KCNE) and other regulatory proteins associated with the macromolecular IKs complex are emerging as another layer of complexity in regulating KCNQ1 function (12Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we uncovered a new and intriguing example of an interaction between a KCNE subunit and another important KCNQ1 regulatory protein. Specifically, we identified an interaction between KCNE4 and CaM that is linked to the robust inhibitory effect of this accessory protein on KCNQ1. The observation that pharmacological inhibition of CaM dramatically blunts KCNQ1 activity (15Ghosh S. Nunziato D.A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A. Wiener R. Hirsch J. Pongs O. Attali B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which resembles the modulatory effect of KCNE4 on KCNQ1, prompted our hypothesis that KCNQ1 inhibition by KCNE4 could involve CaM. Our demonstration of a Ca2+-dependent biochemical interaction between KCNE4 and CaM, and that KCNQ1 functional modulation by KCNE4 is impaired both upon mutation of a candidate CaM interaction site in the juxtamembrane region of KCNE4 and by acutely chelating [Ca2+]i to displace CaM from KCNE4, suggests a connection between the mechanism of KCNQ1 inhibition by KCNE4 and the effect of CaM on the channel. We previously assumed that the inhibition of KCNQ1 by KCNE4 is caused by a direct effect of KCNE4 on the channel (32Manderfield L.J. Daniels M.A. Vanoye C.G. George Jr., A.L. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Vanoye C.G. Welch R.C. Daniels M.A. Manderfield L.J. Tapper A.R. Sanders C.R. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In demonstrating that the interaction between CaM and KCNE4 is critical for the inhibitory effect of KCNE4, the data presented here introduce the new possibility that KCNE4 inhibits KCNQ1 by disrupting CaM-mediated KCNQ1 activation. The KCNE4 region we identified to be critical for its biochemical interaction with CaM lacks typical motifs shared by many (but not all) CaM-interacting proteins, such as an IQ domain or a 1–5-10 motif (27Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). However, there are other examples of membrane proteins known to interact with CaM at an intracellular juxtamembrane region (as we demonstrated for KCNE4), including the epidermal growth factor receptor (34Martín-Nieto J. Villalobo A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Li H. Villalobo A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Li H. Ruano M.J. Villalobo A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of KCNE4 is necessary for its inhibition of KCNQ1 and is sufficient to confer inhibitory function to a chimera consisting of the N terminus and transmembrane domain of KCNE1 but the C terminus of KCNE4 (32Manderfield L.J. Daniels M.A. Vanoye C.G. George Jr., A.L. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This overlap between the CaM-binding site and the KCNE4 domain necessary for inhibition of KCNQ1 activity supports our hypothesis that KCNQ1 inhibition by KCNE4 may involve its ability to interact with CaM. The primary structure of KCNE4 is distinct from the other four KCNE proteins at the juxtamembrane site identified here as a CaM-binding region. Specifically, the region containing four sequential hydrophobic leucine residues in KCNE4 is occupied by polar residues in the other four KCNE proteins, which would likely not support interactions with CaM. As we demonstrated in this study, KCNE1 does not interact with CaM when expressed alone (supplemental Fig. S2). The identification of critical residues for CaM binding also allowed us to study the functional consequences of disrupting the KCNE4-CaM interaction. We demonstrated that KCNE4 L(69–72)A-ha subunits fail to robustly inhibit KCNQ1. However, expression of this KCNE4 mutant does modulate the kinetics and voltage dependence of KCNQ1 activation and changes kinetic properties of tail currents consistent with removal of inactivation (Fig. 5). Overall these findings indicate that the mutant KCNE4 with impaired biochemical interaction with CaM also exhibits impaired ability to inhibit KCNQ1, although its ability to function as a modulatory subunit to KCNQ1 is not lost. We speculate that these residual functional effects of KCNE4 L(69–72)A-ha on KCNQ1 could be mediated through interactions between the pore-forming subunit and the KCNE4 transmembrane domain. In support of this notion, there are similarities in KCNQ1 modulation evoked by KCNE4 L(69–72)A-ha and a chimera consisting of the N and C termini of KCNE1 coupled to the transmembrane domain of KCNE4 (32Manderfield L.J. Daniels M.A. Vanoye C.G. George Jr., A.L. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The physiological implications of the observations presented here may be significant, but they are difficult to assign because of the primary lack of understanding of the physiological contributions of KCNE4. In heart, where KCNE4 could modulate repolarizing currents, such as IKs, and where local free Ca2+ concentrations cycle dramatically, the Ca2+-CaM sensitivity described here for KCNE4 may enable Ca2+-dependent regulation of repolarization time. Because repolarization time is critical for action potential duration as well as Ca2+ release and contractility (37Sah R. Ramirez R.J. Kaprielian R. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), CaM-KCNE4 interactions might constitute part of a feedback loop for regulating intracellular Ca2+. Further characterization of KCNE4 L(69–72)A in native cardiac myocytes will be valuable toward establishing the physiological consequences of disrupting the interaction between KCNE4 and CaM. The novel protein-protein interaction we demonstrated in this study reinforces the notion that KV channels function as dynamic protein complexes subject to regulation by both accessory subunits and intracellular signaling molecules, which may themselves interact to impact channel function.

Although hemoglobins are widespread in ""entomostracan"" Crustacea, malacostracans harbor the copper-containing hemocyanin in their hemolymph. Usually, only one type of respiratory protein occurs within a single species. Here, we report the identification of a hemoglobin of the shore crab Carcinus maenas (Malacostraca, Brachyura). In contrast to the dodecameric hemocyanin of this species, C. maenas hemoglobin does not reside in the hemolymph but is restricted to the gills. Immunofluorescence studies and cell fractioning showed that C. maenas hemoglobin resides in the membrane of the chief cells of the gill. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a membrane-bound hemoglobin has been identified in eukaryotes. Bioinformatic evaluation suggests that C. maenas hemoglobin is anchored in the membrane by N-myristoylation. Recombinant C. maenas hemoglobin has a hexacoordinate binding scheme at the Fe(2+) and an oxygen affinity of P(50) = 0.5 Torr. A rapid autoxidation rate precludes a function as oxygen carrier. We rather speculate that, analogous to prokaryotic membrane-globins, C. maenas hemoglobin carries out enzymatic functions to protect the lipids in cell membrane from reactive oxygen species. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic studies suggested that the ancestral arthropod hemoglobin was most likely an N-myristoylated protein that did not have an O(2) supply function. True respiratory hemoglobins of arthropods, however, evolved independently in chironomid midges and branchiopod crustaceans."

Sororin is required for the increased stability of the cohesin complex on chromatin following DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion during G(2). The mechanism by which sororin ensures cohesion is currently unknown. Because the primary sequence of sororin does not contain any previously characterized structural or functional motifs, we have undertaken a structure-function analysis of the sororin protein. Using a series of mutant derivatives of sororin, we show that the ability of sororin to bind to chromatin is separable from both its role in sister chromatid cohesion and its interaction with the cohesin complex. We also show that derivatives of sororin with deletions or mutations in the conserved C terminus fail to rescue the loss-of-cohesion phenotype caused by sororin RNAi and that these mutations also abrogate the association of sororin with the cohesin complex. Our data suggest that the interaction of the highly conserved motif at the C terminus of sororin with the cohesin complex is critical to its ability to mediate sister chromatid cohesion."

For the UmuD2 models in cis, the elbows-down (Fig. 1B) or elbows-up conformations suggest that the arms can bind their own globular domains (8Beuning P.J. Simon S.M. Zemla A. Barsky D. Walker G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9633-9640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The proposed models are also consistent with cross-linking experiments completed at physiologically relevant concentrations (22Guzzo A. Lee M.H. Oda K. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7295-7303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ohta T. Sutton M.D. Guzzo A. Cole S. Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal arms (residues 1–39) of trans-UmuD2 form an extensive interface that spans the homodimer while making widespread contacts with the C-terminal globular domain. Residues 25–40 of the arms of UmuD2 that loop down and across the C-terminal domain not only alter the interacting surface of the protein but are most likely a source of stability for the dimer (6Sutton M.D. Guzzo A. Narumi I. Costanzo M. Altenbach C. Ferentz A.E. Hubbell W.L. Walker G.C. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The flexible regions of UmuD2 also include the “neck” region surrounding peptides 33–43 and 41–52 as seen by high levels of deuterium uptake (24Fang J. Rand K.D. Silva M.C. Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Beuning P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies of this region also support the model of solvent accessibility of residues 31–36 and 39–40 (22Guzzo A. Lee M.H. Oda K. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7295-7303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the relatively efficient cross-linking of mono-cysteine derivatives at position 37 and 38 of UmuD2 implies that these residues are close to the dimer interface (22Guzzo A. Lee M.H. Oda K. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7295-7303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is intriguing that the identical residues do not cross-link in the case of UmuD′2, possibly suggesting a greater degree of structural flexibility relative to full-length UmuD (22Guzzo A. Lee M.H. Oda K. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7295-7303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The arms of UmuD′2 (residues 25–39), which are extended and disordered, are not engaged in the dimerization of the protein. The C-terminal globular domain of UmuD′2 also displays a great deal of plasticity and flexibility as is evident from the NMR solution structure and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments (15Ferentz A.E. Opperman T. Walker G.C. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4287-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Fang J. Rand K.D. Silva M.C. Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Beuning P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The comparative flexibility of wild-type UmuD′2 relative to UmuD is also demonstrated by the robust cross-linking efficiency of UmuD′2 S57C as opposed to the reduced cross-linking efficiency of UmuD2 S57C (6Sutton M.D. Guzzo A. Narumi I. Costanzo M. Altenbach C. Ferentz A.E. Hubbell W.L. Walker G.C. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the UmuD proteins may adopt multiple conformations in solution. In an effort to learn more about the structural dynamics and functions of UmuD proteins, we set out to create variants that were defective in dimerization. Such a variant would not only answer the question as to whether UmuD2 is active in the cis conformation but also address the possibility that UmuD may be functionally active as a monomer. In monomeric UmuD, an intramolecular (cis) conformation is the only conformation possible for the arm binding to the globular domain. Although models of UmuD2 with the arms in the cis conformation have been proposed, evidence that this conformation is physiologically relevant has been lacking to date. We focused on the region near the α-helix composed of residues 39–44, as it has been proposed to be important for UmuD2 dimerization (22Guzzo A. Lee M.H. Oda K. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7295-7303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ohta T. Sutton M.D. Guzzo A. Cole S. Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We also considered the importance of α-helices in protein stability as in the case of leucine zipper dimerization, transmembrane helix interactions, and numerous other examples (26Finger C. Volkmer T. Prodöhl A. Otzen D.E. Engelman D.M. Schneider D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we hypothesized that disrupting the contacts between the α-helical regions of UmuD2 would result in a reduction in dimerization efficiency. We generated a single point mutation, N41D, that is likely to not only alter the hydrogen bonding network but also to produce repulsive interhelical electrostatic interactions. In this work we have found that the single amino acid substitution N41D is sufficient to shift the dimer-monomer equilibrium of UmuD significantly to the monomer form. This single mutation also renders UmuD′ a monomer. We find that this variant of UmuD is a monomer under most conditions, is active in self-cleavage, and is proficient for UV-induced mutagenesis. The E. coli strains and plasmids used for this study are listed in Table 1. The operator sequences of pGY9739 and pGY9738 contain the o1c mutation where a single base substitution leads to modestly increased expression of umuD and umuC (28Beuning P.J. Chan S. Waters L.S.

Competent cells were prepared using the CaCl2 method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Massachusetts General Hospital Core Facility, Cambridge, MA). Mutagenic primer sequences are N41D forward (5′-GCGCATCGATCTGGATCAACTGTTGATCC) and N41D reverse (5′-GGATCAACAGTTGATCCAGATCGATGCGC).TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsRelevant genotypeSource or referenceStrainAB1157argE3Laboratory stockGW8017AB1157 ΔumuDC22Guzzo A.

The β clamp was also purified using the method published for UmuD and UmuD′. DinB and RecA proteins were purified as described (31Beuning P.J. Simon S.M. Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Walker G.C.

Purified wild-type UmuD2 and UmuD′2 (10 μm) as well as UmuD N41D and UmuD′ N41D (10 μm) were each incubated in non-denaturing sample buffer (NDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min with or without the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Electrophoresis was carried out by 10–20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Lonza) using non-denaturing electrode buffer (NDE, 25 mm Tris-Base, 192 mm glycine) at a constant 120 V at room temperature until proteins were resolved. The gel was then stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes), which has a detection limit of 0.25–1 ng for most proteins. Fluorescence was detected with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager using excitation wavelength of 635 nm. UmuD monomer and dimer bands were quantified using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Concentrations of UmuD N41D and UmuD′ N41D ranging from 5 to 200 μm were combined with 10 mm DTT and NDS buffer in preparation for native PAGE. Wild-type UmuD2 and UmuD′2 at concentrations of 10, 100, and 200 μm were included as controls. Protein bands were detected with Sypro Ruby and quantified as described above. The calculations used to determine the KD for homodimerization (including equations and derivations) have been previously described (34Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. Binding and Kinetics for Molecular Biologists. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007Google Scholar). The following equation was applied to the data set to obtain the KD for homodimerization. [AA][A]T=12+KD−(KD2+8KD[A]T)0.5(8[A]T)(Eq. 1) In this equation [A]T is the total concentration of A added to the reaction, and [AA] is the concentration of dimers. The KD was obtained by generating a best fit curve for the average of three trials using nonlinear regression curve fitting in GraphPad Prism. An optical 96-well reaction plate (Applied Biosystems) was used to analyze 16-μl reaction volumes. Each well contained UmuD Tm buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl), 45 μm UmuD protein, and 25× Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes). The plates were sealed using optical adhesive film (Applied Biosystems). An iCycler iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) was used to heat the plate from 10 to 70 °C in 0.1 °C increments. Changes in the fluorescence were monitored concurrently with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The temperature midpoint for the protein unfolding transition, Tm, was calculated by fitting the fluorescence data to a Boltzmann model using curve-fitting program Microsoft Excel XLfit5 add-on program (ID Business Solutions) (24Fang J.

The addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was used to quench the reaction before analysis by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Pierce).

Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cleavage products were analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Pierce). Proteins were detected by staining with Sypro Ruby as described above. To assay the inhibition of UmuD cleavage by DinB, wild-type UmuD2, and UmuD N41D at concentrations of 2 μm were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the absence of wild-type DinB or in the presence of 2 or 4 μm wild-type DinB in LG buffer (31Beuning P.J. Simon S.M. Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 318-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a separate reaction, 3.15 μm RecA, 0.35 μm 24-mer DNA oligo, and 0.68 μm ATPγS were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reactions were combined and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The 20-μl reaction was then quenched with 5 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer before analysis by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Pierce). Sypro Ruby was used for protein detection as described above. The level of UmuD and UmuD′ expression from the low-copy plasmids pGY9739 and pGY9738, respectively, in GW8017 was determined by Western blotting. Induction of expression with UV irradiation was accomplished as previously described (28Beuning P.J. Chan S. Waters L.S. Addepalli H. Ollivierre J.N. Walker G.C. J.

For experiments using denaturing conditions, cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.85% saline and 50 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer. Cells were lysed by heating for 20 min at 95 °C before loading 15-μl aliquots onto 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Pierce). Electrophoresis was carried out using Tris-Hepes-SDS running buffer (100 mm Tris base, 100 mm Hepes, 1% SDS) at 120 V for 1 h 15 min. These assays were carried out with loading amounts appropriate to give a signal within the linear range of quantification (Fig. 5D). For experiments carried out under non-denaturing conditions, a gentle lysis BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) was used per the manufacturer's directions. For native PAGE, 10 μl of supernatant was added to 20 μl of NDS buffer, and half of the reaction was loaded onto 10–20% polyacrylamide gels (Lonza). Electrophoresis was accomplished using NDE buffer at 120 V for 3.5 h. Immunoblotting experiments were completed as previously described (28Beuning P.J. Chan S. Waters L.S. Addepalli H.
