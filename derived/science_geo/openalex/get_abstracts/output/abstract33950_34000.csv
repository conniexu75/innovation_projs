https://openalex.org/W2001962665,"Allele loss is a hallmark of chromosome regions harboring recessive oncogenes. Lung cancer frequently demonstrates loss of heterozygosity on 17p. Recent evidence suggests that the p53 gene located on 17p13 has many features of such an antioncogene. The p53 gene was frequently mutated or inactivated in all types of human lung cancer. The genetic abnormalities of p53 include gross changes such as homozygous deletions and abnormally sized messenger RNAs along with a variety of point or small mutations, which map to the p53 open reading frame and change amino acid sequence in a region highly conserved between mouse and man. In addition, very low or absent expression of p53 messenger RNA in lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung was seen. These findings, coupled with the previous demonstration of 17p allele loss in lung cancer, strongly implicate p53 as an anti-oncogene whose disruption is involved in the pathogenesis of human lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1577460994,"Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy has been applied to measure radical generation in the postischemic heart; however, there is controversy regarding the methods used and the conclusion as to whether radicals are generated. In order to resolve this controversy, direct and spin trapping measurements of the time course and mechanisms of radical generation were performed in isolated perfused rabbit hearts. In reperfused tissue, 3 prominent radical signals are observed: A, isotropic g = 2.004 suggestive of a semiquinone; B, anisotropic g parallel = 2.033 and g perpendicular = 2.005 suggestive of ROO.; and C, a triplet g = 2.000 and aN = 24 G suggestive of a nitrogen centered radical. B and C, however, are highly labile and disappear at temperatures probably encountered in some previous studies. In normally perfused hearts, A is observed with only small amounts of B and C. During ischemia, B and C increase reaching a maximum after 45 min while A decreases. On reflow with oxygenated perfusate all 3 signals increase. With varying duration of ischemia and reflow, peak signal intensities occurred after 15 s of reflow following 30 min of ischemia. Reperfusion with superoxide dismutase, deferoxamine, or mannitol abolished the reperfusion increase of B. Measurements performed with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrated a similar time course of radical generation with prominent DMPO-OH and DMPO-R signals peaking between 10 and 20 s of reflow. Superoxide dismutase and deferoxamine also quenched these signals. Thus, .O2- derived .OH, R., and ROO. radicals are generated in postischemic myocardium. While the experimental techniques used can result in loss of intrinsic radicals and generation of extraneous radicals, with proper care and controls valid measurements of free radicals in biological tissues can be performed."
https://openalex.org/W1533075742,"Abstract Protein import into the cell nucleus requires specific binding of nuclear proteins to the nuclear pore complex. Based on amino acid sequence motifs of known nuclear targeting signals, we identified peptides within a number of nuclear proteins with likely nuclear targeting potential and tested their function by transfecting into cells fusion genes that produce the cytoplasmic reporter protein, pyruvate kinase (PK), joined to the test sequence. Sequences within c-myb (PLLKKIKQ), N-myc (PPQKKIKS), p53 (PQPKKKP), and c-erb-A (SKRVAKRKL) oncoproteins that direct PK hybrids into the nucleus were identified. A peptide (GRKKRRQRRRAP) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat protein (Tat), which contains two short basic regions, targets fusion proteins to the nucleolus. The COOH-terminal basic Tat region (QRRRAP) does not target PK hybrid proteins into the nucleus, but mutation of two basic amino acids in this region decreases but does not abolish nucleolar accumulation mediated by the entire Tat nucleolar targeting sequence. Moreover, the c-Myc nuclear targeting sequence fused to the COOH-terminal basic Tat region (PAAKRVKLDQRRRAP) effectively localizes PK hybrids to the nucleus and nucleolus. A similar sequence (FKRKHKKDISQNKRAVRR) in the human heat-shock protein HSP70 also localizes PK to the nucleus and nucleolus."

https://openalex.org/W1970968166,"An 88-base pair fragment in the core promoter of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a functional promoter and a strong liver-specific enhancer. This enhancer functions in human hepatoma cells, where it is much more active than the previously described HBV enhancer in stimulating expression of the linked bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expressed from heterologous promoters. Studies of the role of this enhancer-promoter in HBV may help to clarify mechanisms of gene expression in cells infected with HBV and the role of the virus in the pathogenesis of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W1665506700,"Absolute concentrations of inositol phosphate isomers (InsP(s] were quantified in the myeloid cell line HL-60 using the metal-dye detection technique. Stimulation with the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) led to distinct alterations in at least seven different inositol phosphate species. Whereas the intracellular concentrations of the tetrakisphosphate isomers (InsP4(s] were found below the micromolar range, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakis- and hexakisphosphate levels were about two orders of magnitude higher (36 and 54 +/- 2 microM (mean +/- S.D.), respectively). The three InsP4(s) showed distinct kinetic pattern upon receptor activation, the transient elevation of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate being faster both in onset and in redecrease than inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate. Whereas the two latter isomers reached maximally 2.75 and 2.9 +/- 0.2 microM, respectively, 1 min after stimulation, inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate remained elevated (3.5 +/- 0.4 microM) up to 5 min after fMLP. Unexpected changes in highly phosphorylated InsP(s) were observed, notably a rise in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and in inositol hexakisphosphate to 52 +/- 3 and 60 +/- 1 microM, respectively. In terms of mass, the increases in highly phosphorylated inositols are by far highest among all InsP(s). Combining radiotracer method with mass determination it was observed that the specific radioactivity of various InsP(s) was different and changed markedly upon fMLP stimulation, in spite of a prolonged labeling period leading to apparent isotopic steady state. The data presented demonstrate agonist-induced elevations of highly phosphorylated InsP(s) and suggest that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, product of receptor-activated phospholipase C, is metabolized rather via phosphorylation than only by dephosphorylation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1511640438,"Abstract Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin is a calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclase enzyme which has the capacity to enter eukaryotic target cells and catalyze the conversion of endogenous ATP into cyclic AMP. In this work, the AC holotoxin molecule is identified and isolated. It is a single polypeptide of apparent 216 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Monoclonal antibodies which immunoprecipitate AC activity from extracts of wild type B. pertussis (BP338) react with this 216-kDa band on Western blots, and it is absent from a transposon Tn5 mutant (BP348) specifically lacking AC toxin. Isolation of the 216-kDa protein to greater than 85% purity by hydrophobic chromatography, preparative sucrose gradient centrifugation, and affinity chromatography using either calmodulin-Sepharose or monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose 4B yields stepwise increases in AC toxin potency, to a maximum of 88.3 mumol of cAMP/mg of target cell protein/mg of toxin. Electroelution of the 216-kDa band following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yields a preparation with both AC enzyme and toxin activities. These data indicate that this protein represents the AC holotoxin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1492885137,"The ability of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase, HeLa polymerase α, and HeLa polymerase β to utilize several dGTP analogues has been investigated using a defined synthetic template primer. The relative efficiencies of the triphosphates of 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine (acyclovir triphosphate, ACVTP), 9-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl] guanine (ganciclovir triphosphate, DHPGTP), and 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine (ddGTP) as substrates for the three polymerases were: HSV-1 polymerase, dGTP ≫ ACVTP ≅ DHPGTP ≫ ddGTP; polymerase α, dGTP ≫ ACVTP ≅ DHPGTP ≫ ddGTP; polymerase β, ddGTP ≫ dGTP ≫ ACVTP ≅ DHPGTP. The potent inhibition of HSV-1 polymerase by ACVTP has been shown previously to be due to the formation of a dead-end complex upon binding of the next 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate encoded by the template after incorporation of acyclovir monophosphate into the 3′ end of the primer (Reardon, J. E., and Spector, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7405–7411). This mechanism was shown here to be a general mechanism for inhibition of polymerases by the obligate chain terminators, ACVTP and ddGTP. The ACVTP-induced inhibition was 30-fold more potent with HSV-1 polymerase than with polymerase α. This difference may contribute to the antiviral selectivity of this nucleotide analogue. The effect of ganciclovir monophosphate incorporation (a nonobligate chain terminator) on subsequent primer extension was also evaluated. With HSV-1 polymerase and polymerase α, although there was a considerable reduction in the efficiency of utilization of the 3′-DHPGMP-terminal primer, contrasting kinetic behavior was observed. With HSV-1 polymerase, insertion of DHPGTP resulted in a significant reduction in Vmax for subsequent nucleotide incorporations. In contrast, with polymerase α, a relatively small decrease in Vmax was accompanied by increased Km values for subsequent nucleotide incorporations."
https://openalex.org/W1511406372,"Abstract The proton motive force (delta mu H+) plays an important role, although it is not absolutely essential, in the in vitro translocation of secretory proteins, such as OmpA, across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli (Yamada, H., Tokuda, H., and Mizushima, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1723-1728). The transient accumulation in membrane vesicles of a possible translocation intermediate of OmpA was observed in the absence of delta mu H+. The intermediate was detected on a polyacrylamide gel as a proteinase K-resistant band corresponding to a molecular weight of 26,000. The intermediate did not possess the signal peptide. The appearance of this band was inhibited in the absence of ATP or the presence of adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) and enhanced upon the addition of SecA. Upon the addition of NADH that energizes the membrane, the intermediate was converted to the translocated form of OmpA, even in the presence of AMP-PNP. These results suggest different requirements of ATP and delta mu H+ for the early and late stages of the translocation reaction. The SecA requirement for the early stage of the translocation has also been suggested. In addition to this band, two other bands were observed at higher positions on the gel, when the translocation reaction was performed in the absence of delta mu H+. Although these two bands also represented the mature form of OmpA, which was partly protected from the proteinase K treatment by the membrane vesicles, the accumulation was not transient. These bands did not appear when the translocation reaction was performed in the presence of dithiothreitol. Together with other evidence, the above observations suggest that OmpA, which has an intramolecular disulfide bridge, cannot undergo the translocation unless delta mu H+ is imposed."
https://openalex.org/W1559124731,"Abstract cDNAs containing the entire coding regions of the alpha and beta subunits of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) were isolated from a rat cerebrum cDNA library, ligated into an expression vector under the control of SV40 early promoter and introduced into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To investigate the role of the alpha and beta subunits and their functional domains in CaM kinase II activity, the properties of the kinases expressed in the transfected cells were studied. CaM kinase II activity was detected in the transfected cells when the alpha and beta cDNAs were introduced into CHO cells simultaneously. RNA transfer blot and protein immunoblot analyses demonstrated the expression of the mRNAs and proteins of both alpha and beta subunits in the cloned cells. When alpha or beta cDNA was introduced into CHO cells separately, a significant level of the enzyme activity was also expressed, indicating that the alpha and beta subunits exhibited enzyme activity individually. The apparent Km values for ATP and MAP 2 were almost the same for the alpha subunit, beta subunit, alpha beta complex, and brain CaM kinase II. However, there was a slight difference in the affinity for calmodulin between the expressed proteins. The alpha and beta subunits expressed in the same cells polymerized to form alpha beta complex of a size similar to that of brain CaM kinase II. The alpha subunit also polymerized to form an oligomer, which showed almost the same S value as that of alpha beta complex and brain CaM kinase II. In contrast, the beta subunit did not polymerize. The alpha subunit, beta subunit, alpha beta complex, and brain CaM kinase II were autophosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, which resulted in the appearance of Ca2+-independent activity. The Ca2+-independent activity was 60-75% of the total activity as measured in the presence of Ca2+ plus calmodulin. To examine the functional relationship of peptide domains of the subunits of CaM kinase II, deleted cDNAs were introduced into CHO cells and the properties of the expressed proteins were studied. In cells transfected with alpha or beta cDNA from which the association domain was deleted, a significant level of kinase activity was expressed. However, the expressed proteins showed hardly any autophosphorylation and the appearance of Ca2+-independent enzyme activity was very low, indicating that the association domain was essential for the autophosphorylation and for the appearance of the Ca2+-independent activity."
https://openalex.org/W2145728481,"The in vitro translocation of OmpF-Lpp, a model secretory protein, into inverted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli obligatorily requires the proton motive force (δ mu H+) in the conventional assay system (Yamada, H., Tokuda, H., and Mizushima, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1723-1728). The translocation, however, took place efficiently, even in the absence of δ mu H+, when the system was supplemented with additional SecA. With the stripped membrane vesicles, which are permeable to protons, or in the absence of NADH, the supplementation of SecA remarkably stimulated the translocation activity. The further addition of NADH did not significantly enhance the translocation activity under the SecA-enriched conditions. OmpF-Lpp thus translocated could be recovered from the vesicular lumen by sonication, indicating that complete translocation occurred in the absence of δ mu H+. It is suggested that δ mu H+ is required for high affinity interaction of SecA with the presumed secretory machinery in the cytoplasmic membrane and that a high concentration of SecA modulates the δ mu H+ requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1557815911,"In order to analyze the complex activities of histamine H2 receptor activation on neutrophils, human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were differentiated into neutrophils by incubation with dimethyl sufoxide, loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive indicator dyes, indo-1 or fura-2, and the levels of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) measured in a fluorescent-activated cell sorter and fluorimeter, respectively. Histamine increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal concentration (EC50) of approximately 10−6 to 10−5 M, which exhibited H2 receptor specificity. Prostaglandin E2 and isoproterenol also induced [Ca2+]i mobilization in HL-60 cells, whereas the cell permeable form of cAMP and forskolin failed to increase [Ca2+]i. Since H2-receptor mediated [Ca2+]i mobilization was not inhibited by reducing the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ nor by the addition of Ca2+ channel antagonists, LaCl3 and nifedipine, [Ca2+]i mobilization is due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Furthermore, both 10−4 M histamine and 10−6 M fMet-Leu-Phe increased the levels of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate. However, histamine-induced mobilization of [Ca2+]i was inhibited by cholera toxin but not by pertussis toxin, whereas the action of fMet-Leu-Phe was inhibited by pertussis toxin but not by cholera toxin. These data suggest that H2 receptors on HL-60 cells are coupled to two different cholera toxin-sensitive G-proteins and activate adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1499613870,"In this report we describe an activated form of S6 protein kinase in rabbits treated acutely with insulin. The major insulin-stimulated activity in rabbit liver is increased 2- to 5-fold compared to material from untreated animals based on DEAE-cellulose profiles. The activity observed in DEAE-cellulose fractions can be separated into a major and a minor peak, each having very similar chromatographic behavior. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, S-Sepharose, heptyl-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, and Mono Q results in greater than 20,000-fold purification of the insulin-stimulated enzyme with a 12% recovery. The stimulated activity has chromatographic properties similar to an S6 protein kinase studied previously in 3T3-L1 cells (Cobb, M. H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12994-12999) and other systems. The enzyme purified from insulin-treated animals contains a major band that migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with Mr congruent to 70,000; this band also appears in the control preparation. Treatment of the insulin-stimulated S6 kinase with the catalytic subunit of phosphatase 2a reduces its activity by 97%. The activity of the inactivated S6 kinase is stimulated nearly 5-fold by a 15-min preincubation with partially purified insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1635059056,"A receptor for acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF, respectively) was isolated from 7-day embryonic chick. Chromatography of solubilized membrane proteins on wheat germ agglutininagarose and aFGF-Sepharose yielded three major polypeptides migrating at 150, 70, and 45 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These polypeptides were eluted from aFGF-Sepharose with either 1.0 M NaCl or 100 micrograms/ml heparin, but were not retained on underivatized Sepharose. Cross-linking of 125I-aFGF or 125I-bFGF to either crude membrane preparations or to purified fractions yielded a 165-kDa complex, suggesting the existence of a 150-kDa FGF receptor after subtraction of approximately 15 kDa for 125I-FGF. Addition of excess aFGF or bFGF competed for binding of either 125I-aFGF or 125I-bFGF to FGF receptor preparations. Purified FGF receptor fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and incubated with 125I-aFGF or 125I-bFGF in order to identify FGF-binding polypeptides. Bound 125I-aFGF and 125I-bFGF were displaced by aFGF and bFGF, but not epidermal growth factor, consistent with the identification of the 150-kDa polypeptide as a receptor for acidic and basic FGF. Treatment of purified FGF receptor fractions with N-glycanase demonstrated that the 150-kDa polypeptide contained approximately 10 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharide. The apparent molecular mass of the 150-kDa polypeptide was unaffected by treatment with heparitinase, indicating that the 150-kDa polypeptide is not a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Together, these data suggest that the 150-kDa polypeptide is a FGF receptor that may mediate the biological activities of aFGF and bFGF."
https://openalex.org/W1564744465,"Abstract The breakdown of exogenously added [3H]inositol-labeled phosphoinositides by rat brain cortical membranes was stimulated by the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol. The stimulation required the presence of guanine nucleotide. Optimal conditions were similar to those described for guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) + carbachol stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown in [3H]inositol-prelabeled brain membranes (Claro, E., Garcia, A., and Picatoste, F. (1989) Biochem J. 261, 29-35). Carbachol stimulated [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) breakdown was inhibited by atropine and guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiobisphosphate). The magnitude of the stimulation of exogenous PIP2 breakdown by carbachol and GTP gamma S (2- to 3-fold) was little affected over a PIP2 concentration range of 0.03-100 microM. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) was as good a substrate at all concentrations as PIP2 for carbachol stimulation of phospholipase C activity. There was appreciable phosphomonoesterase degradation of PIP to phosphatidylinositol (PI) over 10 min. There was also some conversion of added PIP to PIP2 in the presence of added ATP. The effect of calcium on PIP breakdown was similar to that on PIP2 breakdown, with an apparent EC50 for Ca2+ stimulation of 0.74 and 0.72 microM, respectively, under basal conditions. The stimulation of PIP2 and PIP breakdown by carbachol in the presence of GTP gamma S was greatest on a percentage basis at the lowest free Ca2+ concentrations. Above 1 microM free Ca2+, the stimulatory effect was lost, whereas 10 microM free Ca2+ gave a maximal stimulation of basal phospholipase C activity. Degradation of added PI was also stimulated by carbachol in the absence of ATP. PI breakdown had an EC50 for Ca2+ stimulation of 1.07 microM. The best stimulation of PI breakdown due to carbachol plus GTP gamma S was seen with 0.3 microM free Ca2+ and 100 microM PI. Maximal activation of PI breakdown was seen at 1 mM deoxycholate as was true for PIP2 and PIP breakdown. There was little effect, even of 30 microM GTP gamma S alone or of carbachol alone, on PI breakdown. Half-maximal activation of the carbachol response required only 0.2 microM GTP gamma S. These results indicate that the phospholipase C enzyme(s) activated by carbachol in the presence of GTP gamma S in rat brain cortical membranes can degrade PIP2, PIP, and PI to inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol."

Unautolyzed m-calpain, autolyzed m-calpain, and autolyzed mu-calpain required less Ca2+ for half-maximal binding to calpastatin than for half-maximal activity. Unautolyzed mu-calpain, however, required slightly more Ca2+ for half-maximal binding to calpastatin than for half-maximal activity. Half-maximal binding of oxidatively inactivated mu- or m-calpain to calpastatin required approximately the same Ca2+ concentrations as half-maximal binding of unautolyzed mu- or m-calpain, respectively, to calpastatin. Binding of unautolyzed m-calpain and autolyzed mu-calpain to calpastatin occurred over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations, and it seems likely that two or more Ca2+-binding sites with different Ca2+-binding constants are involved in binding of the calpains to calpastatin. Proteolytic activity occurs at different Ca2+ concentrations than calpastatin binding, suggesting a second set of Ca2+-binding sites associated with proteolytic activity. Third and fourth sets of Ca2+-binding sites may be involved in autolysis and in binding to phosphatidylinositol or cell membranes; these four Ca2+-dependent properties of the calpains may require the eight potential Ca2+-binding sites that amino acid sequences predict are present in the calpain molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1496754597,"Abstract We have investigated the association of human topoisomerase I with poly(ADP-ribosylated) domains of chromatin and the effects of this modification on the enzyme activity. In vitro poly(ADP-ribosylation) assays demonstrated that this enzyme was one of the major acceptors for this chromatin-dependent post-translational modification. Western blotting procedures using antibody to topoisomerase I indicated that under extensive poly(ADP-ribosylation) conditions, where a majority of poly(ADP-ribose) acceptor molecules form aggregates, the major population of the topoisomerase I associated with chromatin was apparently non-aggregated. The catalytic activity of the topoisomerase I associated with the poly(ADP-ribosylated) chromatin was 3-5-fold inhibited. Additionally, antibody to poly(ADP-ribose) was used to immunofractionate selectively the modified domains of chromatin. Our data suggests the presence of topoisomerase I, both adjacent and distal to the poly(ADP-ribosylated) sites of chromatin. Unmodified and a significant portion of the modified species of enzyme migrated as approximately 100-kDa proteins. However, the modified form of topoisomerase was noted to be catalytically less active as compared to the enzyme bound to the non-poly(ADP-ribosylated) nucleosomes. These results provide evidence, at the cellular level, for the poly(ADP-ribosylation)-mediated regulation of human topoisomerase I and suggest a functional significance for poly(ADP-ribosylation) in topoisomerase-related processes (replication, transcription, and recombination) in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1598570827,"Abstract Haloperoxidases have been detected in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and mammals. Mammalian haloperoxidases are known to be directly involved in the oxidative destruction of microorganisms. The algal bromoperoxidases are probably involved in the biosynthesis of bromometabolites, most of which show considerable bactericidal activity. From the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (order, Fucales) two different bromoperoxidases have been isolated, which both contain vanadium as an essential element for enzymic activity. The location of these two enzymes, determined by activity staining of cross-sections of algal parts, was different. Bromoperoxidase I (which has been described before) was located inside the thallus, particularly around the conceptacles, whereas bromoperoxidase II was present at the thallus surface of the alga. The molecular masses of these bromoperoxidases as judged from sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis were 97 and 106 kDa, respectively. Some of the enzymatic properties (pH optimum and Km for bromide) of the two enzymes were slightly different, whereas the amino acid compositions were more or less equal. The isoelectric point of the two proteins was the same, namely 5.0. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels both enzymes could be stained with periodic acid Schiff's reagent, so both are glycoproteins. Since only bromoperoxidase II could be bound to a concanavalin A-Sepharose column, these enzymes contain different carbohydrates. Both enzymes display a considerable thermostability. However, the chemical stability of the two bromoperoxidases differed. Bromoperoxidase II could also be inactivated by dialysis at low pH and reactivation was only possible with the transition metal vanadium and not with other metal ions. The presence of vanadium in this enzyme could be established with atomic absorption spectrophotometry and electron paramagnetic resonance. The EPR signals of both bromoperoxidases, which were observed after reduction with sodium dithionite, were similar: only minor differences were observed in the hyperfine coupling. In immunoblotting experiments these two bromoperoxidases were found to cross-react, so they have common antigenic determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2419601986,"Amplification of c-myc, c-erbB-2, hst and int-2 proto-oncogenes was investigated in two independently collected breast tumor series comprising 292 carcinomas. Differences in the frequencies of amplification could be observed between these two series for c-myc (9.3% vs. 20.8%) and hst/int-2 (21.5% vs. 15.6%) whereas similar values were found for c-erbB-2 (22.5% vs. 20.3%). Statistical correlations between amplification and disease parameters were also dependent on population sampling. Therefore we performed our statistical analysis on the pooled populations and focused on the 219 primary breast carcinomas from patients without therapy prior to surgery. Amplification of c-erbB-2 was strongly correlated to the absence of either estrogen (ER-, P = 0.003) or progesterone (PR-, P = 0.004) receptors. An amplified c-myc was significantly associated with PR- (P = 0.005) and was prevalent in high grade tumors. On the contrary, hst/int-2 amplification was correlated to PR+ tumors (P = 0.01) and was more frequent in ER+ and low grade tumors, and was also correlated with lymph node involvement (P = 0.04). Our data suggest that amplification of each of these proto-oncogenes could be representative of a particular subset of breast tumors. Therefore, proto-oncogene amplification may be helpful in characterizing new biological subclasses in human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1518270161,"Abstract We have investigated the mechanism of inhibition of the serum-free monolayer growth of normal rat kidney (NRK) cells by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). NRK cells grown on fibronectin-coated dishes exhibited a biphasic response to TGF-beta. Monolayer growth was slightly stimulated by subpicomolar concentrations, while picomolar concentrations of TGF-beta inhibited NRK cell growth in the presence or absence of epidermal growth factor. NRK cells exhibited a similar biphasic growth response to exogenous type I collagen. TGF-beta induced a 3-5-fold increase in the deposition of type I collagen-like proteins into the extracellular matrix of NRK cells during serum-free growth. Type I collagen-like proteins were identified by their sensitivity to degradation by purified bacterial collagenase and by Western blot analysis. The TGF-beta dose-response curves for induction of extracellular matrix-localized collagen and inhibition of NRK cell growth were similar. Finally, the inclusion of a purified bacterial collagenase, which did not degrade TGF-beta or TGF-beta receptors, or alter control NRK growth, prevented exogenous collagen or TGF-beta from inhibiting the serum-free growth of NRK cells.

Extracts from cells transfected with expression vectors coding for the C alpha or the C beta isoform of the C subunit required 200 nM protein kinase inhibitor peptide for half-maximal inhibition of kinase activity in extracts from these cells. An affinity column was constructed using this synthetic peptide, and the column was incubated with protein extracts from cells overexpressing C alpha or C beta. Elution of the affinity column with arginine allowed single step isolation of purified C alpha and C beta subunits. The C alpha and C beta proteins were enriched 200-400-fold from cellular extracts by this single step of affinity chromatography. No residual inhibitory peptide activity could be detected in the purified protein. The purified C subunit isoforms were used to demonstrate preferential antibody reactivity with the C alpha isoform by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, preliminary characterization showed both isoforms have similar apparent Km values for ATP (4 microM) and for Kemptide (5.6 microM). These results demonstrate that a combination of affinity chromatography employing peptides derived from the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor protein and the use of cells overexpressing C subunit related proteins may be an effective means for purification and characterization of the C subunit isoforms. Furthermore, this method of purification may be applicable to other kinases which are known to be specifically inhibited by small peptides."
https://openalex.org/W189225254,"Eukaryotic cells possess a multienzyme ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway in which the small, highly conserved protein ubiquitin (Ub) acts as a cofactor. In this pathway, formation of a covalent Ub-substrate conjugate precedes ATP-dependent degradation of the substrate. Inorganic arsenite (AsO2−) inhibited Ub-dependent protein degradation in a concentration-dependent fashion, both in intact rabbit reticulocytes and in a reticulocyte lysate (fraction II). Concentrations of arsenite causing half-maximal inhibition in fraction II varied with the substrate, ranging from 0.025 m M (bovine α-lactalbumin) to 3.3 m M (reduced/carboxymethylated bovine serum albumin). Inhibition was rapidly reversed upon addition of dithiothreitol. Arsenite inhibited the Ub-dependent proteolytic pathway at one or both of two steps, depending on the substrate. 1) Proteins with acidic amino termini must be amino terminally arginylated, in a tRNA-dependent reaction, prior to becoming conjugated to Ub (Ferber, S., and Ciechanover, A. (1987) Nature 326, 808–811). Arsenite inhibited substrate arginylation, and therefore also inhibited Ub conjugation. The inhibited species appeared to be arginyl aminoacyl-tRNA transferase, since arsenite was without strong effect on the rate or extent of arginyl-tRNA formation in fraction II, yet almost completely inhibited arginine transfer from arginyl-tRNA to reduced/carboxymethylated bovine serum albumin. 2) Arsenite also inhibited Ub-substrate conjugate turnover, as shown in pulse-chase experiments. For a given substrate, degradative (protease-dependent) and Ub regenerative (isopeptidase-dependent) components of conjugate turnover were similarly inhibited by arsenite. The potency of this inhibition varied for different substrates. Monosubstituted trivalent arsenicals such as arsenite typically interact with sites containing vicinal sulfhydryl groups. Inhibition by arsenite of two steps in the Ub-dependent proteolytic pathway suggests that the relevant pathway components could possess this kind of structural/catalytic feature."
https://openalex.org/W1541285989,"Abstract The binding of a calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP) with high calcium sensitivity (muCANP) to erythrocyte membranes and its subsequent autolytic activation on the membranes were analyzed by an immunoblot technique. In the presence of calcium ions, muCANP bound to the erythrocyte membranes as a heterodimer of 79- and 28-kDa subunits and was converted quickly on the membranes to an active form with a 76-kDa large subunit. The active form was then released from the membranes to the soluble fraction. These sequential reactions, however, were not specific to inside-out vesicles, but occurred also, except for some Ca2+-independent binding, on right side-out vesicles. A rapid degradation of some membrane proteins was observed after binding of muCANP to the membranes. The binding of muCANP to erythrocyte membranes was inhibited by substrates and the endogenous CANP inhibitor, which is also a suicide substrate. These results strongly suggest that muCANP binds to membranes by recognition of membrane proteins as substrates and not at a special site for activation. Thus, a possible mechanism for muCANP activation on membranes is that muCANP first binds to substrates on membranes, is activated, and then degrades the substrates to deform the membrane structures."
https://openalex.org/W1511714617,"Abstract Beta 2-Microglobulin (beta 2m), a component of the major histocompatibility complex in chordates, has growth factor-like activity for cultured rat cells. We presently describe interactions between beta 2m and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) in osteoblast-enriched cultures. beta 2m increased DNA synthesis and was synergistic with IGF I. Affinity labeling revealed that beta 2m enhanced IGF I receptor number, and Northern analysis and radioimmunoassay showed that beta 2m increased steady state IGF I transcripts and medium IGF I polypeptide levels. These results indicate that the growth-promoting activity of beta 2m is mediated at least in part by regulating local IGF I binding and synthesis by skeletal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1541799897,"Abstract The effects of species-specific monoclonal antibodies to the human insulin receptor on ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation were studied in rodent cell lines transfected with human insulin receptors. First, Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts expressing normal human insulin receptors (3T3/HIR cells) were studied. Three monoclonal antibodies, MA-5, MA-20, and MA-51, activated S6 kinase in these cells but had no effects in untransfected 3T3 cells. Both insulin and MA-5, the most potent antibody, activated S6 kinase in a similar time- and dose-dependent manner. To measure S6 phosphorylation in vivo, 3T3/HIR cells were preincubated with [32P]Pi and treated with insulin and MA-5. Both agents increased S6 phosphorylation, and their tryptic phosphopeptide maps were similar. MA-5 and the other monoclonal antibodies, unlike insulin, failed to stimulate insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity either in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, unlike insulin, they failed to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous cytoplasmic protein, pp 185. Next, HTC rat hepatoma cells, expressing a human insulin receptor mutant that had three key tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the beta-subunit changed to phenylalanines (HTC-IR-F3 cells), were studied. In this cell line but not in untransfected HTC cells, monoclonal antibodies activated S6 kinase without stimulating either insulin receptor autophosphorylation or the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp 185. These data indicate, therefore, that monoclonal antibodies can activate S6 kinase and then increase S6 phosphorylation. Moreover, they suggest that activation of receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins may not be crucial for activation of S6 kinase by the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1567364863,"Abstract Na-H exchange is present in apical membrane vesicles (AMV) isolated from distal colon of normal rats. Because in intact tissue aldosterone both induces amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport and inhibits electroneutral sodium absorption, these studies with AMV were designed to establish the effect of aldosterone on sodium transport. An outward-directed proton gradient stimulated 22Na uptake in AMV isolated from distal colon of normal and dietary sodium depleted (with elevated aldosterone levels) experimental rats. Unlike normal AMV, proton gradient-dependent 22Na uptake in experimental AMV was inhibited when uptake was measured under voltage-clamped conditions. 10 microM amiloride inhibited the initial rate of proton gradient-dependent 22Na uptake in AMV of normal and experimental rats by 30 and 75%, respectively. In contrast, 1 mM amiloride produced comparable inhibition (90 and 80%) of 22Na uptake in normal and experimental AMV. Intravesicular-negative potential stimulated 22Na uptake in experimental but not in normal AMV. This increase was inhibited by 90% by 10 microM amiloride. An analogue of amiloride, 5-(N-ethylisopropyl) amiloride (1 microM), a potent inhibitor of electroneutral Na-H exchange in AMV of normal rat distal colon, did not alter potassium diffusion potential-dependent 22Na uptake. Increasing sodium concentration saturated proton gradient-dependent 22Na uptake in normal AMV. However, in experimental AMV, 22Na uptake stimulated by both proton gradient and potassium diffusion potential did not saturate as a function of increasing sodium concentration. We conclude from these results that an electrically sensitive conductive channel, not electroneutral Na-H exchange, mediates 22Na uptake in AMV isolated from the distal colon of aldosterone rats."
https://openalex.org/W1501977255,"Hepatic parenchymal cells contribute to the clearance of circulating tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in vivo. The hepatocyte extracellular matrix is interposed between the endothelial-lined sinusoids and the parenchymal cell surface and thus may influence t-PA clearance. To test this hypothesis, the well differentiated human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was used to characterize the role of extracellular matrix in t-PA clearance in vitro. Previous studies with these cells demonstrated their capacity for specific catabolism of t-PA in a system modulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In the present study the extracellular matrix growth substratum of HepG2 cells is shown to contain active PAI-1. PAI-1 is distributed in a punctuate pattern throughout the substratum. Components of the substratum confer stability to active PAI-1 for intervals of at least 24 h. Exposing substratum to 125I-t-PA leads rapidly to the formation and release of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable 95-kDa 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 complex. In comparison, cell monolayers have the additional capacity for specific binding of the complex. However, PAI-1 is not detected at the surface of HepG2 cells in suspension, suggesting that 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 complexes form in substratum and subsequently bind to cells. Specific binding of performed 125I-t-PA.PAI-1, but not 125I-t-PA, was demonstrated for HepG2 cells in suspension. These results suggest that components of extracellular matrix participate in the clearance of t-PA by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1521463767,"Abstract The properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase from Bacillus subtilis have been investigated using low temperature magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and resonance Raman spectroscopies. The Raman spectra of the native enzyme in the Fe-S stretching region show a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster that is structurally very similar to those in simple redox proteins. Photochemical reduction mediated by 5-deazaflavin with oxalate as the electron donor resulted in [4Fe-4S]+ clusters with a mixture of ground state spin multiplicities. Magnetic circular dichroism and EPR studies of samples ranging in concentration from 0.15 to 0.4 mM concur in finding S = 3/2 [4Fe-4S]+ clusters with predominantly axial and positive zero field splitting as the dominant species. The EPR studies also revealed minor contributions from S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]+ centers and an S = 5/2 species. The latter becomes the dominant component in more concentrated samples (approximately 2 mM), and arguments are presented in favor of assignment to S = 5/2 [4Fe-4S]+ clusters rather than adventitiously bound high spin Fe(III) ions. The concentration-dependent spin state heterogeneity of the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster in glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase is discussed in light of the magnetic and electronic properties of the [4Fe-4S]+ centers in other enzymes and proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1502532356,"An insulin-like growth factor II variant (IGF-II variant) was purified from Cohn fraction IV1 of human plasma by ion exchange, gel filtration, and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino-terminal sequence of the first 35 amino acid residues showed a replacement of Ser-29 of IGF-II with the tetrapeptide Arg-Leu-Pro-Gly of IGF-II variant. Peptides isolated and sequenced after digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N and endoproteinase Glu-C disclosed no differences with the sequence predicted from an IGF-II variant cDNA clone isolated by Jansen, M., van Shaik, F. M. A., van Tol, H., Van den Brande, J. L., and Sussenbach, J. S. (1985) FEBS Lett., 179, 243-246. The molecular ion of intact IGF-II variant was 7809.4 mass units, as measured by plasma desorption mass spectrometry. This is in close agreement with the molecular ion of 7812.8 mass units calculated from the determined sequence and indicates the entire amino acid sequence had been accounted for. Binding of IGF-II variant to purified insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors demonstrated a 2-3-fold lower affinity for this receptor compared with IGF-I or IGF-II. The dissociation constants for IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-II variant are 0.23, 0.38, and 0.80 nM, respectively. In a growth assay, the concentration of IGF-II and IGF-II variant required to stimulate the half-maximal growth of MCF-7 cells was 4 and 13 nM, respectively. Finally, the amount of IGF-II variant that can be purified by this method constitutes approximately 25% of the total IGF-II isolated from Cohn fraction IV1 of human plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1557030780,"Abstract The photoinduced formation of the covalently labeled cytosolic and nuclear aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptors was studied using 2,3,7,8-[3H]tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as the photoaffinity label. Irradiation of TCDD alone at wavelengths of greater than 300 nm resulted in rapid degradation of this compound (t 1/2 = 8 min). In a separate experiment, the unliganded cytosolic Ah receptor was only slowly inactivated (t 1/2 = 48 min) using the greater than 300 nm light source. Preliminary experiments with rat hepatic cytosol did not result in significant formation of specifically bound [3H]TCDD-protein covalent adducts which could be visualized by autoradiography. Irradiation of [3H]TCDD-nuclear Ah receptor complexes isolated from mouse Hepa 1c1c7 cells for 15 min gave approximately a 40% overall yield of the radiolabeled Ah receptor protein adduct. Denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the [3H]TCDD-nuclear Ah receptor photoadduct gave a single major radiolabeled protein with an apparent molecular size of 91 kDa. The chromatographic properties of the control (dark) and photolabeled nuclear Ah receptor complexes were comparable using Sephacryl S-300 and DNA-Sepharose columns. Velocity sedimentation of both the control (dark) and irradiated nuclear Ah receptor complexes gave specifically bound peaks which sedimented at 6.5 S. However, the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable (buffer-reconstituted) [3H]TCDD-nuclear Ah receptor photo-covalent adduct was eluted from the Sephacryl S-300 column in the void volume and did not exhibit a specifically bound peak after velocity sedimentation analysis due to protein aggregate formation. In contrast, the elution profile of the aggregate on a DNA-Sepharose column was similar to that observed for the control (dark) and photolabeled complexes, which were eluted from the column with salt concentrations between 0.24 and 0.28 M. These photolabeling studies show that [3H] TCDD can act as a photoaffinity label for the Ah receptor and can be utilized as photoligand to probe further the structure and function of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1490457601,"Abstract A procedure is described for purification of DNA polymerase alpha/primase from cultured mouse lymphoblasts. Approximately 0.5 mg of enzyme, free of detectable contaminants, was obtained from 40 g of cells using seven conventional purification steps. The mouse enzyme contains subunits of 180, 70, 56, and 47 kDa, almost completely intact and similar to the subunit sizes reported for DNA polymerase alpha/primase from Drosophila embryos (Kaguni, L. S., Rossignol, J-M., Conaway, R. C., and Lehman, I. R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 2221-2225) and Saccharomyces (Plevani, P., Foiani, M., Valsasnini, P., Badaracco, G., Cheriathundam, E., and Chang, L.M.S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7102-7107). A similar structure has also been inferred for mammalian DNA polymerase alpha/primase; however, previous descriptions of the highly purified mammalian enzyme complex have included substantial evidence of proteolysis and/or partial loss of subunits. In particular, the intact 180-kDa subunit has ordinarily been a minor component, and the molecular mass of the complex and total number of subunits have not been established. Results reported here indicate that the native DNA polymerase alpha/primase consists of one each of the four subunit sizes for a total of 353 kDa, based on estimates from denaturing gels, or 344 kDa when sizes deduced from available nucleic acid sequence data are substituted for three of the four subunits. A figure of 313 kDa was calculated from the sedimentation coefficient (8.9 S) and Stokes radius (81.1 A), the values for which also indicate a frictional ratio of 1.80, corresponding to an axial ratio of approximately 16 and suggesting a highly extended structure."
https://openalex.org/W2007209962,"Abstract Coenzyme A (CoA) transport was studied in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Uptake of CoA was assayed by determining [3H]CoA associated with mitochondria under various conditions. Various oxidizable substrates including alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, or malate stimulated CoA uptake. The membrane proton (delta pH) and electrical (delta psi) gradients, which dissipated with time in the absence of substrate, were maintained at their initial levels throughout the incubation in the presence of substrate. Addition of phosphate caused a concentration-dependent decrease of both delta pH and CoA uptake. Nigericin also dissipated the proton gradient and prevented CoA uptake. Valinomycin also prevented CoA uptake into mitochondria. Although the proton gradient was unaffected, the electrical gradient was completely abolished in the presence of valinomycin. Addition of 5 mM phosphate 10 min after the start of incubation prevented further uptake of CoA into mitochondria. A rapid dissipation of the proton gradient upon addition of phosphate was observed. Addition of nigericin or valinomycin 10 min after the start of incubation also resulted in no further uptake of CoA into with mitochondria; valinomycin caused an apparent efflux of CoA from mitochondria. Uptake was found to be sensitive to external pH displaying a pH optimum at pHext 8.0. Although nigericin significantly inhibited CoA uptake over the pHext range of 6.75-8, maximal transport was observed around pHext 8.0-8.25. Valinomycin, on the other hand, abolished transport over the entire pH range. The results suggest that mitochondrial CoA transport is determined by the membrane electrical gradient. The apparent dependence of CoA uptake on an intact membrane pH gradient is probably the result of modulation of CoA transport by matrix pH."
https://openalex.org/W1502100550,"We have demonstrated that the uptake and agonist-induced release of a pulse of arachidonate are influenced by the size and composition of preexisting endogenous fatty acid pools. EFD-1 cells, an essential fatty acid-deficient mouse fibrosarcoma cell line, were incubated with radiolabeled (14C or 3H] arachidonate, linoleate, eicosapentaenoate (EPA), palmitate, or oleate in concentrations of 0-33 microM for 24 h. After 24 h, the cells were pulsed with 0.67 microM radiolabeled (3H or 14C, opposite first label) arachidonate for 15 min and then stimulated with 10 microM bradykinin for 4 min. Because EFD-1 cells contain no endogenous essential fatty acids, we were able to create essential fatty acid-repleted cells for which the specific activity of the newly constructed endogenous essential fatty acid pool was known. Loading the endogenous pool with the essential fatty acids arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, or linoleate (15-20 nmol of fatty acid incorporated/10(6) cells) decreased the uptake of a pulse of arachidonate from 200 to 100 pmol/10(6) cells but had no effect on palmitate uptake. The percent of arachidonate incorporated during the pulse which was released upon agonist stimulation increased 2-fold (4-8%) as the endogenous pool of essential fatty acids was increased from 0 to 15-20 nmol/10(6) cells. This 8% release was at least 3-fold greater than the percent release from the various endogenous essential fatty acid pools. In contrast, loading the endogenous pool with the nonessential fatty acids oleate or palmitate to more than 2-3 times their preexisting cellular level had no effect on the uptake of an arachidonate pulse. Like the essential fatty acids, increasing endogenous oleate increased (by 2-fold) the percent release of arachidonate incorporated during the pulse, whereas endogenous palmitate had no effect on subsequent agonist-induced release from this arachidonate pool. These studies show that preexisting pools of essential and nonessential fatty acids exert different effects on the uptake and subsequent releasability of a pulse of arachidonate."
https://openalex.org/W1573779138,"Abstract Previously, we isolated an ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway in muscle, liver, and reticulocytes that requires ubiquitin and the enzymes which conjugate ubiquitin to proteins. We report here that skeletal muscle contains another soluble alkaline energy-dependent (but ubiquitin-independent) proteolytic activity. The cleavage of non-ubiquitinated protein substrates by the partially purified protease requires ATP hydrolysis since ATP in the absence of Mg2+, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, and pyrophosphate all fail to stimulate proteolysis. Proteolytic activity is also stimulated by UTP, CTP, and GTP, although not as effectively as by ATP (Km(ATP) = 0.027 mM). The enzyme is inactivated by the serine protease inhibitors diisopropyl fluorophosphate and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, but not by specific inhibitors of aspartic, thiol, or metalloproteases. It is maximally active at pH 8 and has a molecular weight of approximately 600,000. This new activity differs from the 720-kDa multicatalytic proteinase, but resembles the soluble ATP-dependent proteolytic system that we previously isolated from murine erythroleukemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599454160,"The ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) has been identified to reside in structural domain III (residues 405-613) and a portion of domain Ib (residues 385-404) of the molecule (Hwang, J., FitzGerald, D. J., Adhya, S., and Pastan, I. (1987) Cell 48, 129-136). To further determine the carboxyl end region essential for ADP-ribosylation activity, we constructed sequential deletions at the carboxyl-terminal of PE. Our results show that a clone with a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues from Arg-609 to Lys-613 and replaced with Arg-Asn retained wild-type PE ADP-ribosylation activity. Deletion of the terminal amino acid residues from Ala-596 to Lys-613 and replaced with Val-Ile-Asn reduced ADP-ribosylation activity by 75%, while deletions of 36 or more amino acids from the carboxyl terminus completely lose their ADP-ribosylation activity. These modified PEs were also examined for their ability to block PE cytotoxicity. Our results shown that modified PEs which lost their ADP-ribosylation activity correspondingly lost their cytotoxicity. Furthermore, extracts containing PE fragments without ADP-ribosylation activity were able to block the cytotoxic activity of intact PE. Our results thus indicate that carboxyl-terminal amino acids in the Ser-595 region are crucial for ADP-ribosylation activity and, consequently, cytotoxicity of PE. The modified PEs which have lost their ADP-ribosylation activity may also be a route to new PE vaccines."

The compounds with carbon monoxide, methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, and t-butyl isonitriles have been investigated by laser flash photolysis. All are photosensitive and show different degrees of geminate recombination of ligand in the picosecond and nanosecond time ranges. Carbon monoxide shows the least effect. The three straight-chain isonitriles show about 50% geminate recombination with half-times of the order of 10 ns. t-Butyl isonitrile shows more and faster recombination.

https://openalex.org/W1565053833,"Abstract The effects of AMP, fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), and paramagnetic ions on the aromatic region of the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase have been investigated at 300 MHz. Two well resolved peaks in this region of the NMR spectrum are assigned to the protons from the aromatic ring of a tyrosyl residue of the enzyme by chemical modification with tetranitromethane and by nuclear Overhauser effects. Nitration of the tyrosyl residue causes desensitization of the enzyme to AMP inhibition as well as the loss of activity. In the presence of AMP during the modifications, 1 tyrosyl residue could be protected, presumably the one observed by NMR. Binding of AMP, an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme, to rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase leads to an upfield shift of the tyrosyl proton signals in the NMR spectrum. No chemical shift or line broadening could be detected in the presence of the paramagnetic manganous ion, Fru-2,6-P2, or Fru-6-P. The negative intramolecular nuclear Overhauser effect from the ribose H2' proton to the adenine H8 proton of AMP suggested that AMP binds to the enzyme with an anti conformation about the glycosidic bond. The failure to observe intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects between the tyrosyl residue and the protons of AMP indicates that the distances between them are greater than 4 A. On the basis of these observations, it is suggested that the AMP-related tyrosyl residue may be close to the AMP binding site, but it is not directly involved in ligand binding. Rather, the protection of this tyrosyl residue by AMP as observed by chemical modification experiments may well be due to a conformational change that results from covalent modification of the enzyme."
