https://openalex.org/W2067856914,"Antibodies to bradykinin and angiotensin have been produced in rabbits by the use of conjugates containing albumin and the hapten, covalently bound. The use of water-soluble carbodiimide reagents provided an easy and rapid method of synthesis of the antigenic conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2067757416,"Two mutant mice with deficient myelination are described. Quaking is a new autosomal recessive mutant mouse with marked tremor of the hindquarters. The mice eat, swim, breed, and nurse well even though the entire central nervous system is very deficient in myelin by histological and chemical criteria. Myelin formation is impaired; no destruction is seen. Peripheral nerves are myelinated. Jimpy, a known sex-linked mutation, has similar but more severe symptoms and similar pathology, with the additional feature of sudanophilic (nonpolar) lipid distributed in some white-matter tracts. Both mutants offer new opportunities for study of the formation and functions of myelin."
https://openalex.org/W1976757330,"In human blood cells dividing in vitro two chromosomes are occasionally found intimately associated in a quadriradial configuration (Qr). A Qr by traditional interpretation is the result of chromatid interchange. Since the configurations in blood cells often are equal and symmetrical and are composed of homologous chromosomes, they are considered cytological evidence that somatic crossing-over may occur in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2045942894,"Analysis of the fly ash produced by combustion of pulverized Appalachian coal has shown that a 1000-megawatt coal-burning power plant will discharge into the atmosphere from about 28 millicuries to nearly 1 curie per year of radium-226 and radium-228. An oil-burning plant of similar size will discharge about 0.5 millicurie of radium per year. Comparison of these data with data on the release of fission products from nuclear-powered generating stations shows that when the physical and biological properties of the various radionuclides are taken into consideration, the conventional fossil-fueled plants discharge relatively greater quantities of radioactive materials into the atmosphere than nuclearpowered plants of comparable size."
https://openalex.org/W1997497654,"Fluorescent antibody to antigenically distinct portions of 7S gammaglobulin was used to study the occurrence of H-chains and L-chains of types I and II within single cells. Individual lymphoid cells contained both H-and L-chains, but individual cells did not contain both antigenic types of L-chains."
https://openalex.org/W2088581378,"Homogenates of pigeon testes show three types of lactate dehydrogenase isozyme patterns. Recombination of the polypeptide subunits of the dehydrogenase in mixtures of the different types, and the distribution of the three isozyme patterns in six different pigeon populations demonstrated that lactate dehydrogenase synthesis in pigeon testes is under the control of three distinct loci, A, B, and C."

https://openalex.org/W2066482506,"Radioactive iron, which concentrates in erythropoietic marrow, is given intravenously, and 16 hours later pictures of its distribution are taken with the positron camera. The instrument is an imaging device that produces pictures of the distribution of positron-emitting nuclides without scanning. Wide variations in the distribution of marrow are found in various diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2087979921,"Within 70 minutes after the administration of testosterone to rats castrated 12 to 15 hours previously, the rate of synthesis of RNA in the seminal vesicle is increased by 50 percent and continues to rise until approximately 50 minutes after injection when a two- to threefold increase was attained. No further increase was detected for as long as 240 minutes after hormone administration. The base composition of the pulse-labeled RNA was intermediate between that of the total seminal vesicle RNA and DNA-like RNA. No change in this composition was detected at any interval after injection."
https://openalex.org/W1966137027,"Bone marrow of homozygous C57BL/10 donors was tested for growth in x-irradiated isogenic recipient mice, in (C57BL/10 X 129) F(1) mice, and in F(1) hybrids from congenic parents differing respectively, for an allelic substitution at one of the histocompatibility loci H-1, H-2, H-3, and H-4. All the tested H-2 heterozygotes resisted the transplantation of 10(4) parental marrow cells, whereas H-2 homozygotes were nonresistant, in spite of heterozygosity, at one or several other H loci. Findings in F(1) hybrids between C57BL/10 mice and mice carrying alleles resulting from crossing-over within the H-2 locus demonstrated that the hybrid resistance was associated with heterozygosity in the K region, but not in the D region of the H-2 locus."
https://openalex.org/W1977196221,"Long, pleomorphic microvilli project from the walls of adjacent secretory cells in the lacrymal glands of sea turtles, and a substance identified histochemically as a mucopolysaccharide fills the intercellular channels. These features are not characteristic of the principal secretory cells in the salt glands of marine birds."
https://openalex.org/W2008109831,Subjects who were placed in darkness for a week but who were otherwise exposed to a normal and varied sensory environment showed an increase in tactual acuity and in sensitivity to heat and pain. This cutaneous supersensitivity was still present several days after the termination of visual deprivation.
https://openalex.org/W2010797666,"Monkeys with surgically produced lesions of the orbital frontal cortex, monkeys with lesions of the lateral frontal cortex, and normal controls were tested for the effects of repeated presentation of novel stimuli on lever-pressing for food rewards. The results support the conclusion that the habituation of responses to novel stimuli was more impaired in monkeys with orbital frontal lesions than in monkeys with lateral frontal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1998884265,A simple method is described which obviates the difficulties of estimating the concentration of chloramphenicol in the blood in the presence of other antibiotics. This is of importance in avoiding hematologic depression from chloramphenicol toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2004222768,Exacerbations of schizophrenic behavior are associated with elevations of urinary tryptophan metabolites. Free tryptophan and methionine possibly arising from the breakdown of muscle protein may act like an endogenous metabolic factor which enhances behavioral worsening. Some of the apparently spontaneous activations of psychotic symptoms may be intensified by the endogenous liberation of these two compounds.
https://openalex.org/W1972312784,Feeding activity in fasted rats resulted in an immediate increase in brain temperature and a decrease in rectal temperature. The temperature changes did not correlate with any specific property of the food nor with the amount eaten. The responses were judged to be the result of reflex vasomotor changes resulting in widespread shifts in the direction of blood flow. They were not related to the regulation of food intake.
https://openalex.org/W1984109298,"The caries-preventive effect of phosphate additives in cariogenic diets fed to white rats has been further demonstrated. Diammonium phosphate, beta-glycerol phosphate, and sodium phytate again were shown to be caries-inhibiting, as was a 1,6-fructose diphosphate. The caries-inhibiting action of organic phosphates may coincide with a caries-protective factor presumed lost in the refining of sugar and in the processing of certain cereal foods."
https://openalex.org/W2033109133,"Avian sarcoma and leucosis virus preparations grown in chick embryo tissue cultures contained complement-fixing antigens, which were demonstrated with the use of antiserums from hamsters carrying sarcomas induced by the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of avian sarcoma virus. The complement-fixing antigens shared by three different strains of avian leucosis and one strain of avian sarcoma viruses were largely ""soluble"" (having failed to sediment when centrifuged at 59,364g for 70 minutes). Sedimented particles, presumably virus particles, contained the common sarcoma-leucosis antigen as well."
https://openalex.org/W2089002172,"The formate oxidizing system of Methanobacillus omelianskii is specific for nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide and requires ferredoxin, a biological carrier with the lowest known potential. Ferredoxin from other obligate anaerobes is active in the reaction studied."
https://openalex.org/W1965591745,"Three-second interruptions of continuous auditory stimulation, as well as 3-second periods of stimulation from the same sound source, were effective in producing behavioral arousal and electrocortical desynchronization in sleeping cats. Thus, stimulus offset as well as onset may serve an arousal function. Some differences in behavioral response and electrocortical desynchronization latency were noted."
https://openalex.org/W2064029687,"A quartzite believed to be at least 2700 million years old contains pockets of minute red or yellow objects presumably composed of hematite and goethite, respectively. The size and morphology of the objects suggests that most of them may be the remains of microorganisms of at least two species."
https://openalex.org/W2027940680,Mice made phenylketonuric from birth until maturity by continuous administration of phenylalanine plus tyrosine had a subnormal maze-learning ability which was largely prevented when serotonin congeners such as melatonin or 5-hydroxytryptophan were administered continuously from birth to maturity. These results were interpreted to mean that the mental failure of experimental phenylketonuria is attributable to the serotonin deficiency imposed by it in infancy.
https://openalex.org/W1978504676,"Mouse eggs in intraperitoneal diffusion chambers continued normal development up to the stage of implantation, and shedding of the zona pellucida occurred. At the time corresponding to implantation within the uterus, eggs attached to the Millipore surface, where both embryonic and trophoblastic cell populations developed. There was migration of cells, especially of trophoblastic giant cells, away from the point of egg attachment. Egg development was not influenced by the endocrine state of the host."

https://openalex.org/W1997446532,"Studies on the synthesis of cholesterol with cell-free homogenates of liver from rats treated with graded doses of estrone show that, at doses of estrone which cause a reduction in blood cholesterol, there is an accompanying inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, this inhibition appears to occur at the stage of cholesterol biosynthesis at which mevalonate is decarboxylated."
https://openalex.org/W2089290040,The crystal and molecular structure of 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine has been determined by x-ray diffraction methods. The most interesting feature of the structure is an unusually short intermolecular distance between the iodine and oxygen of a carbonyl group; this type of bonding may be the molecular basis for the antiviral activity.
https://openalex.org/W1965100098,"Mixtures of the 2', 3' nucleoside monophosphates obtained from an alkaline hydrolysis of RNA can be resolved into the four main RNA mononucleotides by electrophoresis on thin layers of cellulose. The separated nucleotides are recovered by removing the cellulose layer from the supporting glass plate and suspending the cellulose layer in tris hydrochloride buffer. The extracted cellulose is removed by low-speed centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1980856275,"Reduced audiogenic seizure susceptibility in dilute mice was associated with enhancement of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, previously reported as low in dilute mice. Though nutritional changes complicate the interpretation, evidence exists for a mutation linked with dilute which modifies susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2014785432,"Folic acid antagonists inhibited oviposition by screw-worm flies [Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel); Diptera: Calliphoridae]. Fertility was unaltered when sufficient folic acid was administered simultaneously, or it was partly restored spontaneously about 2 weeks after treatment. Folic acid antagonists principally affected only maturing eggs at any age, rather than those already matured."

https://openalex.org/W1989238949,"Antihistaminic activity was demonstrated previously in extracts of crown gall tumors by assaying in vivo. A crystalline substance isolated from the crude extracts has now been found to possess a high degree of potency against histamine, acetylcholine, bradykinin, and serotonin when assayed in vitro. The chemical characteristics of the substance resemble closely those of tomatine. When tomatine was investigated, it was found to have biological properties similar to those of the crystalline substances isolated from crown gall tumors. It seems likely that the antihistaminic properties of crown-gall tumor extracts are due to tomatine or a substance which closely resembles it."
https://openalex.org/W1998072579,"Studies on sensitivity of Australorbis glabratus to x-rays have defined the chronological and physiological age at which the snail is most sensitive to radiation damage. Results showed that the dose producing 50percent mortality at 30 days after irradiation increased with age but that at 90 days it was practically constant from 2 to 210 days of age. In view of the available data on recovery from radiation damage caused by doses from 6000 to 9000 roentgens it is suggested that doses above those causing 50 percent lethality at 60 days but below those causing 50 percent lethality for 30 days should be considered in setting up ""radiation barriers"" to control snails in water-distribution systems."

https://openalex.org/W1993628677,Twenty-four recessive lethal mutations were detected in a heterokaryon by the method of Atwood and Mukai. All controlled indispensable functions. Genetic analysis revealed that six of these failed to transmit the defect to their progeny. These mutants are believed to be semilethal genetic changes which express a lethal phenotype only in certain genetic backgrounds.
https://openalex.org/W1969015272,"Papain-digested rabbit antibodies to diphtheria toxoid were separated into three fragments. Fragments I and II combined with toxoid in vitro and neutralized toxin. The ratios of these activities were not the same for fragments I and II, indicating that antitoxic and accessory antibody may be distributed unequally between two classes of antibody."
