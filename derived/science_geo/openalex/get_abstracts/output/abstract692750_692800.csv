https://openalex.org/W4225013427,"At least 10,000 virus species have the ability to infect humans but, at present, the vast majority are circulating silently in wild mammals1,2. However, changes in climate and land use will lead to opportunities for viral sharing among previously geographically isolated species of wildlife3,4. In some cases, this will facilitate zoonotic spillover-a mechanistic link between global environmental change and disease emergence. Here we simulate potential hotspots of future viral sharing, using a phylogeographical model of the mammal-virus network, and projections of geographical range shifts for 3,139 mammal species under climate-change and land-use scenarios for the year 2070. We predict that species will aggregate in new combinations at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, causing the cross-species transmission of their associated viruses an estimated 4,000 times. Owing to their unique dispersal ability, bats account for the majority of novel viral sharing and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary pathways that will facilitate future emergence in humans. Notably, we find that this ecological transition may already be underway, and holding warming under 2 °C within the twenty-first century will not reduce future viral sharing. Our findings highlight an urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity surveys tracking the range shifts of species, especially in tropical regions that contain the most zoonoses and are experiencing rapid warming."
https://openalex.org/W4225159577,"Severe COVID-19 is characterized by persistent lung inflammation, inflammatory cytokine production, viral RNA and a sustained interferon (IFN) response, all of which are recapitulated and required for pathology in the SARS-CoV-2-infected MISTRG6-hACE2 humanized mouse model of COVID-19, which has a human immune system1-20. Blocking either viral replication with remdesivir21-23 or the downstream IFN-stimulated cascade with anti-IFNAR2 antibodies in vivo in the chronic stages of disease attenuates the overactive immune inflammatory response, especially inflammatory macrophages. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in lung-resident human macrophages is a critical driver of disease. In response to infection mediated by CD16 and ACE2 receptors, human macrophages activate inflammasomes, release interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-18, and undergo pyroptosis, thereby contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of the lungs. Inflammasome activation and the accompanying inflammatory response are necessary for lung inflammation, as inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway reverses chronic lung pathology. Notably, this blockade of inflammasome activation leads to the release of infectious virus by the infected macrophages. Thus, inflammasomes oppose host infection by SARS-CoV-2 through the production of inflammatory cytokines and suicide by pyroptosis to prevent a productive viral cycle."
https://openalex.org/W4224983989,"The human somatosensory network relies on ionic currents to sense, transmit, and process tactile information. We investigate hydrogels that similarly transduce pressure into ionic currents, forming a piezoionic skin. As in rapid- and slow-adapting mechanoreceptors, piezoionic currents can vary widely in duration, from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. These currents are shown to elicit direct neuromodulation and muscle excitation, suggesting a path toward bionic sensory interfaces. The signal magnitude and duration depend on cationic and anionic mobility differences. Patterned hydrogel films with gradients of fixed charge provide voltage offsets akin to cell potentials. The combined effects enable the creation of self-powered and ultrasoft piezoionic mechanoreceptors that generate a charge density four to six orders of magnitude higher than those of triboelectric and piezoelectric devices."
https://openalex.org/W4225141679,"Bone marrow (BM)-mediated trained innate immunity (TII) is a state of heightened immune responsiveness of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and their myeloid progeny. We show here that maladaptive BM-mediated TII underlies inflammatory comorbidities, as exemplified by the periodontitis-arthritis axis. Experimental-periodontitis-related systemic inflammation in mice induced epigenetic rewiring of HSPC and led to sustained enhancement of production of myeloid cells with increased inflammatory preparedness. The periodontitis-induced trained phenotype was transmissible by BM transplantation to naive recipients, which exhibited increased inflammatory responsiveness and disease severity when subjected to inflammatory arthritis. IL-1 signaling in HSPC was essential for their maladaptive training by periodontitis. Therefore, maladaptive innate immune training of myelopoiesis underlies inflammatory comorbidities and may be pharmacologically targeted to treat them via a holistic approach."
https://openalex.org/W4224997445,"Improving composite battery electrodes requires a delicate control of active materials and electrode formulation. The electrochemically active particles fulfill their role as energy exchange reservoirs through interacting with the surrounding conductive network. We formulate a network evolution model to interpret the regulation and equilibration between electrochemical activity and mechanical damage of these particles. Through statistical analysis of thousands of particles using x-ray phase contrast holotomography in a LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2-based cathode, we found that the local network heterogeneity results in asynchronous activities in the early cycles, and subsequently the particle assemblies move toward a synchronous behavior. Our study pinpoints the chemomechanical behavior of individual particles and enables better designs of the conductive network to optimize the utility of all the particles during operation."
https://openalex.org/W4225151249,"Regulatable CAR platforms could circumvent toxicities associated with CAR-T therapy, but existing systems have shortcomings including leakiness and attenuated activity. Here, we present SNIP CARs, a protease-based platform for regulating CAR activity using an FDA-approved small molecule. Design iterations yielded CAR-T cells that manifest full functional capacity with drug and no leaky activity in the absence of drug. In numerous models, SNIP CAR-T cells were more potent than constitutive CAR-T cells and showed diminished T cell exhaustion and greater stemness. In a ROR1-based CAR lethality model, drug cessation following toxicity onset reversed toxicity, thereby credentialing the platform as a safety switch. In the same model, reduced drug dosing opened a therapeutic window that resulted in tumor eradication in the absence of toxicity. SNIP CARs enable remote tuning of CAR activity, which provides solutions to safety and efficacy barriers that are currently limiting progress in using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4224986472,"Behavioral genetics in dogs has focused on modern breeds, which are isolated subgroups with distinctive physical and, purportedly, behavioral characteristics. We interrogated breed stereotypes by surveying owners of 18,385 purebred and mixed-breed dogs and genotyping 2155 dogs. Most behavioral traits are heritable [heritability (h2) > 25%], and admixture patterns in mixed-breed dogs reveal breed propensities. Breed explains just 9% of behavioral variation in individuals. Genome-wide association analyses identify 11 loci that are significantly associated with behavior, and characteristic breed behaviors exhibit genetic complexity. Behavioral loci are not unusually differentiated in breeds, but breed propensities align, albeit weakly, with ancestral function. We propose that behaviors perceived as characteristic of modern breeds derive from thousands of years of polygenic adaptation that predates breed formation, with modern breeds distinguished primarily by aesthetic traits."

https://openalex.org/W4224979957,"The crystallographic pore sizes of zeolites are substantially smaller than those inferred from catalytic transformation and molecular sieving capabilities, which reflects flexible variation in zeolite opening pores. Using in situ electron microscopy, we imaged the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite with benzene as a probe molecule and observed subcell flexibility of the framework. The opening pores stretched along the longest direction of confined benzene molecules with a maximum aspect change of 15%, and the Pnma space group symmetry of the MFI framework caused adjacent channels to deform. This compensation maintained the stability and rigidity of the overall unit cell within 0.5% deformation. The subcell flexibility originates mainly from the topologically soft silicon-oxygen-silicon hinges between rigid tetrahedral SiO4 units, with inner angles varying from 135° to 153°, as confirmed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations."
https://openalex.org/W4225009204,"Reaction generality is crucial in determining the overall impact and usefulness of synthetic methods. Typical generalization protocols require a priori mechanistic understanding and suffer when applied to complex, less understood systems. We developed an additive mapping approach that rapidly expands the utility of synthetic methods while generating concurrent mechanistic insight. Validation of this approach on the metallaphotoredox decarboxylative arylation resulted in the discovery of a phthalimide ligand additive that overcomes many lingering limitations of this reaction and has important mechanistic implications for nickel-catalyzed cross-couplings."
https://openalex.org/W4224998105,"Discovery chemists routinely identify purpose-tailored molecules through an iterative structural optimization approach, but the preparation of each successive candidate in a compound series can rarely be conducted in a manner matching their thought process. This is because many of the necessary chemical transformations required to modify compound cores in a straightforward fashion are not applicable in complex contexts. We report a method that addresses one facet of this problem by allowing chemists to hop directly between chemically distinct heteroaromatic scaffolds. Specifically, we show that selective photolysis of quinoline N-oxides with 390-nanometer light followed by acid-promoted rearrangement affords N-acylindoles while showing broad compatibility with medicinally relevant functionality. Applications to late-stage skeletal modification of compounds of pharmaceutical interest and more complex transformations involving serial single-atom changes are demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W4224985744,"Public neoantigens (NeoAgs) represent an elite class of shared cancer-specific epitopes derived from recurrently mutated driver genes. Here we describe a high-throughput platform combining single-cell transcriptomic and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to establish whether mutant PIK3CA, among the most frequently genomically altered driver oncogenes, generates an immunogenic public NeoAg. Using this strategy, we developed a panel of TCRs that recognize an endogenously processed neopeptide encompassing a common PIK3CA hotspot mutation restricted by the prevalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*03:01 allele. Mechanistically, immunogenicity to this public NeoAg arises from enhanced neopeptide/HLA complex stability caused by a preferred HLA anchor substitution. Structural studies indicated that the HLA-bound neopeptide presents a comparatively 'featureless' surface dominated by the peptide's backbone. To bind this epitope with high specificity and affinity, we discovered that a lead TCR clinical candidate engages the neopeptide through an extended interface facilitated by an unusually long CDR3β loop. In patients with diverse malignancies, we observed NeoAg clonal conservation and spontaneous immunogenicity to the neoepitope. Finally, adoptive transfer of TCR-engineered T cells led to tumor regression in vivo in mice bearing PIK3CA-mutant tumors but not wild-type PIK3CA tumors. Together, these findings establish the immunogenicity and therapeutic potential of a mutant PIK3CA-derived public NeoAg."
https://openalex.org/W4225136246,"β-arrestins bind G protein-coupled receptors to terminate G protein signaling and to facilitate other downstream signaling pathways. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we show that β-arrestin is strongly autoinhibited in its basal state. Its engagement with a phosphopeptide mimicking phosphorylated receptor tail efficiently releases the β-arrestin tail from its N domain to assume distinct conformations. Unexpectedly, we find that β-arrestin binding to phosphorylated receptor, with a phosphorylation barcode identical to the isolated phosphopeptide, is highly inefficient and that agonist-promoted receptor activation is required for β-arrestin activation, consistent with the release of a sequestered receptor C tail. These findings, together with focused cellular investigations, reveal that agonism and receptor C-tail release are specific determinants of the rate and efficiency of β-arrestin activation by phosphorylated receptor. We infer that receptor phosphorylation patterns, in combination with receptor agonism, synergistically establish the strength and specificity with which diverse, downstream β-arrestin-mediated events are directed."
https://openalex.org/W4225121910,"The detyrosination-tyrosination cycle involves the removal and religation of the C-terminal tyrosine of α-tubulin and is implicated in cognitive, cardiac, and mitotic defects. The vasohibin–small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP) complex underlies much, but not all, detyrosination. We used haploid genetic screens to identify an unannotated protein, microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase (MATCAP), as a remaining detyrosinating enzyme. X-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structures established MATCAP’s cleaving mechanism, substrate specificity, and microtubule recognition. Paradoxically, whereas abrogation of tyrosine religation is lethal in mice, codeletion of MATCAP and SVBP is not. Although viable, defective detyrosination caused microcephaly, associated with proliferative defects during neurogenesis, and abnormal behavior. Thus, MATCAP is a missing component of the detyrosination-tyrosination cycle, revealing the importance of this modification in brain formation."
https://openalex.org/W4224994191,"The biological bases of wanting have been characterized in mammals, but whether an equivalent wanting system exists in insects remains unknown. In this study, we focused on honey bees, which perform intensive foraging activities to satisfy colony needs, and sought to determine whether foragers leave the hive driven by specific expectations about reward and whether they recollect these expectations during their waggle dances. We monitored foraging and dance behavior and simultaneously quantified and interfered with biogenic amine signaling in the bee brain. We show that a dopamine-dependent wanting system is activated transiently in the bee brain by increased appetite and individual recollection of profitable food sources, both en route to the goal and during waggle dances. Our results show that insects share with mammals common neural mechanisms for encoding wanting of stimuli with positive hedonic value."
https://openalex.org/W4225006761,"Genotoxic therapy such as radiation serves as a frontline cancer treatment, yet acquired resistance that leads to tumor reoccurrence is frequent. We found that cancer cells maintain viability during irradiation by reversibly increasing genome-wide DNA breaks, thereby limiting premature mitotic progression. We identify caspase-activated DNase (CAD) as the nuclease inflicting these de novo DNA lesions at defined loci, which are in proximity to chromatin-modifying CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. CAD nuclease activity is governed through phosphorylation by DNA damage response kinases, independent of caspase activity. In turn, loss of CAD activity impairs cell fate decisions, rendering cancer cells vulnerable to radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Our observations highlight a cancer-selective survival adaptation, whereby tumor cells deploy regulated DNA breaks to delimit the detrimental effects of therapy-evoked DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W4225123066,"The lack of tools to observe drug-target interactions at cellular resolution in intact tissue has been a major barrier to understanding in vivo drug actions. Here, we develop clearing-assisted tissue click chemistry (CATCH) to optically image covalent drug targets in intact mammalian tissues. CATCH permits specific and robust in situ fluorescence imaging of target-bound drug molecules at subcellular resolution and enables the identification of target cell types. Using well-established inhibitors of endocannabinoid hydrolases and monoamine oxidases, direct or competitive CATCH not only reveals distinct anatomical distributions and predominant cell targets of different drug compounds in the mouse brain but also uncovers unexpected differences in drug engagement across and within brain regions, reflecting rare cell types, as well as dose-dependent target shifts across tissue, cellular, and subcellular compartments that are not accessible by conventional methods. CATCH represents a valuable platform for visualizing in vivo interactions of small molecules in tissue."
https://openalex.org/W4225112567,"Despite their low abundance, phosphoinositides play a central role in membrane traffic and signalling. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 are uniquely important, as they promote cell growth, survival and migration. Pathogenic organisms have developed means to subvert phosphoinositide metabolism to promote successful infection and their survival in host organisms. We demonstrate that PtdIns(3,4)P2 is a major product generated in host cells by the effectors of the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Pharmacological, gene silencing and heterologous expression experiments revealed that, remarkably, the biosynthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 occurs independently of phosphoinositide 3-kinases. Instead, we found that the Salmonella effector SopB, heretofore believed to be a phosphatase, generates PtdIns(3,4)P2 de novo via a phosphotransferase/phosphoisomerase mechanism. Recombinant SopB is capable of generating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 from PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a cell-free system. Through a remarkable instance of convergent evolution, bacterial effectors acquired the ability to synthesize 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides by an ATP- and kinase-independent mechanism, thereby subverting host signalling to gain entry and even provoke oncogenic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W4225135297,"Human NANOG expression resets stem cells to ground-state pluripotency. Here we identify the unique features of human NANOG that relate to its dose-sensitive function as a master transcription factor. NANOG is largely disordered, with a C-terminal prion-like domain that phase-transitions to gel-like condensates. Full-length NANOG readily forms higher-order oligomers at low nanomolar concentrations, orders of magnitude lower than typical amyloids. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence cross-correlation techniques, we show that NANOG oligomerization is essential for bridging DNA elements in vitro. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and Hi-C 3.0 in cells, we validate that NANOG prion-like domain assembly is essential for specific DNA recognition and distant chromatin interactions. Our results provide a physical basis for the indispensable role of NANOG in shaping the pluripotent genome. NANOG's unique ability to form prion-like assemblies could provide a cooperative and concerted DNA bridging mechanism that is essential for chromatin reorganization and dose-sensitive activation of ground-state pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W4224994977,"Establishing causal relationships between genetic alterations of human cancers and specific phenotypes of malignancy remains a challenge. We sequentially introduced mutations into healthy human melanocytes in up to five genes spanning six commonly disrupted melanoma pathways, forming nine genetically distinct cellular models of melanoma. We connected mutant melanocyte genotypes to malignant cell expression programs in vitro and in vivo, replicative immortality, malignancy, rapid tumor growth, pigmentation, metastasis, and histopathology. Mutations in malignant cells also affected tumor microenvironment composition and cell states. Our melanoma models shared genotype-associated expression programs with patient melanomas, and a deep learning model showed that these models partially recapitulated genotype-associated histopathological features as well. Thus, a progressive series of genome-edited human cancer models can causally connect genotypes carrying multiple mutations to phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W4225001820,"Pleasant touch provides emotional and psychological support that helps mitigate social isolation and stress. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a pleasant touch-conditioned place preference (PT-CPP) test, we show that genetic ablation of spinal excitatory interneurons expressing prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), or its ligand PROK2 in sensory neurons, abolishes PT-CPP without impairing pain and itch behaviors in mice. Mutant mice display profound impairments in stress response and prosocial behaviors. Moreover, PROKR2 neurons respond most vigorously to gentle stroking and encode reward value. Collectively, we identify PROK2 as a long-sought neuropeptide that encodes and transmits pleasant touch to spinal PROKR2 neurons. These findings may have important implications for elucidating mechanisms by which pleasant touch deprivation contributes to social avoidance behavior and mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4225130866,"The generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a major goal for regenerative medicine. During embryonic development, HSCs derive from haemogenic endothelium (HE) in a NOTCH- and retinoic acid (RA)-dependent manner. Although a WNT-dependent (WNTd) patterning of nascent hPSC mesoderm specifies clonally multipotent intra-embryonic-like HOXA+ definitive HE, this HE is functionally unresponsive to RA. Here we show that WNTd mesoderm, before HE specification, is actually composed of two distinct KDR+ CD34neg populations. CXCR4negCYP26A1+ mesoderm gives rise to HOXA+ multilineage definitive HE in an RA-independent manner, whereas CXCR4+ ALDH1A2+ mesoderm gives rise to HOXA+ multilineage definitive HE in a stage-specific, RA-dependent manner. Furthermore, both RA-independent (RAi) and RA-dependent (RAd) HE harbour transcriptional similarity to distinct populations found in the early human embryo, including HSC-competent HE. This revised model of human haematopoietic development provides essential resolution to the regulation and origins of the multiple waves of haematopoiesis. These insights provide the basis for the generation of specific haematopoietic populations, including the de novo specification of HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W4225012043,"How acute pathogens persist and what curtails their epidemic growth in the absence of acquired immunity remains unknown. Canine rabies is a fatal zoonosis that circulates endemically at low prevalence among domestic dogs in low- and middle-income countries. We traced rabies transmission in a population of 50,000 dogs in Tanzania from 2002 to 2016 and applied individual-based models to these spatially resolved data to investigate the mechanisms modulating transmission and the scale over which they operate. Although rabies prevalence never exceeded 0.15%, the best-fitting models demonstrated appreciable depletion of susceptible animals that occurred at local scales because of clusters of deaths and dogs already incubating infection. Individual variation in rabid dog behavior facilitated virus dispersal and cocirculation of virus lineages, enabling metapopulation persistence. These mechanisms have important implications for prediction and control of pathogens that circulate in spatially structured populations."

Non-Fourier's heat flux and non-Fick's mass flux are incorporated for heat and mass flow analysis. Silver (Ag) and Copper (Cu) are considered nanoparticles with water as base fluid. The resulting equations are transformed into the dimensionless form using similarity transformation and solved by RK-4 with the shooting method. The impact of the governing parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction coefficient, streamlines, and finally isotherms are incorporated. It is observed that increment in power-law index parameter uplifts the fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer. The increase in the magnitude of skin friction coefficient in (x-direction) with wall thickness parameter is high for nanofluid containing silver nanoparticles as compared to copper nanoparticles."

https://openalex.org/W4224491653,"miRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that negatively and specifically regulate protein expression, the cumulative effects of which can result in broad changes to cell systems and architecture. The miRNA miR-27b is known to regulate lipid regulatory pathways in the human liver and is also induced by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, the functional targets of miR-27b are not well established. Herein, an activity-based protein profiling method using a serine hydrolase probe, coupled with stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry identified direct and indirect targets of miR-27b. The hepatic lipase C (LIPC) stood out as both highly dependent on miR-27b and as a major modulator of lipid pathway misregulation. Modulation of miR-27b using both exogenous miRNA mimics and inhibitors demonstrated that transcription factors Jun, PPARα, and HNF4α, all of which also influence LIPC levels and activity, are regulated by miR-27b. LIPC was furthermore shown to affect the progress of the life cycle of HCV and to decrease levels of intracellular triglycerides, upon which HCV is known to depend. In summary, this work has demonstrated that miR-27b mediates HCV infection by downregulating LIPC, thereby reducing triglyceride degradation, which in turn increases cellular lipid levels. miRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that negatively and specifically regulate protein expression, the cumulative effects of which can result in broad changes to cell systems and architecture.

Cellular metabolism exists as a set of interconnected systems and the functional output of the component enzymes of these systems relies upon multiple layers of regulatory mechanisms. In humans, miRNAs calibrate the expression of protein-coding genes by selectively recognizing sequences within mRNA transcripts and using the RNA interference silencing complex to sequester and degrade the targeted mRNA (1O'Brien J.J. Overview of microRNA biogenesis, mechanisms of actions, and circulation.Front. Endocrinol. 2018; 9: 402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). As the length of base pairing is short and the complementarity imperfect, mRNAs are frequently targeted by multiple different miRNAs (1O'Brien J.J.

Characterizing miR-27b regulation is therefore of interest not only in the study of the role of lipid metabolism during HCV infection but also may furthermore provide insight into novel strategies to combat the effects of abnormal miRNA function, which contribute to other conditions such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and obesity-related illnesses (23Xie W. Li L. Zhang M. Cheng H.-P. Gong D.

The response to a miRNA is not limited to its direct targets; rather, specific miRNA–mRNA interactions may alter key factors within larger pathways resulting in significant changes downstream of the protein originally targeted. In this work, functional effectors of miR-27b regulation of lipid metabolism are identified and the mechanisms by which their activity is controlled are explored. These functional effectors were identified by means of activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) techniques, which use small-molecule probes that covalently bind active enzymes, but not their inactive counterparts (36Barglow K.T. Cravatt B.F. Activity-based protein profiling for the functional annotation of enzymes.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 37Cravatt B.F. Wright A.T. Kozarich J.W. Activity-based protein profiling: from enzyme chemistry to proteomic chemistry.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 383-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). ABPP techniques have been previously used to gain a deeper understanding of metabolic function (38Hunerdosse D. Nomura D.K. Activity-based proteomic and metabolomic approaches for understanding metabolism.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2014; 28: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and to characterize enzyme dysregulation during infection (39Strmiskova M. Desrochers G.F. Shaw T.A. Powdrill M.H.

Springer International Publishing, Cham2019: 23-48Google Scholar). As lipid metabolism is regulated in large part by the serine hydrolase class of enzymes (42Long J.Z. Cravatt B.F. The metabolic serine hydrolases and their functions in mammalian physiology and disease.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6022-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), a fluorophosphonate (FP)-based probe (Fig. 1B), which broadly labels active serine hydrolases, was used to profile the effects of miRNA-27b (43Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Activity-based protein profiling: the serine hydrolases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). A reporter tag conjugated to the FP warhead allows enzymes bound to the probe to be identified and quantified (36Barglow K.T. Cravatt B.F. Activity-based protein profiling for the functional annotation of enzymes.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 43Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Activity-based protein profiling: the serine hydrolases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Using this probe, differential activity profiles were established, from which the hepatic lipase C (LIPC) was confirmed as novel functional target of miR-27b. Multiple intermediary factors responsible for the miR-27b-mediated change to LIPC activity were subsequently identified. Finally, the effect of the miR-27b-induced modulation of LIPC activity was shown to be detrimental to HCV propagation. Altogether, this study has expanded our understanding of the key role played by this miRNA in liver metabolism and HCV infection and, more generally, highlighted the need for the functional profiling of miRNA activity to fully understand their roles both in normal cell function and in disease. The importance of miR-27b in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism, both in healthy tissue and in the context of disease, has been previously established (17Singaravelu R. Chen R. Lyn R.K. Jones D.M. O'Hara S. Rouleau Y. et al.Hepatitis C virus induced up-regulation of microRNA-27: a novel mechanism for hepatic steatosis.Hepatology. 2014; 59: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Vickers K.C. Shoucri B.M. Levin M.G. Wu H. Pearson D.S. Osei-Hwedieh D. et al.MicroRNA-27b is a regulatory hub in lipid metabolism and is altered in dyslipidemia.Hepatology. 2013; 57: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms by which this modulation of the cell’s lipid profile is accomplished are not yet well understood. To investigate the functional consequences of miR-27b to cells’ lipid profile, lipidomic mass spectrometry was performed on cells transfected with miR-27b mimic versus a control (Tables S1–S9). A significant decrease in the expression of the established miR-27b target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (44Chiyomaru T. Seki N. Inoguchi S. Ishihara T. Mataki H. Matsushita R. et al.Dual regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase genes EGFR and c-Met by the tumor-suppressive microRNA-23b/27b cluster in bladder cancer.Int. J. Oncol. 2015; 46: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used to demonstrate efficient miR-27b transfection (Fig. 2). Consistently with previous reports (17Singaravelu R. Chen R. Lyn R.K. Jones D.M. O'Hara S. Rouleau Y. et al.Hepatitis C virus induced up-regulation of microRNA-27: a novel mechanism for hepatic steatosis.Hepatology. 2014; 59: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a significant increase in the overall quantity of triglycerides present was observed (Fig. 2A), with a trend toward desaturation (Fig. 2B). No significant changes were observed in any other lipid groups (Fig. 2A), suggesting triglyceride metabolism is the primary target of regulation by miR-27b and warranting further investigation. Prior efforts to profile miR-27b-induced changes to cell function have relied mainly on sequencing-based techniques such as ago-HITS-CLIP (10Luna J.M. Scheel T.K.H. Danino T. Shaw K.S. Mele A.

Commun. 2015; 6: 8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which reports only on direct hydrogen-bonding interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs and does not allow the detection of any potentially more significant changes occurring downstream. Other studies have used microarrays to globally profile miR-27b′s impact, direct or indirect, on the transcriptome (47Rogler C.E. LeVoci L. Ader T. Massimi A. Tchaikovskaya T. Norel R. et al.MicroRNA-23b cluster microRNAs regulate transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein signaling and liver stem cell differentiation by targeting Smads.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 48Poon V.Y.

Fivaz M. miR-27b shapes the presynaptic transcriptome and influences neurotransmission by silencing the polycomb group protein Bmi1.BMC Genomics. 2016; 17: 777Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, this type of analysis is incapable of reporting on important potential posttranslational regulation of protein function. Use of an activity-based probe measures differential enzyme activity derived not only from direct miRNA targeting or altered gene expression but also from changes to protein localization, posttranslational modifications, and protein–protein interactions, thereby providing a more complete, not to mention relevant, picture of the functional role. A significant number of enzymes responsible for the regulation of cells’ lipid profile belong to the serine hydrolase family, whose activity can be detected by the activity-based probe FP (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether any serine hydrolase activities are altered by miR-27b, the fluorescent FP–tetramethylrhodamine probe was used to label the proteomes of cells transfected with miR-27b mimic or inhibitor and visualized by in-gel fluorescence. Multiple differential band intensities were observed (Fig. 3A) following miR-27b overexpression or inhibition, indicating that serine hydrolases could play a role in the miR-27b-induced changes to the lipid profile. Interestingly, when this experiment was repeated in cells infected with the JFH1T strain of HCV, a distinct banding pattern was observed, suggesting that the effects of miR-27b might vary depending on the environment of the cell. Next, we determined the identity of the functional targets of miR-27b using affinity purification and HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry (MS). Differentially active serine hydrolases were identified using a biotinylated FP probe to selectively enrich labeled enzymes. Dimethyl labeling, a type of stable isotope labeling using isotopes of formaldehyde, was used to label peptides from each samples, which could then be combined and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Relative abundances were calculated by the relative size of the peaks in M1, and peptides positively identified, following fragmentation, in M2 (49Boersema P.J. Raijmakers R. Lemeer S. Mohammed S. Heck A.J.R. Multiplex peptide stable isotope dimethyl labeling for quantitative proteomics.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) (Tables S10–S24). Hits were ranked by prioritizing enzymes whose activity was altered, in opposing directions, by both overexpressing and inhibiting miR-27b, and who displayed this pattern in both naïve and HCV-infected cells (Fig. 3B). Lipid metabolic serine hydrolases represented a significant proportion of enriched, differentially active proteins, followed by a smaller number of signaling proteases and peptidases (Fig. 3B). The top-ranked enzyme was LIPC, the hepatic lipase, which has not previously been associated with miR-27b. LIPC is a liver enzyme mainly localized to the cell surface of hepatocytes (50Kuusi T. Nikklä E.A. Virtanen I. Kinnunen P.K.J. Localization of the heparin-releasable lipase in situ in the rat liver.Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and which predominantly hydrolyzes triglycerides, though it can also target other acyl-containing lipid species (51Connelly P.W. The role of hepatic lipase in lipoprotein metabolism.Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 286: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ABPP–LC-MS/MS screen showed that miR-27b significantly decreased the activity of LIPC, while the inhibitor increased activity (Fig. 3B), which suggests a role for LIPC downregulation in miR-27b-mediated lipid accumulation. To confirm our MS-derived observations and to determine whether this regulation of LIPC activity was pretranslational or posttranslational, FP-biotin was again used to label proteomes of cells transfected with miR-27b mimic or its inhibitor, and LIPC in the enriched fraction as well as the unenriched cell lysates was quantified by Western blotting. A significant decrease in both LIPC activity and abundance in the presence of miR-27b was observed, paralleled by an insignificant increase in LIPC activity and abundance when miR-27b was inhibited (Fig. 4, A–C). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to show a similar mimic-mediated decrease in mRNA, while the inhibitor left LIPC mRNA levels relatively unchanged (Fig. 4D). This indicates that the miR-27b-mediated decrease in LIPC activity is based largely on changes to protein expression regulated at the mRNA level, either via direct targeting of the LIPC mRNA by miR-27b or by changes to transcription. While a seed site of miR-27b was found in the 3′-UTR of LIPC (Fig. S1A), a reporter construct containing the 3′-UTR from LIPC and the luciferase gene was not targeted by miR-27 (Fig. S1B), indicating that LIPC expression was not directly targeted by miR-27b. The failure of miR-27b to target the luciferase construct may be explained by the lack of complementarity outside the seed sequence, which typically provides extra stability to miRNA–mRNA interactions (1O'Brien J.J. Overview of microRNA biogenesis, mechanisms of actions, and circulation.Front. Endocrinol. 2018; 9: 402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of transcription factors, which regulate lipid metabolism and have been linked to the transcriptional regulation of LIPC (52Rakhshandehroo M.

Both PPARα and PPARγ were significantly decreased in the presence of miR-27b mimic (Fig. 5D), in agreement with previous findings (17Singaravelu R. Chen R. Lyn R.K. Jones D.M. O'Hara S.

To assess whether a reduction in PPAR activity was responsible for the decreased expression of LIPC, cells were treated with the pan-PPAR inhibitor benzamide (54Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. et al.T0070907, a selective ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, functions as an antagonist of biochemical and cellular activities.J. Biol.

Western blotting showed a large decrease in LIPC activity and expression (Fig. 5, A and B), confirming that PPARs play a role in the transcription of LIPC in the model system used. To confirm whether the miR-27b-mediated decrease in LIPC expression was due to a decrease in PPAR signaling, cells transfected with miR-27b mimic were treated with the pan-PPAR activator bezafibrate (55Berger J.

https://openalex.org/W4225361974,"Drought stress is a major limitation in wheat production around the globe. Organic amendments could be the possible option in semi-arid climatic conditions to mitigate the adverse effects of drought at critical growth stages. Wheat straw biochar (BC0 = Control, BC1 = 3% biochar and BC2 = 5% biochar) was used to alleviate the drought stress at tillering (DTS), flowering (DFS), and grain filling (DGFS) stages. Drought stress significantly reduced the growth and yield of wheat at critical growth stages, with DGFS being the most susceptible stage, resulting in significant yield loss. Biochar application substantially reduced the detrimental effects of drought by improving plant height (15.74%), fertile tiller count (17.14%), spike length (16.61%), grains per spike (13.89%), thousand grain weight (10.4%), and biological yield (13.1%) when compared with the control treatment. Furthermore, physiological parameters such as water use efficiency (38.41%), stomatal conductance (42.76%), chlorophyll a (19.3%), chlorophyll b (22.24%), transpiration rate (39.17%), photosynthetic rate (24.86%), electrolyte leakage (-42.5%) hydrogen peroxide (-18.03%) superoxide dismutase (24.66%), catalase (24.11%) and peroxidase (-13.14%) were also improved by biochar application. The use of principal component analysis linked disparate scales of our findings to explain the changes occurred in wheat growth and yield in response to biochar application under drought circumstances. In essence, using biochar at 5% rate could be a successful strategy to promote wheat grain production by reducing the hazardous impacts of drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W4226462414,"In deep learning-based maize leaf disease detection, a maize disease identification method called Network based on wavelet threshold-guided bilateral filtering, multi-channel ResNet, and attenuation factor (WG-MARNet) is proposed. This method can solve the problems of noise, background interference, and low detection accuracy of maize leaf disease images. To begin, a processing layer called Wavelet threshold guided bilateral filtering (WT-GBF) based on the WG-MARNet model is employed to reduce image noise and perform high and low-frequency decomposition of the input image using WT-GBF. This increases the input image's resistance to environmental interference and feature extraction capability. Secondly, for the multiscale feature fusion technique, an average down-sampling and tiling method is employed to increase feature representation and limit the risk of overfitting. Then, on high and low-frequency multi-channel, an attenuation factor is introduced to optimize the performance instability during training of the deep network. Finally, when the convergence and accuracy are compared, PRelu and Adabound are used instead of the Relu activation function and the Adam optimizer. The experimental results revealed that our method's average recognition accuracy was 97.96%, and the detection time for a single image was 0.278 seconds. The average detection accuracy has been increased. The method lays the groundwork for the precise control of maize diseases in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4224447347,"Ecotin is a homodimeric serine protease inhibitor produced by many commensal and pathogenic microbes. It functions as a virulence factor, enabling survival of various pathogens in the blood. The ecotin dimer binds two protease molecules, and each ecotin protomer has two protease-binding sites: site1 occupies the substrate-binding groove, whereas site2 engages a distinct secondary region. Owing to the twofold rotational symmetry within the ecotin dimer, sites 1 and 2 of a protomer bind to different protease molecules within the tetrameric complex. Escherichia coli ecotin inhibits trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and elastase-like enzymes, including pancreatic proteases, leukocyte elastase, key enzymes of blood coagulation, the contact and complement systems, and other antimicrobial cascades. Here, we show that mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1) and MASP-2, essential activators of the complement lectin pathway, and MASP-3, an essential alternative pathway activator, are all inhibited by ecotin. We decipher in detail how the preorganization of site1 and site2 within the ecotin dimer contributes to the inhibition of each MASP enzyme. In addition, using mutated and monomeric ecotin variants, we show that site1, site2, and dimerization contribute to inhibition in a surprisingly target-dependent manner. We present the first ecotin:MASP-1 and ecotin:MASP-2 crystal structures, which provide additional insights and permit structural interpretation of the observed functional results. Importantly, we reveal that monomerization completely disables the MASP-2-inhibitory, MASP-3-inhibitory, and lectin pathway–inhibitory capacity of ecotin. These findings provide new opportunities to combat dangerous multidrug-resistant pathogens through development of compounds capable of blocking ecotin dimer formation.

These findings provide new opportunities to combat dangerous multidrug-resistant pathogens through development of compounds capable of blocking ecotin dimer formation. Ecotin (UniProt ID: P23827) is a reversible serine protease (SP) inhibitor first isolated from the periplasm of Escherichia coli (1Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. Purification from Escherichia coli of a periplasmic protein that is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic proteases.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It represents one of the 18 independently evolved families of canonical inhibitors (2Krowarsch D. Cierpicki T. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Canonical protein inhibitors of serine proteases.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2427-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Each family has a distinct fold but contains a surface loop responsible for the inhibition of the target enzyme. In all families, this loop adopts the same, that is, “canonical” conformation upon occupying the substrate-binding cleft of the target protease. Yet, ecotin is unique among these families as in addition to the canonical loop, which belongs to its primary binding site (site1), it also has a structurally distinct secondary binding site (site2). Moreover, ecotin is a homodimer; therefore, it has two pairs of site1 and site2. The two protomers are mainly held together through their C-terminal arms, and the homodimer has a twofold rotational symmetry. In the homodimer, site1 of one protomer and site2 of the other one are positioned such that together they can “chelate” the target proteinases (3McGrath M.e. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J.

Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar)), which enters the S1 specificity pocket of the enzyme. Inhibitors of trypsin-like enzymes have P1 Arg or Lys, whereas those of chymotrypsin-like enzymes Phe or Leu (7Laskowski M. Kato I. Protein inhibitors of proteinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). In contrast, ecotin has a P1 Met, a highly flexible neutral residue capable of adapting to a variety of characteristically different S1 pockets. This P1 Met greatly contributes to the exceptional promiscuity of ecotin that inhibits the three main pancreatic enzyme types, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (1Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S.

Yet, the suboptimal P1–S1 interaction of ecotin does not lead to a general low affinity, and this is due to the existence of site2 and the chelating mechanism of ecotin (4Mcgrath M.E. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R.J. Ecotin: Lessons on survival in a protease-filled world.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The result is an extremely broad palette of target proteases, combined with tight binding of many different enzymes. The relative importance of the P1 residue, the site2, and dimerization of ecotin were already quantitatively assessed in the context of the pancreatic enzymes and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (11Pál G.

Ecotin: A serine protease inhibitor with two distinct and interacting binding sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that E. coli ecotin inhibits all three MASPs of the complement system (16Nagy Z.A. Szakács D. Boros E. Héja D. Vígh E. Sándor N. et al.Ecotin, a microbial inhibitor of serine proteases, blocks multiple complement dependent and independent microbicidal activities of human serum.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1008232Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). While ecotin is a moderate MASP-1 inhibitor, it potently inhibits MASP-2 and MASP-3. MASP-1 and MASP-2 are essential activators of the complement lectin pathway (LP) (17Héja D. Kocsis A. Dobó J. Szilágyi K. Szász R. Závodszky P. et al.Revised mechanism of complement lectin-pathway activation revealing the role of serine protease MASP-1 as the exclusive activator of MASP-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 10498-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas MASP-3 is the exclusive activator of pro-factor D (FD) in resting human blood, and therefore, it is essential for alternative complement pathway (AP) activation (18Dobó J. Szakács D. Oroszlán G. Kortvely E. Kiss B. Boros E. et al.MASP-3 is the exclusive pro-factor D activator in resting blood: The lectin and the alternative complement pathways are fundamentally linked.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 31877Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The three MASPs have unique structures and specificities, all have key physiologic functions and all are inhibited by ecotin. This prompted us to follow a previously outlined mutagenesis approach and decipher how site1, site2, and their structural preorganization via dimerization contributes to the inhibition of the three MASPs and blocking LP activation. For testing the contribution of the P1 site, we generated an M84A (termed site1A) and an M84R (site1R) mutant. All three MASPs have trypsin-like specificity strictly preferring basic P1 residues (19Gál P. Dobó J. Závodszky P. Sim R.B.M. Early complement proteases: C1r, C1s and MASPs. A structural insight into activation and functions.Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore with site1R, we aimed to increase, whereas with the P1 truncating site1A, we aimed to decrease the affinity of ecotin toward these enzymes. For site2 weakening, we created the Arg108Ala/Asn110Ala (site2A) double mutant. These site2 positions were chosen based on the following considerations: (i) these residues are conserved among ecotin orthologs (10Eggers C.T. Murray I.A. Delmar V.A. Day A.G. Craik C.S.

Teillet F. et al.The serine protease domain of MASP-3: Enzymatic properties and crystal structure in complex with ecotin.PLoS One. 2013; 8e67962Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The aforementioned site1 and site2 mutations were also tested in combinations. The functional role of site1/site2 preorganization was tested by disrupting the homodimer structure of ecotin. This was achieved by removing the homodimer-stabilizing 10-aminoacid C-terminal arms yielding a stable monomeric ecotin form (13Pál G. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Stable monomeric form of an originally dimeric serine proteinase inhibitor, ecotin, was constructed via site directed mutagenesis.FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In parallel with the enzyme inhibition, LP inhibition, and size-exclusion chromatography–based oligomerization studies, we also solved the crystal structure of an MASP-2:ecotin and an MASP-1:site1R ecotin complex, which enabled structural interpretation of the functional results. The functional analyses revealed that site1/site2 preorganization is essential for MASP-2 and MASP-3 inhibition and for blocking LP activation. With the point mutants, we show that individual contributions of site1 and site2 to MASP inhibition are characteristically enzyme dependent. The observed enzyme-specific differences can be congruently interpreted by our new MASP-1 and MASP-2:ecotin complex structures and by a previously reported MASP-3:ecotin structure of Gaboriaud et al. (22Gaboriaud C. Gupta R.K. Martin L. Lacroix M. Serre L. Teillet F. et al.The serine protease domain of MASP-3: Enzymatic properties and crystal structure in complex with ecotin.PLoS One. 2013; 8e67962Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this article, we show why MASP-2 and MASP-3 are inhibited strongly, whereas MASP-1 only weakly by ecotin. We also explain how ecotin uses its preorganized binding sites to achieve strong MASP-2 and MASP-3 inhibition in spite of the suboptimal P1 Met residue. The crystallization process is described in the Experimental procedures section. The crystal structure containing the activated CCP2–SP (complement control protein [CCP] domain; SP domain) fragment of MASP-2 in complex with ecotin was refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å. The structure is well defined by electron density (Table S1 and Fig. S1). The structure of the activated CCP1–CCP2–SP fragment of MASP-1 in complex with ecotin P1 M84R, that is, the site1R mutant, was solved and refined to a resolution of 3.4 Å. The core regions of the SP domain of MASP-1 and site1R ecotin as well as their binding regions stabilized by intermolecular interactions are well resolved in electron density (Table S1 and Fig. S2); in contrast, some loops and side chains on the molecular surface outside these regions are disordered and missing from the final structure (see Table S2 or a complete list of disordered residues). Both structures contain MASP:ecotin2:MASP heterotetramers (Fig. 2), in agreement with the results of Gaboriaud et al. (22Gaboriaud C. Gupta R.K. Martin L. Lacroix M. Serre L. Teillet F. et al.The serine protease domain of MASP-3: Enzymatic properties and crystal structure in complex with ecotin.PLoS One. 2013; 8e67962Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), who reported a heterotetramer structure for the MASP-3:ecotin complex. All these MASP:ecotin complexes are typical in terms of simultaneously engaging both site1 (loops 50s and 80s) and site2 (loops 60s and 100s) of ecotin, without significant structural distortion of these ecotin loops. Importantly, ecotin does not contact the CCP domains. In the MASP-2:ecotin and the MASP-1:site1R ecotin complexes, elements of the catalytic apparatus of the MASPs are in active arrangement, and site1 forms typical canonical interactions. Most structural changes are similar to those observed upon the in vitro evolved monospecific Schistocerca gregaria serine protease inhibitor-2 (SGPI-2)–based MASP inhibitors, SGPI-derived MASP inhibitor (SGMI) 1 binding to MASP-1 and SGPI-based MASP inhibitor 2 (SGMI-2) binding to MASP-2 (17Héja D.

While the P1 Arg in the MASP-1:site1R ecotin complex is in a fully extended conformation, the P1 Met in the MASP-2:ecotin complex does not fully occupy the S1 pocket. Interestingly, the bottom of the S1 pocket of MASP-2 resembles that of an uncomplexed MASP-2 (24Harmat V. Gál P. Kardos J. Szilágyi K. Ambrus G. Végh B. et al.The structure of MBL-associated serine protease-2 reveals that identical substrate specificities of C1s and MASP-2 are realized through different sets of enzyme–substrate interactions.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) rather than an MASP-2:SGMI-2 complex, in which the S1 pocket is occupied by a P1 Lys. Apparently, rotation of the Gln665 side chain to form a hydrogen bond network around the bottom of the S1 pocket is characteristic to MASP-2 complexes where the S1–P1 salt bridge is established (MASP-2:SGMI-2 complex; Fig. 3B). A comparison of site1 interactions of MASP-1:site1R ecotin, MASP-2:ecotin, and MASP-3:ecotin complexes (the latter presented by Gaboriaud et al. (22Gaboriaud C. Gupta R.K. Martin L. Lacroix M. Serre L. Teillet F. et al.The serine protease domain of MASP-3: Enzymatic properties and crystal structure in complex with ecotin.PLoS One. 2013; 8e67962Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) [PDB ID: 4IW4]) reveal that while the same set of backbone hydrogen bonds is present for the P4–P1 core region in all three complexes, the contact region of the 80s loop of ecotin extends to the S7–S4′ region in the substrate-binding grooves of MASP-1 and MASP-3, whereas it is somewhat shorter for MASP-2 (Fig. S3, A–C). The 80s loop backbone is accommodated in very similar conformations in the three complexes (Fig. S3D). Five ecotin point mutants were produced to decipher the contribution of each binding site of ecotin to the inhibition of the MASPs. Site1R ecotin contains a P1 M84R, whereas site1A an M84A mutation. Site2A carries the R108A/N110A double mutation. We also made two combined variants, site1R/site2A and site1A/site2A. In a size-exclusion chromatography analysis, all five mutants had the same elution volume as WT ecotin verifying that these replacements do not alter the original homodimer structure of the inhibitor (Fig. S4A). Monomeric ecotin variants (13Pál G. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Stable monomeric form of an originally dimeric serine proteinase inhibitor, ecotin, was constructed via site directed mutagenesis.FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were clearly separated from the five dimeric point mutants by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S4, A and B).

Our estimated detection limit for inhibitory constant–based binding energy is 24.5 kJ/mol (see the Experimental procedures section for explanation). Note that the binding energy of the ecotin–MASP-1 interaction is close to this limit. The M84A replacement removes the original P1 side-chain atoms beyond the beta carbon. In terms of inhibitory constant, this alteration causes a 126-fold decrease in the affinity of ecotin toward MASP-2 and a 10-fold decrease toward MASP-3, corresponding to binding energy changes (ΔΔG) of −12 and −5.8 kJ/mol, respectively (Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 4). However, for the weak MASP-1:ecotin interaction, the resulting binding energy value for the site1A variant falls below the 24.5 kJ/mol estimated detection limit.Table 2Calculated binding free energy changes caused by the P1 replacement of ecotinEcotin variants comparedMASP-1MASP-2MASP-3ΔΔG (kJ/mol)Site1R versus WT+21.9+13.9+6.9Site1A versus WTND−12.0−5.8Abbreviation: ND (no ΔΔG value could be calculated because the binding energy of the mutant was below the estimated detection limit of 24.5 kJ/mol).Standard free energy (ΔG0) (i.e., binding energy) values of site1 mutants from Table 1 were compared with that of the WT to calculate ΔΔG values.

A positive value indicates an increase of affinity, whereas a negative one indicates a decrease. ΔΔG is calculated from the average ΔG0 values in Table 1. All three MASPs are trypsin-like enzymes having a negatively charged S1 pocket that prefers positively charged Lys or Arg P1 (19Gál P. Dobó J. Závodszky P. Sim R.B.M. Early complement proteases: C1r, C1s and MASPs. A structural insight into activation and functions.Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, M84R replacement increased binding affinity to MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3 7000-fold, 275-fold, and 17-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, Tables 1 and 2), corresponding to calculated ΔΔG values 21.9, 13.9, and 6.9 kJ/mol, respectively. For MASP-2 and MASP-3, affinities against both the M84A and the M84R variants could be determined. Notably, for these enzymes, the M84A replacement yields about the same extent of affinity drop as the affinity is increased by the M84R change: −12.0 kJ/mol versus 13.9 kJ/mol for MASP-2 and −5.8 kJ/mol versus 6.9 kJ/mol for MASP-3 (Table 2). If the same trend applies for MASP-1, the binding energy decrease upon the M84A mutation would be approximately −20 kJ/mol. These data reveal that the role of P1 and therefore site1 is markedly enzyme dependent, being crucial for MASP-1, substantial for MASP-2, and significantly lower for MASP-3. The observed phenomenon can be explained through the crystallographic data. MASP-1 has a readily accessible substrate-binding groove (25Dobó J. Harmat V. Beinrohr L. Sebestyén E. Závodszky P. Gál P.

PC was associated with significantly increased odds of in-hospital mortality, reintervention and 30-day readmission relative to SD. PC was also associated with greater odds of cardiac complications but lower odds of infection, respiratory failure and blood transfusions compared to SD. Although PC was associated with shorter index hospital length of stay and costs, the two strategies yielded similar 30-day cumulative costs.Management of pericardial effusion with PC is associated with greater odds of mortality, reintervention and 30-day readmission but similar 30-day cumulative costs compared to SD. In the setting of adequate hospital capability and operator expertise, SD is a reasonable initial treatment strategy for pericardial effusion."
https://openalex.org/W4226283440,"There has been an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) because jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power to detect genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits. Recently, many statistical methods have been developed for joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genetic association studies, including the Clustering Linear Combination (CLC) method. The CLC method works particularly well with phenotypes that have natural groupings, but due to the unknown number of clusters for a given data, the final test statistic of CLC method is the minimum p-value among all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. Therefore, a simulation procedure needs to be used to evaluate the p-value of the final test statistic. This makes the CLC method computationally demanding. We develop a new method called computationally efficient CLC (ceCLC) to test the association between multiple phenotypes and a genetic variant. Instead of using the minimum p-value as the test statistic in the CLC method, ceCLC uses the Cauchy combination test to combine all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. The test statistic of ceCLC approximately follows a standard Cauchy distribution, so the p-value can be obtained from the cumulative density function without the need for the simulation procedure. Through extensive simulation studies and application on the COPDGene data, the results demonstrate that the type I error rates of ceCLC are effectively controlled in different simulation settings and ceCLC either outperforms all other methods or has statistical power that is very close to the most powerful method with which it has been compared."

https://openalex.org/W4226309123,"Early childhood (from conception to five years) is a key life stage for interventions to prevent obesity. In the Australian Federation, policy responsibility for obesity prevention sits across all levels of government and several intergovernmental institutions, rendering a complicated policy space. There is a gap in our understanding of the role of intergovernmentalism in developing obesity prevention policy in Australia. Given the complexity of intergovernmental structures and initiatives influencing childhood obesity prevention policy, it is important to understand the perspectives of senior health officials within the bureaucracy of government who through their roles may be able to influence processes or new strategies.Document analysis relating to obesity prevention in the intergovernmental context provided material support to the study. This analysis informed the interview guides for nine interviews with ten senior health department officials (one interview per jurisdiction).Several opportunities exist to support nutrition and obesity prevention in early childhood including marketing regulation (discretionary choices, breastmilk substitutes, commercial complementary foods and 'toddler milks') and supporting the early childhood education and care sector. This study found a widening structural gap to support national obesity policy in Australia. New public management strategies limit the ability of intergovernmental institutions to support coordination within and between governments to address complex issues such as obesity. Subnational informants perceived a gap in national leadership for obesity prevention, while a Commonwealth informant noted the commitment of the national government to partner with industry under a self-regulation model. In this gap, subnational leaders have pursued nationally consistent action to address obesity, including the development of a national obesity strategy as a bipartisan endeavour across jurisdictions. Public officials calculate the strategic possibilities of pursuing opportunities within state agendas but note the limited chances of structural change in the absence of national leadership and funding."
https://openalex.org/W4226315382,"For outdoor cultivation of algal feedstocks to become a commercially viable and sustainable option for biofuel production, algal cultivation must maintain high yields and temporal stability in environmentally variable outdoor ponds. One of the main challenges is mitigating disease outbreaks that leads to culture crashes. Drawing on predictions from the 'dilution effect' hypothesis, in which increased biodiversity is thought to reduce disease risk in a community, a teste of whether algal polycultures would reduce disease risk and improve feedstock production efficiencies compared to monocultures was performed. While the positive benefits of biodiversity on disease risk have been demonstrated in various systems, to the best of our knowledge this is the first test in an algal biofuel system. Here, the results a before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design to compare mean monoculture (control) and polyculture (impact) yield, stability, and productivity before and after fungal infection when grown in 400-L outdoor raceway ponds are presented. It has been found that polycultures did not experience a reduction in disease risk compared to monocultures or differ in production efficiencies throughout the course of the 43-day experiment. These results show that polyculture feedstocks can maintain similar levels of productivity, stability, and disease resistance to that of a monoculture. Determining whether these results are generalizable or represent one case study requires additional outdoor experiments using a larger variety of host and pathogen species."

https://openalex.org/W4226253553,"Subterranean termites live in underground colonies with a division of labor among castes (i.e., queens and kings, workers, and soldiers). The function of social colonies relies on sophisticated chemical communication. Olfaction, the sense of smell from food, pathogens, and colony members, plays an important role in their social life. Olfactory plasticity in insects can be induced by long- and short-term environmental perturbations, allowing adaptive responses to the chemical environment according to their physiological and behavioral state. However, there is a paucity of information on the molecular basis of olfaction in termites. In this study, we identified an ortholog encoding the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) in the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus , and examined its expression variation across developmental stages and in response to social conditions. We found that C . formosanus Orco showed conserved sequence and structure compared with other insects. Spatial and temporal analyses showed that the Orco gene was primarily expressed in the antennae, and it was expressed in eggs and all postembryonic developmental stages. The antennal expression of Orco was upregulated in alates (winged reproductives) compared with workers and soldiers. Further, the expression of Orco decreased in workers after starvation for seven days, but it was not affected by the absence of soldiers or different group sizes. Our study reveals the molecular characteristics of Orco in a termite, and the results suggest a link between olfactory sensitivity and nutritional status. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of Orco in olfactory plasticity and behavioral response."
