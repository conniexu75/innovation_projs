https://openalex.org/W2170791918,"Verification of candidate biomarkers relies upon specific, quantitative assays optimized for selective detection of target proteins, and is increasingly viewed as a critical step in the discovery pipeline that bridges unbiased biomarker discovery to preclinical validation. Although individual laboratories have demonstrated that multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) coupled with isotope dilution mass spectrometry can quantify candidate protein biomarkers in plasma, reproducibility and transferability of these assays between laboratories have not been demonstrated. We describe a multilaboratory study to assess reproducibility, recovery, linear dynamic range and limits of detection and quantification of multiplexed, MRM-based assays, conducted by NCI-CPTAC. Using common materials and standardized protocols, we demonstrate that these assays can be highly reproducible within and across laboratories and instrument platforms, and are sensitive to low mug/ml protein concentrations in unfractionated plasma. We provide data and benchmarks against which individual laboratories can compare their performance and evaluate new technologies for biomarker verification in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2056147363,"One of the most distinctive steps in the development of the vertebrate nervous system occurs at mitotic exit when cells lose multipotency and begin to develop stable connections that will persist for a lifetime. This transition is accompanied by a switch in ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling mechanisms that appears to coincide with the final mitotic division of neurons. This switch involves the exchange of the BAF53a (also known as ACTL6a) and BAF45a (PHF10) subunits within Swi/Snf-like neural-progenitor-specific BAF (npBAF) complexes for the homologous BAF53b (ACTL6b) and BAF45b (DPF1) subunits within neuron-specific BAF (nBAF) complexes in post-mitotic neurons. The subunits of the npBAF complex are essential for neural-progenitor proliferation, and mice with reduced dosage for the genes encoding its subunits have defects in neural-tube closure similar to those in human spina bifida, one of the most serious congenital birth defects. In contrast, BAF53b and the nBAF complex are essential for an evolutionarily conserved program of post-mitotic neural development and dendritic morphogenesis. Here we show that this essential transition is mediated by repression of BAF53a by miR-9* and miR-124. We find that BAF53a repression is mediated by sequences in the 3' untranslated region corresponding to the recognition sites for miR-9* and miR-124, which are selectively expressed in post-mitotic neurons. Mutation of these sites led to persistent expression of BAF53a and defective activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth in neurons. In addition, overexpression of miR-9* and miR-124 in neural progenitors caused reduced proliferation. Previous studies have indicated that miR-9* and miR-124 are repressed by the repressor-element-1-silencing transcription factor (REST, also known as NRSF). Indeed, expression of REST in post-mitotic neurons led to derepression of BAF53a, indicating that REST-mediated repression of microRNAs directs the essential switch of chromatin regulatory complexes."

Did these evolutionary novelties arise de novo or from elaboration of ancient genetic networks? We reconstructed the genetic changes underlying thymopoiesis by comparative genome and expression analyses in chordates and basal vertebrates. The derived models of genetic networks were experimentally verified in bony fishes. Ancestral networks defining circumscribed regions of the pharyngeal epithelium of jawless vertebrates expanded in cartilaginous fishes to incorporate novel genes, notably those encoding chemokines. Correspondingly, novel networks evolved in lymphocytes of jawed vertebrates to control the expression of additional chemokine receptors. These complementary changes enabled unprecedented Delta/Notch signaling between pharyngeal epithelium and lymphoid cells that was exploited for specification to the T cell lineage. Our results provide a framework elucidating the evolution of key features of the adaptive immune system in jawed vertebrates.

These complementary changes enabled unprecedented Delta/Notch signaling between pharyngeal epithelium and lymphoid cells that was exploited for specification to the T cell lineage. Our results provide a framework elucidating the evolution of key features of the adaptive immune system in jawed vertebrates. Adaptive immune systems provide anticipatory, clonally distributed, diverse, and self-tolerant repertoires of antigen receptors for immune defense. To date, adaptive immune systems have only been described in vertebrates (Cooper and Alder, 2006Cooper M.D. Alder M.N. The evolution of adaptive immune systems.Cell. 2006; 124: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Interestingly, adaptive immune systems appear to have independently arisen twice in basal vertebrates, once in the lineage that gave rise to jawless vertebrates, with hagfish and lamprey as their surviving representatives, and a second time in the lineage giving rise to all jawed vertebrates, with cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, skates, and so-called chimaeras) as their most ancestral extant forms. Jawless vertebrates utilize gene conversion (Nagawa et al., 2007Nagawa F. Kishishita N. Shimizu K. Hirose S. Miyoshi M. Nezu J. Nishimura T. Nishizumi H. Takahashi Y. Hashimoto S. et al.Antigen-receptor genes of the agnathan lamprey are assembled by a process involving copy choice.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to generate diversity of their variable lymphocyte receptors (Pancer et al., 2004Pancer Z. Amemiya C.T. Ehrhardt G.R.A. Ceitlin J. Gartland G.L. Cooper M.D. Somatic diversification of variable lymphocyte receptors in the agnathan sea lamprey.Nature. 2004; 430: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), while jawed vertebrates employ the so-called VDJ recombination (Schatz, 2004Schatz D.G. V(D)J recombination.Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in developing lymphocytes to achieve combinatorial diversity of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors respectively (Litman and Cooper, 2007Litman G.W. Cooper M.D. Why study the evolution of immunity?.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fundamental differences in the mechanisms of recombination and the molecular nature of receptor structures highlight the independent origins of these two types of adaptive immune systems. Yet, both types of rearranging systems function in lymphocytes, suggesting that the common ancestor of vertebrates possessed lymphocytes but no adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates emerged in cartilaginous fishes about 500 million years ago. In addition to the primordial myelolymphoid lineage of lymphocytes (Kawamoto, 2006Kawamoto H. A close developmental relationship between the lymphoid and myeloid lineages.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates is distinguished by the emergence of T cells as a novel lymphocyte lineage, and the thymus as a primary lymphoid organ (Boehm and Bleul, 2007Boehm T. Bleul C.C. The evolutionary history of lymphoid organs.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Functionally, T cells and thymus are inextricably linked, for without the latter, T cell development fails. Thymopoiesis is a complex process involving colonization of the epithelial organ anlage by lymphoid progenitor cells (Bhandoola et al., 2007Bhandoola A. von Boehmer H. Petrie H.T.

Differentiation of the prospective thymic epithelium in the pharyngeal endoderm (Rodewald, 2008Rodewald H.-R. Thymus organogenesis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 355-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) critically depends on the function of the transcription factor Foxn1 (Nehls et al., 1996Nehls M. Kyewski B. Messerle M.

Mutations in the Foxn1 gene are associated with a failure of thymopoiesis owing to a nonfunctional epithelial microenvironment (Blackburn et al., 1996Blackburn C.C. Augustine C.L. Li R. Harvey R.P.

Immunol. 2007; 19: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) required for their specification toward the T cell lineage (Hozumi et al., 2008Hozumi K. Mailhos C. Negishi I. Hirano K. Yahata T. Ando K. Zuklys S. Holländer G.A. Shima D.T. Habu S. Delta-like 4 is indispensable in thymic environment specific for T cell development.J. Exp.

Furthermore, Foxn1 is required for the differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells (Bleul et al., 2006Bleul C.C. Corbeaux T. Reuter A. Fisch P. Mönting J.S. Boehm T. Formation of a functional thymus initiated by a postnatal epithelial progenitor cell.Nature. 2006; 441: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) into all subsets of the thymic epithelium, including those defining the cortex and the medulla (Bleul et al., 2006Bleul C.C. Corbeaux T. Reuter A. Fisch P. Mönting J.S. Boehm T. Formation of a functional thymus initiated by a postnatal epithelial progenitor cell.Nature. 2006; 441: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, Rossi et al., 2006Rossi S.W. Jenkinson W.E. Anderson G. Jenkinson E.J. Clonal analysis reveals a common progenitor for thymic cortical and medullary epithelium.Nature. 2006; 441: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Foxn1 occupies a key position in the genetic network(s) establishing a functional thymic niche, which is essential for T cell development. Many genes are important for the early development of T cells, including, among others, Notch1, Rbpj, Gata3, Ikaros, and Bcl11b (for review, see Rothenberg et al., 2008Rothenberg E.V. Moore J.E. Yui M.A. Launching the T-cell-lineage developmental programme.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), although their individual contributions to the sequential steps of T cell development are not always well documented. B cell development appears to be the default pathway of differentiation for lymphoid progenitor cells, unless Notch signaling (through Notch1 receptors; Radtke et al., 2004Radtke F. Wilson A. Mancini S.J. MacDonald H.R. Notch regulation of lymphocyte development and function.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) occurs in the thymic epithelial anlage, which expresses Dll4 as the essential and non-redundant ligand for T cell specification (Hozumi et al., 2008Hozumi K. Mailhos C. Negishi I. Hirano K. Yahata T. Ando K. Zuklys S. Holländer G.A. Shima D.T. Habu S. Delta-like 4 is indispensable in thymic environment specific for T cell development.J. Exp.

These observations support earlier suggestions that antibody-producing myelolymphoid cells might represent the primordial phenotype of the vertebrate lymphocyte lineage (Kawamoto, 2006Kawamoto H. A close developmental relationship between the lymphoid and myeloid lineages.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that the T cell lineage emerged at a later point (Boehm and Bleul, 2007Boehm T. Bleul C.C. The evolutionary history of lymphoid organs.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neither jawless nor cartilaginous fishes, which occupy key phylogenetic positions with respect to the evolution of adaptive immune systems, are amenable to genetic analysis. Therefore, the elucidation of the genetic changes underlying the emergence of thymopoiesis poses a formidable challenge; yet, such studies might provide essential information for the understanding of cellular immunity. We set out to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of thymopoiesis, employing the following strategy. First, we analyzed the genomes of several key chordate and vertebrate species in order to trace the evolutionary history of genes potentially involved in the emergence of thymopoiesis. Second, we determined their possible coexpression in order to derive models of potential genetic interactions. Finally, we tested these predictions in bony fishes to validate the structure of relevant genetic networks. Our results indicate how in jawed vertebrates, ancient genetic networks in pharyngeal epithelium and lymphocytes increased in complexity and how these novel functionalities enabled unprecedented cellular interactions between these two cell types. We suggest that these key advances provided the basis for the evolution of T cells and the thymus. Foxn1 occupies a central position in the genetic network(s), establishing a functional thymic rudiment. The Foxn1 gene is first identifiable in cartilaginous fishes and then found in all other jawed vertebrates (Figure 1). Detailed analyses of gene structures and derived protein sequences suggest that Foxn1 is a paralog of Foxn4 (Figure 1; Figures S1A and S1B available online). Foxn4 itself first appears in cephalochordates (amphioxus), where it coexists with its evolutionarily more ancient paralog, Foxn4b, which appears to be absent from the genomes of urochordates and all vertebrates (Figures 1 and S1). Jawless fishes, which represent the most basal group of extant vertebrates, possess a gene very similar to Foxn4, designated Foxn4-like (Foxn4L). Analysis of derived protein sequences and short-range synteny relationships (Figure S1C) indicates that Foxn1 is the Foxn4L ortholog in jawed vertebrates (Figure 1). The genealogy of the Foxn4/Foxn4L/Foxn1 lineage is supported by the expression patterns of these genes. In amphioxus, Foxn4 (i.e., Foxn4a) is expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm (Figure S2), among other sites; in lamprey, Foxn4L is expressed in epithelia lining the gill basket (Figure 2A); and in cartilaginous fishes and all other jawed vertebrates, Foxn1 is expressed in the thymus (Figure S2). The shared expression domains of Foxn4 and its paralog Foxn4L in the pharynx suggest that expression of a Foxn4L ortholog also occurred in the pharyngeal epithelium of the common ancestor of vertebrates and thus antedates the evolutionary emergence of the thymus.Figure 2Foxn1-like Genes Control Expression of delta-like GenesShow full caption(A) Schematic indicating the plane of the section anterior of the second gill opening of L. planeri larvae (blue line) and the major anatomical landmarks in the section (upper panels); the blue rectangle corresponds to the sections shown in the lower panels.

The position of the thymus is highlighted in red; arrows point to the emx-1 expression domain in the brain. Scale bars represent 50 μm. The differentiation of lymphocyte progenitor cells into the T cell lineage depends on the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4) (Hozumi et al., 2008Hozumi K. Mailhos C. Negishi I. Hirano K. Yahata T. Ando K. Zuklys S. Holländer G.A. Shima D.T. Habu S. Delta-like 4 is indispensable in thymic environment specific for T cell development.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2507-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, Koch et al., 2008Koch U. Fiorini E. Benedito R. Besseyrias V. Schuster-Gossler K. Pierres M. Manley N.R. Duarte A. MacDonald H.R. Radtke F. Delta-like 4 is the essential, nonredundant ligand for Notch1 during thymic T cell lineage commitment.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Given that the expression of Dll4 in the mouse is absent in thymic epithelial cells lacking Foxn1 (Itoi et al., 2007Itoi M. Tsukamoto N. Amagai T. Expression of Dll4 and CCL25 in Foxn1-negative epithelial cells in the post-natal thymus.Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we examined whether this functional relationship might have been established earlier in evolution. A phylogenetic analysis of delta-like genes in chordate genomes revealed that the amphioxus genome contains a single delta-like gene (Rasmussen et al., 2007Rasmussen S.L.K. Holland L.Z. Schubert M. Beaster-Jones L. Holland N.D. Amphioxus AmphiDelta: evolution of Delta protein structure, segmentation, and neurogenesis.Genesis. 2007; 45: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas the genomes of jawless and cartilaginous fishes and mammals each contain three distinct genes; the genomes of bony fishes carry two extra copies (a total of five genes), presumably owing to their having undergone an additional round of genome duplication (Figure S3A; further details about this and all other phylogenetic analyses in this paper can be found in the Supplemental Data). Coexpression of Foxn4a and Dll genes occurs in the pharyngeal endoderm of the cephalochordate amphioxus (Figure S2). Moreover, one of the lamprey delta-like genes, dllb is expressed in a circumscribed region of the epithelium lining the gill basket of ammocoete larvae, precisely overlapping with the Foxn4L expression domain (Figure 2A). This strongly suggests an evolutionarily ancient pattern of coexpression of Foxn4/Foxn4L and Delta-like genes. To examine whether this coexpression is indicative of a functional interaction, we turned to bony fishes as the most basal genetically tractable vertebrate. Of the five delta-like genes in medaka fish (O. latipes), only dll4a was expressed in the thymic rudiment (Figure S3B). In order to determine directly whether foxn1 is genetically upstream of dll4a, we derived two transgenic lines in medaka. The first line contains a full-length mouse Foxn1 complementary DNA (cDNA) under the control of a heat-shock promoter; the second line contains a dominant-negative version of Foxn1, designated foxn1-enRD (Figure 2B). Induction of wild-type foxn1 led to expression of dll4a in the embryo, indicating that foxn1 augments dll4a expression; conversely, when foxn1-enRD was induced, dll4a expression in the thymic rudiment was abolished (Figure 2B). Hence, foxn1 acts upstream of the dll4a gene in medaka. In order to examine whether dll4a is also required for T cell specification in this species, we first established that one of the Notch genes (Figure S4A), notch 1b, is expressed in the medaka thymus; however, knockdown of notch1b had pleiotropic effects (data not shown), precluding a meaningful interpretation of the resulting phenotype. By contrast, interference with expression of dll4a caused no general developmental defects, and a significant fraction of dll4a morphants showed no expression of the T cell receptor beta chain (tcrb) in thymocytes, whereas ikaros expression (as a marker of hematopoietic cells) was unaffected (Figure 2C). This indicates that T cell specification via delta-like ligands is an evolutionarily ancient function. Having established foxn4L and dllb as molecular tools to identify the location of a potential thymic microenvironment in lamprey, we examined whether this region of the gill basket also contained aggregates of leukocytes, as a morphological sign of a primordial lymphoid organ. To identify leukocytes in histological sections of ammocoete larvae of Lampetra planeri, we examined the expression patterns of two genes: variable lymphocyte receptor (vlr) genes (Pancer et al., 2004Pancer Z. Amemiya C.T. Ehrhardt G.R.A. Ceitlin J. Gartland G.L. Cooper M.D. Somatic diversification of variable lymphocyte receptors in the agnathan sea lamprey.Nature. 2004; 430: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) are expressed in lymphocytes, and the cxcr4 chemokine receptor (Kuroda et al., 2003Kuroda N. Uinuk-ool T.S. Sato A. Samonte I.E. Figueroa F. Mayer W.E. Klein J. Identification of chemokines and a chemokine receptor in cichlid fish, shark, and lamprey.Immunogenetics. 2003; 54: 884-895PubMed Google Scholar; for a phylogenetic analysis of chemokine receptors, see Figure S5) is expressed on virtually all leukocytes (Figure 3A). Cells expressing either of these two signature genes were not found within epithelial structures. In the gills, they are strictly intravascular (Figure 3B); moreover, no large aggregates of vlr- or cxcr4-positive cells could be detected in the kidney or in the typhlosole (Alder et al., 2008Alder M.N. Herrin B.R. Sadlonova A. Stockard C.R. Grizzle W.E. Gartland L.A. Gartland G.L. Boydston J.A. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Cooper M.D. Antibody responses of variable lymphocyte receptors in the lamprey.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the two major hematopoietic sites in ammocoete larvae (Figure 3C). This suggests that lamprey does not possess a lymphoid organ resembling the thymus of jawed vertebrates. Nonetheless, it was of interest to determine whether lymphocytes and other leukocytes express notch genes, which transmit delta-like signals to developing hematopoietic cells (Radtke et al., 2004Radtke F. Wilson A. Mancini S.J. MacDonald H.R. Notch regulation of lymphocyte development and function.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Indeed, the two notch genes identified in the lamprey genome (Figure S4A) are expressed in these cells (Figure 3A). Hence, our data suggest that although Notch receptor and ligand pairs are already expressed in the required cell types, lamprey lacks a facility required for bringing these two cell types into close proximity. A distinguishing feature of T cells is their ability to home to epithelial structures (thymus anlage, mucosal linings, skin). Given the lack of lamprey lymphocytes at these sites, we hypothesized that lymphocytes in jawed vertebrates might have acquired additional facilities to accomplish this, conceivably via specific chemokines and chemokine receptors. To gain insight into this process, we analyzed the genomes of amphioxus, a jawless fish, and a cartilaginous fish for evidence of such genes. The amphioxus genome lacks chemokine receptors (Nordström et al., 2008Nordström K.J.V. Fredriksson R. Schiöth H.B. The amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) genome contains a highly diversified set of G protein-coupled receptors.BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); the lamprey genome contains at least five chemokine receptor genes, including the known cxcr4 gene (Figure S5A). Lamprey possesses two CC chemokine genes and a cxcl12 homolog (Figure S6). An ortholog of ccr9, which, in the mouse, is implicated in facilitating the first wave of embryonic thymus colonization (Benz and Bleul, 2005Benz C. Bleul C.C.

This suggests that bona fide chemokine and chemokine receptor genes first emerged in the genome of the common ancestor of vertebrates and that this probably coincided with the emergence of lymphocytes as a distinct cell lineage. These gene families then expanded in cartilaginous fishes and further increased in diversity in bony fish and higher vertebrates, coincident with the emergence of primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, additional hematopoietic cell lineages, and more complex requirements for the regulation of immune responses. Specifically, the evolutionary emergence of the ccr9/ccl25 receptor/ligand pair coincides with that of the thymus, whereas that of the cxcr4/cxcl12 pair antedates this. Next, we examined whether the gene encoding the novel chemokine ccl25 became integrated into an existing genetic network or whether a new network was required to regulate its expression. Of several chemokines in medaka, only ccl25a is expressed in the thymic rudiment (Figure 4A). Given that thymic epithelial cells in Foxn1-deficient mice lack the expression of Ccl25 (Bleul and Boehm, 2000Bleul C.C. Boehm T. Chemokines define distinct microenvironments in the developing thymus.Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3371-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Foxn1 might be genetically upstream of this chemokine. This was shown to be the case, using the transgenic HSE::foxn1 and HSE::foxn1-enRD lines. Overexpression of wild-type Foxn1 induced expression of ccl25a, whereas a dominant-negative version of Foxn1 abolished it (Figure 4B). The expression of the paralogous gene ccl25b, which is not expressed in the thymus, remains unchanged under these conditions, providing an internal control for the specificity of the transcription factor function (Figure 4B). The coincident evolution of foxn1 and ccl25 in cartilaginous fishes and their functional interaction indicate that the functions of foxn1 expanded and that the ccl25a gene is an evolutionarily novel target in thymic stromal cells. To identify potential regulators for ccr9, encoding the receptor for ccl25, we considered transcription factors that are highly expressed in thymocyte populations encompassing thymic immigrants (Rothenberg et al., 2008Rothenberg E.V.

This study identifies an alcohol-binding pocket located in the cytoplasmic domains of GIRK2. A leucine residue in this pocket was crucial for GIRK2 activation by alcohols, but was not involved in the alcohol inhibition of related, but constitutively active, K+ channels. Ethanol modifies neural activity in the brain by modulating ion channels. Ethanol activates G protein–gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels, but the molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we used a crystal structure of a mouse inward rectifier containing a bound alcohol and structure-based mutagenesis to probe a putative alcohol-binding pocket located in the cytoplasmic domains of GIRK channels. Substitutions with bulkier side-chains in the alcohol-binding pocket reduced or eliminated activation by alcohols. By contrast, alcohols inhibited constitutively open channels, such as IRK1 or GIRK2 engineered to strongly bind PIP2. Mutations in the hydrophobic alcohol-binding pocket of these channels had no effect on alcohol-dependent inhibition, suggesting an alternate site is involved in inhibition. Comparison of high-resolution structures of inwardly rectifying K+ channels suggests a model for activation of GIRK channels using this hydrophobic alcohol-binding pocket. These results provide a tool for developing therapeutic compounds that could mitigate the effects of alcohol."

The uracil deamination product is processed by familiar DNA repair proteins, including uracil DNA N-glycosylase (UNG) and mismatch repair enzymes. However, the cellular environment within activated B-cells promotes mutagenic processing by these pathways, resulting in point mutations that ultimately enhance antibody affinity in somatic hypermutation or promote clustered double-strand breaks that alter antibody isotype in class switch recombination (6Peled J.U.

The activity of AID is restricted to relatively small 3-kb regions within the immunoglobulin locus around rearranged variable genes and heavy chain switch regions. Within these regions, the targeting of AID is partially dictated by its DNA sequence preferences. For example, it has been noted that the mutable complementarity determining regions from variable gene segments have an abundance of AGC codons as compared with adjacent framework regions that function in stabilizing antibody structure (8Wagner S.D. Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 1995; 376: 732Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In vivo, somatic hypermutation is focused on WRCW (W = A/T, R = A/G) motifs in variable and switch regions (9Rada C. Ehrenstein M.R. Neuberger M.S. Milstein C.

Biochemical assays with heterologously expressed AID have confirmed that this mutational footprint reflects the inherent sequence preferences of AID for deamination within WRC motifs (12Larijani M.

In contrast to AID, members of the APOBEC3 subfamily have evolved to function in the innate immune response (15Sawyer S.L. Emerman M. Malik H.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E275Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV, a significant number of hypermutated viral sequences can be found in infected patients, with viral genomes showing a high frequency of G → A substitutions within two sequence motifs, GA and GG (16Vartanian J.P. Meyerhans A. Sala M. Wain-Hobson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The family members APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G preferentially target TC and CC motifs, respectively, within viral cDNA following reverse transcription, accounting for the observed mutational spectrum in the HIV genome (17Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 18Yu Q. König R. Pillai S. Chiles K. Kearney M. Palmer S. Richman D. Coffin J.M. Landau N.R.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). APOBEC3F and -3G both contain duplicated deaminase domains, with sequence preference and catalytic activity attributed to the C-terminal domain (20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Haché G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Controversy exists over the protective mechanisms used by APOBEC3 family members, as antiviral activity can be dissociated from deamination (22Newman E.N. Holmes R.K. Craig H.M. Klein K.C. Lingappa J.R. Malim M.H. Sheehy A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 166-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, sequence specificity of the APOBEC family is thought to be significant for antiviral effects, as almost all of the viral open reading frames in the hypermutated HIV genomes contain mutations that lead to premature termination (18Yu Q. König R. Pillai S. Chiles K. Kearney M. Palmer S. Richman D. Coffin J.M. Landau N.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that these distinguishing sequence preferences are important for activity, the enzymatic determinants of sequence targeting have not been elucidated. Here, we report that a protein loop in the AID/APOBEC family is a key contributor to the unique sequence preferences of individual family members. Grafting the loop from the antiviral deaminases APOBEC3F or -3G into the AID scaffold alters hot spot selectivity toward that of the two donor enzymes. These constructs reveal the modular nature of substrate recognition and provide biochemical tools to probe the importance of sequence specificity in the physiologic function of this important enzyme family. A synthetic gene encoding Escherichia coli codon-optimized AID was synthesized by GenScript and cloning oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (supplemental Table S1). The AID construct was cloned downstream of an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence. Expression plasmids for the loop variants and C-terminal truncations of AID were generated through a multistep PCR-based procedure (supplemental Fig. S1). Expression vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3)-Star E. coli (Novagen) in the presence or absence of a trigger factor expression plasmid (generously provided by LiChung Ma and Gaetano T. Montelione, Rutgers University). For protein production, 600-ml cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.6 at 37 °C. Cultures were shifted to 16 °C for 16 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (wash buffer) and lysed through a microfluidizer. The soluble fraction, filtered after high-speed centrifugation, was incubated with 3 ml of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed extensively prior to elution with wash buffer plus 10 mm maltose. For small scale analysis, 1 ml of culture was processed with BugBuster reagent (Novagen) into soluble and insoluble fractions. Unlabeled 60-mer oligonucleotide substrates (S60-XXC) contained a solitary C at position 24 and differed only at the −1 and −2 positions relative to the target cytosine (for full sequences see supplemental Table S1). Variants for XX include all 16 permutations of A, G, T, or 5-methyldeoxycytosine (mC). 20-μl assays were carried out in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA. Substrate (1 μm) was incubated with no enzyme or 0.5–3 μg of enzyme and 2.5 units of UNG (New England Biolabs) for 2–12 h at 30 °C, then heated to 95 °C for 20 min. Abasic sites were cleaved by addition of 10 mm magnesium acetate and incubation with human apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE), purified as previously described (23Erzberger J.P. Barsky D. Schärer O.D. Colvin M.E. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), for 2 h at 37 °C, along with RNase A (0.2 μg) to degrade contaminating RNA from the enzyme purification. Samples were run on a 20% acrylamide/Tris-borate-EDTA/urea gel. Gels were stained with SybrGold (Invitrogen) and imaged using UV transillumination. A standard titration curve with a uracil-containing product control (S60-AGU) was run on each gel and used to quantify product formation. Sequence preference profiles were generated by a two-step calculation. First, the product formation was averaged for all sequences that contain the same nucleotide at either the −1 or −2 positions. For example, P60-XAC (the average product formation for the S60-XAC substrates) was calculated by averaging product formation with S60-AAC, -mCAC, -GAC, and -TAC. Next, the probability of deamination for each nucleotide at the −1 or −2 positions was calculated relative to other nucleotide variants. For example, the percent preference for A at −1 was calculated as (P60-XAC/(P60-XAC + P60-XmCC + P60-XGC + P60-XTC)) × 100. The in vivo sequence preference profiles for AID are taken from sequencing data on the ung−/−, msh2−/− mice as previously reported and interpreted (12Larijani M. Frieder D. Basit W. Martin A. Immunogenetics. 2005; 56: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Rada C. Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The mutational sequence preference profile for APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are derived from the previously reported mutagenesis patterns on the retrovirus Moloney leukemia virus, which packages APOBEC3 molecules in an analogous manner to HIV (20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A synthetic gene for uracil DNA-glycosylase inhibitor was obtained from GenScript and cloned into the SphI/AvrII-digested plasmid pETcoco-2 (Novagen). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)-pLysS (Novagen) cells followed by pET41 control plasmid or enzyme expression plasmids. A saturated culture derived from a single colony was diluted to A600 of 0.15. After growth for 1 h at 37 °C, the log-phase culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h, an aliquot was plated on LB-agar containing rifampin (100 μg/ml, Sigma) and LB with selection antibiotics to determine total cell density. The mutagenesis frequencies were calculated by the ratio of rifampin-resistant colonies divided by the total cell population. Single colonies were subjected to colony PCR, and rpoB mutations that conferred rifampin resistance were determined by well established protocols (25Garibyan L. Huang T. Kim M. Wolff E. Nguyen A. Nguyen T. Diep A. Hu K. Iverson A. Yang H. Miller J.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although recent structures of the C-terminal catalytic domain of APOBEC3G have increased our understanding of the overall enzymatic-fold, there are currently no structures of a polynucleotide cytosine deaminase bound to nucleic acid to elucidate how hot spot sequences are recognized (26Chen K.M. Harjes E. Gross P.J. Fahmy A. Lu Y. Shindo K. Harris R.S. Matsuo H. Nature. 2008; 452: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation, we examined the more distantly related structure of RNA-bound TadA, an adenosine deaminase that generates the universal base inosine at the wobble position of tRNAArg (28Losey H.C. Ruthenburg A.J. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Alignment of the unliganded APOBEC3G structure with TadA suggested that a loop between the β4 strand and the α4 helix is poised to interact with the sequence 5′ to the deamination target (Fig. 1A) (2Conticello S.G. Langlois M.A. Yang Z. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Immunol. 2007; 94: 37-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although flanked on either side by highly conserved amino acid residues, this loop itself is poorly conserved between family members, supporting a potential role in specific substrate recognition (Fig. 1B). In prior studies, site-directed mutations have also suggested subtle shifts in specificity that point to this loop. For example, the D311Y mutation of APOBEC3F modestly increased deamination of normally disfavored sequences with A at the −1 position (20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, the D316R/D317R double mutant of APOBEC3G increased deamination of the off-target cytosines at the −1 or −2 positions in the preferred CCC motif of APOBEC3G (27Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To examine the role of this loop in substrate specificity, we aimed to construct AID mutants where the peptide sequence from Leu113 to Pro123 was directly replaced with the corresponding loops from the catalytic domains of APOBEC3F or APOBEC3G (Fig. 1B). These enzymes were selected based on their distinct sequence preferences relative to AID that allow for evaluation of the proposal that loop graft mutants of AID may alter sequence preferences in a predictable manner (19Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of AID has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining large amounts of soluble enzyme from either native B-cell sources or heterologous expression systems (6Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To facilitate evaluation of AID and loop graft mutants, we first aimed to develop a facile route to large amounts of soluble, active protein from bacterial cultures. Through screening of multiple fusion constructs, we found that an N-terminal fusion of MBP to AID yielded some encouraging expression of soluble proteins (Fig. 2A). Then, based on the hypothesis that a potentially poorly structured C-terminal region of AID may contribute to its insolubility, we deleted residues 182–198. C-terminal truncation was expected to be non-perturbing based on prior observations that truncation resulted in higher in vivo mutagenesis rates, as well as the lack of conservation of this sequence within the larger APOBEC family (31Barreto V. Reina-San-Martin B. Ramiro A.R. McBride K.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 501-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Indeed we found that soluble expression increased with MBP-AID-ΔC (hereafter AID-WT) and that the catalytic activity was enhanced about 3-fold over the full-length protein (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, we found that co-expression of the ribosome-associating chaperone trigger factor produced soluble protein in high yield (∼10 mg/liter) upon purification by amylose resin affinity chromatography (Fig. 2A). To examine the sequence preferences of the new AID-WT construct, we assayed an array of substrates with a single cytosine and variations at the −1 and −2 positions immediately 5′ to the target cytosine (Fig. 2B). The assay is based on the notion that AID-catalyzed deamination generates uracil, which can be excised by UNG. The abasic product is then nicked by APE to cleave the DNA phosphate backbone and generate two product fragments of different lengths. The array includes substrates with an XXC sequence where X = A, G, or T or mC. mC serves as a surrogate for cytosine recognition at these positions, as competing cytosines would be potential sites for deamination, thereby complicating the analysis. In contrast, it has been previously shown that mC is a poor substrate for AID, and if a small amount of deamination were to occur at the mC sites, the product (T) would not be a substrate for UNG (32Larijani M. Frieder D. Sonbuchner T.M. Bransteitter R. Goodman M.F. Bouhassira E.E. Scharff M.D. Martin A. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The assay therefore cleanly reports on deamination of the single cytosine in the S60-XXC oligonucleotide substrates. To quantify the sequence preferences of AID-WT, we carried out multiple replicates of the assay under fixed enzyme and substrate conditions where product formation was approximately ≤35% for all substrates. As expected, incubation of AID-WT with the substrate array resulted in preferential deamination of substrates containing A or T at the −2 position, with selection against mC and G (Fig. 2C). At the −1 position, a slight preference of G over A, discrimination against T, and strong selection against mC, was observed. Thus, in vitro sequence specificity of the truncated AID protein with an MBP tag is similar to that previously reported for full-length AID constructs (14Yu K. Huang F.T. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6496-6500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The in vitro sequence preferences of AID-WT also recapitulate the observed hypermutation sequence preferences derived from in vivo data. In vivo sequence preferences of AID were previously obtained through genetic studies by knocking out both the base excision repair enzyme UNG and the mismatch repair enzyme MSH2 with the aim of preventing AID-generated uracil from being processed by downstream repair pathways. Accordingly, the mutational spectrum of the immunoglobulin variable regions of B-cells from ung−/−, msh2−/− mice reflects the in vivo sequence preferences for AID-catalyzed deamination (Fig. 3A) (12Larijani M.

By measuring deamination efficiency of AID-WT with individual members of our substrate array, we constructed an analogous in vitro sequence preference activity profile for AID-WT and compared it with the in vivo profile (Fig. 3A). The two profiles are very similar, with clear preservation of the WRC sequence preference. Of interest, mC appears to be an excellent surrogate for C at the −2 position and a good surrogate at the −1 position, as judged by similar activity profiles derived from in vivo experiments with C and the in vitro system that used mC. Cloning of the loop variants was achieved by overlap extension PCR, leaving N-terminal regions upstream from Leu113 and C-terminal region downstream of Pro123 unchanged from AID-WT and introducing the shorter 10-amino acid loop from APOBEC3F (Leu306 to Gln315) or 9-amino acid loop from APOBEC3G (Ile314 to Gln322) (Fig. 1B). The AID-APOBEC3F loop variant (AID-3FL) and the AID-APOBEC3G loop variant (AID-3GL) were overexpressed as MBP fusion proteins in high yield using the chaperone co-expression system developed for AID-WT. Despite the alteration of a large protein loop, upon overexpression, the proteins were unchanged in their distribution between soluble and insoluble fractions and were obtained in nearly equivalent purity and yield (supplemental Fig. S3). To examine sequence preferences, we assayed the enzymes for deamination of the S60-XXC substrate array. Qualitative differences between the loop variants are easily observed under high turnover conditions (supplemental Fig. S4). To allow for quantitative comparisons using the substrate array, each of the three enzymes were assayed using a fixed concentration of substrate (1 μm) and enzyme (1 μg) under conditions where product formation was ≤35% to approximate the initial rate conditions (Fig. 3). The reported values in Fig. 3 are averages from three to five replicate measurements. Loop grafting in AID-3FL and AID-3GL did not significantly compromise enzymatic activity. This conclusion is supported by the observation that AID-WT activity against its best substrate (S60-AGC) is equivalent to the activity of AID-3FL against its best substrate (S60-TGC). This indicates that the specificity and not the overall activity of AID-3FL has been altered relative to AID-WT. Similarly, AID-3GL is 6.5-fold more active with its preferred substrate (S60-mCmCC) as compared with AID-WT with the same substrate, even though the maximal activity of AID-3GL is about one-third of AID-WT with its preferred substrate. Thus, loop grafting in AID-3GL results in a more selective, albeit slightly less active enzyme. Notably, the sequence preference profiles are unlikely to be affected by modest differences in activity, as these comparisons involve the same enzyme acting on different substrates in the S60-XXC array. As compared with AID-WT, significant changes in sequence preferences for deamination were introduced by the AID-3FL and AID-3GL loop swaps, and these preferences mimic those inferred from hypermutated retroviral genomes (Fig. 3, B and C) (20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For AID-3FL, S60-TGC was the best substrate, accurately reflecting the preference of APOBEC3F for T at the −2 position. The shifts to APOBEC3F-like preferences were also extended to the −1 position. For instance, AID-3FL shows a >2-fold increase in its preference for a −1 T and a >5-fold selection against −1 A relative to AID-WT, which mimics the preferences of APOBEC3F that have been surmised from analyses of hypermutated retroviral genomes (19Liddament M.T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The AID-3GL loop swap negated the classic AID substrate preference, in agreement with poor recognition of WRC sequences by APOBEC3G (Fig. 3C) (20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Beale R.C. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Harris R.S. Rada C. Neuberger M.S. J. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). As compared with AID-WT, the overall preference for a −1 mC increased more than 9-fold with AID-3GL, in line with the preference of APOBEC3G. At the −2 position, where selectivity is less stringent with the entire AID/APOBEC family members, a modest ∼1.5-fold increase in deamination of mC containing substrates was observed with AID-3GL relative to AID-WT. Thus, the AID-3GL loop swap recapitulates the two main sequences targeting attributes of APOBEC3G: its preference for the CCC sequence and its discrimination against the WRC sequence preferred by AID-WT. To further explore the changes in sequence preferences, we examined the mutagenesis patterns using a rifampin-based mutagenesis assay in E. coli (25Garibyan L. Huang T. Kim M. Wolff E. Nguyen A. Nguyen T. Diep A. Hu K. Iverson A. Yang H. Miller J.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Rifampin resistance is conferred by a limited number of C/G → T/A transition mutations in a small portion of the RNA polymerase gene, rpoB. These mutations occur in various trinucleotide sequence contexts. Prior studies have established that each deaminase family member has a distinctive mutational spectrum based on their individual hot spot preferences, which provides a second system to validate the observed shifts in sequence preference (20Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Haché G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Garibyan L. Huang T. Kim M. Wolff E. Nguyen A. Nguyen T. Diep A. Hu K. Iverson A. Yang H.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The assay takes advantage of the potent protein, uracil DNA-glycosylase inhibitor, to prevent repair of uracil lesions. C/G → T/A transition mutations therefore persist and can be located by sequencing individual rifampin-resistant colonies. Expression of AID-WT, AID-3FL, or AID-3GL results in a 6–20-fold increase in the frequency of mutations resulting in rifampin resistance in E. coli (Fig. 4A). Sequencing of rpoB from rifampin-resistant clones established that the in vitro sequence preferences extended to the intracellular environment, where potentially competitive DNA binding sequences could have attenuated the expected results. For all resistant clones, only a single mutation was observed within the sequenced portion of rpoB, and all were known mutations that confer rifampin resistance (25Garibyan L. Huang T. Kim M. Wolff E. Nguyen A. Nguyen T. Diep A. Hu K. Iverson A. Yang H. Miller J.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The mutations on the coding strand were exclusively C → T or G → A, and therefore attributable to replication over unrepaired uracil introduced by the deaminase on either the coding or non-coding strands. For AID-WT, 84% of rifampin mutations were G1586 to A transitions, which can result from a non-coding strand C → T mutation within an ATC trinucleotide sequence (Fig. 4B). Notably, this is the only locus within the rpoB gene where a C → T mutation at a canonical WRC hot spot has been shown to result in rifampin resistance in wild-type E. coli. For AID-3FL, a new mutational spectrum was seen, with many of the new deamination sites containing T at the −1 position, which is the same preference observed in the in vivo studies (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, the most preferred site for mutation by the loop variant AID-3FL was C1576 (30% frequency), which has been previously reported as the preferred site of deamination by APOBEC3F with identical frequency (19Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For AID-3GL, more than 40% of the mutations occurred at CCC locus C1691, which has been previously established as the preferred site of deamination for APOBEC3G (30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 34Jónsson S.R. Haché G. Stenglein M.D. Fahrenkrug S.C. Andrésdóttir V. Harris R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5683-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This preference contrasts significantly with AID-WT, where <3% of mutations were observed at this site. Thus, the predicted shift in preferences for both loop-grafted AID variants extend to an in vivo environment. This work identifies a recognition loop that significantly accounts for the different substrate sequence preferences in the AID/APOBEC family. These studies were facilitated by an improved protein expression system that yielded large amounts of soluble AID, expressed as N-terminal MBP fusion and C-terminal truncation. Importantly, this construct exhibits improved activity relative to the full-length protein and the same hot spot preferences seen in B-cells or with heterologously expressed full-length enzyme (12Larijani M. Frieder D. Basit W. Martin A. Immunogenetics. 2005; 56: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Med. 2006; 203: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The hot spot recognition sequence of AID, and its degree of specificity for this sequence, would be expected to reflect an evolutionary balance between multiple potentially competing requirements. The requirement to generate a broad range of amino acid changes by somatic hypermutation would select for a certain degree of promiscuity in the selectivity of AID. In this regard, deaminated products can be detected for all S60-XXC substrate sequences, which would tend to enhance diversification of target sequences. Class switch recombination has different requirements, where clustering of specific AID target motifs could result in recombinogenic double-strand breaks. High activity of AID on WGC sequences and the prevalence of WGCW in switch regions are also consistent with this requirement. A significant unanswered question in the understanding of the generation of antibody diversity by AID is the mechanism by which the enzyme is targeted. Targeting occurs at multiple levels. Globally, AID must target the immunoglobulin locus, because aberrant global targeting could result in oncogenic lesions (36Liu M. Duke J.L. Richter D.J. Vinuesa C.G. Goodnow C.C. Kleinstein S.H. Schatz D.G. Nature. 2008; 451: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 37Okazaki I.M. Kotani A. Honjo T. Adv. Immunol. 2007; 94: 245-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Upon finding the immunoglobulin locus, AID must then be preferentially localized to the variable regions to promote somatic hypermutation and to the heavy chain switch regions to yield class switch recombination. Within these regions, AID further selects its hot spot WRCW sequences, preferentially promoting productive mutations within the antigen complementarity determining regions over structurally essential framework regions. In exploring these layers of targeting, our work serves as a basis for understanding how AID can achieve sequence level targeting and demonstrates the utility of loop swapping in manipulating sequence preferences. Examination of related enzyme structures led us to postulate that a loop region with poor sequence conservation in the AID/APOBEC family might play a role in DNA sequence recognition. The loop is enriched for aromatic, acidic, and basic side chains, which make it a potential source of base stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions that could contribute to sequence specificity. Flexible loops often play useful roles in the recognition of macromolecules (38Tawfik D.S. Science. 2006; 311: 475-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, antibody molecules themselves exploit the flexibility of protein loops to make diverse antigen recognition pockets (39Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Foote J. Neuberger M.S. Winter G. Nature. 1986; 321: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). As compared with random point mutagenesis, loop grafting has several advantages. Grafting potentially preserves subtle geometric constraints important for binding, accommodates differences in loop sizes, and allows for the directed evaluation of a specific hypothesis, namely that a large part of the individual specificities of these enzymes are encoded in their unique loop architectures. The discovery that a recognition loop can be grafted from APOBEC family members to AID and confer altered specificity has implications for the evolution of this enzyme family (40Khersonsky O. Roodveldt C. Tawfik D.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The APOBEC enzymes have undergone rapid gene expansion in higher mammals and exhibit one of the strongest positive selection signals in the human genome, which suggests an essential and growing role for these enzymes in pathogen defense (15Sawyer S.L. Emerman M. Malik H.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E275Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 41Zhang J. Webb D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The apparently modular nature of the APOBEC family, with segregation of hot spot recognition from the deaminase catalytic core, would offer an elegant strategy for rapid evolution of sequence specificities that are tailored to their individual niches in the immune response to foreign antigens and retroviruses. To further evaluate the generality of loop swaps in the AID/APOBEC family, it will be interesting to see if reciprocal loop swaps, introducing foreign loops into an APOBEC3 scaffold, will alter deamination specificity. This could potentially be pursued by in vivo analysis of loop graft variants acting on retroviral genomes given that in vitro characterization in the AID/APOBEC family often presents potentially significant biochemical challenges (6Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These loop variants provide potentially useful biochemical tools for addressing the importance of sequence specificity in the individual cellular functions of AID/APOBEC family members. The growing enzyme family has clear evidence of specialization. For instance, APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F are able to counteract HIV, whereas many of the other APOBEC enzymes cannot, and APOBEC1 cannot compensate for AID deficiency in B-cells (3Rosenberg B.R. Papavasiliou F.N. Adv. Immunol. 2007; 94: 215-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42Fugmann S.D. Rush J.S. Schatz D.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is unclear if these restricted activities are related to enzymatic sequence preferences. These catalytically competent variants with altered specificities provide valuable tools to now explore the contribution of sequence specificity to antibody diversity, improper gene targeting, and antiviral defense.

We hypothesize that the channels forming this current pathway are composed of a mixture of ASIC and ENaC subunits. RNA profiling of a large number of GBM-derived cell lines and freshly resected tumors have revealed the presence of a myriad of ASIC/ENaC components (3.Berdiev B.K. Xia J. McLean L.A. Markert J.M.

The basally active current seen in GBM cells can be significantly reduced by amiloride or benzamil (a higher affinity amiloride analog), both of which are inhibitors of the ENaC/Deg family of ion channels (3.Berdiev B.K.

PcTX1, a selective ASIC1 blocker, also effectively abolishes the basally active GBM current (35.Bubien J.K. Ji H.L. Gillespie G.Y. Fuller C.M. Markert J.M. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol.

We have previously shown that ENaC and ASIC subunits can form cross-clade interactions in a heterologous expression system (36.Meltzer R.H. Kapoor N. Qadri Y.J. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J.

This study aims to probe the composition of the novel ENaC/Deg heteromer in a glioma cell line, D54-MG. Our study postulates that a change in GBM cell electrophysiological properties after subunit knockdown would be indicative of that subunit being a part of the GBM channel. We have sequentially knocked down different ENaC/Deg subunits from the D54-MG glioma cells and measured amiloride-sensitive whole cell current using patch clamp. We found that knocking down various ENaC/Deg subunits significantly reduced the whole cell patch clamp current in glioma cells and changed the resting Na+/K+ permeability of the these cells. After subunit knockdown, glioma cells showed a reduced cell migration as compared with control cells, consistent with our hypothesis that ENaC/Deg subunits play an important role in glioma cell pathophysiology. Experiments were performed on a glioma-derived cell line D54-MG (GBM, derived from a World Health Organization grade IV tumor; a kind gift of Dr. D. Bigner, Duke University, Durham, NC), primary human astrocytes (a kind gift of Dr. Yancey Gillipsie, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL), and on CHO-K1 cells. Cells were maintained in continuous cell culture in 50:50 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For electrophysiological recording, cells were split 48 h before recording onto 35-mm dishes containing flame-sterilized coverslips. In the case of transfection, cells were split 24 h before the transfection experiment and then allowed to grow for 24–48 h before use. Total cellular RNA was isolated from D54-MG cells and primary human astrocytes using RNeasy (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA isolated 48 h post-transfection from CHO-K1 cells transfected with cDNAs for human ASIC1, αENaC, γENaC, and δENaC was used as a positive control. RNA concentration was calculated based on the absorbance at 260 nm. RNA samples were stored at −20 °C. Real time PCR to measure ASIC1 (Hs00241630_m1), αENaC (Hs00168906_m1), γENaC (Hs00168918_m1), and δENaC (Hs00161595_m1) mRNA was performed using TaqMan® One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents (Applied Biosystems, catalog no. 4309169) using the manufacturer's handbook as a reference (Relative Quantification; Applied Biosystems 7300/7500 Real Time PCR system; 2004). 18 S rRNA (Hs99999901_m1) was amplified as an internal control and used as a reference. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange XL II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to engineer premature stop codons in human ASIC1, human γENaC, human αENaC, and human δENaC cDNA. Briefly, wild type constructs of each subunit (previously ligated at the N terminus to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) at the C-terminal expression vector and shown to form functional ion channels (36.Meltzer R.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 25548-25559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were subjected to PCR with sense and antisense primers containing the specific base change to result in the desired codon mutations. For ASIC1, a stop codon was introduced at Tyr-67, for γENaC at Ser-155, for αENaC at Glu-34, and for δENaC at Ser-35. The reaction mixture was subjected to the cycling parameters according to the manufacturer's handbook; 1 cycle at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 18 cycles sequentially at 95 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s, and 68 °C for 1 min/kilobase of plasmid length and finally followed by 1 cycle at 68 °C for 7 min. PCR products were transformed, and Escherichia coli were plated on Luria Bertani (LB) plates with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies were grown on LB medium with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37 °C with constant shaking. DNA was isolated using the Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen), and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing (Heflin Genetics Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham). The colonies were grown in 250 ml of LB medium with antibiotics, and DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). For transfecting dominant negative cDNAs, electroporation using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser X-cell electroporator (Bio-Rad) was used. Cells are detached from the flask with 0.1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended at 1.3 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 + 10 mm dextrose and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol in a 4-mm sterile cuvette (0.3 ml/cuvette). 5–10 μg of cDNA was added to the cuvette. The cuvette was then pulsed using a time lapse protocol of a single square wave pulse of 300 V for 35 ms and 960 microfarads as per the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were returned to 60-mm dish in the incubator for 24–48 h before use. Post-transfection with ASIC1 ligated to GFP as described above, D54-MG cells were treated with 500 μg/ml G418 to select for transfected cells. After antibiotic selection, GFP-positive cells were sterile-sorted by the Center for AIDS Research Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) facility at University of Alabama at Birmingham. αENaC and γENaC rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against synthetic peptide in collaboration with Dr. Mark Knepper (National Institutes of Health) as described (37.Berdiev B.K. Cormet-Boyaka E. Tousson A. Qadri Y.J. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Hong J.S. Gonzales P.A. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Lukacs G.L. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, antigenic peptide with the sequences human αENaC, LMKGNKREEQGLGPEPAAPQQPTC, and human γENaC, CNTLRLDSAFSSQLTDTQLTNEF, were synthesized by Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). All peptides were high performance liquid chromatography-purified. ASIC1 antibody was obtained from Alomone Labs (product #ASC-014), δENaC antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog #H-230: sc-21015), and GFP antibody was obtained from Abgent (catalog #AM1009a). D54-MG cells stably transfected with ASIC1-GFP were grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were allowed to grow until 90–100% confluent and then scraped and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total membranes and plasma membranes were isolated using a plasma membrane protein extraction kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total membrane and plasma membrane were dissolved in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% w/v CHAPS, and protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Total membrane and plasma membrane protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoblotting, cell lysates were assayed for protein concentration (BCA, Pierce), and then 50 μg of protein was loaded in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol into the wells of a 6–8% SDS-PAGE gel (4% stacking gel). The gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. The blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) and autoradiography. Band densities were assessed using Scanalytic software. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments total membrane and plasma membrane fractions of D54-MG stably transfected with ASIC1-GFP was used. For control experiments CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA for ASIC1-GFP, and CHO-K1 and D54-MG cells were transiently transfected with CFP-CLC1. Cells were lysed using lysis buffer with 1% CHAPS and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). 2 μg of primary antibody was added to 500 μg of cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added and allowed to incubate for 4 h. The beads were then pelleted and washed 3–4 times with lysis buffer. To elute the immune complex, 50 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5–3.0) was added to the beads and allowed to incubate on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 1–3 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected, and the pH was adjusted to physiological pH by adding 10 μl of 1 m Tris. 10–25 μl of loading buffer was added to the eluate and loaded onto a 6% SDS gel. Immunoblotting was carried out as described above using the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. All buffers used for preparing cell lysates, membranes, and subcellular fractions included protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were recorded in transfected and untransfected glioma cells. Cells were cultured on flame-sterilized coverslips and transfected 48 h before patch-clamping. Patch pipettes were made of thin-walled borosilicate glass using a P-97 Flaming/Browning Micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and typically had a resistance of 5–10 megaohms. Pipettes were filled with an electrolyte solution containing 100 mm potassium gluconate, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4 mm ATP, pH 7.2. Current recordings were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and digitized online at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments). pClamp 9.0 (Axon Instruments) was used to acquire and store data. Our standard bath solution consisted of 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 10.5 mm glucose, and 32.5 mm HEPES acid; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The whole cell patch configuration was established as described previously (35.Bubien J.K. Ji H.L. Gillespie G.Y. Fuller C.M. Markert J.M. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1282-C1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded by holding the cell at −60 mV and clamped sequentially to membrane potentials between −100 mV and +80 mV in 20-mV increments. To characterize the ion selectivity of the whole cell currents and calculate the relative permeability for Na+ and K+, bath solutions were used as described previously (35.Bubien J.K. Ji H.L. Gillespie G.Y. Fuller C.M. Markert J.M. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1282-C1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), i.e. solutions A and B that contained Na+ and K+, respectively, as the major cation. Bath solution A contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm dextrose. Bath solution B contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm dextrose. The pH of the solutions was adjusted with NaOH or KOH to 7.5. The solution of the entire chamber was perfused, whereas the cell was still in whole cell patch clamp mode. D54-MG cells were transfected with YFP-tagged dominant negative cDNAs for ASIC1, αENaC, γENaC, or with eYFP for the control group using electroporation as described above. Cells were transfected for 48 h before use and then detached (phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mm EDTA) and counted using a hemocytometer. 50,000 YFP-labeled cells transfected with either test or control cDNAs were replated onto high throughput screening FluoroblokTM (BD Bioscience) inserts coated on the underside with 5 μg/ml vitronectin. High throughput screening Fluoroblok inserts have a special polyethylene terephthalate track-etched polymer coating on the membrane which blocks the passage of light through the membrane so only fluorescent cells that have migrated through the filter pores (8-μm diameter) were visualized. Cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized using fluorescence. Because GFP and YFP fluorophores have overlapping emission spectra, YFP-tagged cells can be visualized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. YFP-expressing cells that had migrated through the pores to the other side of the filter were counted in five random fields per filter using a Nikon TE200V microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Three filters equal an n of 1. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Differences between groups were assessed using standard statistical tests, primarily Student's t test. Data are presented as the means ± 1 S.D. Significance was set at p < 0.05. We have previously shown that high grade gliomas such as GBMs express different subunits of the ENaC/Deg family (3.Berdiev B.K. Xia J. McLean L.A. Markert J.M. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Naren A.P.

To see if a quantitative difference exists between the expression of ASIC1, αENaC, γENaC, and δENaC mRNA levels in glioma cells and primary human astrocytes, we performed quantitative real time PCR on total mRNA obtained from D54-MG glioma cells and primary human astrocytes. Real time PCR was performed using Taq-Man One Step master mix (Applied Biosystems). 18 S rRNA was amplified as the internal control. Relative levels of mRNA for ASIC1, αENaC, γENaC, and δENaC proportional to 18 S rRNA were compared between D54-MG cells and primary human astrocytes. We found that D54-MG cells have a significantly higher expression of ASIC1 (Fig. 1A), αENaC (Fig. 1B), and γENaC (Fig. 1C) mRNA level compared with primary human astrocytes. δENaC mRNA was not detected in either D54-MG cells or primary human astrocytes, whereas we could easily detect it in δENaC-transfected CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Even though we did not detect δENaC mRNA in either astrocytes or in D54-MG cells, we did detect the protein expression in both the cell types (see Fig. 6A, primary astrocytes data are not shown). Therefore, we do not rule out that very low expression of δENaC mRNA might occur in both primary human astrocytes and D54-MG cells, which was undetected using standard semiquantitative RT-PCR. Also it is possible that δENaC mRNA may have a short half-life and is quickly degraded in situ. Among ASIC1, αENaC, and γENaC mRNA expression in D54-MG cells, we found ASIC1 levels to be severalfold higher than αENaC or γENaC levels, suggesting that the channel responsible for the amiloride-sensitive current seen in glioma cells is composed of ASIC1 subunit at the core of the channel in association with ENaC subunits. We have previously shown that high grade glioma cells display a basally active cation current that is inhibited by the diuretic drug amiloride (3.Berdiev B.K. Xia J. McLean L.A. Markert J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2046233677,"The copper(II) complex A0 induces a type of non-apoptotic cell death also known as paraptosis. Paraptosis involves extensive endoplasmic reticulum vacuolization in the absence of caspase activation. A wide panel of human cancer cell lines was used to demonstrate differences in cytotoxicity by the paraptosis-inducing drug A0 and the metal-based pro-apoptotic drug cisplatin. Gene expression profiling of the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells showed that, while cisplatin induced p53 targets, A0 up-regulated genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and response to heavy metals. The cytotoxic effects of A0 were associated with inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins, in a manner dependent on protein synthesis. Cycloheximide inhibited the accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins and hampered A0-induced cell death process. The occurrence of the UPR during A0-induced death process was shown by the increased abundance of spliced XBP1 mRNA, transient eIF2α phosphorylation, and a series of downstream events, including attenuation of global protein synthesis and increased expression of ATF4, CHOP, BIP, and GADD34. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing a mutant eIF2α, which could not be phosphorylated, were more resistant to A0 than wild type cells, pointing to a pro-death role of eIF2α phosphorylation. A0 may thus represent the prototypical member of a new class of compounds that cause paraptotic cell death via mechanisms involving eIF2α phosphorylation and the UPR."
https://openalex.org/W2013244756,"Reversible protein glutathionylation plays a key role in cellular regulation and cell signaling and protects protein thiols from hyperoxidation. Sulfiredoxin (Srx), an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of Cys-sulfinic acid derivatives of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys Prxs), has been shown to catalyze the deglutathionylation of actin. We show that deglutathionylation of 2-Cys Prx, a family of peroxidases, is specifically catalyzed by Srx. Using the ubiquitously expressed member of 2-Cys Prx, Prx I, we revealed the following. (i) Among its four Cys residues, Cys52, Cys83, and Cys173 can be glutathionylated in vitro. Deglutathionylation with Cys mutants showed that Cys83 and Cys173 were preferentially catalyzed by Srx, with glutathionylated Srx as the reaction intermediate, whereas glutaredoxin I was more favorable for deglutathionylating Cys52. (ii) Studies using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with binding and deglutathionylation activities revealed that Pro174 and Pro179 of Prx I and Tyr92 of Srx are essential for both activities. Furthermore, relative to glutaredoxin I, Srx exhibited negligible deglutathionylation activity for glutathionylated cysteine and glutathionylated BSA. These results indicate that Srx is specific for deglutathionylating Prx I due to its favorable affinity for Prx I. To assess the biological relevance of these observations, we showed that Prx I is glutathionylated in A549 and HeLa cells under modest levels of H2O2. In addition, the level of glutathionylated Prx I was substantially elevated in small interfering RNA-mediated Srx-knocked down cells, whereas the reverse was observed in Srx-overexpressing cells. However, glutathionylation of Prx V, not known to bind to Srx, was not affected by the change in Srx expression levels.

These enzymes are known to catalyze the removal of H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxides. Mammalian cells express six Prxs, and they can be divided into three subclasses, namely typical 2-Cys Prxs that consist of Prx I–IV, atypical 2-Cys Prx (Prx V), and 1-Cys Prx (Prx VI). Among them, Prx I is highly abundant and ubiquitously expressed. The typical 2-Cys Prxs are the largest class of Prxs that contain a conserved N-terminal Cys residue and a conserved C-terminal Cys residue. During catalytic action, the conserved N-Cys-free thiol is selectively oxidized to Cys-SOH, which reacts with the C-Cys-free thiol of the other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide bond, and the disulfide bond is reduced specifically by Trx (16.Chae H.Z.

The sulfenic intermediate can be further oxidized to the sulfinic acid derivative (Cys-SO2H), resulting in enzyme inactivation (18.Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G.

Srx was identified as the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of the sulfinic acid derivative in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and thiol as electron donors (10.Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 12.Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) showed that Prx I and Prx V can be glutathionylated in human T lymphocytes and hepatoma cells, respectively. However, diamide is capable of extracting a hydride from thiols to form a reactive RS+ that can easily form a disulfide bond with another thiol, such as GSH (22.Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Wertheim B. Correa W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Therefore, the glutathionylated proteins so obtained may not be physiologically relevant. In this study, we showed that in the absence of diamide and H2O2, Prx I can be glutathionylated at three (Cys52, Cys83, and Cys173) of the four cysteine residues by GSSG. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we revealed that Srx preferentially catalyzes the deglutathionylation of Cys83 and Cys173, whereas Grx is a preferred enzyme to catalyze the deglutathionylation of Cys52. The specificity of Srx as a deglutathionylating enzyme for Prx I derives from its favorable binding affinity to Prx I. The catalytic reaction involves the formation of a glutathionylated Srx, at its only and conserved cysteine residue, as a reaction intermediate. The biological relevance of this finding is supported by the observation that the level of glutathionylated Prx I in A549 cells was substantially elevated in Srx-siRNA-treated cells and substantially reduced in Srx-overexpressing cells. NADPH, GSH, GSSG, dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAM), acrylamide, ATP, glutathione ethyl ester, and MgCl2 were obtained from Sigma; glutathione reductase was from U.S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH); sulfo-NHS-biotin was from Pierce; streptavidin-agarose was from Invitrogen; Lys-C and chymotrypsin were from Roche Applied Science; human Grx I, which has a specific activity of 97 units/mg (pure Grx I exhibits a specific activity of 100 units/mg using glutathionylated cysteine (CSSG) as substrate, and 1 unit is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized/GSSG formed/min), glutathionylated cysteine and glutathionylated BSA were prepared in the laboratory of Professor John J. Mieyal (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH); a monoclonal antibody to glutathione was from Virogen (Watertown, MA); and a polyclonal antibody to human Srx was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Escherichia coli expression plasmids encoding wild type human Prx I and two mutants with Cys52 and Cys173 individually replaced by serine residues (C52S and C173S, respectively) were prepared as described (18.Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Three Prx I mutants with two cysteines replaced by serine residues (C52S/C83S, C83S/C173S, and C52S/C173S) were generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using Prx I (C52S) or Prx I (C173S) as templates. The procedure for constructing the bacterial expression vector for human wild type Srx was described previously (12.Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mutant Srx proteins with His100, Arg101, and Tyr92 replaced by Asn, Met, and Arg, respectively, were generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with hSrx as a template. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring each plasmid were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm), the cultures were incubated for 3 h at 25 °C, and then the cells were lysed. The recombinant proteins were purified as described (23.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Glutathionylation was carried out by disulfide exchange with GSSG. Typically, 40 μm recombinant protein was incubated overnight with 10 mm GSSG at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. After overnight incubation, excess GSSG was removed using either size exclusion chromatography (TSK-GEL G3000SW; TOSOH Corp., Tokyo, Japan) or strong anion exchange chromatography (TSK Super Q-5PW; TOSOH). The glutathionylated products were identified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mass spectrometric methods. Proteins and peptides were analyzed using reverse phase HPLC with a Vydac C18 column coupled with an electrospray mass spectrometer (Agilent 1100 Series LC/MSD). The column was pre-equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The elution was performed over 35 min with a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The effluent from the spectrophotometric detector was mixed in a tee with 100 ml/min acetic acid pumped by another model 1100 pump, and the mixture was introduced into the mass spectrometer (24.Apffel A. Fischer S. Goldberg G. Goodley P.C. Kuhlmann F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 712: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were deconvoluted using the software provided by the instrument manufacturer (Chemstation Version 9, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Theoretical average m/z values of singly charged ions, [M + H]+, were calculated using GPMAW software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Dried protein (20 μg) was redissolved in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.5), containing 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm iodoacetamide, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. After precipitation in 20% trichloroacetic acid and washing with ethanol/ethyl acetate, the protein was incubated with 5 mm DTT for 30 min and subsequently reacted with 25 mm acrylamide at 37 °C for 30 min. The alkylated proteins were digested with Lys-C overnight at room temperature, and half of the sample was further digested with chymotrypsin to smaller peptides. The time course of the deglutathionylation catalyzed by either Srx or Grx I was monitored by the production of GSSG, which was measured by the GSSG-mediated oxidation of NADPH catalyzed by GSSG reductase, modified from a procedure described previously (25.Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures for the coupled assay contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 150 μm NADPH, 0.5 mm GSH, 2 units/ml GSSG reductase, and the indicated concentration of glutathionylated substrate and Srx or Grx I. The deglutathionylation reactions were carried out at 37 °C. The rate of NADPH oxidation was measured from the slope of the linear portion of the time course of decreasing A340 nm. Each experiment was repeated at least five times, and a typical one is shown. To identify the reaction intermediate for the deglutathionylation of Prx I catalyzed by Srx, 5 μm glutathionylated Prx I (C52S/C83S) or Prx I (C83S/C173S) was incubated with 5 μm Srx at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid until the pH reached 2–3. The resulting products were analyzed using the LC-MS method described above. A549 (human lung carcinoma) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) (ATCC number CCL-185) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (CCL-2TM; ATCC). BioGEE was prepared as described previously (26.Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, sulfo-NHS-biotin was reacted with glutathione ethyl ester at a 1:1 molar ratio in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated, and the remaining biotinylation reagent was quenched by the addition of NH4HCO3 to a 5-fold molar excess with respect to the starting sulfo-NHS-biotin concentration. BioGEE was added to the medium 1 h prior to the addition of H2O2. Soluble proteins covalently bound to biotin were extracted in batches using streptavidin-agarose. The agarose beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS. Proteins bound to streptavidin via a disulfide bond were then eluted from the beads by incubation for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA/SDS containing 10 mm DTT. Proteins in the eluent were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting the 5′-GGAGGUGACUACUUCUACU-3′ sequence in the open reading frame of hSrx mRNA as well as a control RNA duplex of random sequence were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Chicago, IL). The A549 cells (2 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of solution T (Amaxa Biosystems, Walkersville, MD) with 1 μm siRNA, and this mixture was subjected to electroporation using the U-17 program of the Nucleofector instrument (Amaxa Biosystems, Walkersville, MD). For overexpression of Srx, A549 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCDNA/Srx or an empty vector using the same procedure as described for siRNA. Human Prx I contains four cysteine residues: Cys52, Cys71, Cys83, and Cys173. To investigate whether these cysteine residues can be glutathionylated, recombinant Prx I protein was incubated with GSSG at 4 °C for 18 h in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The oxidized end products were analyzed using reverse phase HPLC coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry. The theoretical mass for the reduced form of recombinant Prx I is 21,979.3 Da, and we observed a value of 21,977.7 Da (Fig. 1A). After 18 h of incubation with 10 mm GSSG, two new peaks were observed in the chromatogram. Mass analysis revealed that the major new peak had a mass of 22,894, which is 916 Da higher than that of the reduced form. Since the theoretical mass for three covalently bound glutathiones is 915.9 Da, this peak corresponds to a triple-glutathionylated Prx I. The second peak contained several species, including mono- and diglutathionylated Prx I. Glutathionylation of Prx I was also observed in a time-dependent manner by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for glutathione (Fig. 1B). Considering the fact that Prx I has two active site cysteines, N-Cys (Cys52) and C-Cys (Cys173), it was expected that Cys52 and Cys173 would be easily glutathionylated. However, except for those two cysteines, it was not clear which ones of the remaining two might be glutathionylated in Prx I. Therefore, additional experiments were carried out to identify the glutathionylated cysteine residues. To determine the glutathionylated cysteine residues in Prx I, a double alkylation method was employed. In view of the fact that thiol groups on cysteines can be modified easily by alkylating reagents, such as iodoacetamide and acrylamide, the redox state of individual thiols can be determined by using a stepwise alkylation technique in combination with mass spectrometric analysis. The scheme for this double alkylation procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2A and shows how glutathionylated cysteine was identified. Prx I (C52S) mutant protein, in which Cys52 was replaced by serine, was subjected to glutathionylation and alkylation. The use of this Prx I mutant instead of Prx I (WT) was to prevent disulfide bond formation during the reaction. The protein was confirmed to be glutathionylated on two cysteine residues by LC-MS analysis (data not shown). The reduced (control) and glutathionylated Prx I (C52S) were redissolved in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm iodoacetamide to alkylate non-glutathionylated cysteine residues. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the protein was precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by washing to remove the unreacted reagents. The protein was dried and then redissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl in Tris buffer as it was in the first alkylation step but without iodoacetamide. The glutathionylated residue was then reduced with 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the reduced cysteine was alkylated with 25 mm acrylamide. Thus, the cysteine residues modified by iodoacetamide were initially reduced, and the glutathionylated cysteine was the one modified by acrylamide. The alkylated proteins were incubated with Lys-C at room temperature overnight, and then one-half was used for LC-MS analysis (Fig. 2B), and the other half was further incubated with chymotrypsin because Lys-C could not hydrolyze the peptide bonds between Cys71 and Cys83. Fig. 2B shows the elution patterns obtained after the alkylated control and glutathionylated Prx I (C52S) were digested with Lys-C. The peaks identified with an arrow contained the cysteine residue(s). Results from the LC-MS analysis of the cysteine- and the Ser52-containing peptides obtained from the glutathionylated Prx I (C52S) are summarized in Table 1. The theoretical masses for peptides 69–93 and 169–190 with the sequence shown in Table 1 should be 2767.4 and 2349.16 Da, respectively. However, the observed values were 2896.0 Da for peptide 69–93 and 2420.5 Da for peptide 169–190. These results indicate that Cys71 and Cys83 in peptide 69–93 were modified by one acrylamide and one iodoacetamide, since alkylation by one iodoacetamide and one acrylamide would add 57.02 and 71.04 Da to the unmodified peptide, respectively. Together, they correspond to a mass increase of 128.06 Da. In addition, based on the observed mass of 2420.5 Da in peptide 169–190, it indicates that Cys173 was alkylated with acrylamide, since the observed mass is 71.34 Da higher than that expected for the unmodified peptide 169–190. These results indicate that there are two glutathionylation sites in Prx I (C52S); one is Cys173, and the other could either be Cys71 or Cys83. To identify which of these two cysteines is the glutathionylation site, the Lys-C digest was subjected to chymotrypsin digestion, since it cleaves the peptide at the carboxyl site of Tyr, Trp, and Phe. Thus, from peptide 69–93, one would obtain peptides 69–82, 83–87, and 88–93. The mass analysis showed that peptide 83–87 was alkylated with an acrylamide, since its observed mass was 699.32 Da, which is 71 Da higher than the theoretical value of 628.32 Da calculated for the peptide CHLAW. These results indicate that the glutathionylation sites in Prx I are Cys83, Cys52, and Cys173, since Cys71 is not glutathionylated. Interestingly, Cys83 in Prx I is located at the putative dimer-dimer interface (27.Lee W. Choi K.S. Riddell J. Ip C. Ghosh D. Park J.H. Park Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22011-22022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and is susceptible to glutathionylation. As a consequence, glutathionylation may exert an effect on Prx I oligomerization.TABLE 1Cysteine-containing peptides from control (upper lines) or glutathionylated (lower lines) Prx I (C52S) analyzed by LC-MSResiduesRetention timeModificationMassSequenceTheoreticalObservedminm/z37–6626.7None3626.13625.3YVVFFFYPLDFTFVSPTEIIAFSDRAEEFK69–9317.72 CIM2881.42881.9LNCQVIGASVDSHFCHLAWVNTPKK17.81 ACR/1 CIM2895.52896.0169–19013.91 CIM2406.22406.4HGEVCPAGWKPGSDTIKPDVQK14.01 ACR2420.22420.5 Open table in a new tab Although Srx was discovered as an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of the cysteine sulfinic acid derivative in Prx (10.Biteau B.

Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), it has also been shown to possess glutathionyl mixed disulfide oxidoreductase activity (13.Findlay V.J. Townsend D.M. Morris T.E. Fraser J.P. He L. Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6800-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Srx can function as an enzyme to catalyze the deglutathionylation of glutathionylated Prx I and compared its catalytic efficiency with that of Grx I (7.Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28.Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To avoid complexity, characterization of the deglutathionylation process for each of the three cysteine residues in Prx I was carried out with three double mutants in which two of the glutathionylation sites were replaced with serine residues. With these mutants, the rate of deglutathionylation can be determined individually for each glutathionylated cysteine in Prx I. Fig. 3 shows the time courses for the deglutathionylation of Cys52, Cys173, and Cys83 catalyzed by Srx or Grx I. The deglutathionylation reaction was monitored by a coupled enzyme system in which GSSG formed during the deglutathionylation reaction was used as substrate to oxidize NADPH catalyzed by GSSG reductase. The data reveal that at 37 °C, the initial rate for the deglutathionylation of the glutathionylated Cys52, Cys83, and Cys173 catalyzed by Srx ranged from 0.58 to 0.63 μm/min, whereas that catalyzed by fully active human Grx I for Cys52 was 1.51 μm/min, and that for Cys83 and Cys173 was 0.21 and 0.20 μm/min, respectively. In other words, relative to Grx I, Srx is ∼3-folds more efficient in catalyzing the deglutathionylation of Cys83 and Cys173. However, Grx I was found to be about 2.5-folds more efficient than Srx in catalyzing the deglutathionylation of Cys52. It should be pointed out that the initial rapid decrease in A340 nm shown in some of the time courses in Fig. 3 was caused by the reduction of the contaminated GSSG by NADPH. This GSSG was generated by the oxidation of GSH prior to the addition of GSSG reductase, followed by substrate addition to initiate the deglutathionylation reaction. The mechanism of Grx-mediated deglutathionylation of proteins is well established (29.Mieyal J.J. Srinivaan U. Starke D.W. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar). The catalytic process includes the formation of glutathionylated Grx as intermediate. However, Findlay et al. (13.Findlay V.J. Townsend D.M. Morris T.E. Fraser J.P. He L. Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6800-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported that, although the conserved Cys99 residue in Srx is required for Srx-mediated deglutathionylation, Srx is not an acceptor molecule for glutathione. In an attempt to identify the reaction intermediate, we incubated a mixture containing 5 μm glutathionylated Prx I (C83/C173S) mutant and 5 μm Srx in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer, at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final pH of 2–3. The resulting mixture was subjected to LC-MS analysis. The chromatogram in Fig. 4 indicates the presence of four protein species in the reaction mixture. They correspond to the reduced and glutathionylated Prx I mutant and Srx. Based"

Central to the lifecycle of these unicellular parasites is their ability to migrate through animal tissue and invade target host cells.

Infection with P. falciparum results in ∼1–3 million deaths and a further 500 million infections annually (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). During various stages of the Apicomplexan lifecycle the parasites require motility to migrate through their insect and vertebrate hosts and to invade and internalize themselves within targeted host cells (2Baum J. Gilberger T.W. Frischknecht F. Meissner M. Trends Parasitol. 2008; 24: 557-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S.

The parasite's unique mechanism of gliding motility is powered by an Apicomplexan-specific motor complex termed the actin-myosin motor (5Keeley A. Soldati D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 528-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which resides between the outer plasma membrane and inner membrane complex (IMC) 4The abbreviations used are:IMCinner membrane complexDRMdetergent-resistant membraneHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRIPAradioimmune precipitation assaybis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolmAbmonoclonal antibodyChFPcherry fluorescent proteinDSPdithiobis succinimidyl propionateIMPintramembranous particleALValveolinGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositol. (6Soldati D. Meissner M. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The IMC is a continuous patchwork of flattened vesicular cisternae located directly beneath the plasma membrane and overlying the cytoskeletal network (7Bergman L.W. Kaiser K. Fujioka H. Coppens I.

Mitchell G.H. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1831-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IMC appears to arise from Golgi-associated vesicles flattened during parasite maturation to form large membranous sheets, which envelope the parasite and leave only a small gap at the extreme parasite apex (9Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Fowler R.E. Krishna S. Mitchell G.H.

The myosin component of the actin-myosin motor has previously been defined as a tetrameric complex consisting of a class XIV myosin termed Myo-A (10Pinder J. Fowler R. Bannister L. Dluzewski A. Mitchell G.H. Parasitol Today. 2000; 16: 240-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a myosin tail interacting protein (also called myosin light chain) (7Bergman L.W. Kaiser K. Fujioka H. Coppens I. Daly T.M. Fox S. Matuschewski K. Nussenzweig V. Kappe S.H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the two glideosome-associated proteins GAP45 and GAP50 (11Gaskins E. Gilk S. DeVore N. Mann T. Ward G. Beckers C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These motor components are linked to the outer IMC membrane via the membrane proteins GAP45/50 (11Gaskins E. Gilk S. DeVore N. Mann T. Ward G. Beckers C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Between the plasma membrane and the IMC are actin filaments held in place through aldolase-mediated contact with the C-terminal tails of plasma membrane-spanning adhesive proteins whose ectodomains bind substrate and host cells (2Baum J. Gilberger T.W. Frischknecht F. Meissner M. Trends Parasitol. 2008; 24: 557-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To power the forward movement of apicomplexan zoite stages, myosin pulls the actin filaments and their attached adhesins rearward. For this to succeed the GAP-myosin complex must presumably be fixed to the IMC, possibly via interactions with unidentified proteins linking the motor to the underlying cytoskeleton. Studies of fluorescently tagged GAP50 confirm it is relatively immobile within the IMC, however attempts to identify potential anchoring proteins have not been successful and have instead indicated that GAP50 may be immobilized by the lipid-raft like properties of the IMC membranes (12Johnson T.M. Rajfur Z. Jacobson K. Beckers C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The actin-myosin complex is confined to the outer IMC membrane while the opposing innermost IMC membrane is studded with 9 nm intramembranous particles, revealed by electron microscopy of freeze fractured Toxoplasma tachyzoites and Plasmodium ookinetes (13Morrissette N.S. Murray J.M. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Raibaud A. Lupetti P. Paul R.E. Mercati D. Brey P.T. Sinden R.E. Heuser J.E. Dallai R. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The size of these particles suggests that the proteins involved are likely to form high molecular weight complexes that overlay the parasite's cytoskeletal network and possibly anchor the IMC to the cytoskeleton (12Johnson T.M. Rajfur Z. Jacobson K. Beckers C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Morrissette N.S. Murray J.M. Roos D.S. J.

Due to the close apposition of the inner and outer IMC membranes (14Raibaud A. Lupetti P. Paul R.E. Mercati D. Brey P.T. Sinden R.E. Heuser J.E. Dallai R. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Pomel S. Luk F.C. Beckers C.J. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000188Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it is possible that the intramembranous particles could bridge the IMC lumen and interact with the GAP-myosin complex contributing to its stabilization within the IMC. To identify putative proteins that might be components of the intramembranous particles, we examined data from the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) proteome of schizont-stage P. falciparum parasites containing developing merozoites (17Sanders P.R. Gilson P.R. Cantin G.T. Greenbaum D.C. Nebl T. Carucci D.J. McConville M.J. Schofield L. Hodder A.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Crabb B.S. J. Biol.

Crabb B.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 154: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DRMs, or lipid-rafts, were of considerable interest, because they appeared to harbor proteins involved in host cell invasion such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored merozoite surface proteins. Our data also indicated that P. falciparum schizont-stage DRMs contained the IMC proteins PfGAP45/50 (17Sanders P.R. Gilson P.R. Cantin G.T. Greenbaum D.C. Nebl T. Carucci D.J. McConville M.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 40169-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and recent studies in T. gondii have also suggested that the IMC is enriched in DRMs (12Johnson T.M. Rajfur Z. Jacobson K. Beckers C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another study indicated that when P. falciparum DRM protein complexes were separated by blue native gel electrophoresis, a band was produced containing PfGAP45/50 and PfMyo-A as well as a novel six-pass transmembrane protein (PlasmoDB: PFD1110w, GenBankTM: CAD49269) (18Sanders P.R. Cantin G.T. Greenbaum D.C. Gilson P.R. Nebl T. Moritz R.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hodder A.N. Crabb B.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 154: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This protein was related to another six-pass transmembrane DRM protein (PlasmoDB: MAL13P1.130, GenBankTM: CAD52385) we had previously identified in P. falciparum schizont-stage DRMs (17Sanders P.R. Gilson P.R. Cantin G.T. Greenbaum D.C. Nebl T. Carucci D.J. McConville M.J. Schofield L. Hodder A.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Crabb B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40169-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We show here that MAL13P1.130 and PFD1110w, termed PfGAPM1 and PfGAPM2 (glideosome-associated protein with multiple-membrane spans), respectively, belong to a family of proteins specific to the Apicomplexa and demonstrate that P. falciparum GAPM proteins, and their orthologues in T. gondii, localize to the parasite IMC. The GAPMs form high molecular weight complexes that are resistant to dissociation and solubilization by a variety of common detergents and could therefore be components of the intramembranous particles seen in electron microscopy. When isolated by immunoprecipitation, the GAPM complexes co-purify with components of the actin-myosin motor and particularly the parasite cytoskeletal network suggesting GAPMs could anchor the IMC to the cytoskeleton and perhaps even play a role in tethering the motor to cytoskeleton. Orthologues of PfGAPM1, -2, and -3 were identified by BLASTP searches (E-value <0.01) of the following databases; NCBI Non-Redundant data base, PlasmoDB, GeneDB, and OrthoMclDB and are listed in supplemental Table S1. The GAPM proteins were aligned with MUSCLE (19Edgar R.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5912) Google Scholar), evolutionary distances were estimated under the JTT model, and neighbor joining trees were constructed with Phylip (J. Felsenstein, Phylogeny Inference Package version 3.6, Dept. of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle). Bootstrap support was also calculated. gapm genes were PCR-amplified using cDNA extracted from either strain 3D7 P. falciparum parasites or strain RH T. gondii parasites (primers listed in supplemental Table S2). Products were ligated into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega) and were verified by sequencing. The P. falciparum gapm genes were then excised with PstI and ligated into the PstI site of a modified version of pTGFP-GPI (20Gilson P.R. O'Donnell R.A. Nebl T. Sanders P.R. Wickham M.E.

Tggapm1a, Tggapm2b, and Tggapm3 were excised from pGEM T-easy with BglII and AvrII and ligated into pCTCh3H to create a gene fusion with mCherry and the triple HA epitope called pTggapm1/2/3-ChFP-HA (supplemental Fig. S2). pCTCh3H is a derivative of pCTG in which GFP has been replaced with the mCherry/HA fusion (22van Dooren G.G.

P. falciparum strain 3D7 parasites were transfected with either 100 μg of pPfGAPM1/2/3-HA or pPfGAPM1/2/3-GFP and cultured continuously (23Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected with 10 nm WR99210 (24Crabb B.S. Rug M. Gilberger T.W. Thompson J.K. Triglia T. Maier A.G. Cowman A.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 270: 263-276PubMed Google Scholar). T. gondii strain-RH parasites were transfected with pTgGAPM1/2/3-ChFP-HA plasmids using standard conditions (25Striepen B. He C.Y. Matrajt M. Soldati D. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and cultured in human foreskin fibroblasts and vero cells. Addition of 20 μm chloramphenicol to cultures permitted selection of stable transgenic parasites. Schizont stage P. falciparum parasites were treated with 0.15% saponin in RPMI media to release hemoglobin from the red blood cells. The hemoglobin was removed by washing the parasite pellet three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Parasites were solubilized at room temperature for 10 min in either 1% Triton X-100, RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, in phosphate-buffered saline), 2% SDS, or two-dimensional sample buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% ASB-14). Soluble proteins were separated from the insoluble by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. A portion of the soluble fractions as well as the insoluble pellet fractions (washed in phosphate-buffered saline) were incubated in two-dimensional sample buffer overnight at room temperature to further extract the GAPMs. Prior to electrophoresis protein samples were mixed with reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 1× concentration (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol). Samples not containing urea were heated at 80 °C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE. T. gondii tachyzoites were solubilized by sonication in RIPA buffer and soluble fractions were subsequently treated with either reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer or reducing two-dimensional sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed in pre-cast 4–12% acrylamide gradient bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride prior to probing with specific primary antibodies; mouse anti-HA (mAb 12CA5) (1:500), rabbit anti-ALV repeat (ARILKPLIQEKIVEIMKPEIEEKIIEVPQVQYIEKLVEVPHVILQEKLIHIPKPVIHERIKKCSKTIFQEKIVEVPQIKVVDKIVEVPQYVYQEKIIEVPKIMVQERIIPVPKKIVKEKIVEIPQIELKNIDIEKVQEIPEYIPE, 1:100), rabbit anti-GFP (a gift from Emanuella Handman, 1:500), rabbit anti-PfGAP45 (1:200) (26Baum J.

Bound antibody probes were detected with LiCor Odyssey infrared imager. Live cell microscopy was performed on P. falciparum transfectants expressing PfGAPM1/2-GFP and T. gondii RH-strain transfectants expressing TgGAPM1/2/3-ChFP-HA stained with 1 mm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For immunofluorescence microscopy, PfGAPM1/3-HA parasites were fixed in either ice-cold acetone/methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde and probed with the following primary antibody combinations; mouse anti-HA (mAb 12CA5, 1:50) and either rabbit anti-GAP45 (1:50) (26Baum J. Richard D. Healer J. Rug M. Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Green J.L. Holder A.A. Cowman A.F. J. Biol.

Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 568 nm goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 488 nm goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Molecular Probes). TgGAPM-ChFP-HA transfectants were treated with Clostridium septicum α-toxin as previously described (27Wichroski M.J. Melton J.A. Donahue C.G. Tweten R.K. Ward G.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4353-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Treated parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and probed with mouse anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (1:200) and rabbit anti-SAG1 (1:200) (a gift from David Sibley). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, saponin-lysed PfGAPM1-HA, PfGAPM2-GFP, PfGAPM3-HA, and control 3D7 parasites as well as TgGAPM1/2/3-HA-ChFP and control RH strain parasites (100 μl pellets), were solubilized by sonication in RIPA buffer (2 ml) with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Insoluble material was pelleted, and either goat-polyclonal anti-HA agarose beads (AbCam, 50–100 μl) or rat anti-GFP-agarose beads (Medical and Biological Laboratories, 50–100 μl) were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3–4 h. For immunoprecipitation assays with parasite-specific antibodies, soluble 1% Triton X-100 lysates of the PfGAPM1-HA, PfGAPM2-GFP, and PfGAPM3-HA parasites were prepared as described above. Rabbit anti-PfGAP45 (10 μl) or rabbit anti-ALV repeat (10 μl) was added to the lysate for 16 h at 4 °C. Sheep anti-rabbit Dynal beads (Invitrogen) were added to the lysates, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Bound proteins were eluted, reduced in two-dimensional sample buffer or 2% SDS, and analyzed by Western blotting as described as above. Saponin-lysed P. falciparum PfGAPM1-HA, PfGAPM2-GFP, or PfGAPM3-HA schizont stage parasites were prepared as described above (∼20-μl pellets) and resuspended in 0.4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm dithiobis succinimidyl propionate for 30 min. Cross-linkers were later quenched in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Cross-linked pellets were resuspended in two-dimensional sample buffer, and soluble fractions were subsequently either reduced (addition of 100 mm dithiothreitol) or left non-reduced. Two hypothetical proteins PfGAPM1 (MAL13P1.130) and PfGAPM2 (PFD1110w), with six transmembrane domains were previously identified in DRMs extracted from developing P. falciparum schizont/merozoite lysates (17Sanders P.R. Gilson P.R. Cantin G.T. Greenbaum D.C. Nebl T. Carucci D.J. McConville M.J. Schofield L. Hodder A.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Crabb B.S. J. Biol.

Alignment of the amino acid sequences of these proteins revealed a low to moderate degree of similarity (29.9% similar and 18.1% identical) (Fig. 1A). Sequence similarity searches of the Plasmodium genome data base (28Aurrecoechea C. Brestelli J. Brunk B.P. Dommer J. Fischer S. Gajria B. Gao X. Gingle A. Grant G. Harb O.S. Heiges M. Innamorato F. Iodice J. Kissinger J.C. Kraemer E. Li W. Miller J.A. Nayak V. Pennington C. Pinney D.F. Roos D.S. Ross C. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Treatman C. Wang H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D539-D543Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) indicated that P. falciparum encoded an additional member of the family termed PfGAPM3 (PlasmoDB: PF14_0065, GenBankTM: AAN36677). All three proteins were predicted by TMHMM (29Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9080) Google Scholar) to have six transmembrane domains with the N- and C-terminal tails and loops 2 and 4 facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane for the GAPM1 and -2 and the opposite orientation for GAPM3 (Fig. 1B). Subsequent searches of the Apicomplexan genome data base (30Aurrecoechea C. Heiges M. Wang H. Wang Z. Fischer S. Rhodes P. Miller J. Kraemer E. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Roos D.S. Kissinger J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D427-D430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) revealed that most other Apicomplexan genomes also encode three of the GAPM proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of their sequences indicated that each of these proteins falls into one of three distinct orthologous groups, which we have called GAPM1, GAPM2, and GAPM3 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, T. gondii encodes five GAPMs, two each in groups GAPM1 (TgGAPM1a and TgGAPM1b; GenBankTM: EEB00395 and EEB00396) and GAPM2 (TgGAPM2a and TgGAPM2b; GenBankTM: EEB03551 and EEB00710) and one GAPM3 protein (TgGAPM3; GenBankTM: EEA98700) (Fig. 1). Protein similarity searches of GenBankTM revealed no other obvious homologs of the GAPM family outside the Apicomplexan phylum. GAPM sequence alignment revealed interesting patterns of amino acid conservation across the entire GAPM family as well as within the three groups (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Inspection of the residues forming the five short loops separating the six transmembrane domains reveals that loops two and four are highly conserved across all Apicomplexa. Comparatively, loops 1, 3, and 5 are less conserved. Such a high level of conservation in loops 2 and 4 suggests that these residues may assist in maintaining overall GAPM integrity or facilitating interactions with other proteins. Interestingly, the N and C termini appear to be highly conserved within but not between each of the three GAPM groups and may potentially determine group specific functions. To facilitate fluorescent and immunodetection of GAPMs in the absence of antibodies to the endogenous proteins, members from each of the three groups in both P. falciparum and T. gondii were tagged at their C terminus with either green fluorescent protein (GFP), cherry fluorescent protein (ChFP) (31Giepmans B.N. Adams S.R. Ellisman M.H. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2006; 312: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar) and/or a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA). For tagging the GAPMs in P. falciparum, cDNA sequences were ligated in front and in-frame with the sequences of GFP or a double HA tag. The gene fusions were inserted into a modified version of the pTGFP-GPI plasmid (21Meissner M. Krejany E. Gilson P.R. de Koning-Ward T.F. Soldati D. Crabb B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2980-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). In this plasmid system the expression of gene fusions can be suppressed by the addition of the tetracycline analogue anhydrotetracycline and induced by removing the drug. Once induced, the gene fusions come under transcriptional control of a transactivator protein (TATi2) whose expression is in turn regulated by a schizont blood stage merozoite surface protein 2 promoter (20Gilson P.R. O'Donnell R.A. Nebl T. Sanders P.R. Wickham M.E. McElwain T.F. de Koning-Ward T.F. Crabb B.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Meissner M. Krejany E.

Examination of the microarray gene transcription profile of the Pfgapms confirmed the endogenous genes were also expressed during schizogony (32Bozdech Z. Llinás M. Pulliam B.L. Wong E.D. Zhu J. DeRisi J.L. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 33Le Roch K.G. Johnson J.R. Florens L. Zhou Y. Santrosyan A. Grainger M. Yan S.F. Williamson K.C. Holder A.A. Carucci D.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Winzeler E.A. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2308-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Once parasite lines transfected with the Pfgapm gene fusion plasmids were established, anhydrotetracycline was removed and those expressing the GFP fusion proteins were examined by microscopy. GFP fluorescence was only observed for the PfGAPM1-GFP and PfGAPM2-GFP fusions and initially only in a low percentage of schizont and merozoite stage parasites. Over several weeks however, this percentage increased greatly even in the presence of anhydrotetracycline, which should have silenced expression. This indicated that the plasmids containing the PfGAPM-GFP fusion may have recombined into the Pfgapm chromosomal locus tagging the endogenous gene with GFP. Southern blot analysis of PfGAMP2-GFP parasites confirmed this (supplemental Fig. S2). The PfGAPM1-GFP parasites grew poorly and no further work was done with this line. Our attention instead turned to the HA-tagged PfGAPM transfectants. These were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy with a HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5 mAb; used for all subsequent experiments) after several weeks in culture. Most schizont/merozoites expressed the PfGAPM1-HA fusion protein and Southern blot analysis also confirmed integration into the endogenous locus (supplemental Fig. S2). PfGAPM3-HA-expressing parasites were similarly produced, but integration was not confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Although transfected lines containing the PfGAPM2-HA and PfGAPM3-GFP plasmids were generated, the resultant lines did not express detectable levels of fusion proteins possibly due to some unforeseen deleterious effects. To determine in which cellular membrane the GAPMs resided, P. falciparum schizonts were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In Plasmodium asexual blood stages, cell replication occurs by schizogony where several rounds of nuclear division and associated organelle development occur within a common cytoplasm bound by a single plasma membrane. Daughter merozoites are formed late in schizogony when cytokinesis pinches off the individual merozoites. We microscopically examined immature PfGAPM1-HA and PfGAPM3-HA transgenic schizonts, because the multiple forming IMCs are distinct from the single bounding plasma membrane. Parasites were labeled with anti-HA and either the IMC-specific PfGAP45 rabbit antibody or parasite plasma membrane-specific rabbit antibody for the C-terminal domain of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP119). The localization pattern of PfGAPM1-HA and PfGAPM3-HA was indistinguishable from that of PfGAP45 and markedly distinct from that of known plasma membrane protein MSP1 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S4). Additionally, live fluorescence microscopy of PfGAPM1-GFP and PfGAPM2-GFP transgenic schizonts demonstrated an identical IMC expression pattern to that of PfGAPM1-HA and PfGAPM3-HA throughout schizogony and a developmental series of images is shown in supplemental Fig. S3.

https://openalex.org/W2163273578,"The role of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2) in regulating cartilage-specific gene expression was explored in primary human chondrocytes. HDAC1 and HDAC2 protein levels were elevated in chondrocytes from osteoarthritic patients, consistent with a down-regulation of some cartilage marker genes. When expressed in these cells, HDAC1 and HDAC2 repressed aggrecan and collagen 2(α1) expression but differed in their repression of collagen 9(α1), collagen 11(α1), dermatopontin, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). To identify the basis of these differences between HDAC1 and HDAC2, their carboxy-terminal domains (CTDs) were deleted, which led to proteins that retained enzymatic activity but were unable to repress cartilage gene expression. Further, exchange of the CTDs between HDAC1 and HDAC2 led to proteins that were enzymatically active but displayed altered target gene specificity, indicating that these CTDs can function independently of HDAC enzymatic activity, to target the HDACs to specific genes. The Snail transcription factor was identified as a mediator of HDAC1 and HDAC2 repression of the collagen 2(α1) gene, via its interaction with the HDAC1 and 2 CTDs. The data indicate that the CTD serves a novel function within HDAC1 and HDAC2, to mediate repression of cartilage-specific gene expression in human chondrocytes.—Hong, S., Derfoul, A., Pereira-Mouries, L., Hall, D.

https://openalex.org/W2000248995,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is the second most common malignant neoplasm of the salivary glands. Most patients survive more than 5 years after surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. The 10 year survival rate, however, drops to 40%, due to locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. Improving long-term survival in ACC requires the development of more effective systemic therapies based on a better understanding of the biologic behavior of ACC. Much preclinical research in this field involves the use of cultured cells and, to date, several ACC cell lines have been established. Authentication of these cell lines, however, has not been reported. We performed DNA fingerprint analysis on six ACC cell lines using short tandem repeat (STR) examinations and found that all six cell lines had been contaminated with other cells. ACC2, ACC3, and ACCM were determined to be cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells), whereas the ACCS cell line was composed of T24 urinary bladder cancer cells. ACCNS and CAC2 cells were contaminated with cells derived from non-human mammalian species: the cells labeled ACCNS were mouse cells and the CAC2 cells were rat cells. These observations suggest that future studies using ACC cell lines should include cell line authentication to avoid the use of contaminated or non-human cells."

https://openalex.org/W1987841256,"The orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR109B is the result of a recent gene duplication of the nicotinic acid and ketone body receptor GPR109A being found in humans but not in rodents. Like GPR109A, GPR109B is predominantly expressed in adipocytes and is supposed to mediate antilipolytic effects. Here we show that GPR109B serves as a receptor for the beta-oxidation intermediate 3-OH-octanoic acid, which has antilipolytic activity on human but not on murine adipocytes. GPR109B is coupled to Gi-type G-proteins and is activated by 2- and 3-OH-octanoic acid with EC50 values of about 4 and 8 microM, respectively. Interestingly, 3-OH-octanoic acid plasma concentrations reach micromolar concentrations under conditions of increased beta-oxidation rates, like in diabetic ketoacidosis or under a ketogenic diet. These data suggest that the ligand receptor pair 3-OH-octanoic acid/GPR109B mediates in humans a negative feedback regulation of adipocyte lipolysis to counteract prolipolytic influences under conditions of physiological or pathological increases in beta-oxidation rates."
https://openalex.org/W1970961598,"Wnt signaling plays important roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. The pathway that leads to β-catenin stabilization is initiated by Wnt binding to its cell surface receptors, which induces the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) via activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) type I. Here, we show that Wnt also stimulated the production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), which depended on Frizzled (Fz), Dishevelled (Dvl), and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) type IIα in HEK293T cells. Dvl directly interacted with and activated PI4KIIα by increasing its Vmax for ATP and PtdIns. In addition, Dvl regulated PI4KIIα and PIP5KI via different domains. Moreover, Dvl, PI4KIIα, and PIP5KI appeared to form a ternary complex upon Wnt3a stimulation. This complex may allow efficient production of PtdIns(4,5)P2 from PtdIns, which is far more abundant than PtdIns(4)P in cells.

Studies using Drosophila and Xenopus embryos as well as mammalian cells have established a canonical Wnt signaling pathway that leads to stabilization of β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt, a number of proteins, including Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase 1 (CK1), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), 3The abbreviations used are: GSK3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βLRPlipoprotein receptor-related proteinPtdIns(4,5)P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin. form a complex that facilitates β-catenin phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3β.

We recently showed that Wnt3a stimulated the production of PtdIns (4,5)P2, which in turn regulated the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 at Thr1479 and Ser1490 (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y.

We also showed that Wnt3a regulated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I (PIP5KI) activity by inducing the interaction between Dvl and PIP5KI (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y.

Moreover, Dvl could directly stimulate the lipid kinase activity of PIP5KI (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 plays important roles in various cellular functions, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, migration, ion channel activation, and signal transduction (13Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). It, however, represents less than 1% of plasma membrane phospholipids and is primarily synthesized in most cells by sequential phosphorylation of PtdIns on the D4 and D5 positions of the inositol ring by two PtdIns kinases, PI4K and PIP5KI, respectively (14Clarke J.H. Richardson J.P. Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2007; 74: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Michell R.H. Nat. Rev. 2008; 9: 151-161Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). While PtdIns(4)P, the substrate for PIP5KI, is also accounted for around 1% of plasma membrane phospholipids, PtdIns, the substrate for PI4K, is very abundant. Thus, Wnt3a may have to stimulate PI4K activity to provide enough substrate for PIP5KI in PtdIns(4,5)P2 production. Two types of PI4K (PI4KI and PI4KII) have been characterized in mammalian cells. There are two isoforms of PI4KII (PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ) and two isoforms of PI4KI (PI4KIα and PI4KIβ) (16De Matteis M.A. Di Campli A. Godi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we demonstrated the involvement of PI4KIIα in Wnt signaling. siRNA-mediated knockdown in mammalian cells and morpholino-mediated suppression in Xenopus embryos of PI4KIIα inhibited LRP6 phosphorylation and Wnt signaling. In this report, we examined whether Wnt3a regulates the lipid kinase activity of PI4KIIα and found that Wnt3a could induce an increase in the level of PtdIns(4)P in a Dvl- and Fz-dependent manner. In addition, the Dvl protein was found to directly interact with and activate PI4KIIα. Moreover, different domains of Dvl appeared to be involved in the regulation of PI4KIIα and PIP5KI, and Wnt3a induced the formation of a complex of Dvl, PI4KIIα, and PIP5KI possibly for more efficient production of PtdIns (4,5)P2 in cells. Human PI4KIIα and PIP5KIβ cDNAs were subcloned into CMV promoter-based mammalian cell expression vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids for Dvl and its mutants have previously been described (17Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D.

Mouse anti-Dvl3 antibodies were kindly provided by D. Sussman. Rabbit anti-PI4KIIα antibody has previously been described (18Guo J. Wenk M.R. Pellegrini L. Onofri F. Benfenati F. De Camilli P. Proc.

Rabbit anti-PIP5KIβ (Abgent), mouse anti-Flag, mouse anti-HA, mouse anti-Myc, and mouse anti-His (Covance) antibodies were acquired commercially. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine Plus or with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LacZ plasmid was added to make the total amount of DNA equals 0.25 μg/well in a 24-well plate. For transfection of siRNAs, cells were transfected with 10 pmol/well siRNAs, the total amounts remained same when siRNA mixtures were used. Lipid extraction was carried out as previously described (19Irie F. Okuno M. Pasquale E.B. Yamaguchi Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 3.75 volumes of methanol/chloroform/HCl (40:20:1) mixture on ice, followed with 1 volume of chloroform and 2.25 volumes of water. After vortexing for 1 min, samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C, and the lower organic phase was collected and dried under a nitrogen stream.

The microplate was incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, followed by a mouse anti-PtdIns(4)P IgM antibody (Echelon Biosciences Inc.) for 1 h and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 25 min. The microplate was washed three times with PBS and added with chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). The luminescence intensity was determined by a luminometer. For overexpression assays, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs for 24 h. Coimmunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (17Li L. Yuan H.

For the in vitro pull-down assay, recombinant proteins were incubated in 250 μl of binding buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 3 h at 4 °C. After the proteins were captured by glutathione beads, the pull-down complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. For the kinase assay, proteins were incubated in the kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were then incubated with 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, 50 μm cold ATP, 20 μg of PtdIns (Echelon Biosciences Inc.) vesicle for 15 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding the lipid extraction solution as described above. Lipids were separated by TLC, visualized, and quantified by a phosphoimager. We previously demonstrated that treatment of HEK293T cells with Wnt3a resulted in an increase in the cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 content using an ELISA (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether Wnt3a treatment could change the level of PtdIns(4)P in cells using an ELISA with an antibody specific to PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 1A). Treatment of HEK293T cells with 50 ng/ml Wnt3a increased PtdIns(4)P contents by more than 70% compared with those in mock-treated cells (Fig. 1A). There are four PtdIns 4-kinases in mammalian cells that catalyze the production of PtdIns(4)P from PtdIns (22Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that knocking down of PI4KIIα, but not any of the other three PtdIns 4-kinases, inhibited Wnt3a-induced β-catenin accumulation, LRP6 phosphorylation, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation in HEK293T cells (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that PI4KIIα could be involved in Wnt3a-induced PtdIns(4)P accumulation in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we transfected cells with the PI4KIIα siRNA and found that it abolished Wnt3a-induced formation of PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that Wnt3a-induced PtdIns(4)P formation depends on PI4KIIα in these cells. Because Fz and Dvl are required for Wnt3a-induced accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we examined whether they were also involved in PtdIns(4)P formation. In the previous study we have shown that transfection of a mixture of siRNAs targeting Dvl1–3 or Fz2/4/5 was able to inhibit Wnt3a-induced PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We tested the same mixtures of the siRNAs and found that they could also inhibit Wnt3a-induced production of PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that Fz and Dvl are also required for Wnt3a-indcued PtdIns(4)P formation in these cells. Because both Dvl and PI4KIIα are required for Wnt3a-induced PtdIns(4)P formation, we tested whether Dvl may interact with and activate PI4KIIα as it did with PIP5KI (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We first tested whether Dvl could interact with PI4KIIα using coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293T expressing Flag-Dvl1 and HA-PI4KIIα and found that these two proteins coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether PI4KIIα could directly interact with Dvl, we carried out a pull-down assay using recombinant proteins prepared in Escherichia coli., and found that GST-tagged Dvl1, but not GST, interacted with His-tagged PI4KIIα (Fig. 2C). It seems that N-terminal 92 amino acids of PI4KIIα are not required for the interaction (Fig. 2D). Knowing that purified recombinant Dvl3 protein could stimulate the PIP5KI lipid kinase activity (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we tested whether recombinant Dvl3 protein could also stimulate the lipid kinase activity of recombinant PI4KIIα prepared from E. coli. In an in vitro kinase assay, we found that recombinant Dvl3 protein was able to stimulate PI4KIIα activity by ∼2.5 fold (Fig. 3A), and recombinant Dvl1 could also stimulate its activity (data not shown). We further characterized the activation of PI4KIIα by Dvl3 by determining the Km and Vmax values of PI4KIIα for its substrates, PtdIns and ATP, in the presence or absence of Dvl3. Using GST protein as a control, Dvl3 increased the Vmax values for both substrates by at least 2-fold without significantly changing the Km values (Fig. 3, B and C and supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that Dvl accelerates the rate of phosphorylation reaction, but does not significantly alter the affinities of PI4KIIα for its substrates. The Dvl proteins are composed of three highly conserved domains: an N-terminal DIX, a PDZ, and a C-terminal DEP domain (Fig. 4A). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that both PDZ and DEP domains could interact with PI4KIIα (Fig. 4B), and these interactions were direct because purified recombinant proteins interacted in in vitro pull-down assays (Fig. 4C). Although the PDZ domain appeared to have a higher affinity than the DEP domain for PI4KIIα (Fig. 4, B and C), the DEP protein, but not PDZ protein, stimulated the lipid kinase activity of PI4KIIα in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4D). A titration experiment revealed that close to 8 times more DEP protein than the full-length Dvl protein was needed to achieve the same level of PI4KIIα activation as the full length (Fig. 4E). We interpret these results to suggest that the interaction between DEP and PI4KIIα is involved in activating the kinase, whereas the PDZ and PI4KIIα interaction may contribute to the affinity of Dvl for PI4KIIα. Although Dvl DEP appears to be responsible for PI4KIIα activation, it had little effect on activation of PIP5KIβ (Fig. 4F). The N-terminal DIX domain seems to be primarily responsible for activation of PIP5KIβ (Fig. 4F). While Dvl PDZ was able to bind to both PI4KIIα and PIP5KIβ (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y.

Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), PI4KIIα and PIP5KIβ did not appear to compete for Dvl binding. In a coimmunoprecipitation experiment, more rather than less PI4KIIα and PIP5PIβ proteins were pulled down with Dvl in cells coexpressing Dvl, PIP5KIβ, and PI4KIIα than those coexpressing Dvl and PI4KIIα or PIP5KIβ (Fig. 5A). One possible explanation to the enhanced interactions is that PI4KIIα may interact with PIP5KIβ. When these two proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells, they coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S2A). The interaction between these two proteins appeared to be direct, because purified recombinant proteins of PI4KIIα and PIP5KIβ interacted in an in vitro pull-down assay (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). Consistent with the non-competitive nature of these interactions, expression of Dvl did not reduce, but rather increased, the amount of PI4KIIα pulled down by PIP5KIβ (supplemental Fig. S2D). Next, we wanted to know whether Wnt3a stimulation regulates these interactions. To do this, we need to examine the interactions using proteins that are expressed at near endogenous levels. Antibodies specific for PI4KIIα, PIP5KIβ, and Dvl were not suitable for immunoprecipitation. To circumvent this difficulty, we established a HEK293 cell line that stably expressed PI4KIIα carrying seven HA tags at a level that is lower than that of endogenous PI4KIIα (compare the upper bands with the lower bands in the second left panel of Fig. 5C). The seven HA tags markedly increases immunoprecipitation efficiency. In the immunocomplexes pulled down by anti-HA antibodies, we detected a low level of PIP5KIβ, but not Dvl (Fig. 5C). However, when the cells were treated with Wnt3a, Dvl3 was readily detected (Fig. 5C). In addition, an increased amount of PIP5KIβ was detected (Fig. 5C). All of these results together indicate that Wnt3a is able to induce the binding of Dvl to the PIP5KIβ and PI4KIIα complex, leading to more stable interaction between PIP5KIβ and PI4KIIα. In this report, we describe our findings that Wnt3a stimulates the production of PtdIns(4)P via one of the PI4Ks, namely PI4KIIα in HEK293 cells. It is likely that the same PI4K is also regulated by Wnt in Xenopus embryos because its suppression by morpholino oligos inhibited Wnt signaling in the embryos (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In overexpression systems, we found that Dvl could also interact with PI4KIIβ (data not shown). In our previous studies, we presented evidence to indicate that Dvl regulates all of the three PIP5KI isoforms even though PIP5KIβ appeared to be the major isoform in HEK293T cells (12Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. Abrams C.S. Sokol S.Y. Wu D. Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The lack of significant effects of siRNAs to other PIP5KI or PI4K isoforms on Wnt signaling in these cells may be due to their expression levels or subcellular localization. In HEK293 cells, Wnt3a appears to regulate PI4KIIα via Fz and Dvl, probably through its activation by Dvl. It is intriguing and logical for Dvl to directly stimulate both PI4K and PIP5K, both of which constitute the major pathway for PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis in cells. Given that PtdIns(4)P (the substrate of PIP5KI) is as scarce as PtdIns(4,5)P2 (the product of PIP5KI), activation of PI4K would allow Wnt to utilize PtdIns, a more abundant source of substrate on the plasma membrane, for rapid production of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Although we have not visualized the ternary complex of endogenous Dvl, PI4KIIα and PIP5KI proteins, the evidence presented in Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S2 suggests that these three proteins are most likely to form a complex. It is also reasonable to postulate that this complex would allow more efficient production of PtdIns(4,5)P2 since PtdIns(4), the product of PI4KIIα, would not have to diffuse far before it is used by PIP5KI to produce PtdIns(4,5)P2 as depicted in Fig. 5D. Therefore, this study provides further insights into the regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 production by Wnt and Dvl.

Here, we report that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor phosphatidyl-myo-inositol hexamannosides PIM(6) or PIM(2) exert potent anti-inflammatory activities. PIM strongly inhibited the Toll-like receptor (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88)-mediated release of NO, cytokines, and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 12 (IL-12) p40, IL-6, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, and also IL-10 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. This effect was independent of the presence of TLR2. PIM also reduced the LPS-induced MyD88-independent, TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon beta (TRIF)-mediated expression of co-stimulatory receptors. PIM inhibited LPS/TLR4-induced NFkappaB translocation. Synthetic PIM(1) and a PIM(2) mimetic recapitulated these in vitro activities and inhibited endotoxin-induced airway inflammation, TNF and keratinocyte-derived chemokine secretion, and neutrophil recruitment in vivo. Mannosyl, two acyl chains, and phosphatidyl residues are essential for PIM anti-inflammatory activity, whereas the inosityl moiety is dispensable. Therefore, PIM exert potent antiinflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo that may contribute to the strategy developed by mycobacteria for repressing the host innate immunity, and synthetic PIM analogs represent powerful anti-inflammatory leads."

Although mitochondrial iron does not normally bind SOD2, iron will misincorporate into Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sod2p when cells are starved for manganese or when mitochondrial iron homeostasis is disrupted by mutations in yeast grx5, ssq1, and mtm1. We report here that such changes in mitochondrial manganese and iron similarly affect cofactor selection in a heterologously expressed Escherichia coli Mn-SOD, but not a highly homologous Fe-SOD. By x-ray absorption near edge structure and extended x-ray absorption fine structure analyses of isolated mitochondria, we find that misincorporation of iron into yeast Sod2p does not correlate with significant changes in the average oxidation state or coordination chemistry of bulk mitochondrial iron. Instead, small changes in mitochondrial iron are likely to promote iron-SOD2 interactions. Iron binds Sod2p in yeast mutants blocking late stages of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (grx5, ssq1, and atm1), but not in mutants defective in the upstream Isu proteins that serve as scaffolds for iron-sulfur biosynthesis. In fact, we observed a requirement for the Isu proteins in iron inactivation of yeast Sod2p. Sod2p activity was restored in mtm1 and grx5 mutants by depleting cells of Isu proteins or using a dominant negative Isu1p predicted to stabilize iron binding to Isu1p. In all cases where disruptions in iron homeostasis inactivated Sod2p, we observed an increase in mitochondrial Isu proteins.

These studies indicate that the Isu proteins and the iron-sulfur pathway can donate iron to Sod2p. Metal-containing enzymes are generally quite specific for their cognate cofactor. Misincorporation of the wrong metal ion can be deleterious and tends to be a rare occurrence in biology. A prime example of metal ion selectivity is illustrated by the family of manganese- and iron-containing superoxide dismutases (SODs) 3The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseXANESx-ray absorption near edge structureEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structureBPSbathophenanthrolinedisulfonateWTwild typeKDknockdown. 3The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseXANESx-ray absorption near edge structureEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structureBPSbathophenanthrolinedisulfonateWTwild typeKDknockdown.. This large family of enzymes utilizes either manganese or iron as cofactors to scavenge superoxide anion. The iron- and manganese-containing forms are highly homologous to one another at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels and have virtually identical metal binding and catalytic sites (1Wintjens R.

Misincorporation of iron into Mn-SOD or vice versa alters the redox potential of the enzyme's active site and prohibits superoxide disproportionation (4Vance C.K. Miller A.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 461-467Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Vance C.K. Miller A.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13079-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, misincorporation of iron into Mn-SOD does occur in vivo (6Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yang M.

The isolated Mn-SOD from Escherichia coli is found as a mixture of manganese- and iron-bound forms (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); binding of manganese is favored under oxidative stress, whereas iron binding is increased under anaerobic conditions (3Whittaker J.W.

Unlike bacteria that co-express Mn- and Fe-SOD molecules in the same cell, eukaryotic mitochondria generally harbor only one member of the Fe/Mn-SOD family, a tetrameric Mn-SOD typically known as SOD2 (9Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some organisms, SOD2 is essential for survival (10Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright Jr., J.

Using a yeast model system, we have shown previously that metal ion mis-incorporation can occur with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sod2p (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Specifically, iron binds and inactivates yeast Sod2p when cells are either starved for manganese or have certain disruptions in mitochondrial iron homeostasis. These disruptions include mutations in MTM1, a mitochondrial carrier protein that functions in iron metabolism (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We proposed that these disruptions lead to expansion of a mitochondrial pool of so-called SOD2-reactive iron (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unknown whether SOD2-reactive iron represents a major shift in the chemistry of bulk mitochondrial iron or whether it is just a small pool of the metal emerging from one or more specific sites. The grx5 and ssq1 mutants that promote iron-SOD2 interactions encode just two of many components of a complex pathway for iron-sulfur biogenesis (15Rouault T.A. Tong W.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). One of the key components is a well conserved iron-sulfur scaffold protein originally described for bacteria as IscU, also known as mammalian ISCU and S. cerevisiae Isu1p and Isu2p, referred collectively herein as “Isu proteins” (17Gerber J.

The iron-sulfur clusters on Isu proteins are labile and can be transferred to target iron-sulfur proteins through the aid of mitochondrial factors including Grx5p and Ssq1p (15Rouault T.A. Tong W.H.

It is not clear whether disruption of the iron-sulfur pathway per se is sufficient to promote iron interactions with yeast Sod2p or whether this effect is specific to grx5, ssq1, and mtm1 mutants. In the current study, we explore the nature of mitochondrial iron that can interact with Sod2p. We find that the changes in mitochondrial metal homeostasis that shift metal binding in yeast Sod2p likewise alter metal cofactor selection in a heterologously expressed Mn-SOD, but not in a Fe-SOD molecule. Through x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses of mitochondrial iron, we detected no major change in bulk mitochondrial iron under conditions that promote iron-SOD2 interactions. SOD2-reactive iron appears to represent a small pool of the metal, and we provide evidence that the iron-sulfur scaffold Isu1p can act as an important source of this reactive iron. The strains employed in this study are isogenic to either BY4741 (MATa, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, and his3Δ1) or BY4742 (MATα, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, and his3Δ1).

The pGAL-ISU1 knock down strain LJ403 (isu1Δ::kanMX4, isu2Δ::HIS3, pGAL-ISU1) was created by deleting isu2 with pLJ318 (described below) in the isu1Δ::kanMX4 strain expressing ISU1 under GAL1 (plasmid pLJ386; described below). The pMET3-ISU1 knockdown strain LJ436 (BY4742 isu2Δ::kanMX4, pMET3-ISU1::HIS3) was created by integrating the MET3 promoter just prior to the ISU1 coding sequence using plasmid pLJ472 (described below) in a strain also harboring a isu2Δ deletion. MTM1 and GRX5 were deleted in BY4742 and LJ436 using plasmids pVC257 (13Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Yeast cells were grown either in enriched yeast extract, peptone-based medium supplemented with 2% glucose (YPD), 2% galactose (YPGal), 3% glycerol (YPG), or in synthetic defined medium. To minimize oxidative damage in iron accumulating yeast strains, stocks of cells were maintained in oxygen-depleted culture jars (GasPak, Becton Dickinson), and liquid cultures were grown without aeration. The S. cerevisiae SOD2 expressing vector pAN001 was created by mobilizing SOD2 sequences −552 to +889 from pEL111 (13Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The pKL-SOD plasmid for expressing FLAG-tagged E. coli Fe-SOD was a generous gift from Dr. Jerry Kaplan, University of Utah (25Balzan R. Agius D.R. Bannister W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The grx5Δ::URA3 plasmid pLJ190 was generated by PCR-amplifying upstream (−703 to −232) and downstream sequences (+416 to +855) of GRX5 introducing EcoRI and SpeI (upstream) or KpnI and EcoRI (downstream) restriction sites. Following digestion the PCR products were ligated into KpnI/SpeI digested pRS306 (URA3). To generate pLJ129 expressing ISU1 under PGK1, the coding sequence for ISU1 was PCR-amplified with BamHI and SalI sites and inserted into these sites of pLJ150 (URA3 2 μm containing the PGK1 promoter and CYC1 terminator). Plasmid pLJ357 is a derivative of pLJ129 expressing D71A ISU1 generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). To create the GAL1-driven ISU1 vector pLJ386, the BamHI-SalI ISU1-containing fragment of pLJ129 was inserted into these same sites of pYC2/CT harboring the GAL1 promoter (URA3 CEN) (Invitrogen). The isu2Δ::HIS3 disruption plasmid pLJ388 was created by inserting the isu2 disruption cassette from pSG101 (18Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) into the BamHI-SalI sites of pRS403. The pMET3-ISU1 promoter replacement plasmid was generated by PCR-amplifying ISU1 upstream (−929 to −343) and downstream (+1 to +687) sequences introducing NotI and SacI (upstream) or SphI and NotI (downstream) restriction sites and MET3 sequences (−425 to −3) introducing BamHI and SphI sites. Following digestion the MET3 promoter and ISU1 downstream sequences were ligated into pRS313 (HIS3) digested with BamHI/NotI producing plasmid pLJ469. The pMET3-ISU1 (downstream) fusion was then excised with BamHI/NotI and ligated together with the ISU1 upstream sequences digested with NotI/SacI into pRS403 (HIS3) digested with BamHI/SacI. The resulting plasmid pLJ472 was linearized with NotI and used to replace the ISU1 promoter with the methionine-repressible MET3 promoter.

For glucose repression of GAL-ISU1 and methionine repression of pMET3-ISU1, cells were maintained on solid YPD for at least 48 h prior to 14–16 h in liquid YPD cultures. The lysates were analyzed for SOD activity by native gel electrophoresis and nitroblue tetrazolium staining (13Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For XANES and EXAFS analysis, cells were cultured for 16 h in YPD to an A600 4.0–4.5 and mitochondria were isolated from duplicate 2.0 liter cultures as above in buffers containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The yield of protein was typically 10–20 μg/μl. 40 μl of each mitochondrial sample was transferred to Lucite cuvettes for x-ray absorption spectra data collection as described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. We have shown previously that cofactor selectivity in mitochondrial Sod2p is greatly influenced by mitochondrial manganese and iron homeostasis (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We tested whether such effects of the mitochondrial environment are limited to eukaryotic SOD2 or can be extended to other members of the Fe/Mn-SOD family. In the experiment of Fig. 1, E. coli Mn-SOD was expressed in yeast mitochondria using the S. cerevisiae SOD2 gene promoter and mitochondrial targeting signal. E. coli Mn-SOD shows activity in wild type (WT) yeast mitochondria that was not inhibited by increasing mitochondrial iron through iron supplements (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, as with yeast Sod2p, E. coli Mn-SOD seems largely nonreactive to high mitochondrial iron from WT cells. Yet, iron does react with E. coli Mn-SOD in the mtm1, ssq1, and grx5 mutants that also inactivate yeast Sod2p. As seen in Fig. 1B, E. coli Mn-SOD activity is lost in mtm1, ssq1, and grx5 mutants (lanes 3–5), and activity is restored by depleting iron through chelation with BPS (bathophenanthrolinedisulfonate) (lanes 6–8). BPS treatments also somewhat increased activity of E. coli Mn-SOD and yeast Sod2p expressed in WT cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4), consistent with a low level of iron reactivity with these SODs even in WT cells (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial environment has the same impact on cofactor selection in a heterologous Mn-SOD from bacteria as is seen with the endogenous yeast Sod2p. We tested whether the mitochondrial environment can likewise influence cofactor selection in an Fe-SOD. When expressed in WT yeast mitochondria, Fe-SOD from E. coli is active, consistent with iron binding (Fig. 2A, lane 2). To determine whether a fraction of the enzyme is inactivated by manganese binding, Fe-SOD was expressed in the mitochondria of smf2Δ mutants that accumulate very low manganese (7Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Luk E.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fe-SOD activity was not significantly elevated in this manganese-starved cell (Fig. 2A, lane 3), indicating that mitochondrial manganese is not binding the enzyme. Fe-SOD activity was also largely unchanged by the same mtm1 and ssq1 mutants that favor iron binding to Mn-SOD over manganese (Fig. 2B, lane 3 and 4). Even when yeast cells are overloaded with manganese, Fe-SOD retains its activity. As seen in Fig. 2C, the same manganese treatments that promote manganese binding and manganese activation of yeast Sod2p (top) had no effect on Fe-SOD activity (bottom). Fe-SOD is largely refractory to the changes in metal homeostasis that affect cofactor selection in Mn-SOD molecules. Although mitochondrial iron is normally quite bioavailable for Fe-SOD, this is not the case for Mn-SOD. Only a specialized pool of mitochondrial iron, such as that expanded in mtm1, grx5, and ssq1 mutants, can gain access to manganese SOD molecules. The mitochondrial iron that accumulates in grx5, ssq1, and mtm1 mutants would appear to be of a unique nature in that it readily reacts with Mn-SOD molecules. To address whether these mutants are associated with a bulk change in the average oxidative state and/or coordination environment of mitochondrial iron, we employed XANES and EXAFS. Such spectroscopy has previously been used to analyze mitochondrial iron of mammalian cells defective for frataxin (28Popescu B.F. Pickering I.J. George G.N. Nichol H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2007; 101: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which, in our analogous yeast yfh1 mutants, does not react with SOD2. Because our interests lie in “SOD2-reactive iron,” we analyzed the mitochondrial iron of yeast grx5Δ and mtm1Δ mutants, as well as a rho mutant control (grx5 and mtm1 cells are rho−; (29Laliberté J. Whitson L.J. Beaudoin J. Holloway S.P. Hart P.J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28744-28755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). When treated with iron, the rho strain accumulates high mitochondrial iron that does not react with or inactivate Sod2p, whereas the isogenic grx5Δ mutant does exhibit iron activation of Sod2p (Fig. 3A). EXAFS spectra were measured from duplicate samples as described previously (30Tobin D.A. Pickett J.S. Hartman H.L. Fierke C.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9962-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to k = 12 Å−1 (supplemental Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S1). Spectra were fit using Feff 7.02 parameters over the k range 2–9 Å−1. As seen in Fig. 3B, the normalized (31Weng T.C. Waldo G.S. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Synchrotron. Radiat. 2005; 12: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) XANES spectra for the grx5Δ and mtm1Δ mutants and the rho control are identical, indicating that there is no detectable change in either the average iron oxidation state or geometry. The edge energy is consistent with an approximately equal mixture of Fe(II) and Fe(III) and the weak 1s-3d intensity indicates that the bulk of the iron has ∼octahedral symmetry. Although the absolute Fe(II):Fe(III) ratio cannot be discerned because the apparent ratio depends on the reference spectra used for Fe(II) and Fe(III), it is nevertheless clear that there is no significant change in oxidation state in mitochondrial iron from grx5 and mtm1Δ versus the rho control. A conversion of >5% of the iron from Fe(II) to Fe(III) or vice versa would be readily detectable. The EXAFS spectra (supplemental Fig. S1) were fit using a single iron-oxygen/nitrogen shell. Again, there was no significant change in spectra of grx5, mtm1, and the rho control; in all three cases, the apparent iron-oxygen distance was 1.97–2.00 Å, consistent with the expected RFe-O for 6-coordinate Fe(III). Overall, iron inactivation of Sod2p does not correlate with major changes in total mitochondrial iron. The pool of mitochondrial iron that inactivates SOD2 may represent a small fraction. Clues to understanding the origin of SOD2-reactive iron may come from an analysis of the iron-sulfur pathway. The yeast grx5 and ssq1 mutations that promote iron inactivation of Sod2p block both mitochondrial and cytosolic iron-sulfur biogenesis (16Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). A factor needed for cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, iron-sulfur clusters is yeast ATM1, the homologue to mammalian ABCB7 (32Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Bekri S. Kispal G. Lange H. Fitzsimons E. Tolmie J. Lill R. Bishop D.F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, knockdown of human ABCB7 was associated with a lowering of SOD2 activity (34Cavadini P. Biasiotto G. Poli M. Levi S. Verardi R. Zanella I. Derosas M. Ingrassia R. Corrado M. Arosio P. Blood. 2007; 109: 3552-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and we now provide evidence that this reflects iron inactivation of the enzyme. As seen in Fig. 4A, deletion of S. cerevisiae ATM1 results in a dramatic rise in mitochondrial iron. This iron is reacting with Sod2p as there is a pronounced loss in Sod2p activity (Fig. 4B, lane 2) that was rescued by iron chelation (lane 3). Another component of the iron-sulfur biogenesis pathway is the yeast Isu proteins (also known as IscU in bacteria and ISCU in mammals) onto which labile iron-sulfur scaffolds are built (17Gerber J. Neumann K. Prohl C. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4848-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A combined deletion in S. cerevisiae ISU1 and ISU2 is lethal (18Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol.

Repression of ISU1 resulted in an increase in mitochondrial iron (Fig. 4C) as previously shown with isu deficiency and with loss of mtm1, grx5, and ssq1 (13Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M."
https://openalex.org/W1986150384,"In this study, we report that the purified wild-type FANCI (Fanconi anemia complementation group I) protein directly binds to a variety of DNA substrates. The DNA binding domain roughly encompasses residues 200–1000, as suggested by the truncation study. When co-expressed in insect cells, a small fraction of FANCI forms a stable complex with FANCD2 (Fanconi anemia complementation group D2). Intriguingly, the purified FANCI-FANCD2 complex preferentially binds to the branched DNA structures when compared with either FANCI or FANCD2 alone. Co-immunoprecipitation with purified proteins indicates that FANCI interacts with FANCD2 through its C-terminal amino acid 1001–1328 fragment. Although the C terminus of FANCI is dispensable for direct DNA binding, it seems to be involved in the regulation of DNA binding activity. This notion is further enhanced by two C-terminal point mutations, R1285Q and D1301A, which showed differentiated DNA binding activity. We also demonstrate that FANCI forms discrete nuclear foci in HeLa cells in the absence or presence of exogenous DNA damage. The FANCI foci are colocalized perfectly with FANCD2 and partially with proliferating cell nuclear antigen irrespective of mitomycin C treatment. An increased number of FANCI foci form and become resistant to Triton X extraction in response to mitomycin C treatment. Our data suggest that the FANCI-FANCD2 complex may participate in repair of damaged replication forks through its preferential recognition of branched structures."
https://openalex.org/W2006463960,"In normal physiological states mTOR phosphorylates and activates Akt. However, under diabetic-mimicking conditions mTOR inhibits phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signaling by phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser-636/639. The molecular basis for the differential effect of mTOR signaling on Akt is poorly understood. Here, it has been shown that knockdown of mTOR, Raptor, and mLST8, but not Rictor and mSin1, suppresses insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-636/639 and stabilizes IRS-1 after long term insulin stimulation. This phosphorylation depends on the PI 3-kinase/PDK1 axis but is Akt-independent. At the molecular level, Raptor binds the SAIN (Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding) domain of IRS-1 and regulates the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-636/639 by mTOR. IRS-1 lacking the SAIN domain does not interact with Raptor, is not phosphorylated at Ser-636/639, and favorably interacts with PI 3-kinase. Overall, these data provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 inhibits PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling at the level of IRS-1 and suggest that mTOR signaling toward Akt is scaffold-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2031781248,"During cell division, chromosome segregation is governed by the interaction of spindle microtubules with the kinetochore. A dramatic remodeling of interpolar microtubules into an organized central spindle between the separating chromatids is required for the initiation and execution of cytokinesis. Central spindle organization requires mitotic kinesins, microtubule-bundling protein PRC1, and Aurora B kinase complex. However, the precise role of PRC1 in central spindle organization has remained elusive. Here we show that PRC1 recruits CLASP1 to the central spindle at early anaphase onset. CLASP1 belongs to a conserved microtubule-binding protein family that mediates the stabilization of overlapping microtubules of the central spindle. PRC1 physically interacts with CLASP1 and specifies its localization to the central spindle. Repression of CLASP1 leads to sister-chromatid bridges and depolymerization of spindle midzone microtubules. Disruption of PRC1-CLASP1 interaction by a membrane-permeable peptide abrogates accurate chromosome segregation, resulting in sister chromatid bridges. These findings reveal a key role for the PRC1-CLASP1 interaction in achieving a stable anti-parallel microtubule organization essential for faithful chromosome segregation. We propose that PRC1 forms a link between stabilization of CLASP1 association with central spindle microtubules and anti-parallel microtubule elongation."

This reaction was found to be catalyzed by human P450s 2D6 and 3A4 in the presence of (R)-reticuline and NADPH to yield not a single product, but rather (−)-isoboldine, (−)-corytuberine, (+)-pallidine, and salutaridine, the para-ortho coupled established precursor of morphine in the poppy plant and most likely also in mammals. (S)-Reticuline, a substrate of both P450 enzymes, yielded the phenol-coupled alkaloids (+)-isoboldine, (+)-corytuberine, (−)-pallidine, and sinoacutine; none of these serve as a morphine precursor. Catalytic efficiencies were similar for P450 2D6 and P450 3A4 in the presence of cytochrome b5 with (R)-reticuline as substrate. The mechanism of phenol coupling is not yet established; however, we favor a single cycle of iron oxidation to yield salutaridine and the three other alkaloids from (R)-reticuline.

There is, however, a discrepancy between the plant and the animal kingdoms with regard to the sheer number of these biocatalysts. Whereas in a single model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, there are to date 273 P450 proteins, in the human genome, only 57 of these proteins are present. Whereas plants and animals share a multitude of highly regio- and stereospecific O-demethylation reactions, more complex reactions such as phenol coupling are much more abundant in plants than in animals, especially in the alkaloid field (2.Stadler R.

Some Biogenetic Aspects of Phenol Oxidation. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1957Google Scholar) correlated the structure of specific plant alkaloids in terms of this reaction mechanism and gave mechanistic proposals of how these phenol-coupled products may possibly be biosynthesized in nature. The oxidation of phenols by one-electron transfer affords radicals, which, by radical pairing, form new C-C or C-O bonds either by intra- or intermolecular coupling. The first two examples that unequivocally demonstrated the formation of C-C and C-O bonds in a stereo- and regioselective manner in plant metabolism are catalyzed by specific P450-linked microsomal-bound plant enzymes (13.Zenk M.H. Gerardy R. Stadler R. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; 22: 1725-1727Crossref Google Scholar). One of these enzymes was salutaridine synthase from Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) (14.Gerardy R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 4566-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have published a number of reports over the past 25 years claiming that mammals are capable of synthesizing de novo traces of endogenous morphine. However, no convincing experimental data have been presented regarding the enzymes. Phenol-coupling reactions in mammals are extremely rare, and the only example described thus far is the formation of thyroxine, by radical pairing, in humans. If the key step of morphine synthesis, the formation of phenol-coupled salutaridine from (R)-reticuline, occurs in mammals then in analogy to plants, a P450 enzyme must be present (in mammals) to catalyze this reaction. In 1987, the first experiments were conducted in an attempt to discover the reaction by supplying uniformly labeled racemic [3H]reticuline in the presence of rat microsomes and NADPH to examine whether [3H]salutaridine can be formed under these conditions (15.Weitz C.J. Faull K.F. Goldstein A. Nature. 1987; 330: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A radioactive compound was formed in 1% yield and assumed to be the phenol-coupled product salutaridine. We later repeated this experiment using (R)-[N-14CH3]reticuline and NADPH-fortified microsomes from pig, rat, cow, and sheep. We observed the formation of [N-14CH3]salutaridine with the correct stereochemistry at carbon 9 (17.Amann T. Zenk M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 3675-3678Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The enzyme from porcine liver was subsequently purified to homogeneity and the reaction product was characterized by mass spectrometry and physical parameters to be a product of a P450 enzyme, which we provisionally named “salutaridine synthase” (18.Amann T. Roos P.H. Huh H. Zenk M.H. Heterocycles. 1995; 40: 425-440Crossref Google Scholar). The aim of this report is the identification of the homogenous porcine P450 enzyme, its equivalent in humans, and the mechanism of the phenol-coupling reaction in the formation of precursors of morphine. Alkaloids were from our departmental collection, and isoboldine, pallidine, and sinoacutine were gifts of Dr. André Cavé, University Paris-Sud, Dr. Shoei-Sheng Lee, National Taiwan University, and Dr. F. Bracher, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. l-α-Dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, bovine liver catalase, and bovine erythrocytes superoxide dismutase were obtained from Sigma. Human P450 2D6 and rat NADPH-P450 reductase were prepared as described (19.Hanna I.H. Krauser J.A. Cai H. Kim M.S. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Human P450 2D6 and human P450 3A4 (with or without cytochrome b5) were purchased from BD Biosciences (Woburn, MA). Porcine salutaridine synthase was purified according to Ref. 18.Amann T. Roos P.H. Huh H. Zenk M.H. Heterocycles. 1995; 40: 425-440Crossref Google Scholar and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel. The protein band at ∼50 kDa (containing ∼10 μg of protein) was excised and eluted, and the N terminus was sequenced by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Model 470 gas-phase sequencer at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany. Enzyme assays utilizing radioactive labeled substrate were conducted in a total volume of 140 μl containing 36 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 20 pmol of P450 enzyme (BD Biosciences, microsomal preparation from baculovirus-infected insect cells coexpressing human NADPH-P450 reductase), 1.8 mm NADPH, 0.36 mm EDTA, and 0.2 μCi (R)- or (S)-[N-14CH3] reticuline (200,000–300,000 cpm, 6.75 nmol). The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. For identification of products, the reaction mixture was separated by two-dimensional TLC (solvent 1: toluene/acetone/ethanol/NH4OH, 45:45:7:3 (v/v/v/v); solvent 2: CHCl3/acetone/diethylamine, 5:4:1 (v/v/v)), and radioactive bands were detected by phosphorimaging with a Typhoon 9410 (Molecular Dynamics). For plant-feeding experiments, potential precursor solutions were obtained by separation of the reaction mixture by TLC using the solvent mixture chloroform/acetone/diethylamine, 5:4:1 (v/v/v) following the elution of corresponding bands with CH3OH and reconstitution in H2O. Standard reactions for kinetic data and pH profile analysis were conducted in a total volume of 250 μl containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 15 μg of l-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1 mm NADP+, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (yeast), 1000 units/ml catalase (bovine liver), 10 μg bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and 0.25 μm to 5 mm substrate. Reactions were started by adding 38 pmol of P450 2D6 (Escherichia coli-expressed protein) and 255 pmol of rat cytochrome P450 reductase (E. coli-expressed protein) or 9–18 pmol of P450 2D6 or P450 3A4 (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were made alkaline with 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.5) and extracted twice with 400 μl of CHCl3. The combined organic phases were dried, reconstituted with CH3OH, and subjected to LC-MS/MS. Kinetic parameters were estimated by non-linear regression with GraphPad Prism. For pH profile analysis enzymatic assays were conducted as described above in a reaction mixture containing 25 μmol of following buffer: sodium citrate (pH 4–6), potassium phosphate (pH 6–8), and Tris/HCl (pH 8–9). Sterilized 5-day-old Papaver seedlings were incubated for 48 h with the potential precursor solution. The seedlings were extracted with 80% ethanol (v/v). The extracts were dried, redissolved in 20 μl 50% ethanol (v/v), and separated by TLC in solvent system toluene/ethyl acetate/diethylamine, 7:2:1 (v/v/v). Radioactive bands were detected by phosphorimaging. Enzyme activities were analyzed with a 4000 QTRAP LC-TIS-MS-MS system by monitoring the enhanced product ion (EPI) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in the positive ionization mode. The system consisted of a CTC PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies), a Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC system, and a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Separation of (10 μl) samples was achieved by using a Luna C18 octadecylsilane HPLC column (Phenomenex, 5 μm, 150 mm × 2 mm) combined with a C18 guard column (Phenomenex, 4 mm × 2 mm). The mobile phase total flow was set to 0.5 ml/min with binary gradient elution, using solvent A (5% CH3OH, 5% CH3CN, 10 mm NH4HCO3, 45 mm NH4OH) and B (90% CH3CN, 10 mm NH4HCO3, 15 mm NH4OH) (all v/v). The gradient started with 100% A for 2 min and was increased to 100% B over 10 min. Elution was continued for 2 min at 100% B followed by a 5-min equilibration with starting condition. The following TIS source parameters were used: CUR 30, CAD high, IS 5000, TEM 500, EP 10, CXP 17. Compound-dependent parameters for the compounds of interest (collision energy, declustering potential, quantifier MRM transition, qualifier MRM transition, dwell time) are listed in Table 1. Identification of an analyte was based on retention times, the quantifier-to-qualifier MRM transition ratio, and comparison with the expected values for standards. Quantitation was performed by constructing standard curves for each analyte and integrating the peak area of the quantifier MRM transition with Analyst 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX Instruments).TABLE 1Compound-dependent parameters for the LC-MS-MS methodAnalyteCollision energyDeclustering potentialQuantifier MRM transitionQualifier MRM transitionDwell timeVVmsReticuline3545330 → 192330 → 13750Corytuberine4050328 → 265328 → 28250Pallidine4050328 → 211328 → 23750Salutaridine4050328 → 211328 → 23750Isoboldine4050328 → 265328 → 23750Thebaine3540312 → 251312 → 28150Oripavine3540298 → 218298 → 24950 Open table in a new tab The microsomal porcine liver enzyme catalyzing the formation of the phenol-coupling reaction from (R)-reticuline to salutaridine was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity and subjected to Edman degradation. The N terminus yielded the amino acid sequence: Gly-Leu-Leu-Thr-Gly-Asp-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ile-Leu-Ala-Leu-Ala-Met-Val-Ile-Phe-Leu-Leu-Asn(Leu)-Val-Asp-Leu-Met-X-Arg. Upon comparison of this peptide sequence to those present in the public databases, this is the exact N-terminal of pig P450 2D25, except for the missing N-terminal Met. Homology to human P450 2D6 was observed (56% identity). Consequently, human P450 2D6 was obtained from a commercial source (BD Biosciences) and found to indeed catalyze the phenol-coupling reaction from (R)-[N-14CH3]reticuline to salutaridine in the presence of NADPH. However, close examination of the reaction products of the porcine and the commercially available human P450 2D6 enzymes by two-dimensional TLC revealed four metabolites in addition to unconsumed 14C-labeled (R)-reticuline (vide infra). Incubation of (R)-reticuline in the presence of NADPH-P450 reductase and P450 2D6 resulted in the formation of four metabolites that were not found in controls with heat-inactivated enzymes. These metabolites were subjected to MS after separation by HPLC. Comparison of the four compounds with standards of alkaloids that were expected to be formed according to the phenol-coupling reactions allowed the identification of the unknown compounds as salutaridine (para-ortho coupling), (+)-pallidine (para-para coupling), (−)-isoboldine (ortho-para coupling), and (−)-corytuberine (ortho-ortho coupling) (Fig. 1). The identification of these compounds is consistent with the previous findings by the incubation of rat liver microsomes in the presence of racemic reticuline (20.Kametani T. Ohta Y. Takemura M. Ihara M. Fukumoto K. Bioorg. Chem. 1977; 6: 249-256Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21.Kametani T. Kanaya N. Ohta Y. Ihara M. Heterocycles. 1980; 14: 963-970Crossref Google Scholar). However, the important morphine precursor salutaridine was missed during that investigation. Salutaridine is formed unequivocally during the phenol-coupling reaction and was identified by MS and retention time. Application of the para-ortho coupled product to 5-day-old poppy seedlings verified salutaridine by its incorporation into thebaine (Fig. 2), while the other three phenol-coupled products of the (R)-series were not incorporated into thebaine. Analogous incubation of NADPH-P450 reductase in the presence of P450 2D6 and (S)-reticuline again gave four phenol-coupled products of the (S)-series, which were sinoacutine, (−)-pallidine, (+)-isoboldine, and (+)-corytuberine and did not serve as precursors to morphine. The collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra of salutaridine [M+H]+ 328 by EPI yielded the characteristic fragment ions m/z 297, 285, 265, 239, and 237 (22.Raith K. Neubert R. Poeaknapo C. Boettcher C. Zenk M.H. Schmidt J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that were also found in CID spectra of the para-ortho coupled product.

Interestingly, human P450 2D6 is known to catalyze several reactions within the putative pathway leading from l-tyrosine to morphine. These reactions include the hydroxylation of tyramine to dopamine (23.Guengerich F.P. Miller G.P. Hanna I.H. Sato H. Martin M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33711-33719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24.Hiroi T. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 838-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the demethylation of thebaine to oripavine (25.Mikus G. Somogyi A.A. Bochner F. Eichelbaum M. Xenobiotica. 1991; 21: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the demethylation of codeine to morphine (26.Dayer P. Desmeules J. Leemann T. Striberni R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); all of these reactions can be catalyzed by a single enzyme-P450 2D6. Tyramine hydroxylation to dopamine plays only a minor role, if any, in the production of dopamine in humans; however, three P450 2D6-catalyzed reactions may play a role in the biosynthesis of endogenous morphine. P450 3A4 has previously been shown to N-demethylate codeine to N-norcodeine (27.Yue Q.Y. Säwe J. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This similarity of P450 3A4 in accepting codeine as substrate prompted us to investigate whether P450 3A4 can catalyze the phenol coupling of (R)-reticuline. Indeed P450 3A4 showed the product pattern known for 2D6, i.e. the formation of salutaridine, (+)-pallidine, (−)-isoboldine, and (−)-corytuberine from the precursor (R)-reticuline as determined by MS (Fig. 4). The morphine biosynthetic precursor salutaridine is indeed formed by P450 3A4 as well. P450 3A4 was also tested to determine if it can catalyze the phenol-coupling reaction with the (S)-configuration of reticuline as substrate. Incubation of P450 3A4 with (S)-reticuline again yielded four products, sinoacutine, (−)-pallidine, (+)-isoboldine, and (+)-corytuberine, as determined by MS. The four phenol-coupled alkaloids formed in the presence of human P450 2D6 and 10 μm (R)-reticuline were individually quantitated after an incubation time of 10 min, in which time product formation is in the linear range: (−)-corytuberine (4 nm), (−)-isoboldine (54 nm), (+)-pallidine (24 nm), and salutaridine (6 nm). With the (S)-configuration of reticuline as substrate under the same incubation condition the yields of phenol-coupled products were: (+)-corytuberine (1 nm), (+)-isoboldine (61 nm), (−)-pallidine (15 nm), and sinoacutine (3 nm). With P450 3A4 as catalyst, the same set of phenol-coupled alkaloids yielded the following with (R)-reticuline as substrate: (−)-corytuberine (7 nm), (−)-isoboldine (30 nm), (+)-pallidine (18 nm), and salutaridine (28 nm). With (S)-reticuline as substrate, under the same conditions as above and P450 3A4 as catalyst, the yields were: (+)-corytuberine (5 nm) (+)-isoboldine (15 nm), (−)-pallidine (7 nm), and sinoacutine (15 nm). Similar yields were obtained for the (R)- and (S)-series of phenol-coupled products suggesting that the two different P450s oxidize reticuline via radical formation without stereoselectivity. A pH profile for both P450 enzymes catalyzing the phenol coupling of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The relative distribution of the four phenol-coupled products was the same after 10 min and 120 min of incubation as well as at any pH between 5 and 9. Both human P450 enzymes described herein, P450 2D6 and P450 3A4, catalyze the same reaction by converting (R)-reticuline to the four phenol-coupled products but with distinct kinetics that can be derived from their Michaelis-Menten parameters (Table 2 and supplemental Figs. S2-S4). P450 2D6 had a lower apparent Km of 2–3 μm for the substrate (R)-reticuline as compared with P450 3A4 (Km = 500–1000 μm) whereas a higher maximum rate (kcat) for the conversion of (R)-reticuline is observed for P450 3A4. Including cytochrome b5 in the P450 3A4 system increased the rate of product formation by about 6 to 7 times whereas the Km was only slightly changed. These findings support other studies showing that the activity of P450 3A4 can be enhanced by cytochrome b5 whereas P450 2D6 is not affected (28.Yamazaki H. Nakamura M. Komatsu T. Ohyama K. Hatanaka N. Asahi S. Shimada N. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Nakajima M. Yokoi T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Catalytic efficiencies for both enzymes, P450 2D6 and P450 3A4-utilizing (R)-reticuline as a substrate, show that P450 2D6 seems to be more efficient; however, if cytochrome b5 is added to the P450 3A4 system, catalytic efficiencies of both enzymes become comparable. Additionally, human P450 2D6 shows a higher Km value for two other substrates, thebaine and codeine, i.e. 190–250 and 48 μm, respectively (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S5), as compared with (R)-reticuline. However, increased catalytic rates for the substrates thebaine and codeine lead to catalytic efficiencies of same order of magnitude for all three substrates of P450 2D6 that described herein.TABLE 2Catalytic parameters for human P450 2D6 and P450 3A4EnzymeSubstrateProductKmkcatkcat//Kmμmpmol/min/pmol P450mm−1 s−1P450 2D6(R)-ReticulineCorytuberine2.7 ± 0.370.015 ± 0.0010.09Pallidine1.8 ± 0.260.045 ± 0.0020.42Salutaridine2.5 ± 0.210.011 ± 0.0010.08Isoboldine1.9 ± 0.360.390 ± 0.0263.42ThebaineOripavine48 ± 9.64.55 ± 0.541.60CodeineMorphine250aData taken from Ref. 40.14aData taken from Ref. 40.0.93190bData taken from Ref. 41.6.4bData taken from Ref. 41.0.56P450 3A4 with cytochrome b5(R)-ReticulineCorytuberine384 ± 401.3 ± 0.10.06Pallidine474 ± 3014.7 ± 0.30.52Salutaridine1961 ± 18112.3 ± 0.50.12Isoboldine4860 ± 860158 ± 170.54P450 3A4(R)-ReticulineCorytuberine534 ± 660.16 ± 0.140.005Pallidine490 ± 382.97 ± 0.140.101Salutaridine993 ± 2202.20 ± 0.360.037Isoboldine577 ± 1309.37 ± 1.340.271a Data taken from Ref. 40.Oscarson M.

Open table in a new tab It has been shown that human P450 2D6 and P450 3A4 catalyze what appear to be radical-induced phenol-coupling reactions with both (R)-and (S)-reticuline, yielding four (R)-configured and four (S)-configured phenol-coupled products. As shown in Fig. 5, a mechanism can be postulated that starts with the fully activated P450 (“compound I” form), which abstracts a hydrogen atom to create a phenoxy radical. The substrate rotates in juxtaposition to the P450 iron, which is now in the “compound II” form and can still abstract a second phenolic hydrogen, which then leads to immediate coupling within a single cycle of P450 action, yielding a water molecule. A simple enolization of the cyclohexanedienal ring yields the final product salutaridine as one of the (R)-coupled alkaloids and the missing link in human morphine biosynthesis. The intramolecular C-C phenol-coupling reaction of (S)-reticuline to corytuberine catalyzed by CYP80G2 in the plant Coptis japonica is postulated to occur by a diradical mechanism (7.Ikezawa N. Iwasa K. Sato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8810-8821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This postulate was based on a previously proposed mechanism in the first report of a plant cytochrome P450 that catalyzes a phenol-coupling reaction, berbamunine synthase from Berberis stolonifera (2.Stadler R. Zenk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concept of a diradical mechanism in phenol-coupling reactions finds origin in the proposal of Barton and Cohen (12.Barton D.H. Cohen T. Some Biogenetic Aspects of Phenol Oxidation. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1957Google Scholar) in which radical pairing furnishes diphenyl ether or aryl-aryl bonds. A new C-C phenol-coupling reaction catalyzed by CYP121 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has recently been reported (29.Belin P. Le, Du M.H. Fielding A. Lequin O. Jacquet M. Charbonnier J.B. Lecoq A. Thai R. Courǫn M. Masson C. Dugave C. Genet R. Pernodet J.L. Gondry M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is proposed therein that the intramolecular C-C coupling of the two tyrosyl side chains of cYY to cyclodipeptide proceeds via activation of the tyrosyl residues through a radical mechanism. A diradical mechanism can also be proposed herein; however, the mechanism proposed in Fig. 5 avoids the energetic instability of a formal diradical species. Salutaridine has previously escaped detection using rat liver microsomes (20.Kametani T. Ohta Y. Takemura M. Ihara M. Fukumoto K. Bioorg. Chem. 1977; 6: 249-256Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21.Kametani T. Kanaya N. Ohta Y. Ihara M. Heterocycles. 1980; 14: 963-970Crossref Google Scholar), being a minor phenol-coupled alkaloid. Salutaridine is the para-ortho phenol-coupled product, which is the biosynthetic precursor of morphine both in the poppy plant and in humans and other mammals. This finding adds considerable credibility to the controversial discussion about whether endogenous morphine occurs in mammals. It should be pointed out that the occurrence of P450 2D6, not only in liver tissue but also in human brain, has been unequivocally proven (30.Siegle I. Fritz P. Eckhardt K. Zanger U.M. Eichelbaum M. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). P450 2D6 occurs mainly in the neocortex, telencephalon, hippocampus, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, and myelencephalon. The second P450 that catalyzes the phenol-coupling reactions with (R)-reticuline as substrate forming again four phenol-coupled products, including salutaridine-3A4- is found to occur in brain, mainly in pons and cervical cord (31.Agarwal V. Kommaddi R.P. Valli K. Ryder D. Hyde T.M. Kleinman J.E. Strobel H.W. Ravindranath V. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in liver and small intestine (32.Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 377-530Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The presence of endogenous morphine in brain of humans and mammals has been suggested by various researchers (16.Donnerer J. Oka K. Brossi A. Rice K.C. Spector S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 4566-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33.Kodaira H. Spector S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and in sterile human cell cultures, e.g. neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y (34.Boettcher C. Fellermeier M. Boettcher C. Dräger B. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8495-9500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35.Poeaknapo C. Schmidt J. Brandsch M. Dräger B. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Aunis D. Goumon Y. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The possible occurrence of morphine in human and mammalian cells has been a matter of controversy for more than 30 years. A resolution of this problem can come only by the application of state-of-the-art analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology, with the application of critical controls to exclude introduction of morphine from food sources to the animals and exclusion of laboratory contamination with morphine. It has been suggested that human P450 2D6 might catalyze the transformation of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine (37.Zhu W. Cadet P. Baggerman G. Mantione K.J. Stefano G.B. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In a recent report, Hawkins and Smolke (38.Hawkins K.M. Smolke C.D. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) tested whether P450 2D6 might catalyze the formation of salutaridine from (R)-reticuline in recombinant yeast. (R,S)-Norlaudanosoline was fed to the recombinant yeast strain which produced racemic (R,S)-reticuline. When P450 2D6 was introduced into the (R,S)-reticuline-producing yeast strain, a product was formed that had the MS fragment ions of m/z 297 and m/z 265 and was designated salutaridine (38.Hawkins K.M. Smolke C.D. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The yield of the morphine precursor was reported to be between 6 and 8%. The yield could not be further increased (38.Hawkins K.M. Smolke C.D. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) by available techniques. P450 2D6 (and P450 3A4) catalyze reactions that can be interpreted as a diradical mechanism or alternatively involving a single cycle of iron oxidation, vide supra (Fig. 5). This mechanism will lead to four final alkaloid products, each alkaloid in a different but consistent concentration. Only one of these products is the desired morphine precursor salutaridine, in 0.06% concentration. Use of racemic (R,S)-reticuline (via (R,S)-norlaudanosoline in the recombinant yeast system) leads to another four phenol-coupled products of the (S)-series, namely the alkaloids (+)-corytuberine, (+)-isoboldine, sinoacutine, (−)-pallidine, all known natural products. This addition of the (S)-configured compounds would produce seven alkaloids in the recombinant system; only one product (salutaridine) is the morphine precursor. All eight phenol-coupled products derived from (R,S)-reticuline yield the fragment ions m/z 297 and 265 upon mass fragmentation (supplemental Figs. S6 and S7). Eight different structures in different concentrations will result in the recombinant yeast strain; the yield of salutaridine will be ∼0.2%. Although the low and inherent concentration of salutaridine generated by P450 2D6 and P450 3A4 is low for a biotechnological production of morphine, it is expected to be sufficient to generate the ∼10 nm concentration of morphine (via salutaridine) in human cells (35.Poeaknapo C. Schmidt J. Brandsch M. Dräger B. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 14091-14096Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and mouse cerebellum (36.Muller A. Glattard E. Taleb O. Kemmel V. Laux A. Miehe M. Delalande F. Roussell G. Van Dorsselaer A. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Aunis D. Goumon Y. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The phenol-coupling reaction of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine is the key reaction in the biosynthesis of morphine in plants and animals (Fig. 5). The enzyme in endogenous morphine biosynthesis in mammals (P450 2D6) is unique (Fig. 6) in that it catalyzes the 3-O-demethylation of codeine to morphine (26.Dayer P. Desmeules J. Leemann T. Striberni R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the 3-O-demethylation of thebaine to oripavine (25.Mikus G. Somogyi A.A. Bochner F. Eichelbaum M. Xenobiotica. 1991; 21: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the phenol coupling of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine (this work). A minor reaction, the oxidation of tyramine to dopamine that is also catalyzed by P450 2D6 (23.Guengerich F.P. Miller G.P. Hanna I.H. Sato H. Martin M.V. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 5703-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These different reaction types, which are catalyzed by one enzyme in morphine biosynthesis, are rather unique in nature.

https://openalex.org/W2075935790,"ErbB2 and ErbB3, members of the EGF receptor/ErbB family, form a heterodimer upon binding of a ligand, inducing the activation of Rac small G protein and Akt protein kinase for cell movement and survival, respectively. The enhanced ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling causes tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis. We found here that the ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling is regulated by immunoglobulin-like Necl-2, which is down-regulated in various cancer cells and serves as a tumor suppressor. The extracellular region of ErbB3, but not ErbB2, interacted in cis with that of Necl-2. This interaction reduced the ligand-induced, ErbB2-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and inhibited the consequent ErbB3-mediated activation of Rac and Akt, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell movement and survival. These inhibitory effects of Necl-2 were mediated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13 which interacted with the cytoplasmic tail of Necl-2. We describe here this novel mechanism for silencing of the ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling by Necl-2."
https://openalex.org/W2095201876,"Tailed bacteriophages and herpes viruses use powerful molecular motors to translocate DNA into a preassembled prohead and compact the DNA to near crystalline density. The phage T4 motor, a pentamer of 70-kDa large terminase, gp17, is the fastest and most powerful motor reported to date. gp17 has an ATPase activity that powers DNA translocation and a nuclease activity that cuts concatemeric DNA and generates the termini of viral genome. An 18-kDa small terminase, gp16, is also essential, but its role in DNA packaging is poorly understood. gp16 forms oligomers, most likely octamers, exhibits no enzymatic activities, but stimulates the gp17-ATPase activity, and inhibits the nuclease activity. Extensive mutational and biochemical analyses show that gp16 contains three domains, a central oligomerization domain, and N- and C-terminal domains that are essential for ATPase stimulation. Stimulation occurs not by nucleotide exchange or enhanced ATP binding but by triggering hydrolysis of gp17-bound ATP, a mechanism reminiscent of GTPase-activating proteins. gp16 does not have an arginine finger but its interaction with gp17 seems to position a gp17 arginine finger into the catalytic pocket. gp16 inhibits DNA translocation when gp17 is associated with the prohead. gp16 restricts gp17-nuclease such that the putative packaging initiation cut is made but random cutting is inhibited. These results suggest that the phage T4 packaging machine consists of a motor (gp17) and a regulator (gp16). The gp16 regulator is essential to coordinate the gp17 motor ATPase, translocase, and nuclease activities, otherwise it could be suicidal to the virus. Tailed bacteriophages and herpes viruses use powerful molecular motors to translocate DNA into a preassembled prohead and compact the DNA to near crystalline density.

The gp16 regulator is essential to coordinate the gp17 motor ATPase, translocase, and nuclease activities, otherwise it could be suicidal to the virus. During the late stages in the life cycle of tailed bacteriophages and herpes viruses, a metabolically highly active viral genome is disengaged from processes such as transcription and recombination and packaged into a viral capsid to near crystalline density (1.Rao V.B.

In phage T4, a ∼171-kb 56-μm long DNA molecule is compacted within a 120 nm × 86 nm capsid shell (3.Fokine A. Chipman P.R. Leiman P.G. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rao V.B. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 20: 6003-6008Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Many viruses use powerful molecular motors assembled at a special portal vertex of the icosahedral capsid to accomplish this task (4.Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The DNA is translocated through a channel formed by the dodecameric portal protein, utilizing ATP as an energy source (5.Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O. He Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H.

The ATPase domain has two subdomains, a larger RecA-like nucleotide binding subdomain I and a smaller subdomain II, forming a cleft into which ATP binds.

T4 and most tailed phages and herpes viruses replicate their genomes as a head-to-tail concatamer. A sequence nonspecific nuclease activity associated with gp17 cuts the concatamer once at the beginning of DNA packaging (initiation cut) and again when one headful DNA, equivalent to a ∼1.02-length viral genome, is packaged into the capsid (termination cut) (11.Streisinger G.

The nuclease center consisting of a DNA binding groove and a Mg-coordinated catalytic triad of acidic amino acids is localized in the C-domain, facing the outside of the motor (8.Sun S. Kondabagil K.

Mutational and biochemical analyses established the catalytic residues in ATPase, translocase, and nuclease functional motifs that are critical for various steps of DNA packaging (14.Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15.Goetzinger K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol.

An electrostatic force-dependent packaging mechanism was proposed based on different conformational states of the motor (8.Sun S. Kondabagil K. Draper B. Alam T.I. Bowman V.D. Zhang Z. Hegde S. Fokine A. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. Cell. 2008; 135: 1251-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis causes rotation of subdomain II, aligning an array of complementary charged pairs and hydrophobic surfaces between the N- and C-domains. The electrostatic attractive force pulls the DNA-bound C-domain by ∼7 Å, translocating 2 bp of DNA into the capsid. The adjacent C-domain then comes into alignment with the DNA phosphates, binding DNA, and repeating the translocation cycle. After one headful DNA is packaged, a signal is presumably transmitted to gp17, causing it to dissociate from the capsid and make the termination cut (13.Alam T.I. Draper B. Kondabagil K. Rentas F.J. Ghosh-Kumar M. Sun S. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1180-1190PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the ATPase, translocase, and nuclease activities of the packaging motor are precisely coordinated to package one complement of viral genome into each capsid. Tailed phages express another packaging/terminase protein, the small terminase, which is also essential for phage viability (1.Rao V.B. Feiss M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 647-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2.Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Mutations in the T4 small terminase, gp16, result in the production of empty proheads (19.Luftig R.B. Ganz C. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 545-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small terminase, unlike the large terminase, does not possess any enzymatic activities, although a weak low affinity ATPase activity was reported for the phage λ small terminase, gpNu1 (20.Sumner-Smith M. Becker A. Gold M. Virology. 1981; 111: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21.Feiss M. Catalano C.E. Catalano C.E. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure and Mechanis.

Casjens S.R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), the small terminase recognizes a sequence in the viral genome and helps assemble a holoenzyme complex by interacting with the large terminase (1.Rao V.B. Feiss M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 647-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26.Catalano C.E. Cue D. Feiss M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The nuclease activity of the large terminase then cleaves the DNA concatamer at a nearby site, and the complex then docks on to the portal to initiate translocation (1.Rao V.B. Feiss M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 647-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the T4 gp16, unlike the cos and pac phage small terminases, shows weak nonspecific binding to DNA, that too only in a partially folded state (27.Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the mature phage genomic ends are nearly random (28.Lin H. Black L.W. Virology. 1998; 242: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29.Rao V.B. Black L.W. Catalano C.E. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure and Mechanism. Landes Biosci, Georgetown, TX2005: 40-58Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that the small terminase may play broader roles in the post-DNA recognition steps of the packaging process (30.Kondabagil K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus there is much to be understood about the mechanism of action of the small terminase in DNA packaging. Here we report mutational and biochemical analyses of gp16, which show that gp16 contains three functional domains, a central domain that is required for oligomerization, and N- and C-terminal domains that are required for gp17-ATPase stimulation. 5gp17 is a weak ATPase (kcat = ∼1–2 ATPs hydrolyzed/min/gp17 molecule). The gp17 rate of ATP hydrolysis is increased by ∼50-fold in the presence of gp16 (31). Our results further show that gp16 stimulates the gp17-ATPase activity by triggering the hydrolysis of gp17-bound ATP in a manner similar to that of the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). gp16 modulates gp17-dependent DNA translocation through interaction with the prohead-assembled gp17 complex. gp16 restricts gp17-nuclease such that the putative packaging initiation cut is made but extensive random DNA cutting is inhibited. These data suggest that the gp16 small terminase is a global regulator of the T4 DNA packaging motor, modulating the ATPase, translocase, and nuclease activities of the large terminase gp17. Such a regulator might be essential for orchestrating various activities of the packaging process. Hypotheses on how a small regulator molecule can modulate a complex motor are discussed. The g16 DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using purified phage T4 DNA as template and appropriate primers. The N- and C-terminal truncation clones were constructed by amplifying the desired part of g16. The single point mutants, R41A, R53E, R81A, Q61A, and D44A, were constructed by PCR-directed splicing-by-overlap-extension strategy that was described in detail elsewhere (32.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar, 14.Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amplified DNAs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with appropriate restriction enzyme(s), and ligated to the linearized pET-15b or pET-28b plasmid DNA. Insertion in the right orientation results in the fusion of gp16 in-frame with a ∼25-amino acid vector sequence containing hexahistidine tag at the N terminus. The ligated DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli XL10 Gold cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), mini-prep plasmid DNAs were prepared by alkaline lysis procedure, and the presence and orientation of inserts were ascertained by restriction digestion and/or amplification with insert-specific primers. The entire insert of each clone was sequenced to ensure the incorporation of mutant sequence and absence of any nonspecific errors (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). The clones were then transferred into the expression strains, E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys-S or E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIPL (33.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The E. coli cells containing a given gp16 mutant clone was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 32 °C for 2 h to overexpress the His-tagged proteins. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and lysed using a French Press. Cell-free extracts were prepared by centrifugation of the lysate at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. All the mutants produced soluble proteins. The supernatant containing soluble gp16 was purified by successive chromatography on Histrap HP (affinity), Mono Q-5/50 GL (ion-exchange), and Hiload Superdex 200 prep-grade (size exclusion) columns using AKTA-PRIME and AKTA-FPLC systems (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) (see Ref. 9.Kanamaru S. Kondabagil K. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40795-40801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar for additional details). The purified proteins were concentrated by Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored at −70 °C. The proteins were ∼95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue R staining. ATPase assays were performed as per the basic procedure described previously (31.Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The purified gp17 6gp17-K577 (amino acids 1–577) in which the C-terminal 33 amino acids were deleted was used in all the experiments reported here. This protein retained all the biological functions of the full-length gp17, including DNA packaging in a defined system. (0.2–0.5 μm) either alone or with gp16 (2–5 μm) were incubated in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 1 mm unlabeled ATP and 75 nm [γ32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) at 37 °C in ATPase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to 50 mm final concentration, and the products were separated by thin layer chromatography on PEI-cellulose plates (Sigma-Aldrich). The amount of 32Pi was quantified by phosphorimaging (Storm 820, Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare), and the total Pi produced was calculated from the 32Pi value. The data shown are an average of duplicates from two or three independent experiments. Native gradient (4% to 20%, w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used under non-denaturing conditions to separate various species of the purified proteins (30.Kondabagil K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R. The purified gp17 (1.4 μm) and gp16 (1 μm-18 μm) were incubated either alone, or as a mixture, with 3 μm of either [γ-32P]8N3ATP or [α-32P]8N3ATP, or with 5 μm [γ-32P]2N3ATP (Affinity Labeling Technologies, Lexington, KY) in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min on ice and 1-μl aliquots were withdrawn for thin layer chromatography. The rest of the sample was subjected to cross-linking by exposing to UV light (365 nm) for 5 min at 4 °C at 5-cm height (15.Goetzinger K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SDS-sample buffer was added, and the samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE (12% gel). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R, and the amount of bound nucleotide was quantified by phosphorimaging. The purified gp17 (1.5 μm) was incubated either alone or in the presence of gp16 (0.067–0.333 μm) with purified proheads (6 × 109 particles) and 300 ng of 48-kb phage λ DNA (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP for 45 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was deproteinized by the addition of 50 mm EDTA and 0.5 μg/μl of proteinase K (Fermentas) plus 0.2% SDS and incubation for 30 min at 65 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and the amount of DNase-protected DNA was quantified by Gel DOC XR imaging system (Bio-Rad) (10.Kondabagil K.R. Zhang Z. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purified gp17 (0.2–1 μm) was incubated either alone or in the presence of gp16 (0.2–10 μm) with 100 ng of pAD10 plasmid DNA (29 kb) in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 15–30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the samples were electrophoresed on 1.0% (w/v) agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining (13.Alam T.I. Draper B. Kondabagil K. Rentas F.J. Ghosh-Kumar M. Sun S. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1180-1190PubMed Google Scholar). gp16 has a predicted helix-turn-helix motif at the N terminus that is presumably required for viral genome recognition, and 2–3 coiled-coil motifs (CCM) that are required for oligomerization into what appears to be octamers (Fig. 1) (27.Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Kondabagil K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36.Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The central CCM-1 containing two classic heptad sequences is especially critical as mutations in this motif disrupt coiled-coil interactions and impair gp16 oligomerization. The monomeric wild-type (WT) gp16, or the CCM-1 mutant (L103R-I110H), unlike the gp16 oligomer, is unable to stimulate gp17-ATPase (30.Kondabagil K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Programs that predict linker regions between domains, namely DLP-SVM, DisEMBEL, and DISOPRED2, predict two linkers between amino acids 34–44 and 116–125 with the highest probability for disorder at Pro-38 and Ala-120, respectively (Fig. 1). Functional analyses (see below) show that both the N- and C-terminal regions of gp16 are required for binding to gp17 or ATP. Thus gp16 appears to have three domains; a central oligomerization domain flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal domains that interact with DNA, ATP, and gp17. This domain organization is consistent with the proteolysis results that produced a protease-resistant 9.5-kDa core domain corresponding to amino acids 36–115. 7S. Sun, personal communication. Progressive deletions at the C terminus of gp16, T139 (amino acids 1-T139), I128 (amino acids 1-I128), and V115 (amino acids 1-V115) (Fig. 2, A and B, see Fig. 1), did not affect oligomerization (Fig. 2C), although the gp17-ATPase stimulation was progressively reduced (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, the T111 (amino acids 1-T111) mutant in which the deletion extended into two of the seven heptad-2 residues of CCM-1 showed no discernable difference in oligomerization but showed greater than 50% loss of gp17-ATPase stimulation (Fig. 2D, lanes 21–24 in E). The M107 construct in which six of seven heptad-2 residues were deleted completely lost oligomerization (Fig. 2C, lane 7) as well as gp17-ATPase stimulation (Fig. 2D, lanes 25–28 in E). Deletions at the N terminus, L9 (amino acids L9–164), I12 (amino acids I12–164), and S36 (amino acids S36–164) also retained oligomerization and gp17-ATPase stimulation (Fig. 3). But deletions at both N and C termini, I12-T111, I12-T115, E22-I128, and S36-V115 retained oligomerization but lost the ATPase stimulation. Only the E22-I128 mutant in which a small part of the C-domain is present showed very weak stimulation. Another N- and C-terminal mutant, E27-T94, in which the C-terminal deletion extended into CCM-1 completely lost both oligomerization and gp17-ATPase stimulation activities (Fig. 3D and data not shown). gp16 cross-linked to 8N3- ATP, GTP, ADP, or AMP with nearly the same affinity as gp17 (Kd = 1–5 mm), suggesting that gp16 has a nucleotide binding site with broad specificity (Ref. 37, Fig. 4, and data not shown). However, unlike gp17, gp16 showed no hydrolysis of ATP (or any other nucleotide). No canonical ATP binding motifs such as Walker A or Walker B are present in the gp16 sequence (36.Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The gp16 mutants tested, deletions in C-terminal domain or in both C- and N-terminal domains, lost ATP (Fig. 4A), or ADP (Fig. 4B) cross-linking activity. Several gp16 mutants that lost nucleotide binding (e.g. T139, I128, V115, T111) retained gp17-ATPase stimulation (see Fig. 2D). Furthermore, even the apparent differences in the basal level nonspecific cross-linking of various mutants did not correlate with their ability to stimulate ATPase. For instance, the I12-T111 mutant that lost gp17-ATPase stimulation showed similar basal level ATP binding as the T111 mutant which retained ATPase stimulation. In essence, the results show that ATP binding to gp16 is not essential for ATPase stimulation. Stimulation of gp17-ATPase by gp16 is analogous to GTPase/ATPase stimulation by the nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (38.Wieden H.J. Gromadski K. Rodnin D. Rodnina M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6032-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (39.Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A.

Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A hallmark of the nucleotide exchange factors is that they catalyze exchange of NDP product with NTP substrate in the catalytic site of GTPases and ATPases. One method to assess this activity is by showing reduced binding or increased release of nucleoside diphosphate in the presence of an exchange factor. Also, these factors sometimes require acidic residues (38.Wieden H.J. Gromadski K. Rodnin D. Rodnina M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6032-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutation at the conserved acidic residue, Asp-44, retained gp17-ATPase stimulation as well as oligomerization (Fig. 5, C and D). Both gp16 and gp17 bind ADP (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). gp17 binding to ADP was unaffected by gp16 (lane 3). Preloading of gp17 with ADP followed by addition of gp16 did not cause significant release of bound ADP (lane 5). Nor the preloading of gp16 with ADP affected the binding of ADP to gp17 (lane 4). Thus, under the conditions tested, ADP binding to, or release from, gp17-ATPase is not affected by the presence of gp16.FIGURE 6gp16 does not show nucleotide exchange activity. WT gp17 (1 μm) and WT gp16 (8.5 μm) either alone (lanes 1 and 2) or together (lane 3) were incubated with 5 μm [α-32P]8N3ADP for 5 min prior to UV cross-linking. For lane 4, gp16 was preincubated with [α-32P] 8N3ADP for 5 min before the addition of gp17. For lane 5, gp17 was preincubated with [α32P] 8N3ADP for 5 min before the addition of gp16.

However, no gp16 cross-linking was observed when 2N3-ATP was used (column 2C, lanes 2–7), which is likely due to the lack of a cross-linkable lysine in the gp16 structure near the 2-azido group of bound nucleotide. Addition of increasing amounts of gp16 to gp17 resulted in progressive decrease of gp17-bound ATP (columns 2 and 4) and a corresponding increase in the amount of ATP hydrolyzed (columns 3 and 4). Maximum hydrolysis was observed at a gp16 (oligomer):gp17 (monomer) ratio of ∼1:1 or higher. The same behavior was observed with 8N3-[γ-32-P]ATP, 8N3-[α-32P]ATP, and 2N3-[γ-32P]ATP, with the full-length gp17 or the gp17-ATPase domain, with or without preloading gp17 with ATP (Fig. 7; additional data shown in Ref. 37.Al-Zahrani A. Biochemical Mechanism of the DNA Packaging ATPase from Bacteriophage T4. Catholic University of America, 2006Google Scholar). GAPs either provide an arginine finger, or their interaction with GTPase positions an arginine finger (or glutamine) into the catalytic site, triggering bond cleavage (41.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R.

Several arginines (Arg-41, Arg-53, Arg-81) and a glutamine (Gln-61) that are conserved in the T4 family small terminases (see Fig. 1) were tested to see whether any of these are essential for gp17-ATPase stimulation (Fig. 5, A and B). All the mutants retained gp17-ATPase stimulation activity (Fig. 5, C and D), and none showed any loss of oligomerization (data not shown). In a crude in vitro DNA packaging system, gp16 enhances packaging efficiency (27.Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol.

The most obvious function for these inhibitors would be the protection of the midgut against injury by the complement. To investigate this hypothesis, Triatoma brasiliensis nymphs were forced to ingest human serum in conditions in which the protection of midgut by the inhibitors is bypassed. In these conditions, the anterior midgut epithelium was injured by the complement, causing cell death. Once some insects such as Aedes aegypti have no salivary inhibitors, we hypothesized the existence of intestinal inhibitors. The inhibitory activity was investigated in the intestine of A. aegypti as well as in the saliva and intestine of other three triatomine species (T. brasiliensis, T. infestans and Rhodnius prolixus) using an immunological method able to determine the level of deposition of some complement factors (C1q, C3b, or C4b) on the surface of complement activator molecules linked to microplates. This methodology permitted to identify which points along the activation phase of the complement cascade were inhibited. As expected, soluble contents of A. aegypti's intestine was capable to inhibit C3b deposition by the classical and alternative pathways. Saliva or soluble intestinal contents, obtained from triatomines were unable to inhibit C1q deposition by the classical pathway. C4b deposition by the classical pathway was inhibited by the intestinal contents from the three triatomines. On the other hand, only T. brasiliensis saliva inhibited C4b deposition. Both, saliva and intestinal contents from all triatomines were able to inhibit C3b deposition in the classical and alternative pathways. None of the material extracted from the intestinal cell membranes from the triatomines inhibited C3b deposition in the classical pathway. The existence of complement inhibitors may have important biological consequences which are discussed in detail."

Integrin activation and cell spreading is critical for the activation of B cells by membrane-bound antigens. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and follicular dendritic cells can present arrays of captured antigens to B cells (8Bergtold A. Desai D.D. Gavhane A. Clynes R.

Brau F. Glaichenhaus N. Germain R.N. Immunity. 2006; 25: 989-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). BCR-induced integrin activation prolongs the interaction between the B cell and the antigen-presenting cell and also allows the B cell to spread on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell such that more BCRs can encounter and bind membrane-bound antigens (11Fleire S.J. Goldman J.P. Carrasco Y.R. Weber M. Bray D. Batista F.D. Science. 2006; 312: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Subsequent contraction of the B cell membrane allows the B cells to gather the BCR-bound antigen into an immune synapse in which clustered antigen-engaged BCRs are surrounded by a ring of ligand-bound integrins. Formation of this immune synapse reduces the amount of antigen that is required for B cell activation (12Carrasco Y.R. Fleire S.J. Cameron T. Dustin M.L. Batista F.D.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Recent work has shown that B cells in lymphoid organs may contact soluble antigens by extending membrane processes into a highly organized network of lymph-filled conduits (14Roozendaal R.

These conduits are created by fibroblastic reticular cells that partially ensheathe collagen fibrils. In addition to being rich in collagen, fibronectin, and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components, the fibroblastic reticular cells that form these conduits express high levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, the ligand for the αLβ2 integrin (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)) on B cells (10Bajénoff M.

Thus B cells interacting with these conduits are likely to be in contact with integrin ligands, and integrin-dependent spreading may enhance the ability of B cells to extend membrane processes into the fibroblastic reticular cell conduit.In addition to promoting cell spreading, integrins can act as co-stimulatory receptors that enhance signaling by many receptors including the T cell receptor and the BCR (15Bachmann M.F.

However, the role of these kinases in BCR- and integrin-induced B cell spreading has not been investigated, and the signaling pathways that link the BCR and integrins to tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK have not been elucidated.We have shown previously that the ability of the BCR to induce integrin activation, B cell spreading, and immune synapse formation requires activation of the Rap GTPases (6Lin K.B.

In addition to binding effector proteins such as RapL and Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) that promote integrin activation (35Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Moreover we showed that BCR/integrin-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 in B cells is dependent on Rap activation (17McLeod S.J. Shum A.J. Lee R.L. Takei F. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12009-12019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, this previous study did not address how Rap-GTP links the BCR and integrins to Pyk2 phosphorylation, whether Rap activation is important for FAK phosphorylation in B cells, or whether B cell spreading is regulated by Pyk2 or FAK. We now show that Pyk2 and FAK are differentially expressed and localized in B cells, that Pyk2 and FAK are important for B cell spreading, and that integrin engagement enhances BCR-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK, a process that depends on both Rap activation and actin dynamics.DISCUSSIONThe binding of antigens by B cells often occurs in the context of integrin engagement. Integrin-dependent cell spreading enhances the ability of B cells to contact antigens, and integrin signaling may synergize with BCR signaling to promote both B cell spreading and activation. The Pyk2 and FAK kinases are key regulators of cell morphology, and in this report we showed that the kinase activities of Pyk2 and FAK are important for BCR/integrin-induced B cell spreading. Moreover we showed that integrins enhance the ability of the BCR to phosphorylate Pyk2 and FAK on their auto/transphosphorylation sites, the initial step in the activation of these kinases. Finally we showed that both Rap activation and actin dynamics were critical for BCR/integrin-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK.We had shown previously that integrin engagement enhances BCR-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation (17McLeod S.J. Shum A.J. Lee R.L. Takei F. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12009-12019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and we have now shown that the same is true for FAK phosphorylation. Moreover by clustering integrins with Abs, we showed that integrin signaling was sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK in B cells. Thus signaling by antigen-clustered BCR complexes and ligand-bound integrins can have additive effects on the phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK. This highlights the ability of integrins to act as co-stimulatory receptors that collaborate with lymphocyte antigen receptors. Pyk2 and FAK appeared to be selective targets of the BCR/integrin collaboration as integrin engagement did not enhance BCR-induced phosphorylation of other signaling proteins such as Erk, Akt, and paxillin.We also showed that activation of the Rap GTPases was critical for BCR/integrin signaling to induce the phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK on their auto/transphosphorylation sites as well as tyrosine residues in their activation loops. Although Rap-GTP likely contributes to Pyk2 and FAK phosphorylation by activating integrins on B cells (17McLeod S.J. Shum A.J. Lee R.L. Takei F. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12009-12019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we found that activated Rap also acts downstream of the BCR to promote Pyk2 phosphorylation and downstream of integrins to promote the phosphorylation of Pyk2 and FAK. The active GTP-bound form of Rap binds multiple effector proteins that promote actin polymerization and the stabilization of F-actin polymers (38Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Many of the downstream consequences of Rap activation may therefore reflect its role in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed we found that the Rap-dependent steps in Pyk2 and FAK phosphorylation were also blocked by actin-disrupting drugs. This suggests that Rap-GTP promotes Pyk2 and FAK phosphorylation via its ability to remodel the actin cytoskeleton. Rap1 activation was not dependent on actin dynamics, suggesting that the requirement for actin remodeling lies downstream of Rap activation.Although Pyk2 phosphorylation has been shown to require an intact actin cytoskeleton in a number of cell types (21Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), how this contributes to Pyk2 phosphorylation is not clear. Phosphorylation of Pyk2 on Tyr402 may involve Pyk2 dimerization and subsequent transphosphorylation (51Park S.Y. Avraham H.K. Avraham S. J. Biol.

Rap-dependent actin polymerization could create a cytoskeletal platform that promotes Pyk2 dimerization. However, we found that treating B cells with the actin-stabilizing agent jasplakinolide also prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, indicating that polymerized F-actin is not sufficient to support receptor-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation. Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton may be required for efficient Pyk2 dimerization. Alternatively Pyk2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo may require cycles of actin polymerization and depolymerization that regulate either the kinase activity of Pyk2 or the accessibility of its catalytic site.In contrast to Pyk2, Rap activation and actin dynamics were required for integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation but not for BCR-induced FAK phosphorylation in A20 B lymphoma cells. For integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation, Rap activation was required for the initial step in FAK activation, phosphorylation of Tyr397, an event that is initiated by transphosphorylation and that can be amplified by Src family kinase (56Zeng L. Si X. Yu W.P. Le H.T. Ng K.P. Teng R.M. Ryan K. Wang D.Z. Ponniah S. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). How Rap activation and F-actin contribute to integrin-induced FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation is not clear. Our microscopy data suggest that FAK constitutively co-localizes with integrins in B cells. Rap activation and actin polymerization could therefore contribute to the recruitment and/or stabilization of other proteins that regulate FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation. In adherent cells that form focal adhesions, integrin activation results in the recruitment of talin to the integrin α and β chain cytoplasmic domains (57Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Ilic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This allows FAK to interact with paxillin and undergo autophosphorylation. At the same time, activation of Src family kinases by protein-tyrosine phosphatase α increases the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397. Further work is required to determine whether Rap and F-actin promote integrin-dependent FAK phosphorylation by regulating these steps in B cells. Interestingly Rap activation and F-actin were not required for BCR-induced phosphorylation of FAK when the cells were in suspension, a situation in which there is minimal integrin engagement. FAK has been reported to associate constitutively with the Src family kinase Lyn and with the BCR in WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells (33Mlinaric-Rascan I. Yamamoto T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). FAK phosphorylation could therefore be a proximal Rap-independent BCR signaling event that is initiated by BCR.A key finding was that Pyk2 and FAK are important for B cell spreading that is initiated by BCR/integrin co-stimulation or by integrin clustering. This is consistent with Pyk2 and FAK being downstream targets of Rap because blocking Rap activation also prevents B cell spreading (6Lin K.B. Freeman S.A. Zabetian S. Brugger H. Weber M. Lei V.

Knocking down the expression of either Pyk2 or FAK in A20 B lymphoma cells reduced the ability of these cells to undergo cell spreading, whereas PF-431396, a dual specificity inhibitor of the kinase activities of both Pyk2 and FAK, substantially inhibited A20 cell spreading. This suggests that both Pyk2 and FAK contribute to the ability of A20 B lymphoma cells to undergo cell spreading. Moreover the use of PF-431396 showed that the kinase activities of Pyk2 and FAK were critical for B cell spreading.Although it is not known how Pyk2 and FAK promote B cell spreading, these kinases may coordinate the activation of Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA, GTPases that control cytoskeletal organization. In T lymphocytes, Pyk2 binds Vav (50Ostergaard H.L. Lysechko T.L. Immunol. Res. 2005; 31: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), an exchange factor that activates Rac. Both Pyk2 and FAK can interact with the RhoA activator p190RhoGEF (58Lim Y. Lim S.T. Tomar A. Gardel M. Bernard-Trifilo J.A. Chen X.L. Uryu S.A. Canete-Soler R. Zhai J. Lin H. Schlaepfer W.W. Nalbant P. Bokoch G. Ilic D. Waterman-Storer C. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and in fibroblasts Pyk2 associates with Wrch1, a Cdc42-like GTPase that promotes the formation of filopodia (59Ruusala A. Aspenström P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1802-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pyk2 and FAK can also bind the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase following integrin ligation (60Sarkar S. Svoboda M. de Beaumont R. Freedman A.S. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2002; 43: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 61Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate produced by phosphoinositide 3-kinase activates Vav and promotes Rac-dependent actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Pyk2 and FAK can also bind and phosphorylate the scaffolding proteins p130Cas and paxillin, which can then recruit the Rac activators DOCK180 and PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX), leading to Rac-dependent membrane ruffling (61Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar).An interesting observation was that when B cells were activated with LPS plus IL-4 Pyk2 levels decreased, but FAK levels increased significantly. B cells activated in this manner resemble antigen-activated germinal center (GC) B cells, which proliferate within lymphoid organ follicles and undergo somatic hypermutation of their Ig genes. These GC B cells then compete for limiting amounts of antigen that are displayed on the surface of follicular dendritic cells, which provide the B cells with survival signals. GC B cells interacting with follicular dendritic cells in vivo exhibit a spread morphology with multiple membrane processes (62Allen C.D. Okada T. Tang H.L. Cyster J.G. Science. 2007; 315: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 63Hauser A.E. Junt T. Mempel T.R. Sneddon M.W. Kleinstein S.H. Henrickson S.E. von Andrian U.H. Shlomchik M.J. Haberman A.M. Immunity. 2007; 26: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This presumably increases their ability to detect antigens on the surface of the follicular dendritic cell. The activation-induced increase in FAK expression may reflect a switch from the motile phenotype of a circulating B cell to the more adhesive phenotype of an activated GC B cell. FAK expression and activation are associated with sustained adhesion at least in B cell progenitors (34Glodek A.M. Le Y. Dykxhoorn D.M. Park S.Y. Mostoslavsky G. Mulligan R. Lieberman J. Beggs H.E. Honczarenko M. Silberstein L.E. Leukemia. 2007; 21: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A number of adhesion molecules including α6 integrin are up-regulated in activated GC B cells (64Ambrose H.E. Wagner S.D. Immunology. 2004; 111: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 65Klein U. Tu Y. Stolovitzky G.A. Keller J.L. Haddad Jr., J. Miljkovic V. Cattoretti G. Califano A. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and gene expression profiling has shown that FAK mRNA levels are elevated in GC B cells (66Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H. Tran T. Yu X. Powell J.I. Yang L. Marti G.E. Moore T. Hudson Jr., J. Lu L. Lewis D.B. Tibshirani R. Sherlock G. Chan W.C.

Nature. 2000; 403: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (7919) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased expression of FAK after B cell activation may be part of a proadhesion gene expression program in which FAK promotes integrin-dependent adhesion and cell spreading, which facilitate BCR-antigen interactions that provide survival signals for GC B cells. Similarly the change in Pyk2 mRNA splicing in activated B cells may allow Pyk2 to interact with additional proteins that control cell adhesion or cytoskeletal reorganization. In summary, we have shown that Pyk2 and FAK are downstream targets of the Rap GTPases that play an important role in B cell spreading, a process that contributes to B cell activation.

https://openalex.org/W2008391022,"One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner-to-outer plasma membrane (PM) leaflet, where it functions as a ligand for phagocyte recognition and the suppression of inflammatory responses. The mechanism by which apoptotic cells externalize PS has been assumed to involve “scramblases” that randomize phospholipids across the PM bilayer. These putative activities, however, have not been unequivocally proven to be responsible for the redistribution of lipids. Because elevated cytosolic Ca2+ is critical to this process and is also required for activation of lysosome-PM fusion during membrane repair, we hypothesized that apoptosis could activate a “pseudo”-membrane repair response that results in the fusion of lysosomes with the PM. Using a membrane-specific probe that labels endosomes and lysosomes and fluorescein-labeled annexin 5 that labels PS, we show that the appearance of PS at the cell surface during apoptosis is dependent on the fusion of lysosomes with the PM, a process that is inhibited with the lysosomotrophe, chloroquine. We demonstrate that apoptotic cells evoke a persistent pseudo-membrane repair response that likely redistributes lysosomal-derived PS to the PM outer leaflet that leads to membrane expansion and the formation of apoptotic blebs. Our data suggest that inhibition of lysosome-PM fusion-dependent redistribution of PS that occurs as a result of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis will prevent PS-dependent anti-inflammatory responses that preclude the development of tumor- and patient-specific immune responses.

Because high cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations trigger lysosome-PM fusion, the elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels characteristic to apoptotic cells may also evoke a pseudo-repair mechanism that promotes lysosome-PM fusion. Indeed, similar to normal emergency repair responses, apoptosis is characterized by the appearance of organelle proteins and lipids at the PM surface (6Sorice M. Circella A. Misasi R. Pittoni V.

Biochem. 2003; 133: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One critical distinction between the apoptotic and physiologic repair processes is the preservation of membrane lipid asymmetry. In normal cells, any perturbation in PS sidedness is corrected by restoration of basal cytosolic [Ca2+], reactivation of the Ca2+-inhibited aminophospholipid translocase (9Williamson P. Kulick A. Zachowski A. Schlegel R.A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Williamson P. Bevers E.M. Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Schlegel R.A. Zwaal R.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and subsequent facilitated transport of PS back to the inner membrane leaflet of the cell. In apoptotic cells, however, persistent high cytosolic [Ca2+] precludes reactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase, and the redistributed PS remains in the outer membrane leaflet (11Balasubramanian K. Mirnikjoo B. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18357-18364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The apparent similarities in these processes combined with observations that apoptotic cells express PS at the cell surface prompted us to investigate whether lysosome to PM fusion plays a role in the redistribution of PS during apoptosis. plasma membrane chloroquine murine embryonic fibroblasts N-rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine staurosporine HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution fluorescein isothiocyanate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium benzyloxycarbonyl 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml uridine, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Staurosporine (STS; apoptosis-inducing agent), colchicine (microtubule disruptor), latrunculin (inhibitor of actin polymerization), and chloroquine (CLQ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were plated onto 2.5-cm glass coverslips (∼106 cells) overnight. Apoptosis was initiated by incubating the cells with staurosporine (0.5 μm) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were analyzed for PS externalization using FITC-labeled annexin 5 or lactadherin in 0.5 ml of HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (HHBS) containing 2 mm CaCl2 (for the annexin 5 only) that was added for ∼5 min at 20 °C immediately before examination of the cells. For the detection of PS in the lumen of endocytotic vesicles, FITC-annexin 5 was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. For DNA fragmentation (propidium iodide/cell cycle analysis), cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase (1 μg/ml) followed by propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) prior to suspension and flow cytometry. Caspase 3 activity was determined fluorometrically in 0.1% Triton X-100 cell lysates (4 × 106 cells) using z-DEVD-AMC (0.5 μm) as described previously (11Balasubramanian K. Mirnikjoo B. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18357-18364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Caspase activity was expressed as the rate of increase in fluorescent intensity (λex 380 nm, λem 510 nm) at 20 °C. To simultaneously monitor the endosomal and PM staining, MEF cultured on glass coverslips were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM. N-Rhodamine-labeled-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-rho-PE) (5 μl from a 1 mg/ml ethanol solution) (12Struck D.K. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5404-5410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Connor J. Schroit A.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5099-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was added in the absence or presence of FITC-labeled dextran (200 μg/ml; Invitrogen) or LysoTracker Green (1 μm). After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed with DMEM containing 10% serum (back-exchanged) to remove residual, non-internalized N-rho-PE. The cultures were then resuspended in HHBS or DMEM and further incubated at 37 °C with STS or treated A23187/Ca2+ for the indicated times. Back-exchanged N-rho-PE-labeled cells were incubated with A23187 (1 μm) (Sigma) in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with FITC-annexin 5 and analyzed for the externalization of PS and N-rho-PE by confocal microscopy. Cytosolic [Ca2+] was restored to normal levels in back-exchanged N-rho-PE-labeled cells after Ca2+ ionophore treatment by incubating the cells in (Ca2+-free) EGTA-containing medium (2 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. The presence of PS at the cell surface was then monitored with FITC-lactadherin, which binds PS in a Ca2+-independent manner (14Dasgupta S.K. Guchhait P. Thiagarajan P. Transl. Res. 2006; 148: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MEF cells were stained with monoclonal rat anti-LAMP1 (United States Biological) followed by anti-rat cy5-labeled Ig. The cells were also incubated with annexin 5 and monitored for the presence of the fluorescent probes by confocal microscopy. Fluorescent images of live cells following the various treatments were recorded with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an Achroplan 63× water immersion lens using appropriate excitation lines and emission filter sets. For presentation purposes, the raw images were organized into plates using PhotoShop. To monitor de novo formation and trafficking of endosomes, MEF were incubated with the aqueous space marker, fluorescein-labeled dextran (FITC-dextran), and the membrane probe, N-rho-PE (12Struck D.K. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5404-5410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endosome formation was then initiated by incubating the cells at 37 °C. Fig. 1a shows that the N-rho-PE that exchanged into the PM of the cell also labeled the membranes of pinocytotic vesicles that also contained lumen-entrapped FITC-dextran. To monitor only the labeled vesicles, residual N-rho-PE remaining in the PM was removed by back-exchange with 10% serum, leaving the red fluorescent label only in the internal organelles (Fig. 1b). To confirm delivery of late endosomes to lysosomes, the maturation of hybrid organelles was established by substituting LysoTracker Green for FITC-dextran. Fig. 1b shows a significant degree of probe colocalization, indicating that many of the rhodamine-labeled endosomes formed hybrid lysosome/endosome organelles. The ability of apoptotic cells to mount a cell death-dependent emergency repair response was assessed by monitoring the migration of rhodamine-labeled lysosomal membranes to the cell surface in response to treatment with STS. In contrast to the preferential perinuclear distribution of the labeled organelles in control cells (Fig. 1a), in apoptotic cells, the organelles migrated toward the subplasmalemmal space (Fig. 1c). Together with the expected finding that these cells stained with FITC-annexin 5, indicating that PS redistributed to the cell surface, most striking was the redistribution of lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) and red organelle fluorescence to the PM (Fig. 1d). Without exception, every apoptotic cell bearing redistributed PS also redistributed vesicular N-rho-PE back to the PM (Fig. 1e). Exhaustive examination of >300 cells revealed that <1% contained single color fluorescent rings. Enforced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] with Ca2+ ionophore are known to trigger both PS externalization (10Williamson P. Bevers E.M. Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Schlegel R.A. Zwaal R.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and a membrane repair-dependent response that triggers fusion of lysosomes with the PM (4Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 5Rodríguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Taken together with our results, these studies raise the possibility that PS externalization could be dependent on lysosome fusion to the PM. To determine whether the redistribution of PS is dependent on the migration of lysosomes to the PM, cells were treated with the actin- and microtubule-disrupting reagents, latrunculin and colchicine. Fig. 2a shows that cells incubated with latrunculin, but not colchicine, inhibited both lysosome fusion and the redistribution of PS. Treatment of cells with the CLQ increases lysosomal pH and inhibits their trafficking and fusion to the PM (16Hart P.D. Young M.R. Jordan M.M. Perkins W.J. Geisow M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether CLQ also affects PS externalization, we tested the ability of the drug to inhibit Ca2+ ionophore- and STS-induced lipid rearrangements. Examination of cells incubated with CLQ revealed the presence of giant N-rho-PE-labeled lysosomes (Fig. 2, b, c, and f) that did not migrate to the subplasmalemmal space (Fig. 2a). Confocal microscopy of Ca2+ ionophore- (Fig. 2b) and STS-treated cells (Fig. 2c) showed that CLQ inhibited both the redistribution of PS and the fusion of N-rho-PE-labeled organelles to the PM. Although CLQ inhibited lipid redistribution and lysosome-PM fusion, it did not affect the ability of the cells to undergo apoptosis because STS-treated cells incubated in the presence and absence of the drug exhibited essentially identical levels of caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2, d and e). Electron microscopic analysis of the CLQ-treated cells revealed that both ionophore-triggered and STS-triggered organelle to PM fusion (asterisks) was inhibited (Fig. 2f). The data presented above suggest that the redistribution of PS to the outer membrane leaflet of the cell is dependent on lysosome to PM trafficking and fusion of the lysosomes with the PM. Because interleaflet lipid distributions appear to be preserved during membrane fusion (17Klotz K.H. Bartoldus I. Stegmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2383-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Yeung T. Terebiznik M. Yu L. Silvius J. Abidi W.M. Philips M. Levine T. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2006; 313: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the fusion process itself is unlikely to contribute to PS externalization. Interestingly, using annexin 5 and PS antibodies, Yeung et al. (18Yeung T. Terebiznik M. Yu L. Silvius J. Abidi W.M. Philips M. Levine T. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2006; 313: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) showed that PS became depleted from the cytosolic face of newly formed phagolysosomes. To determine whether the exclusion of PS might be due to its transport to the outer PM leaflet-derived luminal endosome leaflet, the presence of PS within newly formed endocytotic vesicles was determined after back-exchange of cells incubated with FITC-annexin 5 and N-rho-PE for 1 at 37 °C. 3This experiment is based on the concept that dilute FITC-annexin 5 is transparent under confocal microscopy because its concentration is below detection limits. In the presence of Ca2+ and membrane PS, however, the probe sequesters to the membrane surface, effectively increasing its local concentration above detection limits. Surprisingly, the endosomal compartment became intensely labeled with both annexin 5 and N-rho-PE (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that PS redistributed from the PM inner leaflet (18Yeung T. Terebiznik M. Yu L. Silvius J. Abidi W.M. Philips M. Levine T. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2006; 313: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) to the (N-rho-PE labeled) outer PM-derived endosomal luminal leaflet. Although we cannot rule out the contribution of a true scramblase activity that might regulate interleaflet lipid mixing (15Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), these data raise the possibility that PS externalized to the cell surface during apoptosis originates from the luminal lysosomal leaflet that fuses back to the outer PM leaflet. Our data indicate that the principal difference between PM damage repair in normal and apoptotic cells is the restoration of membrane PS asymmetry. Because Ca2+-dependent cellular responses evoke both lysosomal membrane repair mechanisms and PS externalization, one of the major differences between the responses in normal and apoptotic cells could be related to persistent increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels in apoptotic cells. If this is the case, then depletion of cytosolic Ca2+ should, in principle, restore a normal phenotype to apoptotic cells. To test this, lysosome to PM fusion and PS externalization was triggered with Ca2+ ionophore (Fig. 3b). Cytosolic Ca2+ was then removed by washing the cells with EGTA-containing medium. The cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min to facilitate reactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase (10Williamson P. Bevers E.M. Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Schlegel R.A. Zwaal R.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The presence of PS at the cell surface was then monitored with FITC-lactadherin that binds PS in the absence of Ca2+ (14Dasgupta S.K. Guchhait P. Thiagarajan P. Transl.

The data shown here indicate that although damage to normal and apoptotic cells results in the activation of analogous lysosome-dependent repair mechanisms, normal cells “heal,” whereas apoptotic cells evoke a “suicidal” response. This difference is likely due to inherent deficiencies in the ability of the cell to restore cytosolic [Ca2+] to basal levels. In damaged cells, the membrane disruption site facilitates influx of exogenous Ca2+ that triggers lysosome-PM fusion that patches the damaged area. Once annealed, further Ca2+ entry is blocked, and normal cytosolic [Ca2+] is restored. This results in the reactivation of aminophospholipid translocase activity (9Williamson P. Kulick A. Zachowski A. Schlegel R.A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Williamson P. Bevers E.M. Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Schlegel R.A. Zwaal R.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the restoration of membrane lipid asymmetry, and the cessation of membrane repair. In apoptotic cells, however, persistent elevated cytosolic [Ca2+] results in continuous inhibition of the aminophospholipid translocase and incessant lysosome-PM fusion that leads to exaggerated PM expansion and blebbing. These findings may have important physiologic implications. Similar to PS functioning as a ligand for the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, PS on viral surfaces is also critical to host infection (19Mercer J. Helenius A. Science. 2008; 320: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Because infection triggers virus-induced PS externalization, and in certain instances, host cell apoptosis (20Soares M.M. King S.W. Thorpe P.E. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), virions likely acquire PS by budding from their PS-expressing host cells. In principle, therefore, inhibition of PS externalization in the host cell would produce impotent PS-free virions. Moreover, because PS suppresses inflammatory responses, thereby avoiding the development of immunity (21Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J.

Moreover, because conventional radio- and chemotherapies kill tumor cells through apoptosis, suppressing the expression of PS at the cell surface could provide a new therapeutic modality. In principle, inhibition of lysosome-PM fusion and expression of PS with lysosomotrophic agents could shift “silent” physiologic clearance mechanisms (23Zhao H. Cai Y. Santi S. Lafrenie R. Lee H.

https://openalex.org/W2083917663,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that act by blocking the translation and increasing the degradation of target transcripts. MiRNAs play a critical role in many biological processes including development and differentiation and many studies have shown that major changes in miRNA levels occur in cancer. Since miRNAs degrade target messages, we used this property to develop a novel computational method aimed at determining the actual biological activity of miRNAs using variations in gene expression. Using the method described here, we quantified miRNA activity in papillary thyroid carcinoma and breast cancer, and found a strong and distinctive signal of increased global miRNA activity, embedded in the pertaining gene expression measurements. Interestingly, we found that in these two cancers, miRNA activity is globally increased, and is associated with a global downregulation of miRNA target genes. This downreguation of miRNA regulated genes is particularly noticeable for genes carrying multiple target sites for miRNAs. Among the miRNA-repressed genes, we found a significant enrichment of known tumor suppressors, thereby suggesting that the increased miRNA activity was indeed tumorigenic."
https://openalex.org/W1997304206,"A role for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) in chemotaxis to various agents has been demonstrated in monocyte-derived cell types. Although WASP has been shown to be activated by multiple mechanisms in vitro, it is unclear how WASP is regulated in vivo. A WASP biosensor (WASPbs), which uses intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer to report WASP activation in vivo, was constructed, and following transfection of macrophages, activation of WASPbs upon treatment with colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) was detected globally as early as 30 s and remained localized to protrusive regions at later time points. Similar results were obtained when endogenous WASP activation was determined using conformation-sensitive antibodies. In vivo CSF-1-induced WASP activation was fully Cdc42-dependent. Activation of WASP in response to treatment with CSF-1 was also shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent. However, treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitors PP2 or SU6656 or disruption of the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of WASPbs (Y291F mutation) did not reduce the level of CSF-1-induced WASP activation. Our results indicate that WASP activation downstream of CSF-1R is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and Cdc42-dependent consistent with an involvement of these molecules in macrophage migration. However, although tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP has been proposed to stimulate WASP activity, we found no evidence to indicate that this occurs in vivo."

In the transport cycle, the enzyme is first activated by cooperative binding of two Ca2+ ions at high affinity transport sites (E2 to E1Ca2, steps 1–2) (14Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and autophosphorylated at Asp351 with MgATP to form the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 3), which reacts with ADP to regenerate ATP in the reverse reaction. Upon this E1P formation, the two bound Ca2+ are occluded in the transport sites (E1PCa2). Subsequent isomeric transition to the ADP-insensitive form (E2PCa2), i.e. loss of ADP sensitivity at the catalytic site, results in rearrangement of the Ca2+ binding sites to deocclude Ca2+, reduce the affinity, and open the lumenal gate, thus releasing Ca2+ into the lumen (E2P, steps 4–5). Finally Asp351-acylphosphate in E2P is hydrolyzed to form the Ca2+-unbound inactive E2 state (steps 6 and 7). Mg2+ bound at the catalytic site is required as a physiological catalytic cofactor in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and thus for the transport cycle. The cycle is totally reversible, e.g. E2P can be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+, and subsequent Ca2+ binding at lumenally oriented low affinity transport sites of E2P reverses the Ca2+-releasing step and produces E1PCa2, which is then decomposed to E1Ca2 by ADP. adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase sarcoplasmic reticulum phosphoenzyme ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid thapsigargin 2′(3′)-O-(trinitrophenyl)-AMP octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether nucleotide binding phosphorylation actuator adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate adenosine 5′-diphosphoramidate.

The three cytoplasmic domains, N, P, and A, largely move and change their organization state during the transport cycle, and the changes are coupled with changes in the transport sites. Most remarkably, in the change from E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP (the transition state for E1PCa2 formation, E1PCa2·ADP·Mg‡) to E2·BeF3− (the ground state E2P·Mg) (23Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M.

E1PCa2·Ca·AMP-PN formed by CaAMP-PNP without Mg2+ is nearly the same as E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP and E1Ca2·CaAMP-PCP in their crystal structures (17Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

Despite these atomic structures, yet unsolved is the structure of E1PCa2·Mg, the genuine physiological intermediate E1PCa2 with bound Mg2+ at the catalytic site without the nucleotide. Its stable structural analog has yet to be developed. E1PCa2·Mg is the major intermediate accumulating almost exclusively at steady state under physiological conditions. Its rate-limiting isomerization results in Ca2+ deocclusion/release producing E2P·Mg as a key event for Ca2+ transport. In E1Ca2·CaAMP-PCP, E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP, and E1PCa2·Ca·AMP-PN, the N and P domains are cross-linked and strongly stabilized by the bound nucleotide and/or Ca2+ at the catalytic site, thus they are crystallized (17Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 18Toyoshima C. Mizutani T.

Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Kinetically, E1PCa2·Ca formed with CaATP is markedly stabilized due to Ca2+ binding at the catalytic Mg2+ site, and its isomerization to E2P is strongly retarded in contrast to E1PCa2·Mg (26Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8698-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11524-11531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the bound Ca2+ at the catalytic Mg2+ site likely produces a significantly different structural state from that with bound Mg2+. Therefore, it is now essential to develop a genuine E1PCa2·Mg analog without bound nucleotide and thereby gain further insight into the structural mechanism in the Ca2+ transport process. It is also crucial to further clarify the structural importance of Mg2+ as the physiological catalytic cation. In this study, we successfully developed the complex E1Ca2·BeFx, most probably E1Ca2·BeF3−, as the E1PCa2·Mg analog by adding beryllium fluoride (BeFx) to the E1Ca2 state without any nucleotides. For its formation, Mg2+ binding at the catalytic site was required and Ca2+ substitution for Mg2+ was absolutely unfavorable, revealing a likely structural reason for its preference as the physiological cofactor. In E1Ca2·BeF3−, two Ca2+ ions bound at the high affinity transport sites are occluded. It was also produced from E2·BeF3− by lumenal Ca2+ binding at the lumenally oriented low affinity transport sites, mimicking E2P·Mg + 2Ca2+ → E1PCa2·Mg. All properties of the newly developed E1Ca2·BeF3− fulfilled the requirements as the E1PCa2·Mg analog, and hence we were able to uncover the hitherto unknown nature of E1PCa2·Mg as well as structural events occurring in the phosphorylation and isomerization processes. Also, we successfully found the conditions that perfectly stabilize the E1Ca2·BeF3− complex. SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (28Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J.

The amount of EP formed was determined as described previously (28Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The background level determined with excess 5 mm EGTA was less than 0.5% of the phosphorylation sites. 45Ca2+ binding and occlusion at the transport sites was determined at 25 °C with 2 ml of the SR vesicle mixture (0.2 mg/ml protein) with a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane filter (Millipore) as described (31Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In some cases, the vesicles on the filter were washed for 10 s by perfusion with 2 ml of a washing solution containing 5 mm EGTA. The amount of Ca2+ bound at the transport sites was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific Ca2+ binding level determined as described in the figure legends. SR vesicles (0.45 mg/ml protein) were treated at 25 °C with trypsin (0.3 mg/ml) or proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) as described (23Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by the Calcon program. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were reproduced by the program VMD (36Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase of SR vesicles in 100 μm Ca2+ and 15 mm Mg2+ was incubated with beryllium fluoride (BeFx) or aluminum fluoride (AlFx) for 30 min at 25 °C. The ability of EP formation from ATP was almost completely lost (actually within 1 min) (Fig. 3), showing the stable complex formation with BeFx and AlFx. No inhibition occurred with Mg2+ and fluoride without beryllium and aluminum (E1Ca2+(MgFx)). Thus, MgFx (MgF42−) was not able to produce a complex with E1Ca2, in contrast to E2·MgF42− formation from E2, the E2·Pi product analog in E2P hydrolysis (19Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 25Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding agrees with the in-line phosphorylation of E1Ca2 to E1PCa2 (37Webb M.R. Trentham D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4884-4887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which there is no state with non-covalently bound Pi. The binding of Mg2+ at the catalytic site as a physiological cation is nevertheless required for EP formation. Actually in Fig. 3, Mg2+ was required for complex formation with BeFx in 100 μm Ca2+. The apparent Mg2+ affinity (K0.5 of 5 mm, supplemental Fig. S1) was consistent with that of the catalytic site in phosphorylation from ATP or Pi (e.g. Refs. 11de Meis L. Masuda H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2057-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, and 38Hasselbach W.

Chem. 1975; 250: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BeFx-induced inhibition also occurred with Mn2+ with apparent affinity (K0.5 of 0.6 mm) significantly higher than that of Mg2+, as found in E1PCa2 formation and ATP hydrolysis with Mn2+ (40Yamada S. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3108-3119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ogurusu T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ over millimolar amounts was added in place of Mg2+, the EP formation was not inhibited by BeFx (BeFx(5 mm Ca)). Therefore, Ca2+ substitution probably at the catalytic Mg2+ site abolished complex formation with BeFx. Although CaATP as a substrate and Ca2+ bound at the catalytic Mg2+ site are able to function for E1PCa2 formation (26Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8698-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11524-11531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+ bound at the catalytic site likely produces different structure from the Mg2+ bound structure (as in fact found, see below). The complex formation of E1Ca2 by AlFx in 100 μm Ca2+ also required Mg2+ or Mn2+ with somewhat higher apparent affinities than those for BeFx-induced complex formation, and was abolished by Ca2+ binding at the catalytic site. In Fig. 4, Ca2+ binding and occlusion in formation of the Ca2+-ATPase complexes with fluoride compounds were determined in 15 mm Mg2+ with and without a 10-s EGTA filter washing. In all the cases without washing, Ca2+ was bound to the Ca2+-ATPase with high affinities; K0.5 at sub-micromolar to millimolar ranges, Hill coefficient ∼2, and maximum levels of 9–10 nmol/mg of protein, i.e. the stoichiometry of two Ca2+ per phosphorylation site (inset at 50 μm Ca2+). Therefore, E1Ca2·BeFx and E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP/E1Ca2·AlFx were produced by cooperative binding of two Ca2+ ions at high affinity transport sites. This finding agrees with the property of the sites for Ca2+ binding and the resulting enzyme activation for phosphorylation by ATP as nicely demonstrated for the first time by Inesi et al. (14Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon the EGTA washing of E1Ca2 that is complexed with BeFx, the two bound Ca2+ were not removed, and therefore occluded in the complex as “E1Ca2·BeFx.” The two Ca2+ are occluded also in E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP and less strongly in E1Ca2·AlFx. Note that the Ca2+ affinity became 2–3-fold lower for BeFx and AlFx. This may be because the Ca2+-free E2 state produces E2·BeF3− and E2·AlF4− (25Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and therefore competes with Ca2+ binding for formation of E1Ca2·BeFx and E1Ca2·AlFx. On the other hand, the observed ∼3-fold Ca2+-affinity increase in formation of E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP is probably brought about by the fact that ADP together with AlFx strongly stabilizes the cross-linked N-P domains (17Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 18Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), which is unfavorable for formation of the Ca2+-free E2 and E2·AlF4−, because for these structures the A domain should rotate into the opened space between the N and P domains and associate with them (19Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 23Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C.

Proteolytic analysis was made to reveal the organization state of the cytoplasmic domains in the newly developed E1PCa2·Mg analog E1Ca2·BeFx, and to compare with E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP/E1Ca2·AlFx and E2·BeF3− (E2P·Mg) (see the typical cleavage in supplemental Fig. S2). The initial rate of the “A1” appearance upon cleavage at the T2 site (Arg198 on the Val200 loop of the A domain) in E1Ca2·BeFx was substantially slower than the rapid cleavage of E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP and E1Ca2·AlFx as well as E1Ca2 (Table 1). The slowed T2 cleavage was also observed when E1Ca2·BeFx was formed with 3 mm Mn2+ in place of 15 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). Also important was the slow but definitely occurring T2 cleavage in E1Ca2·BeFx, in sharp contrast to its complete resistance in E2·BeF3−. Therefore A-P domain organization at the Val200 loop in E1Ca2·BeFx is intermediate between those in E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP/E1Ca2·AlFx and E2·BeF3−.TABLE 1Summary of fluorescence changes and proteolysis ratesATPase state (→ consequent state, if altered)Ca2+ (mm)/Mg2+ (mm)Relative TNP-AMP fluorescence intensity, see Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5Change in tryptophan fluorescence from E1Ca2 (or from another state), supplemental Fig. S3 ↑ increase, ↓ decreaseRelative digestion rateTrypsin (T2), supplemental Fig. S2Proteinase K, supplemental Fig. S2mm%% of E1Ca2 level%E1Ca20.1/157(3.27 ↑ from E2)100100E1Ca2·MgAMP-PCP0.1/1506425E1Ca2·CaAMP-PCP5/00.80 ↑619E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP0.1/150.84 ↑653E1PCa2·Ca·AMP-PN5/00.77 ↑654E1Ca2·AlFx0.1/15707010E1PCa2·Ca5/00.89 ↓806E1PCa2·Mg0.1/151.18 ↓E1Ca2·BeFx0.1/15751.27 ↓3513E1Ca2·BeFx + 5 mm Ca2+ (→ partially E1Ca2)0.1/15 + 5 mm Ca2+307032E1Ca2 + 5 mm Ca2+ + BeFx5/016011690E2·BeF3−0/15100(0.66 ↑ from E2)00E1Ca2·BeFx + TG (→ E2·BeF3−(TG))0.1/1564(5.35 ↓ from E1Ca2·BeFx)00E2·BeF3− + TG (→ E2·BeF3−(TG))0/1565(4.62 ↓ from E2·BeF3−)00E1Ca2·BeFx + A23187 (→ E2·BeF3−)0.1/15100100E2·BeF3− + A231870/1510000E1PCa2·Mg (0.7 mm Ca2+)0.7/151.19 ↓E1Ca2·BeFx (0.7 mm Ca2+)0.7/15751.27 ↓3915E1Ca2·BeFx (0.7 mm Ca2+ + A23187)0.7/1575328E2·BeF3− + 0.7 mm Ca2+0/15 + 0.7 mm Ca2+100(0 from E2·BeF3−)02E2·BeF3− + 0.7 mm Ca2+ + A23187 (→ E1Ca2·BeF3−)0/15 + 0.7 mm Ca2+753816 Open table in a new tab All complexes were almost completely resistant to proteinase K at the major site of Thr242 on the A/M3-linker that produces the “p83” fragment. Therefore, in E1Ca2·BeFx, the A domain is rotated perpendicular to the membrane plane from its position in E1Ca2 thereby causing the A/M3-linker strain, as in E1Ca2·CaAMP-PCP, E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP (18Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 19Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Danko S.

These analyses revealed that in the change E1Ca2·AlF4−· ADP → E1Ca2·BeFx (i.e. upon the ADP release from the transition state), the A domain moves, i.e. probably rotates to some extent parallel to the membrane plane likely due to the A/M3-linker strain, and thereby Arg198 on the Val200 loop comes close to the P domain. In the subsequent change, E1Ca2·BeFx → E2·BeF3−, the A domain rotates further (by the A/M3-linker strain as predicted to be motive force (18Toyoshima C. Mizutani T.

The proteolysis further revealed that E1Ca2·BeFx was not produced from E1Ca2 in 5 mm Ca2+ without Mg2+ (E1Ca2 + 5 mm Ca2+ + BeFx in Table 1), and that E1Ca2·BeFx produced in 15 mm Mg2+ and 50–100 μm Ca2+ was decomposed to the E1Ca2 by 5 mm Ca2+ (E1Ca2·BeFx + 5 mm Ca2+), as shown by the rapid cleavage rates at the T2 and proteinase K sites. In E1PCa2·Ca and E1Ca2· CaAMP-PCP formed in 5 mm Ca2+ without Mg2+ (Table 1), 3The proteolytic analysis of E1PCa2·Ca was made possible by its markedly retarded decay due to Ca2+ ligation at the catalytic site (27Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11524-11531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and feedback inhibition by the high lumenal Ca2+. Analysis of E1PCa2·Mg formed from MgATP was not feasible because of its very rapid turnover, thus of a very rapid ATP exhaustion. the T2 site was also rapidly cleaved, in contrast to its substantially slowed cleavage in E1Ca2·BeFx formed with Mg2+. Thus, for organization of the cytoplasmic domains at the T2 site (Arg198), E1Ca2·CaAMP-PCP and E1PCa2·Ca are very similar to E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP, but differ from E1Ca2·BeFx. The close similarity between E1Ca2·CaAMP-PCP and E1Ca2·AlF4−·ADP is in agreement with their nearly same atomic structures and previous observations (17Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

In this study, we analyze the role of protein palmitoylation, a reversible post-translational lipid modification, in the functional properties of IFNAR. We report that pharmacological inhibition of protein palmitoylation results in severe defects of IFN receptor endocytosis and signaling. We generated mutants of the IFNAR1 subunit of the type I IFN receptor, in which each or both of the two cysteines present in the cytoplasmic domain are replaced by alanines. We show that cysteine 463 of IFNAR1, the more proximal of the two cytoplasmic cysteines, is palmitoylated. A thorough microscopic and biochemical analysis of the palmitoylation-deficient IFNAR1 mutant revealed that IFNAR1 palmitoylation is not required for receptor endocytosis, intracellular distribution, or stability at the cell surface. However, the lack of IFNAR1 palmitoylation affects selectively the activation of Stat2, which results in a lack of efficient Stat1 activation and nuclear translocation and IFN-α-activated gene transcription. Thus, receptor palmitoylation is a previously undescribed mechanism of regulating signaling activity by type I IFNs in the Jak/Stat pathway.

These pleiotropic effects occur through the transcriptional regulation of many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1.Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). IFN signal transduction relies mainly on the activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)/signal-transducing activators of transcription (Stat) pathways, although several other signaling cascades have also been associated with IFN-regulated transcription (2.Kalvakolanu D.V. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3.Parmar S. Platanias L.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In general, the binding of type I IFNs to the cell surface receptor IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits induces tyrosine phosphorylation in trans of the IFNAR-associated Jak kinases (Tyk2 with IFNAR1 and Jak1 with IFNAR2), which in turn leads to IFNAR tyrosine phosphorylation. Several members of the Stat family can be activated by type I IFNs, and Stat1 and Stat2 are the main downstream effectors of the type I IFN transcriptional response. Upon IFN-α stimulation, cytosolic Stat2 is recruited to the activated IFNAR complex where it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by the receptor-associated Jak kinases. Stat2 activation is a key event in IFN-α signaling because it is required for the indirect recruitment, through binding to Stat2, of Stat1 to IFNAR1 and its activation. There is some debate as to whether cytosolic Stat2 is preferentially recruited to IFNAR1 or to IFNAR2 (4.Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell.

Whereas the SH2 domain of Stat2 binds to a region surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine 466 of IFNAR1, Stat2 can bind to IFNAR2 whether it is tyrosine-phosphorylated or not. This series of sequential tyrosine phosphorylations precedes the translocation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex to the nucleus where it activates gene transcription from promoters containing an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) (10.Stark G.R.

Recent data indicate that signal transduction through the Jak/Stat pathway cannot fully account for the diversity and complexity of the biological response elicited by type I IFNs (12.van Boxel-Dezaire A.H. Rani M.R. Stark G.R. Immunity. 2006; 25: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and that other factors, for example receptor configuration and alternate signaling pathways, have to be considered (13.Baychelier F.

We recently showed that endocytosis plays an important role in the control of IFN-α signaling and biological activity (14.Marchetti M. Monier M.N. Fradagrada A. Mitchell K. Baychelier F. Eid P. Johannes L. Lamaze C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Little is known about the potential links between membrane trafficking and the control of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway, and the contribution of IFNAR trafficking to IFN signaling is just beginning to be appreciated (15.Claudinon J. Monier M.N. Lamaze C. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To study this poorly investigated aspect of IFN signaling, we examined the role, if any, of receptor palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification involving the specific attachment of a saturated fatty acid chain to cysteines via a thioester bond. Palmitoylation is among the most prevalent post-translational modifications found on the cytoplasmic face of transmembrane proteins. Various functions have been proposed for protein palmitoylation, although the precise mechanisms by which it works remain to be established (16.Charollais J. Van Der Goot F.G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2009; 26: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17.Nadolski M.J. Linder M.E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5202-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18.Resh M.D. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : re14Google Scholar). Palmitoylation controls the stability of several proteins, including CCR5, yeast SNAREs, the anthrax toxin receptor, and the neutral sphingomyelinase 2, by preventing their ubiquitination and thereby their targeting to lysosomal degradation (19.Abrami L.

In hematopoietic cells and lymphocytes, palmitoylation regulates signal transduction by promoting the association of the signaling molecules with lipid microdomains at the plasma membrane and by regulating protein-protein interactions (23.Flaumenhaft R. Sim D.S. Hematology. 2005; 10: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The chemokine receptor CCR5 and Fas are receptors whose palmitoylation is required for the induction of efficient signaling (24.Chakrabandhu K. Hérincs Z. Huault S. Dost B. Peng L. Conchonaud F.

We investigated whether palmitoylation contributes to IFNAR1 trafficking and IFN-α-induced signaling. We report that IFNAR1 is palmitoylated on cysteine 463, and although this modification has no major effect on IFNAR1 cellular trafficking, it strongly affects Jak/Stat signaling and the gene transcription induced by IFN-α.

L929R2 murine fibroblasts stably expressing human IFNAR2 (28.Cajean-Feroldi C. Nosal F. Nardeux P.C. Gallet X. Guymarho J. Baychelier F. Sempé P. Tovey M.G. Escary J.L. Eid P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12498-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were transfected by wild-type or mutated forms of human IFNAR1 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Mixed populations of transfected cells were selected under hygromycin selective pressure. The generated cell lines (L929R1R2) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 400 μg/ml hygromycin, and 1.5 mg/ml geneticin. CHO cells were cultured as above except for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium/F-12 growth medium and without selection antibiotics. Palmitoylation was inhibited by incubating the cells with 200 μm 2-bromopalmitate for 1 h at 37 °C before starting the experiments. Chemical removal of palmitoylation was performed by treating cell extracts with 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7, for 1 h at room temperature. Protein synthesis was inhibited by a 1-h treatment with 50 μm cycloheximide at 37 °C. All drugs were from Sigma. 40 × 106 cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA 2 mm and lysed 30 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) with or without 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g, and supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with 2.5 μg of EA12 mAb for IFNAR1 or 2.5 μg of 8F11 mAb for IFNAR2. After washing the beads, samples were boiled for 5 min before being analyzed by Western blotting using 64G12 mAb for detecting IFNAR1 or 10E10 mAb for detecting IFNAR2. Cells were first starved for 1 h in serum-free medium, then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin with 200 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), washed, and immunoprecipitated for IFNAR1 or IFNAR2. After fixation (25% isopropyl alcohol, 65% H2O, and 10% acetic acid), gels were incubated for 30 min in enhanced Amplify NAMP100 (GE Healthcare), dried, and exposed for 3 weeks to Hyperfilm MP (GE Healthcare). For analysis of IFNAR1 endocytosis, cells grown on coverslips were incubated on ice with the 34F10 antibody for 30 min. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, washed, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with saponin treatment, and endocytosed antibody-IFNAR1 complexes were revealed with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Cells were imaged with an epifluorescent Leica microscope. For analysis of IFNAR1 intracellular co-localization experiments, cells were first fixed, then permeabilized, and incubated simultaneously with 34F10 and either anti-EEA1, anti-Rab6, anti-Rab11 or anti-Lamp2 antibodies as indicated. Secondary Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used to reveal IFNAR1, and Cy3-conjugated anti-goat antibody was used to reveal EEA1, and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was used to reveal Rab6, Rab11, and Lamp2. Cells were imaged with a confocal Leica microscope. Cells were treated with or without 1000 units/ml IFN-α2b at 37 °C for the indicated times. For biochemical analysis, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and lysed in Lysis Buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and a mixture of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors (Sigma)). After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g, lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot/ECL for activated Tyk2 and Jak1 using anti-pTyk2 and anti-pJak1 or activated Stat1 and Stat2 using anti-pStat1 and anti-pStat2 antibodies. Anti-Jak1 and anti-Stat1 antibodies were used to determine the total amount of Jak1 and Stat1. For immunofluorescent analysis of pStat1 and pStat2 nuclear translocation, cells grown on coverslips were treated with IFN-α2b at 37 °C for the indicated time and fixed with cold methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. pStat1 and pStat2 were then stained by successive incubations with anti-phospho-Stat1, anti-phospho-Stat2, and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA 2 mm and stained with AA3 antibody for 40 min in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum and 0.05% sodium azide) on ice. Goat anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary antibody. Dead cells were excluded by gating on forward/side light scatter. Events corresponding to 2 × 104 gated cells were accumulated per sample. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur machine, and data were analyzed by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). L929R1R2 cells were transfected with an ISG54-luciferase construct kindly provided by S. Pellegrini using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were treated or not (control) with 1000 units/ml IFN-α2b for 8 h. Luciferase activity was quantified in cell lysates using a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold, Wildbald, Germany), and results were reported to the quantity of proteins as quantified with the Bradford method. Results were expressed as fold increase over the basal activity without IFN stimulation. 5 × 106 CHO cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of the DNA construct coding for BRET donor (RLuc-Tyk2) and increasing (0.05–1.5 μg) amounts of the BRET acceptor plasmid (IFNAR1 CC-YFP, IFNAR1 AC-YFP, or IFNGR1-YFP) and 0.1 μg of the DNA construct coding for IFNAR2 using GeneJuice Reagent (Novagen). A total amount of transfected DNA was maintained constant using an appropriate quantity of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the luciferase substrate, coelenterazine h (Interchim), was added at a final concentration of 5 μm to 1 × 105 cells. Luminescence and fluorescence were measured simultaneously using the MithrasTM fluorescence-luminescence detector (Berthold). Cells expressing BRET donors alone were used to determine background. Filter sets were 485 ± 10 nm for luciferase emission and 530 ± 12.5 nm for YFP emission. BRET ratios were calculated as described previously (29.Boularan C. Scott M.G. Bourougaa K. Bellal M.

We recently showed that IFNAR1 uptake at the plasma membrane proceeds through classical clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis; inhibition of IFNAR1 endocytosis by either small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of clathrin or inactivation of the GTPase dynamin by the dominant negative mutant K44A inhibits both activation of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway and the antiviral and antiproliferative activities otherwise promoted by IFN-α (14.Marchetti M.

Based on previous studies of the contribution of palmitoylation to the regulation of membrane trafficking (19.Abrami L. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23795-23804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we tested whether palmitoylation is involved in IFNAR1 endocytosis and IFN-α signaling. We first analyzed the effects of 2-bromopalmitate, a drug that blocks general protein palmitoylation (Fig. 1A) (31.Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). IFNAR1 is rapidly endocytosed, and within 30 min is found in the recycling compartment as shown by co-localization with the small GTPAse Rab11 (data not shown) and as established previously (14.Marchetti M. Monier M.N. Fradagrada A. Mitchell K. Baychelier F. Eid P. Johannes L. Lamaze C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, preincubation of cells with 200 μm 2-bromopalmitate strongly inhibited IFNAR1 endocytosis, and few IFNAR1 subunits were detected in the recycling compartment (Fig. 1A). The inhibition appears to be specific to 2-bromopalmitate because palmitate had no effect; this implicates palmitoylation in IFNAR1 endocytosis. We next tested the effect of 2-bromopalmitate on the Jak/Stat signaling pathway activated by IFN-α because we have shown this process to be dependent on IFNAR1 endocytosis (14.Marchetti M. Monier M.N. Fradagrada A. Mitchell K. Baychelier F. Eid P. Johannes L. Lamaze C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Upon IFN-α binding, the Tyk2 and Jak1 kinases associated with IFNAR are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 of Stat1. In L929R1R2 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 (pStat1) was complete after 10 min of stimulation with 1000 units/ml IFN-α (Fig. 1B). Treatment with 2-bromopalmitate inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 200 μm. We also analyzed later steps of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway by testing for the translocation of pStat1 in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). pStat1 accumulated in the nuclei of control or palmitate-treated cells after 30 min of IFN-α stimulation but not in the nuclei of cells treated with 200 μm 2-bromopalmitate (Fig. 1C). Thus, IFNAR1 endocytosis and IFN-α-dependent Jak/Stat signaling require protein palmitoylation. We analyzed whether the type I IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were themselves palmitoylated. IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were immunoprecipitated from lysates of [3H]palmitic acid-labeled L929R1R2 cells. Radiolabeled bands corresponding to both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were detected (Fig. 2A), with a stronger signal for IFNAR2. The difference of band intensity was probably due to the higher level of IFNAR2 than IFNAR1 expression in this cell line, as shown on the corresponding whole cell extract (28.Cajean-Feroldi C. Nosal F. Nardeux P.C. Gallet X. Guymarho J. Baychelier F. Sempé P. Tovey M.G. Escary J.L. Eid P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12498-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A similar experiment with a Jurkat cell line expressing a FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 showed that IFNAR1 was palmitoylated in this human lymphoid cell line also (data not shown). The two IFN-α receptor subunits are required for IFN-α activity; however, IFNAR1 is essential for IFN-α-induced signaling, and IFNAR2 is more involved in IFN-α binding; we therefore focused our analysis on IFNAR1 (32.Pestka S. Krause C.D. Walter M.R. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 8-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported an inducible cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. For example, stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor by isoproterenol increases the binding of [3H]palmitic acid reflecting a higher turnover of bound palmitate, whereas it induces the depalmitoylation of the Gα subunits associated with the receptor (33.Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 34.Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association of the CD19-CD21-CD81 complex with the activated B cell antigen receptor induces palmitoylation of CD81, thereby enhancing the stability of this association (35.Cherukuri A. Carter R.H. Brooks S. Bornmann W. Finn R. Dowd C.S. Pierce S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31973-31982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Also, 17β-estradiol reduces the palmitoylation of the estradiol receptor in a time- and dose-dependent manner (36.Acconcia F. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Spisni E. Tomasi V. Trentalance A. Visca P. Marino M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether IFN treatment regulates the turnover of palmitate on IFNAR1. Stimulation of the cells with IFN-α from 5 min to 1 h prior to and during radiolabeling with [3H]palmitic acid had no effect on the quantity of palmitate bound to IFNAR1 (Fig. 2B); however, after 2 h of stimulation there was an increase of palmitate incorporation indicating that IFNAR1 palmitoylation turnover can be regulated by IFN-α stimulation. We found that IFNAR1 palmitoylation occurs on cysteine residues via a thioester bond because hydroxylamine, which cleaves the thioester bond, removed the [3H]palmitic acid incorporated in IFNAR1 (Fig. 3B). The cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1 contains only two cysteines, at positions 463 and 502, that are likely to be palmitoylated. To determine which cysteines are palmitoylated, we mutated each of them to an alanine in single (AC and CA) and double (AA) mutants (Fig. 3A). We transfected L929R2 cells with either the wild-type form of human IFNAR1 or each of the three mutants. Mixed populations of transfected cells were generated, and mutant cell lines expressing levels of cell surface IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 similar to that in cells expressing the wild-type subunits, as determined by flow cytometry, were used for metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitic acid. The CA mutant incorporated as much palmitate as the wild-type CC (Fig. 3B); in contrast, the AC mutant, carrying the cysteine 463 to alanine mutation, did not show any radioactive signal. Similarly, the double mutant AA showed no incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid. Thus, IFNAR1 is palmitoylated on cysteine 463 but not on cysteine 502. This is in agreement with previous reports that transmembrane proteins are mostly palmitoylated on cysteine residues in close proximity to the plasma membrane and near stretches of hydrophobic acids (37.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), an environment corresponding to that of the cysteine 463. Next, we examined the effect of IFNAR1 palmitoylation on the functional properties of IFNAR. For several proteins, a lack of palmitoylation results in various trafficking defects, including reduced export from the Golgi apparatus, accumulation in lysosomes, and defective recycling to the plasma membrane (19.Abrami L. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20.Tani M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Therefore, we investigated whether IFNAR1 palmitoylation regulates any of the steps of IFNAR1 intracellular trafficking. We first tested whether IFNAR1 palmitoylation was required for IFNAR1 uptake from the plasma membrane. Indeed, a lack of protein palmitoylation has been associated with abnormalities in endocy"
https://openalex.org/W2083054591,"The thyroid (TR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) belong to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-mediated transcription factors. At the molecular level, TR activity is specifically modulated by interactions with the ligand 3,3′,5 triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), RXR, DNA, and co-activators such as SRC1, occurring in concert or sequentially. Although binding sites for DNA and coregulators such as SRC1 are distinct and at distal regions of these receptors, cell-based and EMSA studies have suggested that these molecules can regulate binding of each other to the receptor. We present evidence of direct, DNA-dependent, communication between the DNA and ligand binding domains (DBD and LBD) that can allosterically regulate interactions with SRC1 and DNA, respectively, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and cell-based assays. Additionally, we note that interdomain communication is affected by RXR in RXR:TR. We also noticed a DNA-dependent cross-talk between RXR and TR within RXR:TR. Finally, we suggest that differences in transactivation on different TRE may be the consequence of different affinities between TRE and RXR:TR."
https://openalex.org/W1973541746,"Members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and T-box gene families play several critical roles in the early embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Although BMP proteins are the upstream regulators of T-box genes, few studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms between these two protein families. Here, we report that Tbx6 interacts directly with Smad6, an inhibitory Smad that antagonizes the BMP signal. This interaction is mediated through the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain of Smad6 and residues 90–180 of Tbx6. We demonstrate that Smad6 facilitates the degradation of Tbx6 protein through recruitment of Smurf1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Consequently, Smad6 reduces Tbx6-mediated Myf-5 gene activation. Furthermore, specific knockdown of endogenous Smad6 and Smurf1 by small interfering RNA increases the protein levels of Tbx6 and enhance the expression of Tbx6 target genes. Collectively, these findings reveal that Smad6 serves as a critical mediator of BMP signal via a functional interaction with Tbx6, thus regulating the activation of Tbx6 downstream genes during cell differentiation.

Upon phosphorylation, R-Smads form complexes with the common partner Smad4 (co-Smad) and then translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes. The third subclass of Smads is composed of Smad6 and Smad7. Once induced by BMP signal, Smad6 functions as a potent antagonist in a negative feedback loop (4.Massagué J. Chen Y.G.

The T-box genes encode a phylogenetically conserved family of transcription factors that share a common DNA-binding motif known as the T-box domain. T-domain proteins are essential for a variety of developmental events ranging from mesoderm specification to limb and heart development (6.Showell C. Binder O. Conlon F.L. Dev.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 37-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brachyury (also known as T), the founding member of this gene family, was originally identified in short-tailed mice. Tbx6 (T-box 6) is expressed in the primitive streak, nascent mesoderm and later in the tailbud region of the developing mouse embryo, largely overlapping with the expression pattern of Brachyury (9.Chapman D.L. Agulnik I. Hancock S. Silver L.M. Papaioannou V.E. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The defect in mouse Tbx6 leads to embryonic lethality with ectopic neural tube-like structures instead of posterior somites, indicating that Tbx6 is necessary for the specification of mesoderm precursor cells (10.Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence implies that the functions of BMPs and T-box proteins are closely related (11.Hamaguchi T. Yabe S. Uchiyama H. Murakami R. Dev.

During some stages of embryogenesis, both BMPs and T-box proteins participate in common developmental processes. For instance, Dorsocross, a Tbx6-related gene in Drosophila, exhibits an expression pattern similar to that of pMad (the phosphorylated form of the Mad protein) in the early blastoderm and the lateral ectoderm after germband elongation, implying a functional association between these two proteins (11.Hamaguchi T. Yabe S. Uchiyama H. Murakami R. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several T-box genes are downstream targets of BMP signal. BMP-2 can promote Tbx2 and Tbx3 expression in chick, whereas Tbx2 expression is greatly reduced in homozygous Bmp-2 mouse mutants (12.Yamada M. Revelli J.P. Eichele G. Barron M. Schwartz R.J. Dev.

Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and BMP signal regulates zebrafish Tbx6 expression through a novel BMP-response element within the promoter (14.Szeto D.P. Kimelman D. Development. 2004; 131: 3751-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Beyond the upstream regulation of T-box gene expression by BMP signal, specific protein interactions with other factors in this signaling cascade are also suggestive of their intrinsic links. However, few reports describe interaction partners for T-domain proteins. Here, we have identified Smad6 as a novel Tbx6-interacting protein. We further demonstrate that Smad6 reduces Tbx6-mediated transcriptional activity by accelerating Tbx6 ubiquitination and degradation, thus regulating the expression of Tbx6 target genes during cell differentiation. Full-length cDNAs encoding mouse Tbx6 and its serial deletion mutants were amplified by a PCR-based approach and verified by DNA sequencing. The sequences were cloned into pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen) with a hemagglutinin or Myc tag at the N terminus. Tbx6 and Smad6 were subcloned into PET-28b(+) (Novagen) and pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) vectors for expression in bacteria. The siRNAs for Tbx6, Smad6, Smurf1, and Smurf2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. FLAG-tagged Smad1–7 constructs were kind gifts from Dr. Y. G. Chen (Tsinghua University, China). FLAG-tagged Smad6 deletion mutants were kindly provided by Dr. X. H. Feng (Baylor College of Medicine). Hemagglutinin-tagged Smurf1 and point mutant Smurf1C699A were generously provided by Dr. Joan Massagué (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). The Myf-5 promoter-reporter (Myf-5-pGL3), 4×Tbx-TK and 4×mTbx-TK reporter constructs, and Xenopus Tbx6 and Brachyury expression plasmids with a 6×Myc tag at the N terminus were described in our previous papers (15.Mei W. Yang J. Tao Q. Geng X. Rupp R.A. Ding X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16.Lin G.F. Geng X. Chen Y. Qu B. Wang F. Hu R. Ding X. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HEK 293T and COS-7 cells, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. TT-D6 cells (a kind gift from Dr. M. Noda) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom) at 33 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 22 °C. The cells were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and mixture protein inhibitors), and sonicated. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-Smad6 fusion protein was bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 3 h with total lysates from His6-Tbx6-expressing E. coli cells. The beads were washed three times with GST lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting analysis using anti-GST and anti-His monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with various expression plasmids as indicated and incubated for 24 h before analysis. For the ubiquitination assay, cells were treated with MG132 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 μm for 4 h prior to harvesting. Cell lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (17.He Z. Li J. Zhen C. Feng L. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18.Lou X. Fang P. Li S. Hu R.Y. Kuerner K.M. Steinbeisser H. Ding X. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were then eluted and subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect the Tbx6-ubiquitin conjugation. To detect the potential interaction between endogenous Smad6 and Tbx6, 1 × 107 TT-D6 cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and a mixture protein inhibitors (Bio Basics). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-Smad6 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG. The proteins were then eluted and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Tbx6 polyclonal antibody (Aviva Systems Biology). Other primary antibodies described in this article include anti-Myf-5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p-Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling), anti-Smurf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Smurf2 (Abcam), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. To evaluate the transcriptional activity of Tbx6, we used the reporter construct Myf-5-pGL3, which contains a 5.4-kb upstream region of the Myf-5 promoter driving luciferase expression (15.Mei W. Yang J. Tao Q. Geng X. Rupp R.A. Ding X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 4×Tbx-TK reporter contains four tandem repeats of T-box binding site upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) basal promoter. The 4×mTbx-TK reporter with four mutant T-box binding sites was used as a negative control (16.Lin G.F. Geng X. Chen Y. Qu B. Wang F. Hu R. Ding X. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TT-D6 cells (5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were transiently transfected with plasmids as indicated in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5. Empty vector pCS2+ was used to keep the total amount of transfected DNA constant (500 ng/well) in each well in all experiments. Luciferase activity in the samples was measured after 24 h of transfection using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity in each sample. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are shown as the mean ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments. TT-D6 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured with or without 500 ng/ml rhBMP-2 (R&D Systems) for 72 h. The activity of alkaline phosphatase was evaluated using the alkaline phosphatase substrate kit III (Vector Laboratories) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For the mineralization assay, the cell layers were fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution for 15 min and stained with 1% Alizarin Red S (Sigma) for 5 min. Cells were then washed with distilled water and air-dried. The stained calcified nodules, which appeared bright red in color, were identified by light microscopy. As described previously (17.He Z. Li J. Zhen C. Feng L. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), TT-D6 cells grown on coverslips were fixed and then stained with anti-Smad6 (1:100) and anti-Tbx6 polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) followed by Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Total RNA isolation and reverse transcription were performed as described previously (18.Lou X. Fang P. Li S. Hu R.Y. Kuerner K.M. Steinbeisser H. Ding X. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in triplicate for each sample. The intensity of each amplified band was measured and normalized to its corresponding GAPDH content. The optimal primers for PCR are as follows: ALP (fwd, 5′-TGCCTACTTGTGTGGCGTGAA-3′; rev, 5′-TCACCCGAGTGGTAGTCACAATG-3′); Dll1 (fwd, 5′-ACTCCTTCAGCCTGCCTGA-3′, rev, 5′-TATCGGATGCACTCATCGC-3′); GAPDH (fwd, 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′, rev, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′); Myf-5 (fwd, 5′-GGATGAGTTTGGGGACCAGTTTG-3′, rev, 5′-GTCCCGGCAGGCTGTAATAGTTC-3′); MyoD (fwd, 5′-AGGCTCTGCTGCGCGACC-3′, rev, 5′-TGCAGTCGATCTCTCAAAGCACC-3′); Mesp2 (fwd, 5′-TGGCTGTCCTGAACTTTGG-3′, rev, 5′-GGAGTATGGAACGACCCTCT-3′); osteocalcin (fwd, 5′-CCAAGCAGGAGGGCAATA-3′, rev, 5′-AGGGCAGCACAGGTCCTAA-3′); Runx2 (fwd, 5′-GGCAGCACGCTATTAAATCCAAA-3′, rev, 5′-TGACTGCCCCCACCCTCTTAG-3′); Smad6 (fwd, 5′-CCACTGGATCTGTCCGATTC-3′, rev, 5′-AAGTCGAACACCTTGATGGAG-3′); and Tbx6 (fwd, 5′-TTCCCTGCTTGCCGAGTATCAG-3′, rev, 5′-GGCATCCCGCTCCCTCTTACAG-3′). As a homologue of Brachyury, Tbx6 shares a high degree of sequence similarity. The expression pattern of Tbx6 and Brachyury mostly overlaps during early embryo development (9.Chapman D.L. Agulnik I. Hancock S. Silver L.M. Papaioannou V.E. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), implying a functional redundancy between these two proteins. Given that Xenopus Brachyury is reported to interact with Smad1 (19.Messenger N.J. Kabitschke C. Andrews R. Grimmer D. Núñez Miguel R. Blundell T.L. Smith J.C. Wardle F.C. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we wondered whether Tbx6 protein might also interact with Smad1 or other Smad molecules. To address this possibility, we co-transfected Myc-tagged Tbx6 with FLAG-tagged Smad expression constructs into HEK 293T cells. The potential interaction between Tbx6 and Smad proteins was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. Interestingly, we found that, instead of interacting with Smad1, Tbx6 interacted with Smad6 but not other Smads (Fig. 1A). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc was subsequently performed to confirm the specific interaction between Tbx6 and Smad6 (Fig. 1B). To further explore whether the association between these two proteins is direct, we carried out an in vitro GST pulldown assay using bacterially expressed GST-Smad6 and His6-Tbx6 fusion proteins. GST-Smad6 fusion protein, but not GST alone, was able to pull down His6-Tbx6, indicating that Tbx6 directly interacts with Smad6 (Fig. 1C). A reciprocal pulldown assay was applied to confirm the direct binding of Tbx6 and Smad6 in vitro (Fig. 1D). We then evaluated the ability of endogenous Tbx6 to associate with Smad6 in vivo. Because Tbx6 and Smad6 are both expressed endogenously in TT-D6 mesenchymal stem cells, we used this cell model for the following analyses. Total extracts from TT-D6 cells were incubated with beads conjugated to anti-Smad6 polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, Tbx6 was readily detected in the immunoprecipitated complex of Smad6, demonstrating that Tbx6 indeed interacts with Smad6 in vivo. Next, we focused on the subcellular localization of Tbx6 and Smad6 proteins. Tbx6 was detected in the nucleus, and Smad6 was distributed predominantly in the nucleus of TT-D6 cells (Fig. 1F). We also found that the co-localization of Tbx6 and Smad6 in the nucleus was not affected by BMP-2 (data not shown). Subsequently, we investigated whether Tbx6 homologues also share the ability to associate with Smad6. We found that both mouse and Xenopus Tbx6 showed similar affinities for mouse Smad6, whereas Xenopus Brachyury, the canonical member of the T-box gene family, does not interact with mouse Smad6 (Fig. 1G). Taking into account the recent finding that Xenopus Brachyury specifically interacts with Smad1 (19.Messenger N.J. Kabitschke C. Andrews R. Grimmer D. Núñez Miguel R. Blundell T.L. Smith J.C. Wardle F.C. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), our data suggest that T-box proteins have distinct affinities for different Smad proteins. Smad proteins contain highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions termed Mad homology 1 (MH1) and Mad homology 2 (MH2) domains, respectively. The MH1 and MH2 domains are linked by a region of variable length and sequence. Smad6 has a conserved MH2 domain, whereas its N-terminal region is divergent from that of other Smads (Fig. 2A) (20.Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To identify the region of Smad6 involved in the association with Tbx6, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using truncated mutants of Smad6. Compared with full-length Smad6, Smad6C protein (MH2 domain, residues 331–496) exhibited a stronger interaction with Tbx6. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal domain (MH1 domain with the linker region referred to as Smad6NL, residues 1–330) completely abolished its ability to form a complex with Tbx6 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the MH2 domain of Smad6 mediates its interaction with Tbx6. To delineate the interaction interface of Tbx6, we then constructed a series of Tbx6 deletion mutants (Fig. 2C). The rationale for designing these mutants was based on an existing understanding of important domains within Tbx6. Like the full-length Tbx6, deletion mutants T, TC, NT1, NT2, and NT3 retained their binding affinities for Smad6. However, Tbx6 deletion mutants N, ΔT1, C, and ΔT2 failed to bind to Smad6 (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that the region encompassing residues 90–180 in Tbx6 is responsible for its specific interaction with Smad6. To date, several downstream target genes of Tbx6 have been successfully identified. Myf-5, a myogenic regulatory factor, is one of these target genes. The skeletal muscle was conspicuously absent in teratomas derived from mouse Tbx6-null tailbud cells, implying a potential requirement for Tbx6 in myogenic specification or differentiation (21.Chapman D.L. Cooper-Morgan A. Harrelson Z. Papaioannou V.E. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previously, we cloned a 5.4-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking sequence of the Myf-5 promoter (15.Mei W. Yang J. Tao Q. Geng X. Rupp R.A. Ding X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and identified a conserved T-box binding site in this fragment that mediated the activation of Myf-5 expression (16.Lin G.F. Geng X. Chen Y. Qu B. Wang F. Hu R. Ding X. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To ascertain the functional significance of Tbx6/Smad6 complex formation, we first tested whether Smad6 could modulate Tbx6-mediated transcriptional activation using the Myf-5 promoter-reporter (Fig. 3A). As expected, overexpression of Tbx6 increased Myf-5 luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1A), whereas co-transfection with increasing amounts of Smad6 constructs resulted in a dramatic repression of Tbx6-induced Myf-5 transcriptional activity (p < 0.01; Fig. 3B). The Myf-5 promoter contains a host of regulatory elements, including a T-box binding site, two Smad binding elements, and an interferon regulatory factor-like binding element (15.Mei W. Yang J. Tao Q. Geng X. Rupp R.A. Ding X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16.Lin G.F. Geng X. Chen Y. Qu B. Wang F. Hu R. Ding X. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22.Chen Y. Lin G.F. Hu R. Chen Y. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To verify that the repression of Myf-5 transcription by Smad6 was indeed mediated through the T-box binding site in the Myf-5 promoter, we used a 4×Tbx-TK reporter that contains four tandem repeats of the T-box binding site inserted upstream of the TK basal promoter (Fig. 3C) (16.Lin G.F. Geng X. Chen Y. Qu B. Wang F. Hu R. Ding X. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of Tbx6 increased the 4×Tbx-TK reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1B). When Tbx6 and Smad6 were both expressed, a dramatic decrease of the reporter activity was observed (supplemental Fig. S1C). However, the Smad6 deletion mutant Smad6NL, which lacks the Tbx6-interacting domain, failed to reduce Tbx6-mediated transcriptional activity (Fig. 3D). Similar experiments were repeated in mouse C2C12 myoblast cells with essentially the same results (data not shown), indicating that Smad6 inhibits the transcriptional activity of Tbx6 through its interaction with Tbx6. The above observations prompted us to further assess the protein levels of Tbx6 in Smad6-overexpressing cells. Tbx6 was co-transfected with different amounts of the Smad6 expression construct into HEK 293T cells, a cell line that has been used extensively in protein degradation studies of Smad2 and BMP receptors (23.Shen R. Chen M. Wang Y.J. Kaneki H. Xing L. O'Keefe R.J. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3569-3576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Tbx6 protein was down-regulated by Smad6 in a dose-dependent manner (∼60% decrease) (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of Smad6 did not have an obvious effect on the transcriptional level of Tbx6 (Fig. 4B), and we thus speculated that it might be the result of Tbx6 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To test our hypothesis, we examined the ubiquitination of Tbx6 after co-expression of Smad6. We found that Smad6 could induce Tbx6 polyubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Moreover, when cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor (MG132), the interaction of Tbx6 with Smad6 was enhanced (supplemental Fig. S2A). It is reported that Smurf1 can be recruited by Smad6 to BMP receptors to trigger the degradation of these receptors (24.Murakami G. Watabe T. Takaoka K. Miyazono K. Imamura T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked whether Smad6 could also recruit Smurf1 to facilitate Tbx6 ubiquitination. First we examined the involvement of Smurf1 in the Tbx6-Smad6 interaction. Because Smurf1 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, the catalytically inactive mutant Smurf1C699A was utilized to avoid protein degradation in the following assays. As shown in Fig. 4D, Tbx6 cannot directly interact with Smurf1 protein alone. When Smad6 was co-transfected with Tbx6 and Smurf1, both Smad6 and Smurf1 were present in the Tbx6-immunoprecipitated complex. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of Smad6 also led to detection of Smurf1 and Tbx6 in the same complexes. These data together indicate that Tbx6 forms a ternary complex with Smad6 and Smurf1. Because Tbx6 protein levels were significantly reduced in the presence of exogenous Smad6 and Smurf1 (supplemental Fig. S2B), we then explored the role of Smurf1 in regulating Smad6-mediated ubiquitination of Tbx6. As shown in Fig. 4E, Smad6 induced Tbx6 ubiquitination, presumably because of the basal expression of Smurf1. Wild-type Smurf1 elicited a significant increase in Smad6-induced Tbx6 ubiquitination, and the catalytically inactive mutant of Smurf1 largely blocked the ubiquitination of Tbx6, suggesting the requirement of Smurf1 in Smad6-mediated Tbx6 ubiquitination. Subsequently, we tested the effect of Smurf1 on Tbx6-induced transcriptional activity. As expected, Smad6 on its own showed only a partial inhibitory effect on Tbx6 activity, whereas Smad6 in cooperation with Smurf1 dramatically suppressed the transcriptional activity of Tbx6 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4F). Collectively, these data indicate that Smad6 reduces Tbx6-induced transcriptional activity through functional interaction with Tbx6 and mediates Tbx6 protein degradation through the recruitment of Smurf1 E3 ligase. To further investigate the role of endogenous Smad6 in the regulation of Tbx6 protein stability and Tbx6-dependent gene expression, we applied RNA interference techniques to TT-D6 cells, a cell line that endogenously expresses both Tbx6 and Smad6. The siRNA against Smad6 was highly effective in blocking endogenous Smad6 expression (∼75% suppression), whereas the endogenous levels of Tbx6 protein were increased by 2.5-fold (Fig. 5A). We tested the effects of Smad6 siRNA on Tbx6-mediated transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 5B, knockdown of endogenous Smad6 elevated the basal activity of the Myf-5 promoter. Compared with control cells, Myf-5 promoter activity was enhanced in Smad6 siRNA-treated cells in a manner that correlated highly with the percentage of loss of Smad6. Similar results were obtained using the 4×Tbx-TK reporter (Fig. 5C), showing that knockdown of Smad6 enhances Tbx6-induced transcriptional activity. We then examined whether the loss of Smad6 impairs the endogenous expression of Tbx6 downstream genes in TT-D6 cells. In addition to Myf-5, Dll1 (Delta-like 1) and Mesp2 (mesoderm posterior 2) are also downstream targets of Tbx6 (25.White P.H. Chapman D.L. Genesis. 2005; 42: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26.Yasuhiko Y. Haraguchi S. Kitajima S. Takahashi Y. Kanno J. Saga Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3651-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Application of Tbx6 siRNA markedly decreased the mRNA expression of Dll1, Mesp2, and Myf-5, supporting the idea that Tbx6 is required for the expression of these mesoderm markers (supplemental Fig. S3). Alternatively, knockdown of endogenous Smad6 resulted in significant augmentation of Dll1, Mesp2, and Myf-5 mRNAs (2.8–4.2-fold increases) (Fig. 5D). Moreover, Smad6 suppression had subtle effects on Tbx6 mRNA transcription, providing new evidence that Tbx6 is regulated by an interaction with Smad6 at the level of post-translational modification rather than transcriptional regulation. To further determine the role of Smad6 and Smurf1 in the regulation of Tbx6 protein stability, we transfected TT-D6 cells with Smad6 and Smurf1 siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 5E, knockdown of endogenous Smad6 and Smurf1 increase Tbx6 protein levels. Similarly, inhibition of Smad6 and Smurf1 expression enhanced the transcriptional activity of Tbx6 (Fig. 5F). Unlike Smurf1, Smurf2 had no obvious effect on Tbx6 protein expression and transcriptional activity (supplemental Fig. S4). These results demonstrate that Smad6 and Smurf1 cooperate to regulate Tbx6 protein levels in TT-D6 cells. Because BMP signal induces a switch in the differentiation of myogenic cells to the osteogenic lineage (27.Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2077903989,"F(1)-ATPase is a rotary molecular motor in which the gamma-subunit rotates against the alpha(3)beta(3) cylinder. The unitary gamma-rotation is a 120 degrees step comprising 80 and 40 degrees substeps, each of these initiated by ATP binding and ADP release and by ATP hydrolysis and inorganic phosphate release, respectively. In our previous study on gamma-rotation at low temperatures, a highly temperature-sensitive (TS) reaction step of F(1)-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 was found below 9 degrees C as an intervening pause before the 80 degrees substep at the same angle for ATP binding and ADP release. However, it remains unclear as to which reaction step the TS reaction corresponds. In this study, we found that the mutant F(1)(beta E190D) from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 showed a clear pause of the TS reaction below 18 degrees C. In an attempt to identify the catalytic state of the TS reaction, the rotation of the hybrid F(1), carrying a single copy of beta E190D, was observed at 18 degrees C. The hybrid F(1) showed a pause of the TS reaction at the same angle as for the ATP binding of the incorporated beta E190D, although kinetic analysis revealed that the TS reaction is not the ATP binding step. These findings suggest that the TS reaction is a structural rearrangement of beta before or after ATP binding."
https://openalex.org/W2105420212,"The structural basis underlying the gating of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels remains elusive. We found that substitution of Leu-312 in the S6 transmembrane segment of mSlo1 BK channels with hydrophilic amino acids of smaller side-chain volume favored the open state. The sensitivities of channels to calcium and voltage were modified by some mutations and completely abolished by others. Interpretation of the results in terms of an allosteric model suggests that the calcium-insensitive mutants greatly destabilize the closed relative to the open conformation and may also disrupt the allosteric coupling between Ca(2+) or voltage sensors and the gate. Some Phe-315 mutations also favor the open state, suggesting that Leu-312 and Phe-315 may interact in the closed state, forming a major energy barrier that the channel has to overcome to open. Homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulations further support that the side chain of Leu-312 can couple strongly with the aromatic ring of Phe-315 in neighboring subunits (L-F coupling) to maintain the channel closed. Additionally, single-channel recordings indicate that the calcium-insensitive mutants, whose kinetics can be approximately characterized by a two-state closed-open (C-O) model, exhibit nearly 100% open probability under physiological conditions without alterations in single-channel conductance. These findings provide a basis for understanding the structure and gating of the BK channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W2155160407,"Maternal environment has been demonstrated to produce considerable impact on offspring growth. However, few studies have been carried out to investigate multi-generational maternal effects of elevated CO(2) on plant growth and development. Here we present the first report on the responses of plant reproductive, photosynthetic, and cellular characteristics to elevated CO(2) over 15 generations using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system. We found that within an individual generation, elevated CO(2) significantly advanced plant flowering, increased photosynthetic rate, increased the size and number of starch grains per chloroplast, reduced stomatal density, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, and resulted in a higher reproductive mass. Elevated CO(2) did not significantly influence silique length and number of seeds per silique. Across 15 generations grown at elevated CO(2) concentrations, however, there were no significant differences in these traits. In addition, a reciprocal sowing experiment demonstrated that elevated CO(2) did not produce detectable maternal effects on the offspring after fifteen generations. Taken together, these results suggested that the maternal effects of elevated CO(2) failed to extend to the offspring due to the potential lack of genetic variation for CO(2) responsiveness, and future plants may not evolve specific adaptations to elevated CO(2) concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2078015516,"Co-translational import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is primarily controlled by N-terminal signal sequences that mediate targeting of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Sec61/translocon and initiate the translocation process. Here we show that after targeting to the translocon the secondary structure of the nascent polypeptide chain can significantly modulate translocation efficiency. ER-targeted polypeptides dominated by unstructured domains failed to efficiently translocate into the ER lumen and were subjected to proteasomal degradation via a co-translocational/preemptive pathway. Productive ER import could be reinstated by increasing the amount of alpha-helical domains, whereas more effective ER signal sequences had only a minor effect on ER import efficiency of unstructured polypeptides. ER stress and overexpression of p58(IPK) promoted the co-translocational degradation pathway. Moreover polypeptides with unstructured domains at their N terminus were specifically targeted to proteasomal degradation under these conditions. Our study indicates that extended unstructured domains are signals to dispose ER-targeted proteins via a co-translocational, preemptive quality control pathway."

Cocaine-free polydrug controls (n = 18) and cocaine polydrug users (n = 18) were matched on sex, age, alcohol consumption, and IQ (using the Raven's progressive matrices), and were tested by using the Global-Local task to measure the scope of attention. Cocaine polydrug users attended significantly more to local aspects of attended events, which fits with the idea that a reduced scope of attention may be associated with the perpetuation of the use of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2024406721,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common malignancy of the adult kidney and displays heterogeneity in clinical outcomes. Through comprehensive gene expression profiling, we have identified previously a set of transcripts that predict survival following nephrectomy independent of tumor stage, grade, and performance status. These transcripts, designated as the SPC (supervised principal components) gene set, show no apparent biological or genetic features that provide insight into renal carcinogenesis or tumor progression. We explored the relationship of this gene list to a set of genes expressed in different anatomical segments of the normal kidney including the cortex (cortex gene set) and the glomerulus (glomerulus gene set), and a gene set expressed after serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts (the core serum response or CSR gene set). Interestingly, the normal cortex, glomerulus (part of the normal renal cortex), and CSR gene sets captured more than 1/5 of the genes in the highly prognostic SPC gene set. Based on gene expression patterns alone, the SPC gene set could be used to sort samples from normal adult kidneys by the anatomical regions from which they were dissected. Tumors whose gene expression profiles most resembled the normal renal cortex or glomerulus showed better survival than those that did not, and those with expression features more similar to CSR showed poorer survival. While the cortex, glomerulus, and CSR signatures predicted survival independent of traditional clinical parameters, they were not independent of the SPC gene list. Our findings suggest that critical biological features of lethal ccRCC include loss of normal cortical differentiation and activation of programs associated with wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2011697615,"Lamprey, basal vertebrate, is an important model system for understanding early events in vertebrate evolution. Lamprey contains orthologs of the estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor and corticoid receptor. A perplexing property of lamprey is that 15alpha-hydroxy-steroids are active steroids. For example, 15alpha-hydroxy-estradiol [15alpha-OH-E2] is the estrogen, instead of estradiol [E2]. To investigate how 15alpha-OH-E2 binds lamprey ER, we constructed a 3D model of the lamprey ER with E2 and 15alpha-OH-E2.We used the 3D structure of human ERalpha as a template to construct a 3D model of lamprey ER. E2 and 15alpha-OH-E2 were inserted into the 3D model of lamprey ER and 15alpha-OH-E2 was inserted into human ERalpha. Then the each steroid-protein complex was refined using Discover 3 from Insight II software. To determine if lamprey ER had some regions that were unique among vertebrate ERs, we used the ligand-binding domain of lamprey ER as a query for a BLAST search of GenBank.Our 3D model of lamprey ER with 15alpha-OH-E2 shows that Sdelta on Met-409 can form a hydrogen bond with the 15alpha-hydroxyl on 15alpha-OH-E2. In human ERalpha, the corresponding residue Ile-424 has a van der Waals contact with 15alpha-OH-E2. BLAST analysis of GenBank indicates that among vertebrate ERs, only lamprey ER contains a methionine at this position. Thus, the contact between Sdelta on Met-409 and 15alpha-OH-E2 is unique. Interestingly, BLAST finds that five New World monkeys and a sturgeon contain a valine instead of isoleucine.In addition to shedding light on the structure of the ER in a basal vertebrate, our 3D model of lamprey ER should prove useful in virtual screening of chemical libraries to identify compounds for controlling reproduction in sea lamprey, an environmental pest in Lake Michigan."
https://openalex.org/W2093585854,"Linear genome stability requires specialized telomere replication and protection mechanisms. A common solution to this problem in non-eukaryotes is the formation of hairpin telomeres by telomere resolvases (also known as protelomerases). These enzymes perform a two-step transesterification on replication intermediates to generate hairpin telomeres using an active site similar to that of tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. Unlike phage telomere resolvases, the telomere resolvase from the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi (ResT) is a permissive enzyme that resolves several types of telomere in vitro. However, the ResT region and residues mediating permissive substrate usage have not been identified. The relapsing fever Borrelia hermsii ResT exhibits a more restricted substrate usage pattern than B. burgdorferi ResT and cannot efficiently resolve a Type 2 telomere. In this study, we determined that all relapsing fever ResTs process Type 2 telomeres inefficiently. Using a library of chimeric and mutant B. hermsii/B. burgdorferi ResTs, we mapped the determinants in B. burgdorferi ResT conferring the ability to resolve multiple Type 2 telomeres. Type 2 telomere resolution was dependent on a single proline in the ResT catalytic region that was conserved in all Lyme disease but not relapsing fever ResTs and that is part of a 2-amino acid insertion absent from phage telomere resolvase sequences. The identification of a permissive substrate usage determinant explains the ability of B. burgdorferi ResT to process the 19 unique telomeres found in its segmented genome and will aid further studies on the structure and function of this essential enzyme.

Hairpin DNA is not recognized as a double-strand break, and continuous synthesis of DNA around the hairpin loop abolishes the end replication problem. However, mother and daughter replicons are covalently linked at the junction of their telomeres following DNA replication; separation of the two replicons and formation of new hairpin telomeres require a DNA breakage and reunion process referred to as telomere resolution (17.Chaconas G.

Telomere resolvase catalyzes a two-step transesterification reaction in which staggered cuts are introduced 6 bp apart on either side of the axis of symmetry in the replicated telomere substrate (5.Hertwig S.

Subsequent nucleophilic attack on opposing strands by the free 5′-OH groups in the nicked substrate creates covalently closed hairpin telomeres. A recent crystal structure of the Klebsiella phage telomere resolvase (TelK) in complex with its substrate identified the residues involved in catalysis (25.Aihara H. Huang W.M. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); all but one of these residues are conserved in all telomere resolvases (22.Deneke J. Burgin A.B. Wilson S.L. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53699-53706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), implying that the basic catalytic mechanism underlying telomere resolution is conserved. However, telomere resolvase sequences vary substantially outside of the central catalytic region (25.Aihara H. Huang W.M. Ellenberger T. Mol.

Microbiol. 2007; 64: 580-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the enzymes characterized to date demonstrate important differences in substrate usage that likely reflect functionally distinct mechanisms of substrate interaction. The Borrelia burgdorferi telomere resolvase, ResT, appears to be particularly divergent. It is substantially smaller than phage telomere resolvases, and unlike its phage counterparts (5.Hertwig S. Klein I. Lurz R. Lanka E. Appel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 989-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20.Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microbiol. 2006; 62: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), presumably reflecting differences in the substrates resolved by phage and Borrelia telomere resolvases in vivo. On the other hand, B. burgdorferi ResT can fuse hairpin telomeres in a reversal of the resolution reaction (28.Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 783-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a function that is not shared with the phage telomere resolvase TelK (25.Aihara H. Huang W.M. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It can also synapse replicated telomeres and catalyze the formation of Holliday junctions (29.Kobryn K. Briffotaux J. Karpov V. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ability of ResT to promote hairpin fusion has been proposed as the mechanism underlying the ongoing genetic rearrangements that are a prominent feature of the B. burgdorferi genome (18.Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28.Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 783-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, B. burgdorferi ResT can tolerate a surprising amount of variation in its substrate (30.Tourand Y. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31.Tourand Y. Deneke J. Moriarty T.J. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7264-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a feature that is not shared by phage telomere resolvases (21.Huang W.M. Joss L. Hsieh T. Casjens S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although B. burgdorferi ResT appears to be more permissive with a greater scope of activities than other telomere resolvases, the sequences mediating most of its unique properties have not yet been identified. The B. burgdorferi genome contains a total of 19 distinct hairpin sequences, all of which must be resolved by ResT (31.Tourand Y. Deneke J. Moriarty T.J. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7264-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These sequences can be classified into three groups based on the presence and positioning of the box 1 motif, which is a critical determinant of activity in phage and Borrelia telomere resolvases (see Fig. 1A) (21.Huang W.M. Joss L. Hsieh T. Casjens S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24.Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4134-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although its function in telomere resolution is unknown. The box 1 consensus sequence (TAT(a/t)AT) closely resembles the −10/Pribnow box and TATA box consensus sequences of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters (TATAAT and TATA(a/t)A(a/t), respectively), which undergo transient deformations that predispose them to melting (36.Patel D.J. Kozlowski S.A. Weiss M. Bhatt R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and are intrinsically bent and anisotropically flexible (37.Davis N.A. Majee S.S. Kahn J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, box 1 may facilitate nucleation of hairpin folding and/or may confer an intrinsic bend or flexibility to substrates that is important for the resolution reaction. B. burgdorferi ResT can resolve telomeres in which box 1 is located at positions 1 and 4 nucleotides away from the axis of symmetry (Type 1 and 2 telomeres, respectively), as well as AT-rich telomeres without a box 1 sequence (Type 3 telomeres) (see Fig. 1A) (30.Tourand Y. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31.Tourand Y. Deneke J. Moriarty T.J. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7264-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). B. burgdorferi ResT cleaves telomeres at a fixed position relative to the axis of symmetry, independent of the location of box 1 (30.Tourand Y. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Positioning of the enzyme for cleavage in all telomere types is most likely driven by sequence-specific interactions between ResT domains 2 (catalytic) and/or 3 (C-terminal) and a fixed element upstream of box 1 that is positioned 14 nucleotides from the axis of symmetry in all Borrelia telomeres (box 3 and adjacent nucleotides) (see Figs. 1A and 2) (26.Tourand Y. Lee L. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 580-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Tourand Y. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 7264-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, box 1 and axis-flanking nucleotides are not involved in high affinity and/or sequence-specific interactions with ResT and require the ResT N-terminal domain for full protection in DNase footprinting assays (26.Tourand Y. Lee L. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 580-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27.Bankhead T. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The most likely candidate for interactions with box 1 and axis-flanking nucleotides is a Borrelia-specific hairpin-binding region in the N terminus, which is thought to promote a pre-hairpinning step involving strand opening at the axis (38.Bankhead T. Chaconas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13768-13773Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ResT from the relapsing fever Borrelia species Borrelia hermsii exhibits a more restricted substrate usage pattern in vitro when compared with ResT from the Lyme disease pathogen B. burgdorferi (39.Tourand Y. Bankhead T. Wilson S.L. Putteet-Driver A.D. Barbour A.G. Byram R. Rosa P.A. Chaconas G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Specifically, B. hermsii ResT is unable to efficiently resolve a Type 2 telomere. Therefore, B. burgdorferi ResT appears to be a more permissive enzyme than its relapsing fever counterpart. In this study, we investigated the basis for permissive substrate usage by B. burgdorferi ResT. Using a library of chimeric B. hermsii/B. burgdorferi ResTs, we mapped the sequence determinants in B. burgdorferi ResT that confer the ability to resolve multiple Type 2 telomeres. Surprisingly, this approach indicated that Type 2 telomere resolution was crucially regulated by a single proline residue located in a small Borrelia-specific insertion in the central catalytic region of ResT. The proline at this position was conserved in the ResTs from all Lyme disease Borrelia species but in none of the ResTs from relapsing fever Borrelia species, which were unable to efficiently resolve Type 2 telomeres in vitro. This study has identified a specific residue in ResT responsible for permissive substrate usage patterns. All relapsing fever and avian Borrelia strains were generously provided by Tom Schwan. ResT coding sequences were cloned from B. anserina strain BA.2 (GCB802), B. parkeri strain RML (GCB803), B. recurrentis strain number 132, P6 (GCB804), and B. turicatae strain 91E135 (GCB801). GenBankTM accession numbers for ResT coding sequences are as follows: B. anserina (FJ882620), B. parkeri (FJ882621), B. recurrentis (FJ882622), and B. turicatae (FJ882623). ResT coding sequences were amplified from the appropriate genomic DNAs using primers containing NdeI and BamH1 sites (described in supplemental Table S2). PCR conditions for the 50-μl reactions were as follows: 1× Phusion High Fidelity (HF) buffer (New England Biolabs, Pickering, Ontario, Canada), 3% DMSO 3The abbreviation used is: DMSOdimethyl sulfoxide., 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.02 units/μl Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 0.5 pmol/μl F primer, 0.5 pmol/μl R primer, 3 ng/μl genomic DNA template. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C 45 s followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C, 10 s; 57 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 45 s and then 72 °C for 10 min. Appropriately sized PCR products were gel-purified using a Qiagen gel purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and then cloned using the ZeroBlunt®TOPO®PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), all according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inserts were cut out of TOPO clones using NdeI/BamH1 (New England Biolabs) and cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET15b. dimethyl sulfoxide. Constructs encoding chimeric proteins were built using site-directed mutagenesis or overlap extension PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce amino acid substitutions or to introduce unique restriction sites that were subsequently used for swapping sequences between B. burgdorferi and relapsing fever ResTs. The methods, templates, and primers used to build each construct are described in supplemental Table S2, and primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S3. All constructs were sequenced before expression in E. coli. PCR conditions for the 50-μl reactions were as follows: 1× Phusion High Fidelity (HF) buffer (New England Biolabs), 3% DMSO, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 0.02 units/μl Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 0.4 pmol/μl F primer, 0.4 pmol/μl R primer, 1.5 ng/μl plasmid DNA template. The first three PCR cycles were performed separately for each primer (e.g. one tube for F primer, one tube for R primer). After the third cycle the contents of the F and R primer tubes were mixed, and PCR cycling was continued to completion. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C 45 s followed by 25–30 cycles of 98 °C, 20 s; 65–68 °C, 15 s; 70–72 °C, 3 min and 30 s and then 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were purified using the QIAQuick PCR purification kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen), and then template DNA was digested with DpnI (New England Biolabs). Purified, digested DNA was used directly to transform chemically competent DH5α. A description of the three-step PCR reaction and primer design is provided in supplemental Fig. S3. In the first step (25 PCR cycles), primers A and B were used to amplify the first approximately one-half of the chimera, and primers C and D were used to amplify the second half (e.g. B. burgdorferi ResT), in separate 50-μl reactions. Primers A and D contained 5′-NdeI and -BamHI sites, respectively. Primers B and C were partially complementary to one another and contained sequences that annealed to both B. burgdorferi and B. hermsii ResT coding sequences (60 °C of sequence complementarity for each). In the second PCR step (six PCR cycles), 2.5 μl of each of the two PCR products from Step 1 were mixed together directly (5-μl final reaction volume) and extended by DNA polymerase already present in the PCR mixture to generate a small amount of chimeric product containing all 1,347 nucleotides of the ResT coding sequence. In Step 3 (25 PCR cycles), 2.5 μl of full-length chimeric Step 2 product were amplified in a 50-μl PCR reaction, using primers A and D. PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 1× Phusion High Fidelity (HF) buffer (New England Biolabs), 3% DMSO, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 0.02 units/μl Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 0.1 pmol/μl F primer, 0.1 pmol/μl R primer, 1.5 ng/μl plasmid DNA template. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 98 °C, 15 s; 63 °C, 15 s; 72 °C, 30 s and then 72 °C for 7 min. Following PCR, products were gel-purified from agarose gels using the QIAQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Cleaned products were cloned into pJET1/blunt using the GeneJET PCR cloning kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (MBI Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). NdeI/BamHI-flanked ResT coding sequences were cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET15b. ResT expression and purification were performed as described previously (38.Bankhead T. Chaconas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13768-13773Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in an EDTA-free buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6). Resuspended cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles following lysozyme treatment followed by ultracentrifugation for 45 min at 100,000 × g 4 °C. Columns for His tag affinity purification were prepared using 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen). All purification buffers contained 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions were diluted to 50 ng/μl in elution buffer, and dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Previously described telomere substrates (30.Tourand Y. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31.Tourand Y. Deneke J. Moriarty T.J. Chaconas G. J. Biol.

Twenty-μl telomere resolution reactions contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm spermidine, 10 ng/μl PstI-linearized substrate DNA, and 10 ng/μl ResT. Time course reactions (140 μl) were incubated at 30 °C with 20-μl aliquots removed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 min. Reactions were performed in duplicate or triplicate and stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.2%. Samples were resolved on 20-cm 1% agarose gels in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer at 100 V for 2 h. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and fluorescence of DNA bands was quantified using the AlphaInnotech software. The percentage of telomere resolution was determined by dividing the fluorescence of the reaction products by the total fluorescence (products plus substrate). Initial velocity values were calculated from the graphical plots of reaction kinetics. Statistical analyses of data were performed using Microsoft Excel and a two-tailed Student's t test with unequal variance. The methods used to identify and align telomere resolvase sequences are described in the legends for Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2. The method used to thread ResT sequences onto the TelK structure is described in the legend for Fig. 4. Our previous work showed that B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and B. hermsii (relapsing fever) ResTs exhibit differences in substrate usage in vitro (39.Tourand Y. Bankhead T. Wilson S.L. Putteet-Driver A.D. Barbour A.G. Byram R. Rosa P.A. Chaconas G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Specifically, B. hermsii ResT resolves a Type 2 telomere very inefficiently when compared with B. burgdorferi, whereas both enzymes can resolve a Type 1 telomere efficiently (Fig. 1, A and B.) The basis for this species-specific difference in substrate usage is unknown. To determine whether ResTs from other relapsing fever Borrelia exhibit similar Type 2 telomere resolution defects, we cloned the ResT coding sequences from three other relapsing fever strains, B. parkeri, B. recurrentis, and B. turicatae, as well as the avian Borrelia species B. anserina. These sequences are shown in Fig. 2, together with the ResT sequences from other Lyme disease (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia garinii, and B. burgdorferi) and relapsing fever (B. hermsii and Borrelia duttonii) Borrelia species (39.Tourand Y.

https://openalex.org/W2050527864,"The sequence information available for homeodomains reveals that salt bridges connecting pairs 19/30, 31/42, and 17/52 are frequent, whereas aliphatic residues at these sites are rare and mainly restricted to proteins from homeotherms. We have analyzed the influence of salt and hydrophobic bridges at these sites on the stability and DNA binding properties of human Hesx-1 homeodomain. Regarding the protein stability, our analysis shows that hydrophobic side chains are clearly preferred at positions 19/30 and 31/42. This stabilizing influence results from the more favorable packing of the aliphatic side chains with the protein core, as illustrated by the three-dimensional solution structure of a thermostable variant, herein reported. In contrast only polar side chains seem to be tolerated at positions 17/52. Interestingly, despite the significant influence of pairs 19/30 and 31/42 on the stability of the homeodomain, their effect on DNA binding ranges from modest to negligible. The observed lack of correlation between binding strength and conformational stability in the analyzed variants suggests that salt/hydrophobic bridges at these specific positions might have been employed by evolution to independently modulate both properties."
https://openalex.org/W2070323777,"Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), a member of β2-integrin family, exerts multiple roles in host T cell immunity and has been identified as a useful drug-development target for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Applying the findings that primary resting T cells absorb nanometric membrane vesicles derived from antigen presenting cells (APC) via dual receptor/ligand interactions of T cell receptor (TCR) with cognate peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complex (pMHC) and LFA-1 with its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and that signaling cascades triggered by TCR/pMHC interaction take a part in the vesicle-absorption, we established a cell-based high throughput assay for systematic investigation, via isolation of small molecules modulating the level of vesicle-absorption, of molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell absorption of APC-derived vesicles, i.e., structural basis of TCR/pMHC and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions and TCR-mediated LFA-1 activation. As primary T cells along with physiological ligands expressed in biological membrane are used and also individual cells in assay samples are analyzed by flow cytometry, results obtained using the assay system hold superior physiological and therapeutic relevance as well as statistical precision."
https://openalex.org/W2008391318,"We used mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) naturally infected with simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) as a model for evaluating the influence of natural STLV-1 infection on the dynamics and evolution of the immune system during chronic infection. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the role of the immune system in controlling the infection during latency, we induced immunosuppression in the infected monkeys. We first showed that the STLV-1 proviral load was higher in males than in females and increased significantly with the duration of infection: mandrills infected for 10-6 years had a significantly higher proviral load than those infected for 2-4 years. Curiously, this observation was associated with a clear reduction in CD4+ T-cell number with age. We also found that the percentage of CD4(+) T cells co-expressing the activation marker HLA-DR and the mean percentage of CD25(+) in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected animals. Furthermore, the STLV-1 proviral load correlated positively with T-cell activation but not with the frequency of T cells secreting interferon gamma in response to Tax peptides. Lastly, we showed that, during immunosuppression in infected monkeys, the percentages of CD8(+) T cells expressing HLA-DR(+) and of CD4(+) T cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 decreased significantly, although the percentage of CD8(+) T cells expressing HLA-DR(+) and Ki67 increased significantly by the end of treatment. Interestingly, the proviral load increased significantly after immunosuppression in the monkey with the highest load. Our study demonstrates that mandrills naturally infected with STLV-1 could be a suitable model for studying the relations between host and virus. Further studies are needed to determine whether the different compartments of the immune response during infection induce the long latency by controlling viral replication over time. Such studies would provide important information for the development of immune-based therapeutic strategies."
