https://openalex.org/W2050353671,"A protein of molecular weight approximately 12,000 which binds long-chain fatty acids and certain other lipids has been identified in cytosol of intestinal mucosa, liver, myocardium, adipose tissue, and kidney. Binding is noncovalent and is greater for unsaturated than for saturated and medium-chain fatty acids. This protein appears to be identical with the smaller of two previously described cytoplasmic anion-binding proteins. Binding of long-chain fatty acids by this protein is greater than that of other anions tested, including sulfobromophthalein, and does not depend on negative charge alone. The presence of this binding protein may explain previously observed differences in intestinal absorption among fatty acids, and the protein may participate in the utilization of long-chain fatty acids by many mammalian tissues."

Jumbling remained an effective variable even when the subject knew where to look and what to look for. Thus an object's meaningful context may affect the course of perceptual recognition and not just peripheral scanning or memory."

The extent of blocking depended on the compound nitrosated and on the experimental conditions. Urea and ammonium sulfamate were less effective as blocking agents. The possibility of in vivo formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds from drugs could be lessened by the combination of such drugs with the ascorbic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1604550330,"Abstract The number of proteins in rat liver ribosomes was determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There were 30 proteins in the 40 S subunit, 39 in the 60 S subunit. The proteins of the two subunits, with one possible exception, are unique. Preparations of 80 S ribosomes contained three proteins not present in either subunit; thus, we estimate that eukaryotic ribosomes contain between 68 and 72 different proteins."

These two syndromes were related to an anatomical subdivision: Superficial lesions resulted in anterograde degeneration in the visual thalamus, whereas lesions confined to the deeper layers produced degeneration in the nonvisual thalamus and in brainstem motor areas."
https://openalex.org/W2122444542,"Mice (BDF1) inoculated with L1210 leukemia survive for a statistically significantly longer span when four courses of arabinosyl cytosine are administered at 4-day intervals-not in courses consisting of eight equal doses at 3-hour intervals, but in sinusoidally increasing and decreasing 24-hour courses, the largest amount being given at previously mapped circadian and circannual times of peak host resistance to the drug. This finding relates to the many therapeutic situations involving rhythmic, and thus predictable, cycles in the host's tolerance of undesired effects from the agent used."
https://openalex.org/W2078051565,"A new spectrophotometric assay has been used to determine the gross concentration of cardiac glycoside in individual monarch butterflies. Adults sampled during the fall migration in four areas of eastern North America exhibited a wide variation in cardiac glycoside concentration. The correlation between spectrophotometrically measured concentrations and emetic dose determinations supports the existence of a broad palatability spectrum in wild monarch butterflies. The cardiac gylcoside concentration is greater in females than in males and is independent of the dry weight of the butterflies; contrary to prediction, both the concentration mean and variance decrease southward. The defensive advantage of incorporating cardiac glycosides may be balanced by detrimental effects on individual viability."
https://openalex.org/W1551683052,"Abstract The solubility of the bovine glomerular basement membrane was assessed in a variety of reagents, including salt, urea, and detergent solutions, and found to be negligible except in urea and in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), where a limited solubilization of about 20% was effected. The material so solubilized differed in composition from the whole membrane, containing fewer of the amino acids characteristic of collagens, and was primarily of very high molecular weight, failing to penetrate 5% polyacrylamide gels on electrophoresis. Extraction of the basement membrane with urea or SDS in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol resulted in a rapid solubilization of the membrane. Moreover, the S-carboxymethylated basement membrane formed by the alkylation of the reduced membrane demonstrated a markedly enhanced solubility over that of the native membrane in all of the reagents. About 80% of the reduced alkylated membrane could be extracted into 5% SDS, and polyacrylamide electrophoresis in SDS revealed the presence of at least 11 components ranging in molecular weight from 30,000 to 220,000, as well as some material which failed to penetrate the 5% gel. No free sulfhydryl groups could be detected in the basement membrane, indicating that all of the cysteine residues occur in disulfide linkage. A number of different amino acids were found in NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal positions in this membrane. On the basis of the total NH2-terminal residues, an average molecular weight of 134,000 was calculated for the peptide chains. Cyanogen bromide treatment of the basement membrane resulted in a maximum of 70% conversion of methionine to homoserine. The incomplete action of the cyanogen bromide was shown to be due to the presence in the membrane of 30% of the methionine residues in the sulfoxide form. Reduction of the methionine sulfoxide permitted almost complete reaction with the cyanogen bromide to take place. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 of these cyanogen bromide products revealed the presence of peptide components which spanned a wide range of molecular weights. Examination of a number of other proteins indicated that most contain only insignificant amounts of methionine sulfoxide. However, the anterior lens capsule of the calf, another basement membrane, was found to have about 30% of its methionine in this oxidized form, which led in the case of this protein also to an incomplete reaction with cyanogen bromide."

https://openalex.org/W1584597633,"Abstract The rate and specificity of histone methylation were examined throughout the HeLa S-3 cell cycle in cultures synchronized by selective detachment in mitosis or by double thymidine block. (a) Of all the cellular fractions tested, only the 0.25 n H2SO4-soluble nuclear fraction contained proteins which appeared to be methylated at high rates. Within this fraction histone polypeptides f2a1 and f3 were methylated at the highest rates, f2b and f2a2 were methylated at lower rates and f1 polypeptides were not methylated at all. (b) Lysine residues in histone fractions f2a, f2b, and f3 were methylated throughout the cell cycle with maximum rates of methylation occurring in G2 phase and mitosis. Only histone f3 polypeptides contained significant amounts of methylated arginine and histidine residues. These residues were methylated at maximum rates during the S phase of the cell cycle. (c) Mitotic cells contained a higher percentage of methylated histone molecules than cells at other stages of the cell cycle and it was calculated that if there was only one methylation site in each of the molecules, from 80 to 100% of all f2a1, f2b, and f3 polypeptides were methylated. (d) The ratios of e, e-N-dimethyllysine to e-N-monomethyllysine in the histone fractions of the heteroploid malignant HeLa S-3 cell were about half the ratios of these amino acids reported found in the corresponding histones of normal cells. (e) The turnover rate of histone methyl groups was about 1 to 2% per hour depending upon the fraction."

The drug and its metabolites are excreted in urine and feces for more than 1 week. The pharmacology, disposition, and metabolism of 11-hydroxy-Delta(9)-tetra-hydrocannabinol mimic that of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, thus providing evidence that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (the major active component of marihuana) is converted to the 11-hydroxy compound in man, the latter compound being responsible for the effects."
https://openalex.org/W1594223211,"Abstract An acidic phosphoprotein has been isolated from adult pig brain and purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure employed ammonium sulfate precipitation, ECTEOLA - cellulose chromatography, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. This protein exhibits high affinity calcium binding (Kd = 2.5 x 10-5 m), binds 1 mole of calcium per mole of protein, and is one of two high affinity calcium-binding proteins found in pig brain. This calcium-binding protein is not present in either liver or kidney, suggesting that it may play a role in calcium function within nervous tissue. The calcium binding properties, phosphorus content and amino acid composition of the protein have been determined. The molecular weight of the protein, as determined by ultracentrifugation, is 11,500. The protein aggregates in the presence of calcium with the formation of multimers. Treatment with phosphatase results in loss of calcium binding activity, suggesting that calcium binds to the phosphate group of the protein. Each mole of protein contains 10 moles of phosphate."

Species differences in epididymal sperm were found in the terminal residues, resembling alpha-D-mannose, D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Species similarities were found in terminal residues, resembling L-fucose and N-acetylneuraminic acid. When ejaculated rabbit sperm were compared to epididyimal sperm, the latter were more agglutinable with a specific agglutinin recognizing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1512041247,"Abstract The recently discovered, biologically active, ferredoxin component of the aerobic nitrogen fixer, Azotobacter vinelandii, has been found to comprise two distinct, low potential proteins (Fd I, Em = -420 mv; Fd II, Em = -460 mv) which were about equally effective as electron carriers for the nitrogenase system and in NADP reduction by illuminated chloroplasts. The absorption spectrum of Fd I showed a shoulder between 380 and 420 nm, whereas Fd II had a broad peak with a maximum at 388 nm. The 400:280 absorbance ratio for Fd I was 0.58, and the 388:280 absorbance ratio of Fd II was 0.68. Fd I which was found to be the main ferredoxin component in A. vinelandii cells (about 5 times more abundant than Fd II) was crystallized and further characterized. Fd I yielded crystals of unusually large size, up to 1 mm in length and 0.01 mm in thickness. Fd I resembles clostridial ferredoxins in having eight non-heme iron and eight labile sulfide groups per mole but its molecular weight is more than twice as great (14,400 versus 6,000 daltons). The sulfur groups of Fd I, unlike those of other ferredoxins, were only slowly and incompletely titrable by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Fd I also differed from other ferredoxins in being significantly more stable in 4 m guanidine-HCl. The possible significance of some of these properties to the role of ferredoxin as a reductant for a nitrogenase system that functions in an aerobic organism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W16386846,"Isolated human platelet membranes which have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) acrylamide gel electrophoresis have been shown to contain a heterogeneous group of polypeptides of different molecular weight classes ranging from 10,000 to over 250,000. Three major glycoproteins have been identified in the platelet membrane. Some of the architectural relationships of the platelet membrane polypeptides were probed by analysis of the residual protein gel patterns following incubation of the intact cells with proteolytic enzymes. The membrane polypeptides in their native state in intact cells were relatively resistant to low dose Pronase digestion in contrast to the high sensitivity of the isolated membrane fragments to enzyme digestion. The membrane glycoproteins in intact cells were particularly susceptible to trypsin and papain action. Acetylcholinesterase was a readily accessible membrane constituent which was rapidly inactivated by small amounts of Pronase. N-Ethyl[14C]maleimide and [203Hg]p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate labeling of intact whole platelets revealed three major membrane polypeptides with reactive sulfhydryl groups. Isotopic labeling of one of these membrane polypeptides was partially blocked by prior incubation of washed platelets with anti-F(ab′)2 thrombosthenin fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1596901281,"Abstract The specificity of rabbit muscle creatine kinase for a series of guanidino substrate analogs has been investigated at 0°. The maximum velocities range from ≤0.1 to 90% that of creatine whereas the Michaelis constants are as much as two orders of magnitude larger than that for creatine. The activity is found to be very sensitive to certain structural features of the guanidino substrate molecules, such as the length of the alkyl side chain length and the position of the carboxyl group. The dissociation constants, Kdiss, of the guanidino analogs from the abortive quaternary complex, MnADP-guanidino analog-enzyme, have been determined by using the difference in the proton relaxation rate of water in the presence of each respective quaternary complex and the ternary MnADP-enzyme complex. Kdiss was also determined for some of the analogs as an inhibition constant, Ki, for the reverse reaction. Nitrate is found to affect drastically both the dissociation constant of the analogs from their respective quaternary complexes and the proton relaxation rate of these complexes. For example, the Kdiss of creatine is decreased from 5 mm to 80 µm and the proton relaxation rate of water is decreased by 50% on the addition of 2 mm potassium nitrate. In the absence of nitrate the dissociation constants are generally of the same order as the Michaelis constants, while in the presence of nitrate they are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller. These results provide cogent evidence for the hypothesis that the nitrate anion acts as an analog of the planer phosphoryl group which is transferred, thus leading to a structure which resembles the transition state."

https://openalex.org/W2104784577,"Abstract The kinetics of activation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids by long chain acyl-CoA synthetase from rat liver microsomes has been studied with a method of selective extraction of free fatty acids based on the insolubility of acyl-CoA in diethyl ether. All unsaturated fatty acids with a double bond in Δ9 position (palmitoleate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate) have values of Km in the same range (1.39 to 2.22 µm) and values of Vmax which vary from 9.09 to 18.52 µmoles per hour per mg of protein. These fatty acids are competitive inhibitors of the activation of each other. Each of these fatty acids has the same Ki (1.23 µm) for the inhibition of linolenic acid activation. Some of the metabolites of linoleic acid, eicosa-11,14-dienoic, eicosa-8,11,14-trienoic, and eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acids, and of linolenic acid, eicosa-11,14,17-trienoic acid, are also competitive inhibitors of the activation of palmitoleic acid: the two eicosatrienoic acids are the strongest inhibitors (Ki = 4.2 µm), followed by the eicosatetraenoic acid (Ki = 5.0 µm), and by the eicosadienoic acid (Ki = 7.0 µm). The Km values for CoA in the activation of palmitic and oleic acids are, respectively, 7.2 and 9.4 µm. The Km for activation of palmitic acid is 2.78 µm with a Vmax = 14.29 µmoles per hour per mg of protein. Palmitic acid is also a competitive inhibitor of linolenic acid activation with the same Ki (1.23 µm) as that of unsaturated fatty acids with a Δ9 double bond. Similarly palmitic and stearic acids are competitive inhibitors of palmitoleic acid activation (Ki = 2.4 and 17.3 µm, respectively). These results lead to the theoretical conclusion that there is probably only one long chain acyl-CoA synthetase which contains several active sites: a main site which may bind the carboxyl group, and therefore would be the same for all substrates, and secondary sites (or spatial configuration) to accommodate the different types of fatty acid molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1521597094,"Abstract The rate of O2 dissociation with CO replacement in the presence of dithionite and the rate of CO replacement by NO have been measured at 20° for human adult and fetal hemoglobins and their isolated subunits over a pH range from 6 to 9. The rates of these reactions for the isolated subunits are pH dependent, as are the rates for the fully liganded structures of the tetrameric hemoglobins. However, the pH dependence exhibited by the isolated subunits is different from that of the tetramer. Although there is no simple relationship between the kinetic properties of the isolated subunits and those of the tetramer, a modification of the intrinsic properties of a subunit is clearly reflected in a similar modification of the properties of the ligand-saturated tetramer. The enthalpy values of these replacement reactions are reported for human adult hemoglobin and its subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1503047199,"Abstract The use of the large capacity zonal rotor makes possible the routine isolation of 1 to 2 mg of hemoglobin mRNA (9 S RNA) from sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated reticulocyte polyribosomes. Mouse hemoglobin mRNA prepared by this method directs the synthesis of significant amounts of mouse globin β-chains when added to a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. The addition of mouse hemoglobin mRNA to a duck reticulocyte cell-free system results in the synthesis of both α- and β-globin chains, thus not only demonstrating the presence of both the α- and β-mRNAs in the mouse 9 S RNA but also the ability of a mammalian mRNA to be translated in a nonmammalian cell-free system. The addition of mouse globin mRNA to the rabbit cell-free system has little effect on the total amino acid incorporation into protein, although a substantial amount of the protein synthesized is mouse β-chains. This suggests that protein synthetic components other than mRNA may be limiting in the rabbit cell-free system and that the added mRNA is competing with endogenous mRNA. An increase of amino acid incorporation into protein is observed when the mouse hemoglobin mRNA is added to the duck cell-free system, suggesting that mRNA may be limiting in this cell-free preparation. The translational efficiencies of the mouse hemoglobin mRNA were essentially equal in both rabbit and duck cell-free systems with 4.0 to 4.5 globin chains synthesized per mRNA during the incubation period. Consequently, the rabbit and duck reticulocyte cell-free systems may be useful for assaying a variety of specific mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2468032187,"Rat glial cells were grown in tissue culture in vitamin B12-deficient medium. As the intracellular level of coenzyme B12 decreased, the cells made increasing amounts of two unusual fatty acids. The fatty acids were unbranched acids with 15 and 17 carbon atoms and arose as the cells progressively lost the ability to metabolize propionic acid through the B12-requiring methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. The levels of the 15- and 17-carbon acids returned to normal when the cultures were supplemented with vitamin B12. The possible importance of similar fatty acid changes in human vitamin B12 deficiency and in disorders of 3- and 4- carbon acid metabolism is speculated."

https://openalex.org/W1559274601,"Previous work has shown the substrate analog bromopyruvate to be an active site-specific alkylating agent for 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconic aldolase. The present work shows that [3H]bromopyruvate is detritiated by the enzyme indicating that the reagent is, in fact, a substrate. A kinetic expression derived from a model in which both catalysis and inactivation occur at the same protein site requires a constant amount of detritiation per mole of enzyme inactivated. This model was tested using the aldolase-bromopyruvate system, with the reagent over a range of concentrations which affect the inactivation rate. Over this concentration range the ratio of bromopyruvate detritiated to aldolase inactivated remained constant, as the derivation predicted, at about 50:1. In addition, excess enzyme removed only half of the tritium of (3R,S)-[3H]bromopyruvate showing the reaction to be stereospecific. Additional experiments showed that the product of reagent detritiation was (3S)-[3-3H]bromopyruvate. Thus, the aldolase activates the hydrogen in the Pro-R position of bromopyruvate. (3S)-[3-3H]Bromopyruvate was used to inactivate the aldolase. The [3-3H]carboxyketo-methyl enzyme was oxidatively decarboxylated with H2O2. The ester linkage to the enzyme was broken with hydroxylamine. The resulting tritiated glycolate was detritiated by glycolate oxidase indicating it to be of the 2R configuration. Thus the alkylation of the enzyme-carboxyl group must occur by an SN2 process. The data support a mechanism in which the enzyme, (E), recognized [3H]bromopyruvate, (I), as a substrate and binds it forming an EI complex which is detritiated. Once in about every 50 events (uncorrected for an isotope effect), complex formation results in the alkylation of an active site basic group. These experiments also illustrate a simple experimental approach which challenges whether a substrate analog which inactivates an enzyme is reacting within the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1615306748,"Abstract The reaction of puromycin with nascent peptides on polyribosomes was used to study transpeptidation on mammalian polysomes. This reaction on polyribosomes should be more nearly a model of transpeptidation in the intact cell than studies of peptide bond synthesis with synthetic donors and washed ribosomes. With the use of this assay for transpeptidation, it was possible to show that a single K+ or Na+ is necessary for transpeptidation; that protonation of a single group with a pKa equal to about 7.7 inactivates the transpeptidase complex; that with respect to protonation of this group H+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of peptidyl-puromycin synthesis; that protonation of a single moiety with a pKa of 9.4 activates the transpeptidase complex; that Mn++ can substitute for Mg++, but that Ca++, spermidine, spermine, and putrescine do so only very poorly; and that the Km for puromycin in this assay is about 8 x 10-6 m. In addition, the effect of pH on transpeptidation is analyzed to directly yield the pKa and the number of ionizable groups involved in the rate-limiting reaction by a simplified method which may have more general applicability."

https://openalex.org/W1548213021,"Abstract Fructose diphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been crystallized from rabbit livers after single or sequential injections of [14C]- and [3H]-lysine. The specific radioactivity of the lysine in the dehydrogenase rises continuously and reaches a maximum during the 5th day after injection, whereas that of the aldolase declines exponentially from the middle of the 1st day. There is sufficient information in the concurrent time curves to permit a numerical solution of the simultaneous equations for the time dependence of activity decay of the free lysine precursor pool and the rate constants for the synthesis and degradation of both proteins, internally corrected for the recycling of isotope. The first order rate constants of degradation of aldolase and the dehydrogenase are 0.62 and 0.25 day-1 corresponding to half-lives of 1.1 and 2.8 days, respectively. Following an initial rapid decline, the specific activity of the effective free lysine pools tends to plateau at a level intermediate between those of the lysines in aldolase and the dehydrogenase and becomes equal to that of the dehydrogenase when the latter reaches its maximum. During this period, the radioactivity of the free lysine is replenished by the breakdown of the most rapidly metabolized fraction of liver proteins. As measured by the uncorrected raw data, the apparent half-life of lysine-labeled aldolase is 3.86 days and of leucine-labeled aldolase 1.48 days. Leucine is less extensively recycled. In contrast with efforts to obtain true pulse labeling conditions by using a rapidly cleared isotope, the present analysis is facilitated by the use of lysine, an amino acid that is most extensively reutilized."

Only the 3',5' internucleotide diester bonds were formed. This polymerization occurs without the addition of any activating agent or catalyst."
https://openalex.org/W1579218607,"Abstract The paper reports rapid mixing and relaxation experiments performed on mixtures of oxy- (HbO2) and carbon monoxide (HbCO) human hemoglobin. On the (well justified) assumption that the two ligands will distribute at random between the available sites, intermediates containing different proportions of O2 and CO will be formed. In the stopped flow experiments mixtures containing different proportions of the two ligands have been mixed with sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), which rapidly reduces to zero the O2 concentration in the system. The apparent dissociation velocity constant for O2 (koff) measured under these conditions decreases progressively as the fraction of HbCO in the mixture increases, in agreement with previous observations on sheep hemoglobin. Temperature jump experiments performed on mixtures of HbCO and HbO2 show that the amplitude of the faster relaxation time (τf) relative to that of the slower one (τf) increases as the percentage of HbCO in the mixture is progressively increased. At high enough percentage of HbCO (≥70%), the amplitude of the faster relaxation time becomes dominant. The reciprocal relaxation time (τf-1), measured under these conditions, is linearly dependent on oxygen concentration, while it is independent of protein concentration (so long as O2 is buffered). The apparent second order velocity constant is kon = 4.8 x 107 m-1 s-1 at 25°. Simple considerations indicate that the kinetics of the reaction with oxygen of mixtures containing high enough percentages of HbCO should represent the combination and dissociation velocity constants of high affinity forms of hemoglobin."
