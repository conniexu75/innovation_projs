https://openalex.org/W2005150284,"Transient transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene following serum stimulation of susceptible cells requires a conserved DNA element located 300 bp 5' to the mRNA cap site. A DNA-binding gel electrophoresis assay was used to detect a protein(s) in HeLa cell nuclear extracts that specifically binds to the 5' activating element. The protein recognizes a region of dyad symmetry within the 5' activating element, defined by binding competition, dimethylsulphate (DMS) interference and DNAase I and DMS protection studies. A single 22 bp synthetic copy of the dyad symmetry element will both compete efficiently for protein binding and restore serum regulation to c-fosH genes that lack the 5' activating element."
https://openalex.org/W2151598389,"Several of the endothelial cell polypeptide mitogens that have been described probably play a role in blood vessel homeostasis. Two overlapping complementary DNA clones encoding human endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) were isolated from a human brain stem complementary DNA library. Southern blot analysis suggested that there is a single copy of the ECGF gene and that it maps to human chromosome 5 at bands 5q31.3 to 33.2 A 4.8-kilobase messenger RNA was present in human brain stem messenger RNA. The complete amino acid sequence of human ECGF was deduced from the nucleic acid sequence of these clones; it encompasses all the well-characterized acidic endothelial cell polypeptide mitogens described by several laboratories. The ECGF-encoding open reading frame is flanked by translation stop codons and provides no signal peptide or internal hydrophobic domain for the secretion of ECGF. This property is shared by human interleukin-1, which is approximately 30 percent homologous to ECGF."
https://openalex.org/W1580333051,"Serum amyloid A protein (apo-SAA), an acute phase reactant, is an apolipoprotein of high density lipoproteins (HDL), in particular the denser subpopulation HDL3. The structure of HDL3 isolated from humans affected by a variety of severe disease states was investigated with respect to density, size, and apolipoprotein composition, using density gradient ultracentrifugation, gradient gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and solid phase immunoadsorption. Apo-SAA was present in HDL particles in increasing amounts as particle density increased. Apo-SAA-containing HDL3 had bigger radii than normal HDL3 of comparable density. Purified apo-SAA associated readily with normal HDL3 in vitro, giving rise to particles containing up to 80% of their apoproteins as apo-SAA. The addition of apo-SAA resulted in a displacement of apo-A-I and an increase in particle size. Acute phase HDL3 represented a mixture of particles, polydisperse with respect to apolipoprotein content; for example, some particles were isolated that contained apo-A-I, apo-A-II, and apo-SAA, whereas others contained apo-A-I and apo-SAA but no apo-A-II. We conclude that apo-SAA probably associates in the circulation of acute phase patients with existing HDL particles, causing the remodeling of the HDL shell to yield particles of bigger size and higher density that are relatively depleted of apo-A-I."
https://openalex.org/W2008850485,"We have identified a region (virG) on the 230 kb virulence plasmid of S. flexneri that is required for cell-to-cell spread of the bacterium. Tn5 insertions into this region result in avirulent mutants that can initially invade and multiply in epithelial cells, but tend to lose active movement and tend to localize within the cytoplasm, where they are gradually extinguished without infecting adjacent cells. The virG region was localized to within 4 kb and may contain a single cistron. Sequences hybridizing to this region were found in all intact virulence plasmids of Shigellae and enteroinvasive E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2017070390,"We expressed cDNA for the rabbit polymeric immunoglobulin receptor in polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney epithelial cells, which normally do not produce this receptor. The receptor appeared to function as in vivo; dimeric IgA was transported from the basolateral to the apical surface and released into the apical medium, together with the cleaved fragment of the receptor, known as secretory component. This system enabled us, for the first time, to study quantitatively IgA transcytosis in vitro and thus make the following observations. First, greater than 90% of the newly made receptor that is ultimately cleaved to secretory component and released into the apical medium goes first to the basolateral surface. Second, transport of the receptor does not depend on ligand binding. Third, transcytosis of bound ligand has a t 1/2 of 30 min."
https://openalex.org/W2052764940,"Whether growth hormone stimulates longitudinal bone growth by a direct effect at the site of the growth plate or indirectly by increasing the concentration of circulating somatomedins (insulin-like growth factors) has been the subject of controversy. Immunohistochemical methods were used to explore the localization and distribution of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) immunoreactivity in the epiphyseal growth plate of the proximal tibia of male rats. Cells in the proliferative zone of the growth plate of normal rats exhibited a bright immunofluorescence, whereas cells in the germinal and hypertrophic zones stained only weakly. In rats subjected to hypophysectomy, the number of fluorescent cells was markedly reduced. When the hypophysectomized rats were treated with growth hormone, either systemically or at the site of the growth plate, the number of IGF-I-immunoreactive cells in the proliferative zone was increased. The results show that IGF-I is produced in proliferative chondrocytes in the growth plate and that the number of IGF-I-containing cells is directly regulated by growth hormone. These findings suggest that IGF-I has a specific role in the clonal expansion of differentiated chondrocytes and exerts its function locally through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2033143360,"Flagellar phase variation is mediated by a recombination event that occurs at specific sites leading to inversion of a chromosomal segment of DNA. The presence of a 60 bp recombinational enhancer sequence on the DNA substrate molecule results in a 150-fold stimulation in the initial rate of inversion. The protein components required for inversion have been purified. They include the 21,000 dalton recombinase (Hin), a 12,000 dalton host protein (Factor II), and one of the major histone-like proteins of E. coli HU. The dependence of the initial rate of recombination on HU varies with respect to the location of the recombinational enhancer. The role of HU, Factor II, and the enhancer in facilitating site-specific recombination is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059847344,"In studies to determine the biochemical mechanisms responsible for cell proliferation, synchronized T cells were used as a model for cellular growth control. By metabolic and morphologic criteria, it was found that activation of the T-cell antigen receptor rendered the cells responsive to interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did not move them through the cell cycle. Instead, IL-2 stimulated G1 progression to S phase, or lymphocyte ""blastic transformation."" During IL-2-promoted G1 progression, expression of the cellular proto-oncogene c-myb was induced transiently at six to seven times basal levels, maximal levels occurring at the midpoint of G1."
https://openalex.org/W2010653401,"All stable, naturally occurring circular yeast DNA plasmids contain a pair of long, nontandem inverted repeats that undergo frequent reciprocal recombination. This yields two plasmid inversion isomers that exist in the cell in equal numbers. In the 2 mu circle plasmid of S. cerevisiae such inversion is catalyzed by a plasmid-encoded site-specific recombinase, FLP. We show that the site-specific recombination system of 2 mu circle enables the plasmid to increase its mean intracellular copy number in yeast cells growing under nonselective conditions. This apparently occurs by a FLP-induced transient shift in the mode of replication from theta to double rolling circle as initially proposed by Futcher. This capability may ensure stable maintenance of the plasmid by enabling it to correct downward deviations in copy number that result from imprecision of the plasmid-encoded partitioning system."
https://openalex.org/W1973598980,"Group II intron bl1 from yeast mitochondria can undergo self-splicing in vitro. Exons become correctly ligated, and the excised intron has a lariat structure similar to that of introns from nuclear mRNA. The branch point of the bl1 lariat is located eight or nine nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of the intron and is part of a hairpin structure that is well conserved among group II introns. Several mutations next to the branch point and in other parts of the core structure of group II introns are shown to affect lariat formation. One of them, carried by strain M4873, abolishes splicing in vivo and in vitro, apparently by changing the architecture of the hairpin structure containing the branch point. Similarities between group II introns and nuclear pre-mRNA introns are discussed in terms of evolutionary relatedness."
https://openalex.org/W1501665702,"The major surface protein of Leishmania promastigotes is evolutionarily conserved and is found in isolates of L. donovani, L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, and L. braziliensis. The data provided in this communication demonstrate that in L. major this integral membrane protein is a protease, which we now designate promastigote surface protease. The enzyme has an alkaline pH optimum and is active both in its detergent-solubilized form and at the surface of living or fixed promastigotes. A water-soluble form of promastigote surface protease is obtained following digestion with the phospholipase C responsible for the release of the variant surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei. Possible biological functions of promastigote surface protease during the life cycle of Leishmania parasites are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1987984945,"We have purified biosynthetically labeled α-factor secreted from transformed yeast α cells. This α-factor binds specifically to a cells and is internalized by a time-, temperature-, and energy-dependent process. α-factor is internalized in an intact form and then rapidly degraded. Two yeast mutants defective in the accumulation of an endocytotic marker, lucifer yellow CH, in the vacuole have been isolated. end1 accumulates invaginations of the plasma membrane, and end2, an internal membrane-bound organelle. One of these mutants, end1, is defective for internalization of α-factor. Both of these mutants are defective in pheromone response."
https://openalex.org/W1972450546,"In Trypanosomatidae the messenger RNA's (mRNA's) that code for the variant surface glycoproteins (VSG's), tubulins, calmodulin, and at least a subset of other proteins contain a common 35-nucleotide leader sequence at their 5′ ends. Hybrid-arrested in vitro translation has been used to show that all mRNA's in both African and South American trypanosomes contain this 35-nucleotide sequence. Oligonucleotides complementary to this sequence blocked translation of all trypanosome mRNA's in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, but did not inhibit translation of mRNA's from other organisms lacking this sequence. An oligonucleotide complementary to the VSG mRNA downstream from the spliced leader sequence arrested only VSG synthesis. Thus, the 35-nucleotide leader sequence is a general feature of all trypanosome mRNA's. The high specificity of oligonucleotides complementary to the spliced leader for their target sequence suggests that analogues permeable to the cell membrane may be useful in the treatment of trypanosomal infections."
https://openalex.org/W1506521906,"The second messenger function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) was investigated in carbamylcholine-stimulated RINm5F cells by analysis of the early changes in inositol phosphates, cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and insulin secretion. After a lag of 2 s, [Ca2+]i rose to a peak at 13 +/- 2 s, a response which was due mainly to mobilization from intracellular stores since it persisted even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ response had already declined toward prestimulatory levels by the time insulin secretion reached its maximal rate (2-3 min). Although the rises in inositol trisphosphate preceded those of both inositol bisphosphate and monophosphate, all three attained maximal concentrations after 1 min and remained elevated for at least 10 min. The accumulation of inositol trisphosphate was truly Ca2+-independent since it persisted under conditions in which the rise in [Ca2+]i was abolished by prior depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools. Further analysis by high performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of the two isomers, Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-1,3,4-P3 in stimulated cells. The latter was virtually absent under nonstimulatory conditions but started to accumulate after a 5-s lag and reached maximal levels after 30 s of stimulation. Ins-1,4,5-P3 doubled within 1 s of carbamylcholine addition, reached a peak after 5 s, and, although declining thereafter, remained slightly elevated for at least 3 min. Hence, both the onset and peak of the rise of Ins-1,4,5-P3 preceded that of [Ca2+]i, which in turn preceded the peak in insulin release. These results strongly suggest that Ins-1,4,5-P3 acts as the second messenger by which carbamylcholine mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ during the initiation of insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W2005251432,"Decanal and N-amino-N'-1-octylguanidine (AOG), combined at 28 microM each, mediated erythrocyte lysis within 80 minutes under physiological conditions. By contrast, no lysis was observed after 20 hours with either decanal (56 microM) or AOG (100 microM) alone. The pronounced synergism observed for these chemicals and similar reactive pairs of chemicals is due to the self-assembly of more cytotoxic hydrazones in situ. Decanal and AOG also exhibit synergistic activity against cultured human cells (HeLa) and bacteria (Escherichia coli J96). This synergism may be useful in the design of cytotoxins that would self-assemble selectively from nontoxic precursors within tumors, while sparing normal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W142315095,"The complete amino acid sequences of bovine and human brain endozepines have been determined. The amino-terminal serine of both endozepines is acylated. Assignment of the first 7 residues was achieved through Edman degradation after acid-induced rearrangement and subsequent acid hydrolysis of the amino-terminal blocking group. Cleavage of endozepine by chemical and enzymatic techniques established all the fragments in an unambiguous sequence. Bovine and human endozepines are single-chain polypeptides of 86 residues, with calculated molecular weights of 9913, displaying 93% homology. A comparison between the sequences of bovine and human endozepines with the partial sequences of the functionally related diazepam binding inhibitor from rat brain reveals significant sequence homology. The reported results suggest that bovine and human endozepines as well as rat diazepam binding inhibitor belong to a new family of polypeptides which presumably take part in the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1649728644,"A protocol employing discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation was developed to prepare light mitochondrial (L) and Golgi fraction endosomes from simultaneously prepared parent L and microsomal fractions. As judged by the concentration of labeled hormone postinjection, L intermediate and heavy endosome subfractions were 40- to 175-fold purified and Golgi intermediate and heavy endosome subfractions were 30- to 45-fold purified. On electron microscopy, L endosomal fractions contained a predominance of lipoprotein-filled vesicles and were less heterogeneous than corresponding Golgi endosomal fractions. All endosomal fractions were enriched in receptors for insulin and prolactin but binding sites for the former were more broadly distributed in other subfractions than those for the latter. On Percoll gradient centrifugation, L endosomal fractions yielded one peak (rho 1.057) corresponding to the heavier of two peaks seen in Golgi endosomal fractions. The protein composition of high density L and Golgi endosomes, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was similar. The bulk of marker enzymes assayed did not migrate with the endosomal components. Combined acid phosphatase cytochemistry and electron microscope radioautography established that about 80% of the L endosomes contained no acid phosphatase. By affinity labeling and immunological titration with insulin receptor antibody, insulin receptors were identical in L and Golgi endosomes. Insulin-stimulable receptor kinase was demonstrable in both L and Golgi endosome fractions. Following in vivo insulin administration, the insulin receptor kinase in both L and Golgi endosomes was significantly activated. This activated state was not inhibited by a large excess of antiserum to insulin and thus not due to insulin contaminating the partially purified receptor preparation. These observations are compatible with the maintenance and/or initiation of hormone-dependent phosphorylations intracellularly."

https://openalex.org/W1513688187,"Glucagon is a peptide hormone of 29 amino acids encoded by a preprohormone which contains in tandem the sequences of glucagon and two additional glucagon-like peptides (GLPs) structurally related to glucagon and separated by intervening peptides. Glucagon arises by cleavage from the prohormone within the A cells of the pancreatic islets but in the intestine remains as part of a partially processed precursor (glicentin). To determine whether additional glucagon-like peptides are processed from preproglucagon and to analyze for potential cellular specificity in the processing of preproglucagon, we introduced and expressed a metallothionein-glucagon fusion gene in a fibroblast and two endocrine (pituitary and pancreatic islet) cell lines. Chromatographic analyses of cell extracts utilizing specific radioimmunoassays to chemically synthesized peptides demonstrate the liberation of intact glucagon, glicentin, GLP-I(1-37), GLP-I(7-37), GLP-II, and an intervening peptide amidated at its carboxyl terminus. The peptides were present in distinct yet different patterns in the two endocrine but not the fibroblast cell lines. The cell-specific liberation of the glucagon-like and intervening peptides suggests their potential as new bioactive peptides. The cellular specificity in the processing of preproglucagon indicates that the genetic determinants of the processing activity are complex and are expressed in a cell-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1587540429,"Mutations were induced in the ampicillinase gene of a bacteriophage f1/pBR322 chimera both by incorporation of O6-methyl-dGTP opposite T during DNA replication in vitro and by site-directed mutagenesis using O6-methylguanine-containing oligonucleotides. After passage of the DNA through Escherichia coli, analysis of 151 O6-methyl-dGTP-induced mutations indicated a significantly greater number of unmutated mutation sites than expected, whereas the mutated sites generally fit a Poisson distribution. The unmutated sites are assumed to be caused by the inability of some sequences to tolerate the presence of a tetrahedral methyl group within the confines of a Watson-Crick helix (Toorchen, D., and Topal, M.D. (1983) Carcinogenesis 4, 1591-1597). A consensus of the DNA sequences surrounding unmutated mutation sites was derived. The consensus sequence had significant similarity to the region of the rat Harvey ras oncogene containing the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea activated site for transformation (Zarbl, H., Sukumar, S., Arthur, A. V., Dionisio, M.-Z., and Barbacid, M. (1985) Nature 315, 382-385). We propose that direct alkylation at O6 of a guanine present within the consensus sequence may produce a DNA conformation less subject to repair. Mutation by O6-methylguanine-containing oligonucleotides demonstrated that repair of the O6-methylguanine lesions varied at least 3-4-fold with position of the lesion."
https://openalex.org/W1489401959,"T4 endonuclease V is a pyrimidine dimer-specific endonuclease which generates incisions in DNA at the sites of pyrimidine dimers by a processive reaction mechanism. A model is presented in which the degree of processivity is directly related to the efficacy of the one-dimensional diffusion of endonuclease V on DNA by which the enzyme locates pyrimidine dimers. The modulation of the processive nicking activity of T4 endonuclease V on superhelical covalently closed circular DNA (form I) which contains pyrimidine dimers has been investigated as a function of the ionic strength of the reaction. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to separate the three topological forms of the DNA which were generated in time course reactions of endonuclease V with dimer-containing form I DNA in the absence of NaCl, and in 25, 50, and 100 mM NaCl. The degree of processivity was evaluated in terms of the mass fraction of form III (linear) DNA which was produced as a function of the fraction of form I DNA remaining. Processivity is maximal in the absence of NaCl and decreases as the NaCl concentration is increased. At 100 mM NaCl, processivity is abolished and endonuclease V generates incisions in DNA at the site of dimers by a distributive reaction mechanism. The change from the distributive to a processive reaction mechanism occurs at NaCl concentrations slightly below 50 mM. The high degree of processivity which is observed in the absence of NaCl is reversible to the distributive mechanism, as demonstrated by experiments in which the NaCl concentration was increased during the time course reaction. In addition, unirradiated DNA inhibited the incision of irradiated DNA only at NaCl concentrations at which processivity was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1499122119,"Studies with Escherichia coli cells showed that the transport systems encoded by glpT (sn-glycerol 3-phosphate transport) and uhpT (hexose phosphate transport) catalyze a reversible 32Pi:Pi exchange. This reaction could be used to monitor the glpT or uhpT activities during reconstitution. Membranes from suitably constructed strains were extracted with octylglucoside in the presence of lipid and glycerol, and proteoliposomes were formed by dilution in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7). Both reconstituted systems mediated a 32Pi:Pi exchange which was blocked by the appropriate heterologous substrate, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) or 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (2DG6P), with an apparent Ki near 50 microM. In the absence of an imposed cation-motive gradient, Pi-loaded proteoliposomes also transported the expected physiological substrate; Michaelis constants for the transport of G3P or 2DG6P were near 20 microM. The heterologous exchange showed a maximal velocity of 130 nmol/min/mg protein via the glpT system and 11 nmol/min/mg protein for the uhpT system. This difference was expected because the G3P transport activity had been reconstituted from a strain carrying multiple copies of the glpT gene. Taken together, these results suggest that anion exchange may be the molecular basis for transport by the glpT and uhpT proteins."
https://openalex.org/W154635942,"A series of high mannose oligosaccharides with the size range Man8-14GlcNAc was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase, and the composition of each was determined by chemical analysis. Purity and composition were verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz, and structures were assigned on the basis of chemical shifts in C1-H and C2-H protons of similarly substituted compounds of known structure. Such analyses showed that these invertase oligosaccharides were a homologous series of homogeneous compounds, each related to the next member by addition of 1 mol of mannose in a specific alpha-linked configuration. Man8GlcNAc purified from the total glycoprotein fraction of disrupted yeast was the smallest species found and had the same homogeneous structure as that previously reported for the Man8GlcNAc from invertase (Byrd, J. C., Tarentino, A. L., Maley, F., Atkinson, P. H., and Trimble, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14657-14666). Digestion of Man8-13GlcNAc species from invertase with Aspergillus satoi alpha 1,2-mannosidase provided products that were consistent with the structures assigned by 1H NMR as did fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy fragmentation analysis of the Man9,10GlcNAc oligosaccharides. These results lead to the proposal that Man8GlcNAc is the only trimming intermediate in Saccharomyces sp., and the remaining Man9-14GlcNAc oligosaccharides are biosynthetic intermediates which define the principal pathway of single-step mannose addition in the formation of the inner core of yeast mannan."
https://openalex.org/W1592380151,"The alpha and beta subunits of tubulin each have a single highly reactive site for a variety of proteases that divides each subunit into two unequal regions. The position of cleavage is not the same for alpha and beta, since alpha is consistently cleaved into about 38- and 14-kDa pieces, while beta is cleaved into about 34- and 21-kDa pieces. The larger fragment is amino-terminal in both subunits as shown: by size reduction of the smaller fragment by subtilisin (which cleaves at the extreme carboxyl-terminal end), but no change in size of the larger fragment; by the charge/mass ratios of the proteolytic fragments; and by sequence analysis which locates trypsin cleavage after residue 339 (alpha) and chymotrypsin cleavage after residue 281 (beta). Since this cleavage pattern of the alpha and beta subunits is found for very different proteases, we suggest that it is determined by structural features of the tubulin molecule. The two pieces of each subunit remain associated following cleavage. While both cleavage sites are exposed in the free dimer, assembly of dimers into microtubules or sheets protects the internal site against cleavage. By contrast, the carboxyl-terminal subtilisin-sensitive sites remain exposed. Based on these results we propose a model for the substructure of the tubulin dimer that accommodates internal cleavage in the dimer but not the polymer, access to the COOH termini in both forms, and the orientation of the dimer in the polymer."

https://openalex.org/W1548201338,"We recently described a pair of partially homologous maize chloroplast genes, one of which was shown to code for an apoprotein of the P700 chlorophyll a complex of photosystem I (Fish, L.E., Kuck, U., and Bogorad, L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1413-1421). Two chlorophyll-free apoprotein bands from maize chlorophyll-protein complex I (CPI) can be resolved on lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS)-urea polyacrylamide gels. Proteins in both bands react with antibodies prepared against CPI, but antibodies prepared against two synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted sequences of PSI-A1 react only with the upper band. The presence of products of the two genes, ps1A1 and ps1A2, in CPI was verified by analysis of cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments of the lower apoprotein band obtained from LDS-urea polyacrylamide gels by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Amino-terminal sequencing of five CNBr fragments indicates that the lower band contains a product of the ps1A2 gene. The possibility of extensive processing was investigated because the apparent molecular masses of the maize CPI proteins are about 58-70 kDa on LDS-polyacrylamide gels rather than the predicted sizes of about 83 kDa. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a predicted sequence in PSI-A1 were used to determine that the amino-terminal end of PSI-A1 is intact beyond about position 52. The amino-terminal CNBr fragment of PSI-A2 was identified by sequencing, indicating that the amino-terminal end of PSI-A2 is not processed. The carboxyl-terminal CNBr fragment of PSI-A2 was also identified by sequencing. These results indicate that the PSI-A1 and PSI-A2 polypeptides are not extensively processed, although some processing at the carboxyl-terminal end has not been ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1555122375,"Insulin inhibits the secretion of lipoprotein components such as triglyceride, phospholipid, and apolipoproteins B and E in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. The aim of this study was to determine whether these hormonal effects are related to the interaction of insulin with its receptor on the surface of cultured hepatocytes. Half-maximal inhibition of secretion of apolipoprotein E and triglyceride occurred at 6 ng/ml porcine insulin, equivalent to a 20% receptor occupancy. When compared to porcine insulin, both guinea pig insulin and desoctapeptide insulin were 60 times less inhibitory on triglyceride and apolipoprotein secretion. These analogs were also 60 times less effective in competing with porcine 125I-insulin for receptor binding. Anti-insulin receptor IgG inhibited binding of porcine insulin to cells in a dose-dependent fashion. However, similar to the hormone itself, it reduced the secretion of triglyceride and apolipoproteins E and B. Preincubation of cells with 200 ng/ml porcine insulin for 15 h caused a 2.5-fold reduction of surface receptor number. These cells were less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of porcine insulin on secretion of triglyceride and apolipoproteins B and E. We conclude that the effects of insulin on lipoprotein processing by hepatocytes in culture are receptor-mediated, can be imitated by antibodies, to the insulin receptor, and are subject to control by receptor down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1493469678,"Clones carrying a gene causing overproduction of protease IV, a signal peptide peptidase of Escherichia coli, were isolated from the Clarke and Carbon's collection. Restriction mapping analysis revealed that pLC7-10 and pLC40-13, thus isolated, shared the same chromosomal DNA region. The 2.3-kilobase RsaI-SalI fragment in this region, which was found to carry the gene, was subjected to nucleotide sequence determination. Only one long open reading frame was found. The hypothetical polypeptide sequence deduced from the DNA sequence has a molecular mass of 67,241 daltons. The putative gene was named sppA. Protease IV was purified to homogeneity from the cytoplasmic membrane of an overproducing strain harboring a sppA gene-carrying plasmid. The purified enzyme gave a single polypeptide band of 67,000-dalton molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. This molecular mass and the amino acid composition of the purified enzyme were consistent with the deduced primary structure of the sppA gene product. The molecular mass thus determined was almost twice as large as that previously reported by Pacaud (Pacaud, M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4333-4339). A cross-linking study revealed that protease IV is a tetramer of the polypeptide. From these results, we conclude that protease IV is a tetramer of the sppA gene product."

The lysyl residue involved in lipoic acid attachment is indicated with an asterisk. The molecular weight including lipoic acid is calculated to be 13,883. From the secondary structure predicted by the method of Chou and Fasman (Chou, P. Y., and Fasman, G. D. (1978) Adv.

https://openalex.org/W1598210821,"Dopamine D1 receptors were solubilized from canine and bovine striatal membranes with the detergent digitonin. The receptors retained the pharmacological characteristics of membrane-bound D1 receptors, as assessed by the binding of the selective antagonist [3H]SCH 23390. The binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to solubilized receptor preparations was specific, saturable, and reversible, with a dissociation constant of 5 nM. Dopaminergic antagonists and agonists inhibited [3H]SCH 23390 binding in a stereoselective and concentration-dependent manner with an appropriate rank order of potency for D1 receptors. Moreover, agonist high affinity binding to D1 receptors and its sensitivity to guanine nucleotides was preserved following solubilization, with agonist dissociation constants virtually identical to those observed with membrane-bound receptors. To ascertain the molecular basis for the existence of an agonist-high affinity receptor complex, D1 receptors labeled with [3H] dopamine (agonist) or [3H]SCH 23390 (antagonist) prior to, or following, solubilization were subjected to high pressure liquid steric-exclusion chromatography. All agonist- and antagonist-labeled receptor species elute as the same apparent molecular size. Treatment of brain membranes with the guanine nucleotide guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate prior to solubilization prevented the retention of [3H]dopamine but not [3H]SCH 23390-labeled soluble receptors. This suggests that the same guanine nucleotide-dopamine D1 receptor complex formed in membranes is stable to solubilization and confers agonist high affinity binding in soluble preparations. These results contrast with those reported on the digitonin-solubilized dopamine D2 receptor, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this difference remains to be elucidated."

A single recessive nuclear mutation (mip1) is responsible for rho 0 phenotype and mtDNA polymerase deficiency in vitro. At 25 degrees C (or 30 degrees C) a dominant suppressor mutation (SUP) masks the deficiency in vivo. The meiotic segregants (mip1 sup) which do not harbor the suppressor have a rho 0 phenotype both at 25 and 35 degrees C. They have no mtDNA polymerase activity, in contrast with MIP rho 0 mutants of mitochondrial inheritance which do exhibit mtDNA polymerase activity. In the thermosensitive mutant (mip1 SUP), the replication of mtDNA observed in vivo at 30 degrees C is completely abolished at 35 degrees C. In the meiotic segregants (mip1 sup), no mtDNA replication takes place at 30 and 35 degrees C. The synthesis of nuclear DNA is not affected. DNA polymerases may have replicative and/or repair activity. There is no evidence that mip mutants are deficient in mtDNA repair. In contrast the MIP gene product is strictly required for the replication of mtDNA and for the expression of the mtDNA polymerase activity. This enzyme might be the replicase of mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1586488610,"Insulin is known to increase the de novo synthesis of inositol phospholipids in rat epididymal fat pads. We presently examined the effects of insulin on the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids in this tissue. Relatively small (30-40%) but significant increases in inositol phosphates (mono-, di-, and tri-) were apparent within 30-60 s of insulin treatment in fat pads (and adipocytes); thereafter, inositol phosphates returned to control levels. These rapid insulin-induced increases in inositol phosphates appeared to be due to phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, since there were associated transient decreases in these lipids during 32P pulse-chase experiments. Increases in the synthesis of inositol phospholipids were also apparent within a few minutes of insulin treatment and persisted for at least 2 h. We conclude that, in the rat epididymal fat pad, insulin has two phospholipid effects, viz. a transient activation of phospholipase C, and a persistent increase in de novo phospholipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1540571522,"The major cathepsin B isozyme CB-I purified from porcine spleens was studied for its specificity against various peptide and denatured protein substrates. The enzyme degraded all the peptide substrates by an exopeptidase activity. The substrates were degraded mainly by a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity of the enzyme except for angiotensin I, from which a COOH-terminal leucine residue was released. The enzyme failed to hydrolyze peptides having a proline or cysteic acid in the COOH-terminal, penultimate, and antepenultimate positions. Reduced and carboxymethylated soybean trypsin inhibitor was degraded by the same dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase action of cathepsin B. No significant endopeptidase activity was observed. These results do not support the general assumption that cathepsin B has both endo- and exopeptidase activities, neither do these observations support the postulation that cathepsin B might be involved in the in vivo proteolytic processing of protein precursors. We propose that the biological role of this enzyme is mainly the degradation of tissue proteins in lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W119727618,"Lipoprotein lipase from bovine milk reacted stoichiometrically with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), an inactivator of serine esterases, resulting in the loss of enzymatic activity against triacylglycerols. The reaction obeyed first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.69 h-1. In order to isolate the peptide containing the diisopropylphosphoryl moiety (DIP), partially purified lipoprotein lipase was covalently labeled with [3H]DFP, and the labeled protein was reduced, carboxymethylated, and further purified to about 90% homogeneity. Cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by gel filtration yielded a radioactive peptide of 6-8 kDa. This peptide was succinylated and then digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase. From this digest, a peptide containing 0.95 mol of [3H] DIP/mol of peptide was isolated by gel-permeation chromatography followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Automated Edman degradation provided the following sequence: Ala-Ile-Gly-Ile-His-Trp-Gly-Gly- (DIP)Ser-Pro-Asn-Gln-Lys-Asn-Gly-Ala-Val-Phe-Ile-Asn-(Ser, Leu)-Glu. Analysis of the sequence for secondary structure suggests that the reactive serine of lipoprotein lipase is in a beta-turn, a structure similar to those of the active sites of most other serine proteinases. Lipoprotein lipase appears to share this secondary structure with other serine hydrolases despite significant differences in the primary structure of this domain."
https://openalex.org/W1525646795,"We have used an iodinated, photoreactive analog of insulin, 125I-B2(2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)-des-PheB1-insulin, to covalently label insulin receptors on the cell surface of isolated rat adipocytes. Following internalization of the labeled insulin-receptor complexes at 37 degrees C, we measured the rate and extent of recycling of these complexes using trypsin to distinguish receptors on the cell surface from those inside the cell. The return of internalized photoaffinity-labeled receptors to the cell surface was very rapid at 37 degrees C proceeding with an apparent t 1/2 of 6 min. About 95% of the labeled receptors present in the cell 20 min after the initiation of endocytosis returned to the cell surface by 40 min. Recycling was slower at 25 and 16 degrees C compared to 37 degrees C and essentially negligible at 12 degrees C or in the presence of energy depleters. Addition of excess unlabeled insulin had no effect on the recycling of photoaffinity-labeled insulin receptor complexes, whereas monensin, chloroquine, and Tris partially inhibited this process. These data indicate that dissociation of insulin from internalized receptors is not necessary for insulin receptor recycling. Furthermore, agents which have been shown to prevent vesicular acidification inhibit the recycling of insulin receptors by a mechanism other than prevention of ligand dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1617008218,"Apolipoprotein C-II plays a major role in lipid metabolism as a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Apo-C-II is initially synthesized as a 101 amino acid protein that undergoes subsequent cotranslational cleavage of a signal peptide. Post-translational processing of apo-C-II has not been previously described. In this manuscript we identify four major plasma isoforms of apo-C-II by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis that result from post-translational modification of apo-C-II. Neuraminidase studies have shown that two of these isoforms are early secreted sialic acid containing glycoproteins. Amino acid compositional and amino-terminal analysis have established that the major plasma isoform of apo-C-II is proapo-C-II. Proapo-C-II undergoes proteolytic cleavage of its amino-terminal hexapeptide to generate the mature form of apo-C-II. Thus, apo-C-II appears to be secreted as a carbohydrate containing proprotein that then undergoes deglycosylation and proteolytic cleavage to generate mature apo-C-II, a minor isoform in plasma. An improved understanding of the structural relationship of the various plasma isoforms of apo-C-II will help to elucidate the mechanisms involved in normal, as well as defective, processing of apo-C-II."
https://openalex.org/W2152524172,"Mercuric reductase contains FAD and a redox-active disulfide which is reduced to a thiol/thiolate pair in two-electron reduced enzyme (EH2) (Fox, B. and Walsh, C.T. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2498-2503). A charge transfer interaction between the thiolate and oxidized FAD gives EH2 a characteristic absorption spectrum, very similar to that found with other flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductases. We have examined the reaction of EH2 with HgCl2 (+/- mercaptoethanol) in stopped-flow kinetic and static titration experiments. In the absence of mercaptoethanol, reaction of EH2 with HgCl2 yields a final spectrum which is indistinguishable from that of oxidized enzyme. The nature of the final species was examined by titration of enzyme thiols with 5,5'-dithiobis-2,2'-nitrobenzoic acid under denaturing conditions in the presence of NaI to displace any Hg(II) bound to enzyme thiols. These studies demonstrate that EH2 tightly complexes Hg(II) with its active site thiols, but is incapable of reducing Hg(II) to Hg0. For the latter reaction to occur, additional reducing equivalents are required. In catalysis, the enzyme must first be reduced to EH2 after which it cycles between EH2 and EH2 X NADPH forms. This is in contrast to other flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductases which cycle between Eox and EH2 forms in catalysis (Williams, C. H., Jr. (1976) in The Enzymes (Boyer, P. D., ed) 3rd Ed., Vol. 13, pp. 89-173, Academic Press, New York). With mercuric reductase, exogenous thiols are required for catalytic reduction of Hg(II) to Hg0. We have shown that this is due to prevention or reversal of formation of an abortive complex of Hg(II) with the thiol/thiolate pair of EH2."
https://openalex.org/W1530300210,"Histones isolated from Reuber H35 rat hepatoma cells treated with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were examined for possible alterations in phosphorylation. Incorporation of 32P orthophosphate into individual acid-extracted histones was monitored by autoradiography and scintillation counting of polyacrylamide gels or by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Treatment of quiescent H35 cells (arrested by serum starvation) with submicromolar doses of TPA resulted in a rapid and specific increase in phosphorylation of histones H2B and H1(0). Smaller increases in phosphorylation were observed for H4. No significant change in phosphorylation of the major H1 histones or H2A were observed after 1 h of treatment. The phosphorylation was TPA dose-dependent, with a maximum increase of approximately 14-fold for H2B, 11-fold for H1(0), and 2-fold for H4 achieved at 0.8 M TPA. The nonpromoting parent compound phorbol did not induce any of these changes. Furthermore, the mitogenic hormone insulin did not cause a similar pattern of histone phosphorylation, suggesting that the effect observed was not due to a general mitogenic response in the H35 hepatoma cells. Addition of 8-Br-cAMP also failed to reproduce the effect of TPA on histone phosphorylation, suggesting that cAMP-dependent protein kinases are not likely to be involved in mediating this response to TPA."
https://openalex.org/W1541392402,"Five analogs of adenosylcobalamin modified in the adenine moiety of the Co beta ligand were synthesized and tested for coenzymic function with diol dehydrase of Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 8724. 1-Deaza and 3-deaza analogs of adenosylcobalamin were active as coenzyme, whereas 7-deaza and N6,N6-dimethyl derivatives and guanosylcobalamin did not show detectable coenzymic activity. 7-Deaza and N6,N6-dimethyl analogs acted as strong competitive inhibitors with respect to adenosylcobalamin. The formation of cob(II)alamin as intermediate in the catalytic reaction was spectroscopically observed with catalytically active complexes of the enzyme with 1-deaza and 3-deaza analogs in the presence of 1,2-propanediol, but not with complexes with the inactive analogs. Oxygen sensitivity of the enzyme-analog complexes suggests that the carbon-cobalt bond of 1-deaza and 3-deaza analogs becomes activated by the enzyme even in the absence of substrate. These results indicate that the importance of the nitrogen atoms in the adenine moiety of the coenzyme for manifestation of catalytic function and for activation of the carbon-cobalt bond decreases in the following order: N-7 greater than 6-NH2 greater than N-3 greater than N-1. The dissociation constant for 5'-deoxyadenosine determined by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C was about 23 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1589456510,"The mode of interaction of Cro repressor with specific and nonspecific sites on DNA was explored by chemical modification and protection of lysine and tyrosine residues. Cro has 8 lysines. In the presence of DNA, lysines 32 and 56 are fully protected and lysines 21, 62, and 63 are partially protected from alkylation. However, the terminal amino group and lysines 8, 18, and 39 are not protected. Location of the protected and unprotected lysines on the three-dimensional Cro structure defines a DNA-binding region. The results provide direct experimental support for a mode of interaction between Cro and DNA, in which Cro buries its 2-fold related alpha-helices in consecutive DNA major grooves (Anderson, W. F., Ohlendorf, D. H., Takeda, Y., and Matthews, B. W. (1981) Nature 290, 754-758; Ohlendorf, D. H., Anderson, W. F., Fisher, R. G., Takeda, Y., and Matthews, B. W. (1982) Nature 298, 718-723). In the model, the carboxyl-terminal part of Cro was tentatively presumed to interact with the DNA minor groove. Protection of lysines 62 and 63 confirms the involvement of the carboxyl terminus in DNA binding. Although nonspecific and specific DNA protect the same lysine residues, there are differences in the nature of the interaction of Cro with nonspecific and specific DNA. Cro-nonspecific DNA interaction is salt-sensitive, suggesting that the interaction is predominantly electrostatic. On the other hand, Cro-specific DNA interaction is salt-resistant, suggesting that the interaction may include nonelectrostatic components (hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions) as well. Protection experiments of tyrosine residues (against iodination) suggest that the conformation of Cro repressor changes in two stages: first, when Cro binds at nonspecific sites, and, second, when Cro binds to specific sites on DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1585445410,"Abstract The effect of the arginine-specific reagents phenylglyoxal and butanedione on the activity of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase) was determined. Inactivation of the enzyme by butanedione is completely protected by methionine-enkephalin, but only partially protected by methionine-enkephalinamide. In contrast, phenylglyoxal inactivation of the enzyme exhibits saturation kinetics with a Kd of 20 mM. The enzyme is only partially protected against phenylglyoxal inactivation by both methionine-enkephalin and its amide, indicating that phenylglyoxal reacts at two sites. Reaction of the enzyme with phenylglyoxal in the presence of saturating methionine-enkephalin involves the direct reaction of the reagent with the enzyme-substrate complex. Enzyme treated with butanedione or with phenylglyoxal (at site 1) exhibits a 3-5 decrease in substrate binding with little change in kcat. In contrast, reaction with phenylglyoxal in the presence of saturating methionine-enkephalin shows little change in substrate binding but a 4-fold decrease in kcat. Enzyme inactivation involves the incorporation of approximately 1 mol of phenylglyoxal/enzyme subunit in the absence of methionine-enkephalin and approximately 2.5 mol of phenylglyoxal/enzyme subunit in the presence of saturating methionine-enkephalin. These results suggest that an arginine residue on the enzyme is involved in substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W21296164,"Incubation of smooth muscle phosphorylated heavy meromyosin in the presence of myosin light chain kinase, calmodulin, ADP, and Ca2+ results in a decrease of the protein-bound phosphate. The dephosphorylation is not due to phosphatase activity and is dependent on the presence of ADP and the active ternary myosin light chain kinase complex. Using 32P-labeled phosphorylated 20,000-dalton light chains as the phosphate donor, the formation of ATP from ADP can be demonstrated. This reaction requires the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin, and myosin light chain kinase. These results indicate that myosin light chain kinase can catalyze a reverse reaction and form ATP from ADP and phosphorylated substrate. The rate of the reverse reaction, kcat/KLC approximately 0.21 min-1 microM-1, is considerably slower than the forward reaction under similar conditions and is therefore detectable only at relatively high concentrations of myosin light chain kinase. For the reverse reaction, KmADP is approximately 30 microM and ATP is a competitive inhibitor, KIATP approximately 88 microM. For the forward reaction, measured with both isolated light chains and intact myosin, KmATP is approximately 100 microM and ADP is a competitive inhibitor, KiADP approximately 140 microM (myosin) and 120 microM (light chains). Thus, the affinity of ATP for the forward and reverse reactions is similar, but the affinity of ADP is higher for the reverse reaction. From the light chain dependence of the two reactions, the following was calculated: forward, Km = 5 microM, kcat = 1720 min-1, and reverse, Km = 130 microM, kcat = 27 min-1. In contrast to the data obtained with isolated light chains, it is suggested that, with intact myosin as substrate, the Km term is primarily responsible for determining the rate of the reverse reaction. With light chains phosphorylated at serine 19 and threonine 18, it was shown that both sites act as a phosphate donor, although the reverse reaction for threonine 18 is slower than that for serine 19."
https://openalex.org/W1607818000,"Immunological and microanalytical methods were used to investigate the two isozymes of phosphorylase kinase, enzyme w and enzyme r, in psoas major and tibialis anterior muscles. Peptide mapping experiments indicated that the alpha subunit of enzyme w and alpha' subunit of enzyme r were structurally very similar. Both subunits were completely immunoprecipitated from muscle extracts with an antibody specific for the beta subunit of the kinase, indicating that alpha and alpha' subunits are completely assembled with beta subunits in adult muscle fibers. The relative amounts of enzymes w and r in single fibers were determined from amounts of alpha and alpha' subunits, which were detected by immunoblotting. Phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase activities were measured in the same fibers, as well as in individual fibers from diaphragm and soleus muscles. Slow oxidative fibers were found to contain low levels of enzyme r, but almost no enzyme w. Considerably more enzyme r was present in fast oxidative-glycolytic fibers. Fast glycolytic fibers contained the most enzyme w, and the highest levels of enzyme r were found in a subgroup of such fibers. Interestingly, more than half of the fast glycolytic fibers analyzed contained both isozymes. In these fibers phosphorylase was positively correlated with enzyme w, but negatively correlated with enzyme r. Total kinase activity ranged 30-fold from the highest in one of the psoas fibers to the lowest in one of the soleus fibers and was closely correlated with the phosphorylase levels. In psoas and soleus fibers, calculated absolute maximal rates for phosphorylase b to a conversion varied almost 2,500-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1499657417,"To study cell interactions with external molecules immobilized on a chemically defined nonionic, inert matrix, we have prepared flat polyacrylamide matrices containing covalently attached carbohydrate or protein. A new acrylamide derivative, containing a terminal 1,2-dihydroxy group, was synthesized and then copolymerized with acrylamide and bisacrylamide to make 20% polyacrylamide matrices, which could be oxidized with NaIO4 to generate reactive aldehyde groups. Molecules containing a free amine (e.g. proteins or glycopeptides) can be coupled to the aldehyde-activated matrix by formation of a Schiff base and reduction with NaCNBH3 to form a stable -CH2-NH-bond. Unreacted aldehyde groups are reduced to hydroxyl groups with NaBH4. In order to immobilize polysaccharides on the activated surfaces, these molecules are first modified to contain a free amine. We have described a procedure to convert purified hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides to a reactive alkylamine derivative uniquely modified at the reducing end (Raja, R. H., LeBoeuf, R. D., Stone, G. W., and Weigel, P. H. (1984) Anal. Biochem. 139, 168-177). The covalent attachment of [3H]hyaluronate-amine, [14C]ethanolamine, or 125I-bovine serum albumin, to activated surfaces was complete within 5-24 h. The amount immobilized was directly proportional to the amine concentration and to the aldehyde content of the matrix and inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the amine. About 90% of the available aldehyde groups reacted with ethanolamine, whereas less than 0.01% reacted with albumin. Molecules larger than 3300 Da were excluded from the interior of the matrix and could therefore only be attached to the surface of the matrix. These synthetic surfaces can be used in long term culture experiments to study cellular interactions with virtually any type of immobilized molecule."

(1985) Endocrinology 116, 2677-2681), is a member of a family of peptide hormones which includes pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and the gut peptide YY. A 30-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment of the precursor to aPY has been purified from anglerfish endocrine pancreas in two steps using both classical chromatographic methods and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. It was identified by sequence homology with the analogous peptide from human preproneuropeptide Y. The sequence was found by Edman degradation and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry to be SSPEEAVAWLLFKADPSQDIEPRLDDDNAW. The high yield of this fragment (6.5 nmol . g-1) is similar to that previously reported for aPY (7.9 nmol . g-1) and suggests that it is a major product of pro-aPY processing. The data indicate that pro-aPY is proteolytically processed into two major products: the 37-residue aPY and the 30-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment."
https://openalex.org/W2143983551,"The effect of lipopolysaccharide on RNA polymerase I activity in primary cultures of murine B lymphocytes has been examined. In cells treated with mitogen for 48 h, the activity of RNA polymerase I was approximately 15 times greater than in control cells. In situ localization of RNA polymerase I using indirect immunofluorescence indicated that there was at least a 10-fold increase in the amount of this enzyme associated with nucleoli of 48 h mitogen-treated cells relative to control cells. Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated a similar increase in the concentration of the 190-kDa subunit bound to DNA; the concentrations of the other polymerase I-associated polypeptides did not correlate with rRNA synthesis. Assuming 1 mol of the 190-kDa polypeptide/mol of polymerase I, it was estimated that 2,300 and 30,000 molecules of enzyme were associated with rDNA in the unstimulated and stimulated B cell, respectively. Thus, an increased cellular concentration of the 190-kDa subunit of RNA polymerase I and its association with ribosomal DNA may be a crucial step in rRNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1574132210,A new method for the determination of dissociation rates of enzyme-substrate complexes has been developed. The rate of exchange of a labeled product back into the substrate is measured during catalysis of the forward reaction when the forward reaction is kept far from equilibrium by the enzymatic removal of the nonexchanging product. The ratio of the exchange rate and the net rate for product formation is then determined at various concentrations of the exchanging product. A plot of this ratio is a diagnostic indication of the kinetic mechanism and the relative rates of product dissociation from the binary and ternary enzyme complexes. This technique has been applied to the reaction catalyzed by bovine liver argininosuccinate lyase. The ratio for the rate of exchange of fumarate into argininosuccinate and the net rate for product formation was found to increase with the concentration of fumarate but to reach a limit of 3.3. The ratio of rates was half-maximal at 36 mM fumarate. The data have been interpreted to indicate the argininosuccinate lyase has a random kinetic mechanism. The calculated lower limit for the rate of release of arginine from the enzyme-fumarate-arginine complex is 0.35 times as fast as the Vmax in the reverse direction. The rate of release of arginine from the enzyme-arginine binary complex is 210 times faster than Vmax in the reverse direction.

Affinity-purified antibodies made to this protein only react with a single 40-kDa protein band from cardiac myofibrils on immunoblots. The anti-40-kDa protein also shows cross-reactivities with cardiac myofibrils from rabbits, rats, and chickens. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that the 40-kDa protein is localized at the Z-bands of cardiac myofibrils and at the intercalated discs. The antibody did not react with skeletal muscle myofibrils by immunofluorescence or immunoblotting. It appears that the 40-kDa protein may play a role in the strong attachments between adjacent myofibrils in cardiac muscle."
