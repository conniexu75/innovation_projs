https://openalex.org/W2809386363,"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) describes the experience of tingling sensations in the crown of the head, in response to a range of audio-visual triggers such as whispering, tapping, and hand movements. Public interest in ASMR has risen dramatically and ASMR experiencers watch ASMR videos to promote relaxation and sleep. Unlike ostensibly similar emotional experiences such as ""aesthetic chills"" from music and awe-inspiring scenarios, the psychological basis of ASMR has not yet been established. We present two studies (one large-scale online experiment; one laboratory study) that test the emotional and physiological correlates of the ASMR response. Both studies showed that watching ASMR videos increased pleasant affect only in people who experienced ASMR. Study 2 showed that ASMR was associated with reduced heart rate and increased skin conductance levels. Findings indicate that ASMR is a reliable and physiologically-rooted experience that may have therapeutic benefits for mental and physical health."

Here, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on different parts of this data set. We find that more than 94% of the test images can be correctly labeled, irrespective of their experimental origin. Because crystal recognition is key to high-density screening and the systematic analysis of crystallization experiments, this approach opens the door to both industrial and fundamental research applications."

We demonstrate the presence of more than 25 species of which only seven are formally described. Species boundaries are determined with molecular data using a broad range of analytical methods. Many of the new species are common and wide spread, and the majority of the species are found in sympatry with several other species in the complex. Being one of the most regularly encountered annelid taxa in the North East Atlantic, it is more likely to find an undescribed species of Terebellides than a described one."

Of the 187 patients studied, 87 were ambulant (age range: 7–15.8 years), and 90 non-ambulant (age range: 9.08–24.78). The total scores changed significantly over time (p<0.001). Non-ambulant patients had lower total scores at baseline (mean 19.7) when compared to the ambulant ones (mean 38.4). They also had also a bigger decrease in total scores over 24 months compared to the ambulant boys (4.36 vs 2.07 points). Multivariate model analysis showed that the Performance of Upper Limb changes reflected the entry level and ambulation status, that were independently associated to the slope of Performance of Upper Limb changes. This information will be of help both in clinical practice and at the time of designing clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W2808810914,"Morphological characterization of leg arteries is of significant importance to detect vascular remodeling triggered by atherosclerotic changes. We determined reference values of vessel diameters and assessed prevalence of stenosis and arterial variations of the lower limb arteries in a healthy male population sample.Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography at 1.5 Tesla was performed in 756 male participants (median age = 52 years, range = 21-82 years) of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania. Vessel diameters were measured in 9 predefined segments of the pelvic and leg arteries and 95th percentiles were used for upper reference values of means of left and right side arteries.Reference values of vascular diameters decreased from proximal to distal arteries: common iliac = 1.18cm; internal iliac = 0.75cm; external iliac = 1.03cm; proximal femoral = 1.02cm; distal femoral = 0.77cm; popliteal = 0.69cm; anterior tibial = 0.42cm; posterior tibial = 0.38cm; fibular = 0.40cm. Body-surface area indexed reference values increased with age in all segments. A number of 53 subjects (7.0%) had at least one stenosis, mainly in the lower leg arteries anterior tibial (n = 28, 3.7%), posterior tibial (n = 18, 2.4%) and fibular (n = 20, 2.6%). The risk of stenosis increased considerably with age (odds ratio = 1.08; p<0.001). The most common arterial variant was type I-A in both legs (n = 620, 82%).We present reference values for different pelvic and leg artery segment diameters in men that decrease from proximal to distal and increase with age. Stenoses were most prevalent in lower leg arteries and type I-A was the most common variant in the lower leg."
https://openalex.org/W2809543651,"Nephrin (Nphs1) is an adhesion protein that is expressed at the podocyte intercellular junction in the glomerulus. Nphs1 mutations in humans or deletion in animal genetic models results in a developmental failure of foot process formation. A number of studies have shown decrease in expression of nephrin in various proteinuric kidney diseases as well as in animal models of glomerular disease. Decrease in nephrin expression has been suggested to precede podocyte loss and linked to the progression of kidney disease. Whether the decrease in expression of nephrin is related to loss of podocytes or lead to podocyte detachment is unclear. To answer this central question we generated an inducible model of nephrin deletion (Nphs1Tam-Cre) in order to lower nephrin expression in healthy adult mice. Following tamoxifen-induction there was a 75% decrease in nephrin expression by 14 days. The Nphs1Tam-Cre mice had normal foot process ultrastructure and intact filtration barriers up to 4–6 weeks post-induction. Despite the loss of nephrin expression, the podocyte number and density remained unchanged during the initial period. Unexpectedly, nephrin expression, albeit at low levels persisted at the slit diaphragm up to 16–20 weeks post-tamoxifen induction. The mice became progressively proteinuric with glomerular hypertrophy and scarring reminiscent of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis at 20 weeks. Four week-old Nphs1 knockout mice subjected to protamine sulfate model of podocyte injury demonstrated failure to recover from foot process effacement following heparin sulfate. Similarly, Nphs1 knockout mice failed to recover following nephrotoxic serum (NTS) with persistence of proteinuria and foot process effacement. Our results suggest that as in development, nephrin is necessary for maintenance of a healthy glomerular filter. In contrast to the developmental phenotype, lowering nephrin expression in a mature glomerulus resulted in a slowly progressive disease that histologically resembles FSGS a disease linked closely with podocyte depletion. Podocytes with low levels of nephrin expression are both susceptible and unable to recover following perturbation. Our results suggest that decreased nephrin expression independent of podocyte loss occurring as an early event in proteinuric kidney diseases might play a role in disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2809157283,"The purpose of this study is to analyse the role of risk perceptions and exposure for protective behaviour against tick bites and the related diseases Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), both of which are growing health concerns. We use data from a national survey in Sweden with respondents in geographical areas with substantial differences in both abundance of ticks and incidence of LB and TBE. We find that the share of respondents who frequently use protective clothing (64%), perform tick checks (63%) or avoid tall grass while in areas with ticks (48%) is relatively high. However, the use of protective measures is uneven and a considerably lower share tuck their trousers into their socks (18%), use repellent against ticks (16%) or use a combination of protective measures. Thirty-one per cent of the respondents report one or more tick bites in the last year and 68% report one or more lifetime tick bites, indicating that it is difficult to protect oneself from tick bites. There is a strong positive association between exposure and checking the skin for ticks, but exposure is only weakly associated with other protective measures. Tick bites are perceived as a serious health risk by as many as 43% of the respondents. The perception that a single tick bite is serious is negatively associated with actual exposure to ticks, while the opposite is true for the perception that tick bites constitute a serious lifetime health risk. This indicates a learning effect in relation to risk perceptions and the performance of tick checks, but not in relation to other protective measures. Recommendations include informing people of the risks associated with tick bites, the efficacy of various protective measures and the importance of combining multiple types of protection. Given the high exposure to tick bites, the growing incidence of TBE and LB, and the difficulties in preventing tick bites, other preventive measures should be further discussed, including vaccination programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2809466147,"The use of pesticides exposes humans to numerous harmful molecules. Exposure in early-life may be responsible for adverse effects in later life. This study aimed to assess the metabolic modifications induced in pregnant rats and their offspring by a pesticide mixture representative of human exposure. Ten pregnant rats were exposed to a mixture of eight pesticides: acetochlor (246 μg/kg bw/d) + bromoxynil (12 μg/kg bw/d) + carbofuran (22.5 μg/kg bw/d) + chlormequat (35 μg/kg bw/d) + ethephon (22.5 μg/kg bw/d) + fenpropimorph (15.5 μg/kg bw/d) + glyphosate (12 μg/kg bw/d) + imidacloprid (12.5 μg/kg bw/d) representing the main environmental pesticide exposure in Brittany (France) in 2004. Another group of 10 pregnant rats served as controls. Females were fed ad libitum from early pregnancy, which is from gestational day (GD) 4 to GD 21. Urine samples were collected at GD 15. At the end of the exposure, mothers and pups were euthanized and blood, liver, and brain samples collected. 1H NMR-based metabolomics and GC-FID analyses were performed and PCA and PLS-DA used to discriminate between control and exposed groups. Metabolites for which the levels were significantly modified were then identified using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing correction using the False Discovery Rate. The metabolomics analysis revealed many differences between dams of the two groups, especially in the plasma, liver and brain. The modified metabolites are involved in TCA cycle, energy production and storage, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and amino-acid metabolism. These modifications suggest that the pesticide mixture may induce oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism. These observations may reflect liver dysfunction with increased relative liver weight and total lipid content. Similar findings were observed for glucose and energy metabolism in the liver of the offspring, and oxidative stress was also suggested in the brains of male offspring."

Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model and fluorescent heme sensors, site-specific heme chelators, and molecular genetic approaches, we found here that 1) yeast cells preferentially use LH in heme-depleted conditions; 2) sequestration of cytosolic LH suppresses heme signaling; and 3) lead (Pb2+) stress contributes to a decrease in total heme, but an increase in LH, which correlates with increased heme signaling. We also observed that the proteasome is involved in the regulation of the LH pool and that loss of proteasomal activity sensitizes cells to Pb2+ effects on heme homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2809361864,"Introduction and hypothesis Voiding dysfunction has gained interest due to its high prevalence in the elderly. This study characterized bladder dysfunction in women with voiding dysfunction using video urodynamic studies (VUDS) focused on detrusor underactivity (DU). Methods We studied 1914 women in which first-line medical treatment failed. Age, comorbidities, and urodynamic parameters were analyzed to determine the association between bladder sensation and contractility. Results VUDS were normal in 2.9% (n = 56) of patients and showed DU in 23.1% (n = 443), detrusor hyperactivity and impaired contractility (DHIC) in 12.0% (n = 231), hypersensitive bladder in 17.0% (n = 325), detrusor overactivity (DO) in 2.6% (n = 49) and bladder outlet obstruction in 42.3% (n = 810). The mean age of patients in the DU and DHIC groups was significantly older than in women with normal VUDS and those with hypersensitive bladders (p<0.01). Decreased bladder sensation and larger cystometric bladder capacity were noted in the DU group compared to the DHIC, HSB, and DO groups. Bladder sensation was negatively associated with the bladder contractility. Bladder contractility index and voiding efficiency were lower in the DU and DHIC groups compared to the normal group. Conclusions The bladder conditions of women with voiding dysfunction included DU, DHIC, HSB and DO. Bladder contractility index and voiding efficiency were significantly lowest in DU and DHIC groups and lower in HSB and DO groups than normal tracing group. Reduced bladder sensation was noted in DU and negatively associated with detrusor contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2809238021,"Dynamic communities in proteins comprise the cohesive structural units that individually exhibit rigid body motions. These can correspond to structural domains, but are usually smaller parts that move with respect to one another in a protein's internal motions, key to its functional dynamics. Previous studies emphasized their importance to understand the nature of ligand-induced allosteric regulation. These studies reported that mutations to key community residues can hinder transmission of allosteric signals among the communities. Usually molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (~ 100 ns or longer) have been used to identify the communities-a demanding task for larger proteins. In the present study, we propose that dynamic communities obtained from MD simulations can also be obtained alternatively with simpler models-the elastic network models (ENMs). To verify this premise, we compare the specific communities obtained from MD and ENMs for 44 proteins. We evaluate the correspondence in communities from the two methods and compute the extent of agreement in the dynamic cross-correlation data used for community detection. Our study reveals a strong correspondence between the communities from MD and ENM and also good agreement for the residue cross-correlations. Importantly, we observe that the dynamic communities from MD can be closely reproduced with ENMs. With ENMs, we also compare the community structures of stable and unstable mutant forms of T4 Lysozyme with its wild-type. We find that communities for unstable mutants show substantially poorer agreement with the wild-type communities than do stable mutants, suggesting such ENM-based community structures can serve as a means to rapidly identify deleterious mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2735710262,"Quantitative methods to measure the participation to parliamentary debate and discourse of elected Members of Parliament (MPs) and the parties they belong to are lacking. This is an exploratory study in which we propose the development of a new approach for a quantitative analysis of such participation. We utilize the New Zealand government's digital Hansard database to construct a topic model of parliamentary speeches consisting of nearly 40 million words in the period 2003-2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is implemented in order to reveal the thematic structure of our set of documents. This generative statistical model enables the detection of major themes or topics that are publicly discussed in the New Zealand parliament, as well as permitting their classification by MP. Information on topic proportions is subsequently analyzed using a combination of statistical methods. We observe patterns arising from time-series analysis of topic frequencies which can be related to specific social, economic and legislative events. We then construct a bipartite network representation, linking MPs to topics, for each of four parliamentary terms in this time frame. We build projected networks (onto the set of nodes represented by MPs) and proceed to the study of the dynamical changes of their topology, including community structure. By performing this longitudinal network analysis, we can observe the evolution of the New Zealand parliamentary topic network and its main parties in the period studied."

Using the word lists from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, designed to infer a range of psychological states from the word usage of a person, we studied temporal changes in the average expression of psychological traits in the general population. We sampled the contents of Twitter in the United Kingdom at hourly intervals for a period of four years, revealing a strong diurnal rhythm in most of the psychometric variables, and finding that two independent factors can explain 85% of the variance across their 24-h profiles. The first has peak expression time starting at 5am/6am, it correlates with measures of analytical thinking, with the language of drive (e.g power, and achievement), and personal concerns. It is anticorrelated with the language of negative affect and social concerns. The second factor has peak expression time starting at 3am/4am, it correlates with the language of existential concerns, and anticorrelates with expression of positive emotions. Overall, we see strong evidence that our language changes dramatically between night and day, reflecting changes in our concerns and underlying cognitive and emotional processes. These shifts occur at times associated with major changes in neural activity and hormonal levels."
https://openalex.org/W2808721329,"Purpose This study assessed the association of dry eyes with depression and suicidal ideation in a Korean adult population. Methods Data from 16408 participants (6972 men and 9436 women) aged ≥ 19 years included in the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2010–2012, were analyzed. For dry eyes, surveys of previous diagnosis of dry eye disease (DED) by an ophthalmologist and experience of subjective dry eye symptoms were separately used. Diagnosis of depression and suicidal ideation were obtained via responses to an interviewer-assisted questionnaire, and questions were asked in a closed-ended response format. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between dry eyes, depression, and suicidal ideation. Results DED diagnosis exhibited an odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.57) for depression and 1.24 (95% CI 1.05–1.48) for suicidal ideation compared to those without DED, after adjusting for sex, age, education, occupation, household income, body mass index, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, thyroid diseases, major cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Similarly, the adjusted OR (95% CI) of dry eye symptoms was 1.50 (95% CI 1.30–1.73) for depression and 1.47 (95% CI 1.27–1.70) for suicidal ideation. Conclusion Our findings suggest that dry eyes (either DED diagnosis or dry eye symptoms) may be associated with the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation in the Korean adult population."
https://openalex.org/W2809617077,"Coral reefs are experiencing increasing anthropogenic impacts that result in substantial declines of reef-building corals and a change of community structure towards other benthic invertebrates or macroalgae. Reefs around Zanzibar are exposed to untreated sewage and runoff from the main city Stonetown. At many of these sites, sponge cover has increased over the last years. Sponges are one of the top spatial competitors on reefs worldwide. Their success is, in part, dependent on their strong chemical defenses against predators, microbial attacks and other sessile benthic competitors. This is the first study that investigates the bioactive properties of sponge species in the Western Indian Ocean region. Crude extracts of the ten most dominant sponge species were assessed for their chemical defenses against 35 bacterial strains (nine known as marine pathogens) using disc diffusion assays and general cytotoxic activities were assessed with brine shrimp lethality assays. The three chemically most active sponge species were additionally tested for their allelopathic properties against the scleractinian coral competitor Porites sp.. The antimicrobial assays revealed that all tested sponge extracts had strong antimicrobial properties and that the majority (80%) of the tested sponges were equally defended against pathogenic and environmental bacterial strains. Additionally, seven out of ten sponge species exhibited cytotoxic activities in the brine shrimp assay. Moreover, we could also show that the three most bioactive sponge species were able to decrease the photosynthetic performance of the coral symbionts and thus were likely to impair the coral physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2809091983,"Recently, sparse representation, which relies on the underlying assumption that samples can be sparsely represented by their labeled neighbors, has been applied with great success to image classification problems. Through sparse representation-based classification (SRC), the label can be assigned with minimum residual between the sample and its synthetic version with class-specific coding, which means that the coding scheme is the most significant factor for classification accuracy. However, conventional SRC-based coding schemes ignore dependency among the samples, which leads to an undesired result that similar samples may be coded into different categories due to quantization sensitivity. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel approach based on self-supervised sparse representation is proposed for image classification. In the proposed approach, the manifold structure of samples is firstly exploited with low rank representation. Next, the low-rank representation matrix is used to characterize the similarity of samples in order to establish a self-supervised sparse coding model, which aims to preserve the local structure of codings for similar samples. Finally, a numerical algorithm utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to obtain the approximate solution. Experiments on several publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach compared with existing state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W2809296831,"Root-knot nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne are recognised worldwide as a major production constraint in crops of primary economic importance. Knowledge of their diversity and prevalence, as well as the major environmental and agronomical cues for understanding their distribution in specific areas is of vital importance for designing control measures to reduce significant damage. We provide the first detailed information on the diversity, distribution and levels of Meloidogyne species infecting wild and cultivated olive soils in a wide-region in southern Spain that included 499 sampling sites. Overall Meloidogyne spp. were found in 6.6% of sampled olive plants, with 6.6% and 6.5% for cultivated and wild olive, respectively. We identified five previously described Meloidogyne spp. (Meloidogyne arenaria, M. baetica, M. hapla, M. incognita, M. javanica) and one new species (Meloidogyne oleae sp. nov.) which, characterized using integrative taxonomy, increases the known biodiversity of Meloidogyne spp. affecting olive. Meloidogyne arenaria and M. incognita were only found infecting cultivated olive varieties, while, M. baetica was only found infecting wild olive. Three major parameters drive the distribution of Meloidogyne spp. in cultivated olives in southern Spain, cover vegetation on alley, irrigation and soil texture, but different species respond differently to them. In particular the presence of M. incognita is highly correlated with sandy loamy soils, the presence of M. javanica with irrigated soils and cover vegetation, while the presence of M. arenaria is correlated with the absence of cover vegetation on alley and absence of irrigation. These parameters likely influence the selection of each particular Meloidogyne species from a major dispersal source, such as the rooted plantlets used to establish the orchards."

https://openalex.org/W2809665685,"The annual cyclicality of cortical bone growth marks (BGMs) allows reconstruction of some important life history traits, such as longevity, growth rate or age at maturity. Little attention has been paid, however, to non-cyclical BGMs, though some record key life history events such as hatching (egg-laying vertebrates), metamorphosis (amphibians), or weaning (suggested for Microcebus and the hedgehog). Here, we investigate the relationship between non-cyclical BGMs and a stressful biological event in mammals: the moment of birth. In the present study, we histologically examine ontogenetic series of femora, tibiae and metapodia in several extant representatives of the genus Equus (E. hemionus, E. quagga and E. grevyi). Our analysis reveals the presence of a non-cyclical growth mark that is deposited around the moment of birth, analogous to the neonatal line described for teeth. We therefore refer to it as neonatal line. The presence of this feature within the bone cross-section agrees with a period of growth arrest in newborn foals regulated by the endocrine system. The neonatal line is accompanied by modifications in bone tissue type and vascularization, and has been identified in all bones studied and at different ontogenetic ages. Our discovery of a non-cyclical BGM related to the moment of birth in mammals is an important step towards the histological reconstruction of life histories in extant and fossil equids."
https://openalex.org/W2809077846,"Background Elder mistreatment is a well-recognized public health issue with complex underlying factors. The current study hypothesized that there is no effect of any of the following factors on any type of elder mistreatment: ethnicity, age group, education status, gender, living arrangement, concentration problems, medication for any disease, income level of caregiver, use of alcohol and tobacco products, and dependence on family or caregivers for daily activities. Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 339 elders adults aged 60 or above residing in a rural part of eastern Nepal between August and November 2016. Multi-stage cluster sampling was adopted to select the study subjects. Information was collected using semi-structured questionnaires administered to elderly people by a designated interviewer. Factors associated with elder mistreatment were analyzed using logistic regression. Results Our findings revealed that 61.7% of 60+-year-olds experienced some form of mistreatment (physical 2.4%, psychological 22.4%, caregiver neglect 57.5%, financial 12.1% and stranger-inflicted 8.3%). Elder mistreatment was associated with the following characteristics of elders: dependent on family for daily living activities, illiterate, experiencing concentration problems, residing in a living arrangement with their son(s)/daughter(s)-in-law, taking regular medications, belonging to the Dalit community according to the Hindu traditional caste system, and residing with a caregiver having a monthly family income of less than NRs. 20,000 (193USD). Conclusions Our data show that elder mistreatment is prevalent in a rural community of Nepal. Addressing the lower socio-economic or socio-cultural classes of caregivers and elders via community-focused development programs might have significant implications for improving the well-being of elders."
https://openalex.org/W2809446732,"Lionfish, native to reef ecosystems of the tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific, were introduced to Florida waters in the 1980s, and have spread rapidly throughout the northwestern Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. These invasive, carnivorous fish significantly reduce other fish and benthic invertebrate biomass, fish recruitment, and species richness in reef ecosystems. Fisheries resource managers have proposed the establishment of a commercial fishery to reduce lionfish populations and mitigate adverse effects on reef communities. The potential for a commercial fishery for lionfish is the primary reason to identify locations where lionfish accumulate sufficient amounts of ciguatoxin (CTX) to cause ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), the leading cause of non-bacterial seafood poisoning associated with fish consumption. To address this issue, an initial geographic assessment of CTX toxicity in lionfish from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico was conducted. Lionfish samples (n = 293) were collected by spearfishing from 13 locations (74 sampling sites) around the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico between 2012 and 2015. The highest frequencies of lionfish containing measurable CTX occurred in areas known to be high-risk regions for CFP in the central to eastern Caribbean (e.g., 53% British Virgin Islands and 5% Florida Keys). Though measurable CTX was found in some locations, the majority of the samples (99.3%) contained CTX concentrations below the United States Food and Drug Administration guidance level of 0.1 ppb Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 (C-CTX-1) equivalents (eq.). Only 0.7% of lionfish tested contained more than 0.1 ppb C-CTX-1 eq. As of 2018, there has been one suspected case of CFP from eating lionfish. Given this finding, current risk reduction techniques used to manage CTX accumulating fish are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2809469541,"Many genes have been suggested as candidate genes for keratoconus based on their function, their proximity to associated polymorphisms or due to the identification of putative causative variants within the gene. However, very few of these genes have been assessed for rare variation in keratoconus more broadly. In contrast, VSX1 and SOD1 have been widely assessed, however, the vast majority of studies have been small and the findings conflicting. In a cohort of Australians of European descent, consisting of 385 keratoconus cases and 396 controls, we screened 21 keratoconus candidate genes: BANP, CAST, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL5A1, FOXO1, FNDC3B, HGF, IL1A, IL1B, ILRN, IMMP2L, MPDZ, NFIB, RAB3GAP1, RAD51, RXRA, SLC4A11, SOD1, TF and VSX1. The candidate genes were sequenced in these individuals by either whole exome sequencing or targeted gene sequencing. Variants were filtered to identify rare (minor allele frequency <1%), potentially pathogenic variants. A total of 164 such variants were identified across the two groups with no variants fulfilling these criteria in cases in IL1RN, BANP, IL1B, RAD51 or SOD1. The frequency of variants was compared between cases and controls using chi-square or Fishers' Exact tests for each gene with at least one rare potentially pathogenic variant identified in the case cohort. The number of rare potentially pathogenic variants per gene ranged from three (RXRA) to 102 (MPDZ), however for all genes, there was no difference in the frequency between the cases and controls. We conclude that rare potentially pathogenic variation in the 21 candidate genes assessed do not play a major role in keratoconus susceptibility and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2809297594,"Purpose To examine the relationship between optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and clinical course in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injection (IVR). Design Prospective cohort study. Participants Thirty eyes of 30 patients with BRVO treated with IVR. Methods All patients received 1 initial IVR followed by repeated injections in the pro re nata (PRN) regimen. Correlations between logarithm of minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity (logMAR BCVA) or number of IVRs after 12 months and OCT parameters including the external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ), interdigitation zone (IZ), and photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) length at first resolution of macular edema (ME) were assessed. Resolution of ME was defined as central foveal thickness <300 μm and the absence of subretinal fluid. OCT parameters influencing BCVA and number of IVRs were evaluated using multivariate analysis. Correlations between nonperfusion areas (NPAs) and thinning areas and changes in retinal thickness of BRVO-affected areas were assessed. Results Of the 30 patients, 27 completed this study and were included in the statistical analyses. The mean logMAR BCVA at 3, 6, and 12 months was 0.16 ± 0.19, 0.09 ± 0.20, and 0.07 ± 0.20, respectively, which improved significantly from baseline at each visit (p < 0.0001, respectively), while the mean number of IVRs at 12 months was 3.9 ± 2.2. The mean number of IVRs for the first resolution of ME was 1.6 ± 0.8. Eyes with ELM and EZ defects at the points of first resolution of ME were correlated with a significantly lower BCVA at 12 months compared with eyes with preserved ELMs and EZs (p = 0.035, p = 0.002, respectively). However, eyes with IZ defects at the points of first resolution of ME were not correlated with a significantly lower BCVA at 12 months compared with eyes with preserved IZs (p = 0.160). Defects in the EZ at the points of first resolution of ME significantly affected the number of IVRs at 12 months (p = 0.042), although the ELM and IZ did not. PROS length at the points of first resolution of ME was significantly correlated with BCVA and number of IVRs at 12 months (p = 0.006, p = 0.0008, respectively). In multivariate analysis, PROS length at the points of first resolution of ME had the most significant effect on BCVA and number of IVRs (p = 0.013, p = 0.012, respectively). NPA size on fluorescein angiography and thinning area on OCT within the macular area showed a significant correlation (p = 0.003, r = 0.971). The retinal thickness of ischemic BRVO-affected areas was significantly less than that of control areas at 10, 11, and 12 months (p = 0.001, p = 0.005, p = 0.003, respectively). Conclusion We showed that the 1+PRN regimen may be a useful therapy for ME due to BRVO. In addition, PROS length at points of first resolution of ME appears to be a good indicator of BCVA and number of IVRs in BRVO patients."
https://openalex.org/W2809435772,"Regulation of autophagy by proteolytically cleaved fragments of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is a novel and current research focus in tumor biology. Endorepellin is the C-terminal angiostatic fragment of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan and induces autophagy in endothelial cells. To further investigate this property, we used NanoString, a digital PCR platform for measuring pre-defined transcripts in biological samples to analyze a custom subset of 95 autophagy-related genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with ultrapure human recombinant endorepellin. We discovered an endorepellin-evoked pro-autophagic and pro-mitophagic gene expression signatures, which included two coordinately up-regulated mitochondrial-associated genes encoding the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Parkin and the tumor suppressor mitostatin. Induction of both proteins required the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Furthermore, we discovered that endorepellin evoked mitochondrial depolarization in endothelial cells via a specific interaction between its two proximal LG1/2 domains and VEGFR2. We also found that following loss of membrane potential, mitostatin and parkin interact and that mitostatin associates with the established Parkin receptor mitofusin-2. In conclusion, we have identified a critical role for endorepellin in remodeling the autophagic transcriptome and influencing mitochondrial homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2809524280,"With the booming development of evacuation simulation software, developing an extensive database in indoor scenarios for evacuation models is imperative. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the collected videotapes and aim to provide a complete and unitary database of pedestrians’ earthquake emergency response behaviors in indoor scenarios, including human-environment interactions. Using the qualitative analysis method, we extract keyword groups and keywords that code the response modes of pedestrians and construct a general decision flowchart using chronological organization. Using the quantitative analysis method, we analyze data on the delay time, evacuation speed, evacuation route and emergency exit choices. Furthermore, we study the effect of classroom layout on emergency evacuation. The database for indoor scenarios provides reliable input parameters and allows the construction of real and effective constraints for use in software and mathematical models. The database can also be used to validate the accuracy of evacuation models."
https://openalex.org/W2809082432,"Objectives Pediatric brain damage is associated with various cognitive deficits. Cognitive rehabilitation may prevent and reduce cognitive impairment. In recent years, home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) has been introduced in clinical practice to increase treatment opportunities for patients (telerehabilitation). However, limited research has been conducted thus far on investigating the effects of remote CCT for the juvenile population in contexts other than English-speaking countries. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of a home-based CCT in a group of Italian adolescents with brain damage. A commercially available CCT (Lumosity) developed in the English language was used due to the lack of telerehabilitation programs in the Italian language that allow stimulation of multiple cognitive domains and, at the same time, remote automatic collection of data. Thus, this investigation provides information on the possibility of introducing CCT programs available in foreign languages in countries with limited investment in the telerehabilitation field. Methods 32 adolescents aged 11–16 with a diagnosis of congenital or acquired (either traumatic or non-traumatic) brain damage participated in the study. They received 40 training sessions (5 days/week for 8 weeks). Before starting the training program, they received face-to-face demonstration of training exercises and written instructions in their mother tongue. The feasibility of both training and study design and procedures was assessed through 9 criteria taken from extant literature. Results All 9 feasibility criteria were met. 31 out of the 32 participants demonstrated adherence to the training program. 94.2% of training sessions were completed in the recommended timeframe. No significant technical issue was found. Conclusions Telerehabilitation seems to be a feasible practice for adolescents with brain damage. A training program developed in a foreign language can be used to counter the unavailability of programs in patients’ mother tongue. Trial registration The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN59250807"
https://openalex.org/W2809335208,"The tongue, with fleshy, muscular, and bony components, is an innovation of the earliest land-dwelling vertebrates with key functions in both feeding and respiration. Here, we bring together evidence from preserved hyoid elements from dinosaurs and outgroup archosaurs, including pterosaurs, with enhanced contrast x-ray computed tomography data from extant taxa. Midline ossification is a key component of the origin of an avian hyoid. The elaboration of the avian tongue includes the evolution of multiple novel midline hyoid bones and a larynx suspended caudal to these midline elements. While variable in dentition and skull shape, most bird-line archosaurs show a simple hyoid structure. Bony, or well-mineralized, hyoid structures in dinosaurs show limited modification in response to dietary shifts and across significant changes in body-size. In Dinosauria, at least one such narrow, midline element is variably mineralized in some basal paravian theropods. Only in derived ornithischians, pterosaurs and birds is further significant hyoid elaboration recorded. Furthermore, only in the latter two taxa does the bony tongue structure include elongation of paired hyobranchial elements that have been associated in functional studies with hyolingual mobility. Pterosaurs and enantiornithine birds achieve similar elongation and inferred mobility via elongation of ceratobranchial elements while within ornithurine birds, including living Aves, ossified and separate paired epibranchial elements (caudal to the ceratobranchials) confer an increase in hyobranchial length. The mobile tongues seen in living birds may be present in other flighted archosaurs showing a similar elongation. Shifts from hypercarnivory to more diverse feeding ecologies and diets, with the evolution of novel locomotor strategies like flight, may explain the evolution of more complex tongue function."
https://openalex.org/W2809651820,"Many Management (sub-)disciplines, from Organizational Behavior and Marketing to Accounting and Strategy, are interested in antecedents and consequences of individual attitudes and traits. A key aspect of personality profiles are explicit and implicit motives. Yet, Management scholars mainly focus on explicit motives, with limited attention to implicit motives. We argue that this state of affairs probably came into being because current Management researchers mainly rely on implicit motive measures that are either difficult to apply or to develop, hampering researchers from applying implicit motive measures. To overcome the downsides of available instruments, we develop a Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) as an efficient, reliable and valid measure of implicit motives, particularly the needs for achievement, affiliation and power. To explore our BIAT’s predictive validity, we apply this measure to a specific research domain within Management: Entrepreneurship. We examine implicit motives’ association with entrepreneurial self-efficacy, business founding, and financial profitability. Our results show that the introduction of implicit motives can unlock stranded discussions in this research domain. Overall, we argue that implicit motives can help to push the boundaries of the study of deep-level attributes in a wide range of organizational and managerial settings."
https://openalex.org/W2808886511,"Describing the physical habitat diversity of stream types is important for understanding stream ecosystem complexity, but also prioritizing management of stream ecosystems, especially those that are rare. We developed a stream classification system of six physical habitat layers (size, gradient, hydrology, temperature, valley confinement, and substrate) for approximately 1 million stream reaches within the Eastern United States in order to conduct an inventory of different types of streams and examine stream diversity. Additionally, we compare stream diversity to patterns of anthropogenic disturbances to evaluate associations between stream types and human disturbances, but also to prioritize rare stream types that may lack natural representation in the landscape. Based on combinations of different layers, we estimate there are anywhere from 1,521 to 5,577 different physical types of stream reaches within the Eastern US. By accounting for uncertainty in class membership, these estimates could range from 1,434 to 6,856 stream types. However, 95% of total stream distance is represented by only 30% of the total stream habitat types, which suggests that most stream types are rare. Unfortunately, as much as one third of stream physical diversity within the region has been compromised by anthropogenic disturbances. To provide an example of the stream classification’s utility in management of these ecosystems, we isolated 5% of stream length in the entire region that represented 87% of the total physical diversity of streams to prioritize streams for conservation protection, restoration, and biological monitoring. We suggest that our stream classification framework could be important for exploring the diversity of stream ecosystems and is flexible in that it can be combined with other stream classification frameworks developed at higher resolutions (meso- and micro-habitat scales). Additionally, the exploration of physical diversity helps to estimate the rarity and patchiness of riverscapes over large region and assist in conservation and management."
https://openalex.org/W2808958710,"Background The Outpatient Therapeutic Program (OTP) for treatment brings the management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) closer to the community. Many lives have been saved through this approach, but little data exists on the outcome of the children after discharge from such programmes. This study was aimed to determine the survival and nutritional status of children at six months after discharge from OTP for SAM. Methodology This was a prospective study of children with SAM admitted into 10 OTPs in two local government areas of Jigawa state from June 2016 to July 2016. Home visits at six months after discharge enabled the collection of data on survival and nutritional status. The primary outcome measures were survival and nutritional status (Mid upper arm circumference and weight-for-height z-score). Result Of 494 children with SAM, 410 were discharged and 379 were followed up. Of these, 354, (93.4%) were found alive while 25 (6.6%) died. Among the survivors 333 (94.1%) had MUAC ≥12.5cm and 64 (18.1%) had WHZ<-3. Mortality rates were higher 10 (8.4%) among the 6-11months old. Most deaths 16 (64%) occurred within the first 3months post-discharge. Those who died were significantly more stunted, p = 0.016 and had a smaller head circumference, p = 0.005 on entry to OTP programme. There was improvement from admission to six months follow up in the number of children with complete immunization (27.4% to 35.6%), and a decrease in the number of unimmunized children (34.8% vs 20.6%) at follow-up. Conclusion The study demonstrates good post discharge survival rate and improved nutritional status for SAM patients managed in OTPs. There were, however considerable post discharge mortality, especially in the first three months and lower immunization uptake post discharge. A follow-up programme will improve these indices further."
https://openalex.org/W2809316849,"Purpose Prostate cancer (PC) is a devastating and heterogeneous condition with diverse treatment options. When selecting treatments for patients with very high-risk PC, clinicians must consider patient comorbidities. We investigated the efficacy of the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) as a prognostic factor for patient outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and methods We retrospectively investigated the medical records of PC patients at our institution who underwent RP from 1992 to 2010. Very high-risk PC was defined according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Patients with incomplete medical records or who had received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Preoperative comorbidity was evaluated by the ACCI, and the prognostic efficacy of the ACCI was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression, competing risk regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results Our final analysis included 228 men with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range 62–71) and median prostate specific antigen of 10.7 ng/mL. There were 41 (18%) patients with an ACCI score >3 and 88 (38.6%) patients with a biopsy Gleason score >8. Preoperative evaluation revealed that 159 patients (69.7%) had a non-organ confined tumor (≥T3). Following RP, 8-year prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 91.6% and 83.4%, respectively. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that ACCI was significantly associated with other-cause survival and OS (p<0.05). Conclusion The ACCI is an effective prognostic factor for other-cause survival and OS in very high-risk PC patients. RP should be considered carefully for patients with an ACCI score >3."
https://openalex.org/W2809265289,"Interactions between pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungal species in the tree canopy are complex and can determine if disease will manifest in the plant and in other organisms such as honey bees. Seasonal dynamics of fungi were studied in an almond orchard in California where experimental release of the atoxigenic biopesticide Aspergillus flavus AF36 to displace toxigenic Aspergillus strains has been conducted for five years. The presence of the vegetative compatibility group (VCG) YV36, to which AF36 belongs, in the blossoms, and the honey bees that attend these blossoms, was assessed. In blossoms, A. flavus frequencies ranged from 0 to 4.5%, depending on the year of study. Frequencies of honey bees carrying A. flavus ranged from 6.5 to 10%. Only one A. flavus isolate recovered from a blossom in 2016 belonged to YV36, while members of the VCG were not detected contaminating honey bees. Exposure of pollinator honey bees to AF36 was detected to be very low. The density of several Aspergillus species was found to increase during almond hull split and throughout the final stages of maturation; this also occurred in pistachio orchards during the maturation period. Additionally, we found that AF36 effectively limited almond aflatoxin contamination in laboratory assays. This study provides knowledge and understanding of the seasonal dynamics of Aspergillus fungi and will help design aflatoxin management strategies for almond. The evidence of the low levels of VCG YV36 encountered on almond blossoms and bees during pollination and AF36’s effectiveness in limiting aflatoxin contamination in almond provided additional support for the registration of AF36 with USEPA to use in almond in California."
https://openalex.org/W2809060073,"Frequent international travel facilitates the global spread of dengue fever. Japan has experienced an increasing number of imported case notifications of dengue virus (DENV) infection, mostly arising from Japanese travelers visiting South and Southeast Asian countries. This has led an autochthonous dengue outbreak in 2014 in Japan. The present study aimed to infer the risk of DENV infection among Japanese travelers to Asian countries, thereby obtaining an actual estimate of the number of DENV infections among travelers.For eight destination countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Singapore), we collected age-dependent seroepidemiological data. We also retrieved the number of imported cases, who were notified to the Japanese government, as well as the total number of travelers to each destination. Using a mathematical model, we estimated the force of infection in each destination country with seroepidemiological data while jointly inferring the reporting coverage of DENV infections among Japanese travelers from datasets of imported cases and travelers. Assuming that travelers had a risk of infection that was identical to that of the local population during travel, the reporting coverage of dengue appeared to range from 0.6% to 4.3%. The risk of infection per journey ranged from 0.02% to 0.44%.We found that the actual number of imported cases of DENV infection among Japanese travelers could be more than 20 times the notified number of imported cases. This finding may be attributed to the substantial proportion of asymptomatic and under-ascertained infections."
https://openalex.org/W2809633226,"In clinical practice and in research, there is an ongoing debate on how to return incidental and secondary findings of genetic tests to patients and research participants. Previous investigations have found that most of the people most of the time are in favor of full disclosure of results. Yet, the option to reject disclosure, based on the so-called right not to know, can be valuable especially for some vulnerable subgroups of recipients. In the present study we investigated variations in informational preferences in the context of genetic testing in a large and diverse German sample. This survey examined health care professionals, patients, participants of genetic counseling sessions and members of the general population (N = 518). Survey participants were assessed regarding their openness to learning about findings under various hypothetical scenarios, as well as their attitudes about the doctor-patient-relationship in a disclosure situation and about informational transfer to third parties. While the majority of participants wanted to learn about their findings, the extent of support of disclosure varied with features of the hypothetical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., controllability of disease; abstract vs. concrete scenario description) and demographic characteristics of the subjects. For example, subjects with higher levels of education were more selective with regards to the kind of information they want to receive than those with lower levels of education. We discuss implications of these findings for the debate about the right not to know and for the clinical practice of informed consent procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2808789510,"CD74 is a multifunctional protein and a receptor for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) and MIF-2 / D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) cytokines, upregulated in diabetic kidney disease. However, the drivers of CD74 expression and DDT function in kidney cells are poorly characterized. TWEAK is a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes kidney injury. We have now identified CD74 gene expression as upregulated in the kidneys in response to systemic TWEAK administration in mice, and have characterized the in vivo CD74 expression and the functional consequences in cultured cells. TWEAK administration to mice resulted in a progressive time-dependent (up to 24h) upregulation of kidney CD74 mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (Western blot). Furthermore, the CD74 ligands MIF and DDT were also upregulated at the protein level 24h after TWEAK administration. Immunohistochemistry localized the increased CD74, MIF and DDT expression to tubular cells. In cultured tubular cells, TWEAK increased CD74 mRNA and protein expression dose-dependently, with a temporal pattern similar to in vivo. TWEAK-induced CD74 localized to the cell membrane, where it can function as a cytokine receptor. For the first time, we explored the actions of DDT in tubular cells and found that DDT amplified the increase in MCP-1 and RANTES expression in response to TWEAK. By contrast, DDT did not significantly modify TWEAK-induced Klotho downregulation. In conclusion, TWEAK upregulates CD74 and its ligands MIF and DDT in renal tubular cells. This may have functional consequences for kidney injury since DDT amplified the inflammatory response to TWEAK."
https://openalex.org/W2809415625,"Chronically high blood glucose concentrations are a characteristic of diabetes mellitus. Maternal diabetes affects the metabolism of early embryos and can cause a delay in development. To mimic maternal diabetes, bovine in vitro fertilization and embryo culture were performed in fertilization medium and culture medium containing 0.5, 2, 3, and 5 mM, glucose whereas under control conditions, the medium was glucose free (0 mM). Compared to control conditions (0 mM, 31%), blastocyst development was decreased to 23% with 0.5 and 2 mM glucose. Presence of 3 or 5 mM glucose in the medium resulted in decreased blastocyst rates (20% and 10% respectively). The metabolomic profile of resulting day 8 blastocysts was analysed by UPLC-MS/MS, and compared to that of blastocysts cultured in control conditions. Elevated glucose concentrations stimulated an increase in glycolysis and activity of the hexosamine pathway, which is involved in protein glycosylation. However, components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, such as citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate, were reduced in glucose stimulated blastocysts, suggesting that energy production from pyruvate was inefficient. On the other hand, activity of the polyol pathway, an alternative route to energy generation, was increased. In short, cattle embryos exposed to elevated glucose concentrations during early development showed changes in their metabolomic profile consistent with the expectations of exposure to diabetic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2808983527,"Objectives Quality of tuberculosis (TB) microscopy diagnosis is not a guarantee despite implementation of External Quality Assurance (EQA) service in all laboratories of health facilities. Hence, we aimed at evaluating the technical quality and the findings of sputum smear microscopy for acid fast bacilli (AFB) at health centers in Hararge Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out between July 8, 2014 and July 7, 2015.A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) method was put into practice for collecting all necessary sample slides. Data were analyzed by using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 20 software. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Of the total55 health center laboratories which had been assessed during the study period, 20 (36.4%) had major technical errors; 13 (23.6%) had 15 false negative results and 17 (30.9%) had 22 false positive results. Moreover, poor specimen quality, smear size, smear thickness, staining and evenness were indicated in 40 (72.7%), 39 (70.9%), 37 (67.3%), 27(49.1%) and 37 (67.3%) of the collected samples, respectively. False negative AFB findings were significantly associated with lack of Internal Quality Control (IQC) measures (AOR (Adjusted Odds Ratio): 2.90 (95% CI (Confidence Interval): 1.25,6.75) and poor staining procedures (AOR: 2.16(95% CI: 1.01, 5.11). Conclusions The qualities of AFB smear microscopy reading and smearing were low in most of the laboratories of the health centers. Therefore, it is essential to strength EQA program through building the capacity of laboratory professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2809189000,"Over the last few decades, public life has taken center stage in urban studies, but that is about to change. At times, indoor activities have been shown to matter more than what is publicly visible (they have been found to be more predictive of future crimes, for example). Until recently, however, data has not been available to study indoor activities at city scale. To that end, we propose a new methodology that relies on tagging information of geo-referenced pictures and unfolds in three main steps. First, we collected and classified a comprehensive set of activity-related words, creating the first dictionary of urban activities. Second, for both London and New York City, we collected geo-referenced Flickr tags and matched them with the words in the dictionary. This step produced both a systematic classification (our activity-related words were best classified in eleven categories) and two city-wide indoor activity maps which, when compared to open data of public amenities and sensory maps of smell and sound matched theoretical expectations. Third, we studied, for the first time, activities happening indoor in relation to neighborhood socio-economic conditions. We found the very same result for both London and New York City. In deprived areas, people focused on any of the activity types (leading to specialization), and it did not matter on which one they did so. By contrast, in well-to-do areas, people engaged not in one type of activity but in a variety of them (leading to diversification)."
https://openalex.org/W2809263233,"In this study, we screen archaeological soil samples by microscopy and analyse the samples by next generation sequencing to obtain results with parasites at species level and untargeted findings of plant and animal DNA. Three separate sediment layers of an ancient man-made pond in Hoby, Denmark, ranging from 100 BC to 200 AD, were analysed by microscopy for presence of intestinal worm eggs and DNA analysis were performed to identify intestinal worms and dietary components. Ancient DNA of parasites, domestic animals and edible plants revealed a change in use of the pond over time reflecting the household practice in the adjacent Iron Age settlement. The most abundant parasite found belonged to the Ascaris genus, which was not possible to type at species level. For all sediment layers the presence of eggs of the human whipworm Trichuris trichiura and the beef tapeworm Taenia saginata suggests continuous disposal of human faeces in the pond. Moreover, the continuous findings of T. saginata further imply beef consumption and may suggest that cattle were living in the immediate surrounding of the site throughout the period. Findings of additional host-specific parasites suggest fluctuating presence of other domestic animals over time: Trichuris suis (pig), Parascaris univalens (horse), Taenia hydatigena (dog and sheep). Likewise, alternating occurrence of aDNA of edible plants may suggest changes in agricultural practices. Moreover, the composition of aDNA of parasites, plants and vertebrates suggests a significant change in the use of the ancient pond over a period of three centuries."

The most sensitive Arabic text available online is the Digital Qur’an, the sacred book of Revelation in Islam that all Muslims including non-Arabs recite as part of their worship. Due to the different characteristics of the Arabic letters like diacritics (punctuation symbols), kashida (extended letters) and other symbols, it is written and available in different styles like Kufi, Naskh, Thuluth, Uthmani, etc. As social media has become part of our daily life, posting downloaded Qur’anic verses from the web is common. This leads to the problem of authenticating the selected Qur’anic passages available in different styles. This paper presents a residual approach for authenticating Uthmani and plain Qur’an verses using one common database. Residual (difference) is obtained by analyzing the differences between Uthmani and plain Quranic styles using XOR operation. Based on predefined data, the proposed approach converts Uthmani text into plain text. Furthermore, we propose to use the Tuned BM algorithm (BMT) exact pattern matching algorithm to verify the substituted Uthmani verse with a given database of plain Qur’anic style. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is useful and effective in authenticating multi-style texts of the Qur’an with 87.1% accuracy."

Mutations in its gene cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, mainly arising from overactivation of the renal Na+/Cl− cotransporter (NCC). In addition to full-length WNK4, we have observed faster migrating bands (between 95 and 130 kDa) in Western blots of kidney lysates. Therefore, we hypothesized that these could correspond to uncharacterized WNK4 variants. Here, using several WNK4 antibodies and WNK4−/− mice as controls, we showed that these bands indeed correspond to short WNK4 variants that are not observed in other tissue lysates. LC-MS/MS confirmed these bands as WNK4 variants that lack C-terminal segments.

Mutations occurring within a specific motif in WNK4, the acidic motif, produce the human genetic disease pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) (2.Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodème S. Choate K.A.

This disease features hypertension, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and marked sensitivity to thiazide diuretics, alterations that are thought to be mainly due to higher basal activity of the renal thiazide–sensitive Na+/Cl− cotransporter (NCC), which is specifically expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the nephron (3.Grimm P.R.

The acidic motif of WNK4 constitutes the binding site for the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex formed by cullin 3, Kelch-like 3, and an E3 ring ubiquitin ligase, which regulates the degradation of the kinase (6.Shibata S.

WNK4-knockout mice present markedly decreased levels of NCC expression and virtually no NCC phosphorylation. Accordingly, the phenotype of WNK4-knockout mice resembles that of patients with Gitelman disease, featuring hypotension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, which is caused by inactivating mutations in NCC (8.Castañeda-Bueno M. Cervantes-Pérez L.G. Vázquez N. Uribe N. Kantesaria S. Morla L. Bobadilla N.A. Doucet A. Alessi D.R. Gamba G.

Thus, WNK4 is a key regulator of NCC, and its activity is essential to maintain basal NCC activity levels. WNK4 promotes NCC activation through the phosphorylation of the T-loop of the Ste20-related proline/alanine–rich kinase (SPAK), which in turn phosphorylates key residues for NCC activation located in the N-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of the cotransporter (9.Pacheco-Alvarez D.

In contrast, the regulatory effect of WNK4 on ROMK and ENaC appears to be independent of kinase activity (11.Kahle K.T. Wilson F.H. Leng Q. Lalioti M.D. O'Connell A.D. Dong K. Rapson A.K.

Recently, it was shown that knock-in mice carrying a constitutively active form of SPAK in the DCT develop PHAII (3.Grimm P.R. Coleman R. Delpire E. Welling P.A. Constitutively active SPAK causes hyperkalemia by activating NCC and remodeling distal tubules.J. Am. Soc.

Thus, WNK4's direct effects on ROMK and ENaC do not seem to be essential to develop the disease. WNK4 kinase activity is regulated by at least two different mechanisms. Binding of a chloride ion within a site located near the active site of the kinase stabilizes an inactive conformation and prevents kinase activity (13.Piala A.T. Moon T.M. Akella R. He H. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Chloride sensing by WNK1 involves inhibition of autophosphorylation.Sci.

Thus, at high intracellular chloride concentrations ([Cl−]i), chloride ions remain bound to these sites, inhibiting WNK4 activity. Conversely, when [Cl−]i decreases, dissociation of Cl− ions allows kinase activation. This mechanism has been shown to be important for NCC modulation in response to changes in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e), because changes in [K+]e affect the intracellular Cl− concentration of DCT cells (15.Terker A.S.

The second known regulatory mechanism of WNK4 kinase activity involves phosphorylation of at least two sites, Ser-64 and Ser-1196, located within the regulatory N- and C-terminal domains of WNK4, respectively (16.Castañeda-Bueno M. Arroyo J.P. Zhang J. Puthumana J. Yarborough 3rd, O. Shibata S. Rojas-Vega L. Gamba G. Rinehart J. Lifton R.P.

Phosphorylation of these sites promotes kinase activation; it can be conducted by protein kinase C or protein kinase A, and it is stimulated, for example, in response to AT1 receptor activation by angiotensin II. So far, the mechanism linking phosphorylation to kinase activation is unknown; however, both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of WNK4 have long been thought to play a regulatory role (17.San-Cristobal P.

During our recent characterization of the WNK4-knockout mouse strain (8.Castañeda-Bueno M. Cervantes-Pérez L.G. Vázquez N. Uribe N. Kantesaria S. Morla L. Bobadilla N.A. Doucet A. Alessi D.R. Gamba G. Activation of the renal Na+:Cl− cotransporter by angiotensin II is a WNK4-dependent process.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109 (22550170): 7929-793410.1073/pnas.1200947109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we noticed that several bands smaller than that corresponding to the full-length WNK4 were observed in blots of renal tissues performed with an antibody directed against an N-terminal epitope; these were absent in samples from the knockout animals, ruling them out as nonspecific signals. Thus, we hypothesized that these bands could correspond to previously unrecognized variants of WNK4. Here, we present evidence that confirms the identity of these short bands as WNK4 short variants that lack a portion of the C-terminal domain. In addition, the characterization of these short variants of WNK4 has led us to the identification of a bona fide PP1-binding site located at the final portion of WNK4's C terminus, which regulates WNK4 phosphorylation levels and, thus, kinase activity. Mouse kidney lysates from WNK4+/+ and WNK4−/− mice were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against three distinct WNK4 epitopes. Using two different antibodies directed against N-terminal epitopes, we observed, in addition to the band corresponding to the full-length protein, at least two smaller bands that were absent in the WNK4−/− mouse samples (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). These smaller bands were more abundant in samples from TgWNK4PHAII mice (4.Lalioti M.D. Zhang J. Volkman H.M. Kahle K.T. Hoffmann K.E. Toka H.R. Nelson-Williams C. Ellison D.H. Flavell R. Booth C.J. Lu Y. Geller D.S. Lifton R.P. Wnk4 controls blood pressure and potassium homeostasis via regulation of mass and activity of the distal convoluted tubule.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38 (16964266): 1124-113210.1038/ng1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1B) and were not detected when an antibody directed against a C-terminal WNK4 epitope was used (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the small bands observed correspond to shorter variants of WNK4, with an intact N-terminal domain and probably lacking a segment of the C terminus. These shorter WNK4 variants appear to be kidney-specific, as they were not observed in lysates from testis, brain, and lung when analyzed with a WNK4 N-terminal antibody (Fig. 1C). Full-length WNK4 and the shorter variants were immunoprecipitated from mouse kidney lysates and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). Bands were excised from gel and individually analyzed by MS (LC-MS/MS). For the excised gel sample containing the full-length protein, tryptic peptides generated from the whole length of the protein were detected, including peptides from the C-terminal region (Fig. 1E and Table S1). In contrast, for the gel sample containing the smaller WNK4 variants, only peptides generated from the N-terminal and middle region of the protein were observed, whereas no peptides from the last portion of the C-terminal domain were detected (Fig. 1E and Table S2). This confirms the identity of the small-sized bands observed in Western blots as smaller variants of WNK4 lacking a portion of the C terminus. In addition, given that the 781–787 peptide was observed in the sample corresponding to the short WNK4 variants (Table S2), at least the segment comprising amino acid residues 1–787 must be present in the longest of the short variants. It should be noted that the large tryptic peptide comprising residues 788–970 was not expected to be detected in these assays due to its large size, and thus, the absence of detection of this peptide may not have been due to absence of this segment in the short WNK4 variants. To understand the impact that C-terminal truncations may have on WNK4 activity, we generated several WNK4 mutant constructs in which STOP codons were inserted at strategic positions between functional motifs (Fig. 2A). This allowed us to test the impact of the additive elimination of these motifs. The activity of these constructs was tested in HEK293 cells that were cotransfected with SPAK. SPAK phosphorylation (pSPAK; Ser-373) was measured as an indicator of WNK4 activity. Almost all mutant constructs presented a higher level of activity than WNK4-WT (Fig. 2, B and C), which was comparable with the activity of the WNK4-L319F mutant that is considered to be a constitutively active mutant due to impaired chloride binding in the kinase domain (14.Bazúa-Valenti S. Chávez-Canales M. Rojas-Vega L. González-Rodríguez X. Vázquez N. Rodríguez-Gama A. Argaiz E.R. Melo Z. Plata C. Ellison D.H. García-Valdés J. Hadchouel J. Gamba G.

Nephrol. 2015; 26 (25542968): 1781-178610.1681/ASN.2014050470Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This effect depended on WNK4 catalytic activity, because it was prevented by introduction of the D318A mutation, which renders the kinase catalytically inactive (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2A) (25.Wilson F.H. Kahle K.T. Sabath E. Lalioti M.D. Rapson A.K. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Lifton R.P.

The only mutant construct that did not present higher activity levels than WNK4-WT was WNK4-R996X. Because this mutant is only 35 amino acid residues shorter than the WNK4-T1029X mutant, and the only functional motif known in this segment is the SPAK-binding site comprising residues 996–999 (RFXV motif) (26.Ponce-Coria J. Markadieu N. Austin T.M. Flammang L. Rios K. Welling P.A. Delpire E.

We also assessed T-loop phosphorylation of the truncated mutants WNK4-K1211X and -T1029X as an alternative indicator of activation level. For both mutants, we observed higher T-loop phosphorylation levels than for WNK4-WT (Fig. 2, D and E). Finally, a representative WNK4-truncated mutant was tested for its ability to promote NCC activation in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In accordance with the results obtained in HEK293 cells, the WNK4-T1029X mutant promoted NCC activation, whereas no NCC activation was observed with the WNK4-WT under the experimental conditions tested (Fig. S2B). We noted that the only common feature between the four truncated mutants that presented higher activity levels than WNK4-WT was the absence of the last 12 amino acid residues of the protein. Within this region, a motif presenting the consensus sequence for interaction with PP1 is present (KXVXF) (27.Shi Y. Serine/threonine phosphatases: mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139 (19879837): 468-48410.1016/j.cell.2009.10.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Lin et al. (21.Lin D.-H. Yue P. Rinehart J. Sun P. Wang Z. Lifton R. Wang W.-H. Protein phosphatase 1 modulates the inhibitory effect of With-no-Lysine kinase 4 on ROMK channels.Am. J. Physiol.

In our hands, however, the WNK4–PP1 interaction was preserved in a WNK4 mutant lacking both putative PP1-binding sites (here termed PP1a and PP1b) (Fig. 3A). However, when only a fragment of WNK4's C terminus was expressed (residues 770–1222), which contains only the PP1b site, the absence of this site disrupted the interaction with PP1. This result suggests that the PP1b site is indeed a PP1-binding site but that, in addition to the PP1a and PP1b sites, additional motifs present in WNK4 may be involved in the interaction. We hypothesized that the gain of function observed in the truncated WNK4 mutants was due to the loss of the PP1b site. We thus tested whether elimination of the PP1a, PP1b, or both sites could replicate the gain of function observed with the truncated mutants. Interestingly, we observed that only the individual elimination of the PP1b site replicated the gain-of-function effect (Fig. 3, B and C) and that when the PP1a site was mutated in addition to the PP1b site, the gain-of-function effect was lost. We next tested the effect of the cotransfection of the different PP1 isoforms (PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ) on the phosphorylation levels of WNK4-WT at previously described phosphorylation sites (RRXS sites) (16.Castañeda-Bueno M. Arroyo J.P. Zhang J. Puthumana J. Yarborough 3rd, O. Shibata S. Rojas-Vega L. Gamba G. Rinehart J. Lifton R.P. Phosphorylation by PKC and PKA regulate the kinase activity and downstream signaling of WNK4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We observed that coexpression of PP1α and PP1γ promoted WNK4 dephosphorylation, whereas coexpression of PP1β had no effect (Fig. 3D). The inability of PP1β to dephosphorylate WNK4 may be because it binds to WNK4 with lower affinity than the other isoforms (Fig. 3E). The effect of PP1α co-expression on WNK4 phosphorylation levels depended on PP1 catalytic activity (Fig. S3). Finally, we tested the effect of PP1α cotransfection on the phosphorylation levels of the PP1 binding mutants. We observed that the presence of the PP1b mutation (either alone or together with the PP1a mutation) prevented the PP1α-mediated dephosphorylation of WNK4 (Fig. 3, F and G), whereas the WNK4–PP1a mutant behaved similarly to the WT. Altogether, these results suggest that PP1α and PP1γ are important regulators of WNK4 phosphorylation levels and that they require the presence of the C-terminal binding site, here described as PP1b, to achieve dephosphorylation. Impaired dephosphorylation of WNK4 in the presence of the PP1b mutation leads to kinase activation. This activation is lost in the presence of the PP1a mutation despite high WNK4 phosphorylation levels observed in this double mutant, suggesting that the PP1a mutation impairs the kinase activity of WNK4. Of note, the PP1a site lies within a region of WNK4 that has been described to have a PF2-like fold similar to the one present in SPAK and OSR1. This PF2-like domain present in SPAK and OSR1 has been implicated in the binding of RFXV motifs present in WNK kinases and SLC12 cotransporters (26.Ponce-Coria J. Markadieu N. Austin T.M. Flammang L.

Interestingly, it was recently shown that kidney lysates of mice that express SPAK only in the DCT, from a transgene carrying SPAK's ORF, display the same pattern of bands in SPAK blots compared with those observed with lysates of WT mice. This suggests that the shorter variants of SPAK are primarily produced by proteolytic cleavage and are present in the DCT (3.Grimm P.R. Coleman R. Delpire E. Welling P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2809359043,"The fucose salvage pathway is a two-step process in which mammalian cells transform L-fucose into GDP-L-fucose, a universal fucose donor used by fucosyltransferases to modify glycans. Emerging evidence indicates the fucose salvage pathway and the fucosylation of proteins are altered during melanoma progression and metastasis. However the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we report that the fucose salvage pathway inhibits invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation by promoting α-1,2 fucosylation. Chemically or genetically increasing the fucose salvage pathway decreases invadopodium numbers and inhibits the proteolytic activity of invadopodia in WM793 melanoma cells. Inhibiting fucosylation by depleting fucokinase abrogates L-fucose-mediated inhibition of invadopodia, suggesting dependence on the fucose salvage pathway. The inhibition of invadopodium formation by L-fucose or ectopically expressed FUK could be rescued by treatment with α-1,2, but not α-1,3/α-1,4 fucosidase, implicating an α-1,2 fucose linkage-dependent anti-metastatic effect. The expression of FUT1, an α-1,2 fucosyltransferase, is remarkably down-regulated during melanoma progression, and the ectopic expression of FUT1 is sufficient to inhibit invadopodium formation and ECM degradation. Our findings indicate that the fucose salvage pathway can inhibit invadopodium formation, and consequently, invasiveness in melanoma via α-1,2 fucosylation. Re-activation of this pathway in melanoma could be useful for preventing melanoma invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2808867632,"Recent years have witnessed the emigration of young Spanish people searching for labor opportunities. A decade after the beginning of the worldwide economic crisis in 2007, the rapid deterioration of living conditions and lack of opportunities for personal development combined with the breakdown of professional expectations have led thousands of young people to emigrate from Spain, creating the so-called youth exodus. The press has paid recurrent attention to this phenomenon, often using eye-catching headlines such as ‘Brain Drain’. Given the regular interest of the media in this phenomenon, the objective of this research is to analyze the media coverage of the drain of Spanish talent capital, or the emigration of young Spanish people seeking a better future, to create a distributive map that defines the characteristics and trends of this coverage. The analyzed corpus comprises 346 articles from eight Spanish and eleven international newspapers. The articles were coded based on descriptive variables (i.e., author, publication year, newspaper and language) and categorical variables (i.e., section, method, approach to the phenomenon, assessment of the phenomenon and overview of the phenomenon). The results indicate a significant increase in press coverage over the past few years and reveal associations between assessment of the phenomenon and year and between assessment of the phenomenon and section. As a result of this research, new investigative lines are unveiled regarding the social construction of the phenomenon in the media and the identity and individual construction of the ‘truncated careers’ of young Spanish people."
https://openalex.org/W2808990603,"Introduction The HIV epidemic in England is largely concentrated among heterosexuals who are predominately black African and men who have sex with men (MSM). We present for the first time trends in annual HIV incidence for adults attending sexual health clinics, where 80% of all HIV diagnoses are made. Methods We identified newly diagnosed incident HIV using a recent infection testing algorithm (RITA) consisting of a biomarker (AxSYM assay, modified to determine antibody avidity), epidemiological and clinical information. We estimated HIV incidence using the WHO RITA formula for cross-sectional studies, with HIV testing data from sexual health clinics as the denominator. Results From 2009 to 2013, each year, between 9,700 and 26,000 black African heterosexuals (of between 161,000 and 231,000 heterosexuals overall) were included in analyses. For the same period, annually between 19,000 and 55,000 MSM were included. Estimates of HIV incidence among black Africans increased slightly (although non-significantly) from 0.15% (95% C.I.0.05%-0.26%) in 2009 to 0.19% (95% C.I.0.04%-0.34%) in 2013 and was 4-5-fold higher than among all heterosexuals among which it remained stable between 0.03% (95% C.I.0.02%-0.05%) and 0.05% (95% C.I.0.03%-0.07%) over the period. Among MSM incidence was highest and increased (non-significantly) from 1.24% (95%C.I 0.96–1.52%) to 1.46% (95% C.I 1.23%-1.70%) after a peak of 1.52% (95%C.I 1.30%-1.75%) in 2012. Conclusion These are the first nationwide estimates for trends in HIV incidence among black African and heterosexual populations in England which show black Africans, alongside MSM, remain disproportionately at risk of infection. Although people attending sexual health clinics may not be representative of the general population, nearly half of black Africans and MSM had attended in the previous 5 years. Timely and accurate incidence estimates will be critical in monitoring the impact of the reconfiguration of sexual health services in England, and any prevention programmes such as pre-exposure prophylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2809616952,"Objectives Several studies suggest a relationship between gestational age at birth and risk of school difficulties. Our study aimed to investigate the association between the entire range of gestational ages and significant school difficulties measured as 1) More than nine hours per week special educational support and 2) Failing to complete compulsory school. Methods A population-based register study including all children attending the Danish compulsory school in 2015/2016 and all live-born infants born in Denmark from 1992 to 1997. Data were collected and linked using multiple registers held by Statistic Denmark. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between gestational age and significant school difficulties, adjusted for explanatory variables. Results For measurement 1) “Special educational support” 615,789 children entered the analyses after exclusion of those with missing neonatal data. The risk of special educational support increased gradually across the entire range of gestation from 40 to ≤24 weeks: The adjusted odds ratio was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.03–1.12) at 39 weeks of gestational and 6.18 (95% confidence interval 5.17–7.39) at gestational ages < 28 weeks. For measurement 2) “Failing to complete compulsory school” the cohort consisted of 374,798 children after exclusion of those who died, had emigrated and/or had missing neonatal data. The risk of failing to complete compulsory school increased across the entire range of gestational ages: The adjusted odds ratio was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.04–1.10) at 39 weeks of gestation and 2.99 (95% confidence interval 2.41–3.71) at gestational ages < 28 weeks. In both sets of analyses GA = 40 weeks was used as reference. Conclusions We confirm a clear association between the degree of prematurity and significant school difficulties across the entire range of gestational ages from ≤ 24 to 40 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2951230883,"The nick translation property of DNA polymerase I (Pol I) ensures the maturation of Okazaki fragments by removing primer RNAs and facilitating ligation. However, prolonged nick translation traversing downstream DNA is an energy wasting futile process, as Pol I simultaneously polymerizes and depolymerizes at the nick sites utilizing energy-rich dNTPs. Using an in vitro assay system, we demonstrate that the β-clamp of the Escherichia coli replisome strongly inhibits nick translation on the DNA substrate. To do so, β-clamp inhibits the strand displacement activity of Pol I by interfering with the interaction between the finger subdomain of Pol I and the downstream primer-template junction. Conversely, β-clamp stimulates the 5’ exonuclease property of Pol I to cleave single nucleotides or shorter oligonucleotide flaps. This single nucleotide flap removal at high frequency increases the probability of ligation between the upstream and downstream DNA strands at an early phase, terminating nick translation. Besides β-clamp-mediated ligation helps DNA ligase to seal the nick promptly during the maturation of Okazaki fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2809482559,"Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) deficiency has been implicated in complex inflammatory and infectious diseases whose mechanisms are poorly understood. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WT and Tollip-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, we observed here that Tollip deficiency selectively reduces the expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) but potentiates the expression of fatty acid–binding protein 4 (FABP4) in these cells. We also observed that expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1α) is reduced, whereas that of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is elevated, in Tollip-deficient cells, correlating with the decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of FABP4 in these cells. We further found that the coupling of ubiquitin to ER degradation (CUE) domain of Tollip is required for stimulating HIF1α activity, because Tollip CUE–domain mutant cells exhibited reduced levels of HIF1α and selected cytokines. Tollip is known to mediate autophagy and lysosome fusion, and herein we observed that Tollip's autophagy function is required for modulating STAT5 and FABP4 expression. Bafilomycin A, an inhibitor of lysosome fusion, enhanced STAT5 and FABP4 expression in WT fibroblasts, whereas torin 2, an activator of autophagy, reduced STAT5 and FABP4 expression in Tollip-deficient fibroblasts. Taken together, our study reveals that Tollip differentially modulates HIF1α and STAT5 expression in fibroblasts, potentially explaining the complex and context-dependent contribution of Tollip to disease development."
https://openalex.org/W2809684929,"Kinetic studies of biological macromolecules increasingly use microfluidic mixers to initiate and monitor reaction progress. A motivation for using microfluidic mixers is to reduce sample consumption and decrease mixing time to microseconds. Some applications, such as small-angle x-ray scattering, also require large (>10 micron) sampling areas to ensure high signal-to-noise ratios and to minimize parasitic scattering. Chaotic to marginally turbulent mixers are well suited for these applications because this class of mixers provides a good middle ground between existing laminar and turbulent mixers. In this study, we model various chaotic to marginally turbulent mixing concepts such as flow turning, flow splitting, and vortex generation using computational fluid dynamics for optimization of mixing efficiency and observation volume. Design iterations show flow turning to be the best candidate for chaotic/marginally turbulent mixing. A qualitative experimental test is performed on the finalized design with mixing of 10 M urea and water to validate the flow turning unsteady mixing concept as a viable option for RNA and protein folding studies. A comparison of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and turbulence models suggests that the applicability of turbulence models to these flow regimes may be limited."
