https://openalex.org/W3014818461,"We provide results on the level of COVID-19 excess mortality in the Italian region of Lombardy and in the province of Bergamo using official and original data sources. Since February 2020 Lombardy and in particular the province of Bergamo have been severely hit by the novel COVID-19 infectious disease. Combining official statistics, retrospective data and original data (i.e., obituaries and death notices) we provide a tentative estimate of the number of deaths either directly or indirectly, associated with COVID-19 as well as the total number of persons infected. Our findings suggest that the reported number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 identified by public authorities accounts only for one half of the observed excess mortality between March 2020 and previous years."

These systems describe the cardiac action potential, that is the polarization/depolarization cycle occurring at every heart beat that models the time evolution of the electrical potential across the cell membrane, as well as a set of ionic variables. Multiple solutions of these systems, corresponding to different model inputs, are required to evaluate outputs of clinical interest, such as activation maps and action potential duration. More importantly, these models feature coherent structures that propagate over time, such as wavefronts. These systems can hardly be reduced to lower dimensional problems by conventional reduced order models (ROMs) such as, e.g., the reduced basis (RB) method. This is primarily due to the low regularity of the solution manifold (with respect to the problem parameters) as well as to the nonlinear nature of the input-output maps that we intend to reconstruct numerically. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper we propose a new, nonlinear approach which exploits deep learning (DL) algorithms to obtain accurate and efficient ROMs, whose dimensionality matches the number of system parameters. Our DL approach combines deep feedforward neural networks (NNs) and convolutional autoencoders (AEs). We show that the proposed DL-ROM framework can efficiently provide solutions to parametrized electrophysiology problems, thus enabling multi-scenario analysis in pathological cases. We investigate three challenging test cases in cardiac electrophysiology and prove that DL-ROM outperforms classical projection-based ROMs."
https://openalex.org/W3091285160,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic and is public health emergency of international concern. As of now, no registered therapies are available for treatment of coronavirus infection. The viral infection depends on the attachment of spike (S) glycoprotein to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have designed a protein inhibitor (ΔABP-D25Y) targeting S protein using computational approach. The inhibitor consists of two α helical peptides homologues to protease domain (PD) of ACE2. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the inhibitor binds exclusively at the ACE2 binding site of S protein. The computed binding affinity of the inhibitor is higher than the ACE2 and thus will likely out compete ACE2 for binding to S protein. Hence, the proposed inhibitor ΔABP-D25Y could be a potential blocker of S protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment."
https://openalex.org/W3089575494,"Scientific claims in biomedical research are typically derived from statistical analyses. However, misuse or misunderstanding of statistical procedures and results permeate the biomedical literature, affecting the validity of those claims. One approach journals have taken to address this issue is to enlist expert statistical reviewers. How many journals do this, how statistical review is incorporated, and how its value is perceived by editors is of interest. Here we report an expanded version of a survey conducted more than 20 years ago by Goodman and colleagues (1998) with the intention of characterizing contemporary statistical review policies at leading biomedical journals. We received eligible responses from 107 of 364 (28%) journals surveyed, across 57 fields, mostly from editors in chief. 34% (36/107) rarely or never use specialized statistical review, 34% (36/107) used it for 10-50% of their articles and 23% used it for all articles. These numbers have changed little since 1998 in spite of dramatically increased concern about research validity. The vast majority of editors regarded statistical review as having substantial incremental value beyond regular peer review and expressed comparatively little concern about the potential increase in reviewing time, cost, and difficulty identifying suitable statistical reviewers. Improved statistical education of researchers and different ways of employing statistical expertise are needed. Several proposals are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3089479299,"Brain metastasis (BM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in breast cancer (BC) and its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Transmigration of metastatic cells through the brain endothelium is an essential step in BM. Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) overexpression plays a key role in promoting trans-endothelial migration by degrading the inter-endothelial junctions and disrupting the endothelial integrity. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that induce MMP-1 in metastatic cells granting them a brain invasive phenotype. MiR-202-3p is downregulated in brain metastases compared to primary breast tumors and directly targets MMP-1. Here, we unraveled a critical role of miR-202-3p loss in MMP-1 upregulation promoting transmigration of metastatic cells through the brain endothelium.A variant of the MDA-MB-231 human BC cell line (MDA-MB-231-BrM2) selected for its propensity to form brain metastases was found to express high levels of MMP-1 and low levels of miR-202-3p compared to the parental cells. Using a gain-and-loss of function approach, we modulated levels of miR-202-3p and examined the resultant effect on MMP-1 expression. Effect of miR-202-3p modulation on integrity of the brain endothelium and the transmigrative ability of BC cells were also examined.Loss of miR-202-3p in breast cancer cells enhanced their transmigration through the brain endothelium by upregulating MMP-1 and disrupting the inter-endothelial junctions (claudin-5, ZO-1 and ß-catenin). Restoring miR-202-3p exerted a metastasis-suppressive effect and preserved the endothelial barrier integrity.Our study identified a critical regulatory role of miR-202-3p in brain metastasis and shed light on miR-202-3p/MMP-1 axis as a novel prognostic and therapeutic target that can be exploited to predict and prevent brain metastasis in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3090779497,"Predictive models are central to both archaeological research and cultural resource management. Yet, archaeological applications of predictive models are often insufficient due to small training data sets, inadequate statistical techniques, and a lack of theoretical insight to explain the responses of past land use to predictor variables. Here we address these critiques and evaluate the predictive power of four statistical approaches widely used in ecological modeling—generalized linear models, generalized additive models, maximum entropy, and random forests—to predict the locations of Formative Period (2100–650 BP) archaeological sites in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We assess each modeling approach using a threshold-independent measure, the area under the curve (AUC), and threshold-dependent measures, like the true skill statistic. We find that the majority of the modeling approaches struggle with archaeological datasets due to the frequent lack of true-absence locations, which violates model assumptions of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests, as well as measures of their predictive power (AUC). Maximum entropy is the only method tested here which is capable of utilizing pseudo-absence points (inferred absence data based on known presence data) and controlling for a non-representative sampling of the landscape, thus making maximum entropy the best modeling approach for common archaeological data when the goal is prediction. Regression-based approaches may be more applicable when prediction is not the goal, given their grounding in well-established statistical theory. Random forests, while the most powerful, is not applicable to archaeological data except in the rare case where true-absence data exist. Our results have significant implications for the application of predictive models by archaeologists for research and conservation purposes and highlight the importance of understanding model assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W3089652488,"In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a lack of dystrophin leads to extensive muscle weakness and atrophy that is linked to cellular metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress. This dystrophinopathy results in a loss of tethering between microtubules and the sarcolemma. Microtubules are also believed to regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics potentially by binding the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) and influencing permeability to ADP/ATP cycling. The objective of this investigation was to determine if a lack of dystrophin causes microtubule disorganization concurrent with mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle, and whether this relationship is linked to altered binding of tubulin to VDAC. In extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle from 4-week old D2.mdx mice, microtubule disorganization was observed when probing for α-tubulin. This cytoskeletal disorder was associated with a reduced ability of ADP to stimulate respiration and attenuate H2O2 emission relative to wildtype controls. However, this was not associated with altered α-tubulin-VDAC2 interactions. These findings reveal that microtubule disorganization in dystrophin-deficient EDL is associated with impaired ADP control of mitochondrial bioenergetics, and suggests that mechanisms alternative to α-tubulin’s regulation of VDAC2 should be examined to understand how cytoskeletal disruption in the absence of dystrophin may cause metabolic dysfunctions in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3090961733,"Objective Brighter Bites is a school-based health promotion program that delivers fresh produce and nutrition education to low-income children and families. Due to COVID-19-related school closures, states were under “shelter in place” orders, and Brighter Bites administered a rapid assessment survey to identify social needs among their families. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the methodology used to identify those with greatest social needs during this time (“high risk”), and to describe the response of Brighter Bites to these “high risk” families. Methods The rapid assessment survey was collected in April 2020 across Houston, Dallas, Washington DC, and Southwest Florida. The survey consisted of items on disruption of employment status, financial hardship, food insecurity, perceived health status and sociodemographics. The open-ended question “Please share your greatest concern at this time, or any other thoughts you would like to share with us.” was asked at the end of each survey to triage “high risk” families. Responses were then used to articulate a response to meet the needs of these high risk families. Results A total of 1048 families completed the COVID-19 rapid response survey, of which 71 families were triaged and classified as “high risk” (6.8% of survey respondents). During this time, 100% of the “high risk” participants reported being food insecure, 85% were concerned about their financial stability, 82% concerned about the availability of food, and 65% concerned about the affordability of food. A qualitative analysis of the high-risk group revealed four major themes: fear of contracting COVID19, disruption of employment status, financial hardship, and exacerbated food insecurity. In response, Brighter Bites pivoted, created, and deployed a framework to immediately address a variety of social needs among those in the “high risk” category. Administering a rapid response survey to identify the immediate needs of their families can help social service providers tailor their services to meet the needs of the most vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W3090043391,"In spite of the widespread use of electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes, and the proposed adverse cardiac effects of nicotine, the detrimental effects of e-cigarettes on the heart are not well known. This study examines the detrimental effects of e-cigarettes with nicotine at doses that yield circulating nicotine and cotinine in the ranges similar to the levels found in habitual smokers, and a high fat diet (HFD) on cardiac structure and function in a commonly used model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). C57BL/6J mice on an HFD were exposed to e-cigarette in the presence (2.4% nicotine) or absence (0% nicotine) of nicotine and saline aerosol for 12 weeks. Echocardiographic data demonstrated a decrease in left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening, LV ejection fraction, and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF) in mice treated with e-cigarette (2.4% nicotine) compared to e-cigarette (0% nicotine) or saline exposed mice. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) of mice treated with e-cigarette (2.4% nicotine) exhibited LV abnormalities, including lipid accumulation (ventricular steatosis), myofibrillar derangement and destruction, and mitochondrial hypertrophy, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. The detrimental effects of e-cigarettes (2.4% nicotine) on cardiac structure and function was accompanied by increased oxidative stress, plasma free fatty acid levels, CM apoptosis, and inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase and activation of its downstream target, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. Our results indicate profound adverse effects of e-cigarettes (2.4% nicotine) on the heart in obese mice and raise questions about the safety of the nicotine e-cigarettes use."
https://openalex.org/W3091559433,"Scalloped Hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) is an endangered species which its populations have been declining globally including in Indonesia, the world’s top shark fishing country. However, there is a lack of information on the recent population structure of this species to promote proper management and its conservation status. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and connectivity of the S. lewini population, in three major shark landing sites: Aceh (n = 41), Balikpapan (n = 30), and Lombok (n = 29). Meanwhile, additional sequences were retrieved from West Papua (n = 14) and the Western Indian Ocean (n = 65) populations. From the analyses of the mitochondrial CO1 gene, a total of 179 sequences of S. lewini, with an average size of 594 bp, and 40 polymorphic loci in four and eight haplotypes for the Indonesian population and the Western Indian Ocean population were identified. The overall values of genetic diversity were high (h = 0.717; π = 0.013), with the highest values recorded in Aceh (h = 0.668; π = 0.002) and the lowest in Papua (h = 0.143; π = 0.000). On the contrary, the overall value was fairly low in the Western Indian Ocean (h = 0.232; π = 0.001). Furthermore, AMOVA and FST showed three significant subdivisions in Indonesia (FST = 0.442; P < 0.001), with separated populations for Aceh and West Papua, and mixed between Balikpapan and Lombok (FST = 0.044; P = 0.091). In contrast, genetic homogeneity was observed within the population of the Western Indian Ocean (FST = –0.013; P = 0.612). The establishment of a haplotype network provided evidence of a significantly different population and a limited genetic distribution between the Indonesian and the Western Indian Ocean populations (FST = 0.740; P < 0.001). This study showed the presence of a complex population of S. lewini with limited connectivity only in Indonesia separated from the Western Indian Ocean and requiring specific management measures based on the population structure at the regional level."
https://openalex.org/W3091293742,"Objectives Gout is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis. To study the effects of regular physical activity and exercise intensity on inflammation and clinical outcome, we examined inflammatory pathogenesis in an acute model of murine gout and analyzed human gout patient clinical data as a function of physical activity. Methods NF-κB-luciferase reporter mice were organized into four groups and exercised at 0 m/min (non-exercise), 8 m/min (low-intensity), 11 m/min (moderate-intensity), and 15 m/min (high-intensity) for two weeks. Mice subsequently received intra-articular monosodium urate (MSU) crystal injections (0.5mg) and the inflammatory response was analyzed 15 hours later. Ankle swelling, NF-κB activity, histopathology, and tissue infiltration by macrophages and neutrophils were measured. Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 was quantified on peripheral monocytes/neutrophils by flow cytometry and both cytokines and chemokines were measured in serum or synovial aspirates. Clinical data and questionnaires accessing overall physical activity levels were collected from gout patients. Results Injection of MSU crystals produced a robust inflammatory response with increased ankle swelling, NF-κB activity, and synovial infiltration by macrophages and neutrophils. These effects were partially mitigated by low and moderate-intensity exercise. Furthermore, IL-1β was decreased at the site of MSU crystal injection, TLR2 expression on peripheral neutrophils was downregulated, and expression of CXCL1 in serum was suppressed with low and moderate-intensity exercise. Conversely, the high-intensity exercise group closely resembled the non-exercised control group by nearly all metrics of inflammation measured in this study. Physically active gout patients had significantly less flares/yr, decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and lower pain scores relative to physically inactive patients. Conclusions Regular, moderate physical activity can produce a quantifiable anti-inflammatory effect capable of partially mitigating the pathologic response induced by intra-articular MSU crystals by downregulating TLR2 expression on circulating neutrophils and suppressing systemic CXCL1. Low and moderate-intensity exercise produces this anti-inflammatory effect to varying degrees, while high-intensity exercise provides no significant difference in inflammation compared to non-exercising controls. Consistent with the animal model, gout patients with higher levels of physical activity have more favorable prognostic data. Collectively, these data suggest the need for further research and may be the foundation to a future paradigm-shift in conventional exercise recommendations provided by Rheumatologists to gout patients."
https://openalex.org/W3090208152,"Knowledge of continental shelf faunal biodiversity of Antarctica is patchy and as such, the ecology of this unique ecosystem is not fully understood. To this end, we deployed baited cameras at 20 locations along ~ 500 km of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) at depths from 90 to 797 m. We identified 111 unique taxa, with mud bottom accounting for 90% of the dominant (≥ 50% cover) habitat sampled. Amphipoda comprised 41% of the total maximum number of individuals per camera deployment (MaxN) and occurred on 75% of deployments. Excluding this taxon, the highest MaxN occurred around King George/25 de Mayo Island and was driven primarily by the abundance of krill (Euphausiidae), which accounted for 36% of total average MaxN among deployments around this island. In comparison, krill comprised 22% of total average MaxN at Deception Island and only 10% along the peninsula. Taxa richness, diversity, and evenness all increased with depth and depth explained 18.2% of the variation in community structure among locations, which may be explained by decreasing ice scour with depth. We identified a number of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem taxa, including habitat-forming species of cold-water corals and sponge fields. Channichthyidae was the most common fish family, occurring on 80% of all deployments. The Antarctic jonasfish (Notolepis coatsorum) was the most frequently encountered fish taxa, occurring on 70% of all deployments and comprising 25% of total MaxN among all deployments. Nototheniidae was the most numerically abundant fish family, accounting for 36% of total MaxN and was present on 70% of the deployments. The WAP is among the fastest warming regions on Earth and mitigating the impacts of warming, along with more direct impacts such as those from fishing, is critical in providing opportunities for species to adapt to environmental change and to preserve this unique ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3089346544,"Childhood maltreatment affects social functioning in the general adult population. However, how child abuse affects functional disability in adulthood remains unknown. Thus, we investigated the correlation between child abuse, depressive symptoms, cognitive complaints, and functional disability in adult community volunteers.Participants (N = 556) completed the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment, and Sheehan Disability Scale. Multiple regression analyses and structural equation modeling were performed to evaluate scale correlations.Structural equation modeling showed that the direct effect of childhood maltreatment on depressive symptoms, the indirect effect of childhood maltreatment on cognitive function via depressive symptoms, and the indirect effects of childhood maltreatment on functional disability via depressive symptoms and via cognitive function were all significant. The direct effects of childhood maltreatment on cognitive function and functional disability were not significant. There was no significant association between variables.Cross-sectional designs cannot identify causal relationships between parameters. Participants were adult volunteers from the community; therefore, results may not be generalizable to individuals with psychiatric disorders. Sociodemographic variability was a limitation because we used self-reported childhood maltreatment.Childhood maltreatment indirectly affects functional disability via depressive symptoms and via cognitive function through depressive symptoms. We suggest that depressive symptoms and cognitive function play crucial roles in the influence of childhood maltreatment on functional disability in adult community volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W3089806562,"Diabetes is a progressive disease, and thus, it is important to prevent diabetes at the prediabetes stage. Although the loss of muscle strength and prediabetes are associated, few studies have examined relative handgrip strength (RHGS), which can be an indicator of both muscle strength and adiposity. Therefore, our study aimed to examine the association between RHGS and prediabetes (HbA1c level >5.7%) stratified by sex due to sex differences in strength.We analyzed data from the 2016-2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Prediabetes was defined using the HbA1c cut-off level of 5.7-6.4%, identified by the American Diabetes Association. RHGS was calculated as the maximal absolute handgrip strength of both hands divided by body mass index and was divided into sex-specific quartiles. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between sex-specific RHGS and prediabetes.Among the total participants, 13,384 did not have diabetes. In men, the low and mid-low RHGS groups had increased odds of prediabetes (low group, odds ratio [OR]: 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.82; mid-low group, OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.67). However, no significant differences were observed between the corresponding female groups. Moreover, central obesity and lower RHGS were strongly associated with prediabetes in men (low group, OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.52-3.80; mid-low group, OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.26-3.17; mid-high group, OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.81), and a trend was observed (p = 0.0026).RHGS could be a practical and inexpensive tool for predicting diabetes in men. Programs aimed at preventing diabetes need to include exercise routines for improving muscle strength, and further research through longitudinal studies is required to investigate the causality of RHGS on the risk of prediabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3090705066,"Objectives To evaluate the effects of nonadherence to antiseizure medications (ASMs) and clinical characteristics on seizure control, we employed a prospective cohort cross-sectional study using self-reports and medical records of patients with epilepsy (PWEs). Methods Eight hundred and fifty-five PWEs taking ASMs were enrolled from fourteen collaborative outpatient clinics from January 2018 to March 2019. Questions from the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale were used as adherence self-reports. If a PWE’s questionnaire indicated that they had missed doses of their ASMs, outpatient physicians asked them directly about the details of their compliance, including the timing of intentionally or unintentionally missed doses. The association between lack of seizure control and utilization outcomes, such as missed doses, demographics, and clinical characteristics of the PWEs, were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Multivariate analysis revealed that forgetting to take ASMs was associated with lack of seizure control and the existence of focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Dementia, younger age, use of three or more antiepileptic agents, and living in a one-person household were associated with the risk of forgetting to take ASMs. Significance For PWEs with poor drug management or a high incidence of missed doses of ASMs, efforts to improve adherence could facilitate better seizure control and decrease focal to bilateral tonic–clonic propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3089345284,"Zika virus (ZIKV) exhibits a tropism for brain tumor cells and has been used as an oncolytic virus to target brain tumors in mice with modest effects on extending median survival. Recent studies have highlighted the potential for combining virotherapy and immunotherapy to target cancer. We postulated that ZIKV could be used as an adjuvant to enhance the long-term survival of mice with malignant glioblastoma and generate memory T-cells capable of providing long-term immunity against cancer remission. To test this hypothesis mice bearing malignant intracranial GL261 tumors were subcutaneously vaccinated with irradiated GL261 cells previously infected with the ZIKV. Mice also received intracranial injections of live ZIKV, irradiation attenuated ZIKV, or irradiated GL261 cells previously infected with ZIKV. Long-term survivors were rechallenged with a second intracranial tumor to examine their immune response and look for the establishment of protective memory T-cells. Mice with subcutaneous vaccination plus intracranial irradiation attenuated ZIKV or intracranial irradiated GL261 cells previously infected with ZIKV exhibited the greatest extensions to overall survival. Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells within the brains of long-term surviving mice after tumor rechallenge revealed an increase in the number of T-cells, including CD4+ and tissue-resident effector/ effector memory CD4+ T-cells, in comparison to long-term survivors that were mock-rechallenged, and in comparison to naïve untreated mice challenged with intracranial gliomas. These results suggest that ZIKV can serve as an adjuvant to subcutaneous tumor vaccines that enhance long-term survival and generate protective tissue-resident memory CD4+ T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W3090889172,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are becoming a major threat to public health, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The most common form of NDDs is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), boasting 60–70% share. Although some debates still exist, excessive aggregation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles has been deemed one of the major causes for the pathogenesis of AD. A growing number of evidences from studies, however, have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play a key role in the onset and progression of AD. Although scientists have had some understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, the disease still cannot be cured, with existing treatment only capable of providing a temporary relief at best, partly due to the obstacle of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The study was aimed to ascertain the neuroprotective effect of thermal cycle hyperthermia (TC-HT) against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Treating cells with this physical stimulation beforehand significantly improved the cell viability and decreased the ROS content. The underlying mechanisms may be due to the activation of Akt pathway and the downstream antioxidant and prosurvival proteins. The findings manifest significant potential of TC-HT in neuroprotection, via inhibition of oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. It is believed that coupled with the use of drugs or natural compounds, this methodology can be even more effective in treating NDDs."
https://openalex.org/W3091141471,"In this paper, we study the topological properties of the global supply chain network in terms of its degree distribution, clustering coefficient, degree-degree correlation, bow-tie structure, and community structure to test the efficient supply chain propositions proposed by E. J.S. Hearnshaw et al. The global supply chain data in the year 2017 are constructed by collecting various company data from the web site of Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ platform. The in- and out-degree distributions are characterized by a power law of the form of γin = 2.42 and γout = 2.11. The clustering coefficient decays with an exponent βk = 0.46. The nodal degree-degree correlations 〈knn(k)〉 indicates the absence of assortativity. The bow-tie structure of giant weakly connected component (GWCC) reveals that the OUT component is the largest and consists 41.1% of all firms. The giant strong connected component (GSCC) is comprised of 16.4% of all firms. We observe that upstream or downstream firms are located a few steps away from the GSCC. Furthermore, we uncover the community structures of the network and characterize them according to their location and industry classification. We observe that the largest community consists of the consumer discretionary sector based mainly in the United States (US). These firms belong to the OUT component in the bow-tie structure of the global supply chain network. Finally, we confirm the validity of Hearnshaw et al.’s efficient supply chain propositions, namely Proposition S1 (short path length), Proposition S2 (power-law degree distribution), Proposition S3 (high clustering coefficient), Proposition S4 (“fit-gets-richer” growth mechanism), Proposition S5 (truncation of power-law degree distribution), and Proposition S7 (community structure with overlapping boundaries) regarding the global supply chain network. While the original propositions S1 just mentioned a short path length, we found the short path from the GSCC to IN and OUT by analyzing the bow-tie structure. Therefore, the short path length in the bow-tie structure is a conceptual addition to the original propositions of Hearnshaw."
https://openalex.org/W3091170290,"The literature indicates that theatre and drama-based interventions have the potential to improve older adults’ well-being and health. The goal of the current study was to characterize the process of a creative group intervention in adult day centers (ADCs), which integrates playback theatre and life-review principles. Our objective was to provide an evidence-informed framework for drama therapy interventions, which would allow older adults to bring up and explore their life-stories in a dramatic creative process in their own community. A total of 27 participants ranging in age from 63 to 91, took part in one of three playback theatre groups. The playback theatre group intervention comprised 12 weekly sessions. All sessions were videotaped to capture the lived experience of the creative process and were analyzed in post-intervention interviews. In addition, focus group meetings were conducted with 13 ADC staff members to decipher further the effects of the participation as perceived by people outside the groups. Three types of potential transformation were identified in the qualitative analysis: the evolution of life stories, evolution of playfulness, and expansion of social engagement. The results indicate the potential of the integrative framework to serve as a creative intervention in ADC communities, as well as its potential to bring about a personal transformation and expand it to enable a person’s social engagement in the community. The findings imply the potential benefits of using playback theatre groups to supplement the routine care provided in ADCs."
https://openalex.org/W3091314449,"Environmental pollution and income inequality are important issues related to sustainable economic and social development. Air pollution affects residents' physical health, and income inequality affects social stability and economic development. No scholar has yet confirmed the causal impact of air pollution on income inequality; therefore, this study is an important extension of the environmental Kuznets curve theory. This article examines the impact using balanced panel data from 156 countries (2004-2017) and applies the spatial Durbin model to analyze the mechanism of air pollution's impact on income inequality from the perspective of public health. The results prove the following. First, increasing air pollution does increase income inequality. Second, the spatial spillover effect of air pollution constitutes a relatively important part of the total effect of air pollution on income inequality compared with the direct effect. Third, general government public-health expenditures are an important transmission channel by which air pollution affects income inequality. The conclusions of the research have some important policy implications for environmental governance and income distribution policies at the national as well as supranational level."
https://openalex.org/W3006719521,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows the analysis of biochemical processes non invasively and in vivo. Still, its application in clinical diagnostics is rare. Routine MRS is limited to spatial, chemical and temporal resolutions of cubic centimetres, mM and minutes. In fact, the signal of many metabolites is strong enough for detection, but the resonances significantly overlap, exacerbating identification and quantification. In addition, the signals of water and lipids are much stronger and dominate the entire spectrum. To suppress the background and isolate selected signals, usually, relaxation times, J-coupling and chemical shifts are used. Here, we propose methods to isolate the signals of selected molecular groups within endogenous metabolites by using long-lived spin states (LLS). We exemplify the method by preparing the LLSs of coupled protons in the endogenous molecules N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA). First, we store polarization in long-lived, double spin states and then apply saturation pulses and double quantum filters to suppress background signals. We show that LLS can be used to selectively prepare and measure the signals of chosen metabolites or drugs in the presence of water, inhomogeneous field and highly concentrated fatty solutions. The pH measurement presented here is one of the possible applications."
https://openalex.org/W3089663477,"Few studies provide an analysis of conservative two-stage revision of hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) and its impact on final outcome. A conservative revision is defined when soft tissues and bone quality enable the use of primary prosthetic components. Data of patients treated for chronic hip PJI who underwent two-stage revision between 2009 and 2016 and had a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were collected. Oxford Hip Score (OHS), Harris Hip Score (HHS) and radiological and microbiological data were retrieved and analysed. Clinical and functional outcome, survival, mortality, eradication, reinfection and re-revision rates within subgroups of patients with primary components and revision components are reported herein. A total of 148 patients underwent two-stage hip exchange with a mean follow-up of 55.6 ± 23.1 months and a mean age at surgery of 64.3 ± 12.7 years. Forty-four percent of patients underwent conservative revision. The mean HHS significantly improved from 40.6 ± 9.4 points to the final value of 87.8 ± 10.5 points (p = .002), and the mean OHS went from 20.3 ± 3.8 points to 40.3 ± 5. points (p< .001). Patients who were treated with primary components or isolated revision stems in the second stage had a significant reduction in surgical times (p< .001). The mortality rate for all causes of death was 6.8%, the eradication rate was 89.9%, the reinfection rate was 4.7% and the reoperation rate was 7.4% without differences between conservative and non-conservative revisions. Two-stage exchange arthroplasty for total hip arthroplasty (THA) PJI is a good strategy that provides satisfactory results, high eradication rates and no further need for revision. The conservative two-stage revision in patients with adequate bone stock represents a feasible option with good results and survival rates."
https://openalex.org/W3089905444,"Introduction Oncogenic mutation within the KRAS gene represents a negative predictor for treatment response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with colorectal cancer. Recently, we have shown no relevant heterogeneity for KRAS mutation status within and between pre- and posttherapeutic samples from the primary tumor in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intertumoral heterogeneity of KRAS mutation status between the primary tumor and the corresponding metastasis or local recurrence in the similar cohort and to evaluate the ideal representative tissue for KRAS mutation testing. Materials and methods KRAS mutation status was analyzed from 47 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, which were enrolled in the CAO/ARO/AIO-94 or CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial. Mutations in KRAS codons 12, 13, and 61 were analyzed by using the KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (therascreen® KRAS test). Six patients needed to be excluded due to incomplete follow up data. 11 patients showed a relapse of the disease during the follow up presented by distant metastases or local recurrence. DNA from representative areas of metastatic tissue was obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Results The mean patient age was 64.13 ± 10.64 years. In total, 19 patients showed a KRAS mutation (46.34%) in the primary tumor. Of the eleven patients with a metastatic disease or local recurrence, five patients showed a KRAS mutation whereas six patients had a KRAS wildtype status. Metastatic localizations included the liver (n = 2), lung (n = 4), local recurrence (n = 1), liver + lung (n = 3), lung + local recurrence (n = 1). For these eleven patients with paired data available for the primary tumor and metastatic tissue, a significant KRAS mutation status concordance was detected in 81.18% (9/11) of the patients (p = 0.03271). Only two patients showed intertumoral heterogeneity, which harbored in one patient a KRAS G12C mutation status in the primary tumor, but a G12V KRAS mutation status in the corresponding lung lesion, and in the other patient a G12A mutation in the primary lesion and a WT in the lung metastasis. Conclusions We show a significant concordance of the KRAS mutation status between tumor samples obtained from the primary tumor and the corresponding metastasis and/ or local recurrence in patients with rectal cancer indicating no relevant intertumoral heterogeneity. Our data suggest that sampling either the primary (pre- or posttherapeutical tumor tissue) or metastatic lesion may be valid for the initial evaluation of KRAS mutation status predicting the response to anti-EGFR treatment and guiding clinical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3090087660,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the cardiac motion artifact that regularly appears in diffusion-weighted imaging of the left liver lobe might be reduced by acquiring images in inspiration, when the coupling between heart and liver might be minimal. Materials and methods 43 patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions were examined at 1.5 T with breath hold acquisition, once in inspiration and once in expiration. Data were acquired with a diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence and two b-values (b50 = 50 s/mm² and b800 = 800 s/mm²). The severity of the cardiac motion artifact in the left liver lobe was rated by two experienced radiologists for both b-values with a 5 point Likert scale. Additionally, the normalized signal S(b800)/S(b50) in the left liver lobe was computed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used comparing the scores of the two readers obtained in inspiration and expiration, and to compare the normalized signal in inspiration and expiration. Results The normalized signal in inspiration was slightly higher than in expiration (0.349±0.077 vs 0.336±0.058), which would indicate a slight reduction of the cardiac motion artifact, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.24). In the qualitative evaluation, the readers did not observe a significant difference for b50 (reader 1: p = 0.61; reader 2: p = 0.18). For b800, reader 1 observed a significant difference of small effect size favouring expiration (p = 0.03 with a difference of mean Likert scores of 0.27), while reader 2 observed no significant difference (p = 0.62). Conclusion Acquiring the data in inspiration does not lead to a markedly reduced cardiac motion artifact in diffusion-weighted imaging of the left liver lobe and is in this regard not to be preferred over acquiring the data in expiration."
https://openalex.org/W3090142778,"Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) is precancerous lesion of gastric cancer related to H. pylori infection. There has been limited data about IM and associated risk factors. This study aimed to determine risk factors related to development of IM to guide proper management.1,370 patients undergoing UGI endoscopy at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand were included between January 2018-August 2019. Patients' data including baseline characteristics, laboratory results, and histopathology from medical database were extensively reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 expression from gastric biopsies was also performed.Overall H. pylori prevalence was 43.8%. Mean age was 60.7 years and 45% of whom were males. Chronic gastritis was observed in 1,064(77.7%) patients, while 223(16.3%) had IM. Of 223 patients with IM, 194(87%) patients had complete IM, while 29 (13%) had incomplete IM. In groups of complete and incomplete IM, current H. pylori infection rates were 66.5% and 58.6%, respectively. The BMI of incomplete IM group(27.4) was significantly higher than BMI of complete IM group (23.6). Overweight and obese patients (BMI ≥23 kg/m2) were significantly associated with higher risk for the development of incomplete IM (OR 3.25; 95%CI 1.14-9.27, p = 0.027). Males, age >50 years, and current H. pylori infection were significantly higher in IM than chronic gastritis group with OR 1.43 (95%CI 1.01-2.03, p = 0.048), OR 1.67 (95% CI 1.08-2.57, p = 0.021), and OR 3.14 (95% CI 2.29-4.30, p<0.001), respectively. During 20 months of study, there were 15 patients (1.1%) diagnosed with gastric cancer and 1-year survival rate was only 60%.Males, age >50 years, and current H. pylori infection are significant predictors for the presence of intestinal metaplasia. BMI might be beneficial for using as a predictive risk factor to reduce the development of incomplete intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori eradication could be an effective way to prevent the development of gastric precancerous lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3090455758,"In recent decades, several studies have emphasized sense of personal control as a prominent aspect of Aboriginal health. However, one limitation is that instruments available to measure personal control were originally developed in western countries and validation for Aboriginal Australians has not been conducted. The aims of the current study were to evaluate whether the Sense of Personal Control Scale (SPCS) can be used to obtain culturally unbiased measurement of personal control across Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and to assess the psychometric properties of the SPCS for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australian. Methods: The current study utilized two Australian subsamples retrieved from the Teeth Talk Study (n = 317) and the National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004–2006 (n = 3,857) in which the SPCS was included. Graphical Loglinear Rasch Models (GLLRM) were used to fulfill the aims of the study. Results: The Perceived Constraints subscale fitted a GLLRM for Aboriginal Australians after the exclusion of three items, while fit to any Rasch model (RM) or GLLRM model could not be found in the non-Aboriginal sample. The Mastery subscale fitted a GLLRM in the non-Aboriginal sample after the exclusion of one item. In the Aboriginal sample, two items of the Mastery subscale fitted the RM, however, two items cannot be considered as a scale. Conclusion: In the present study, we showed that the development of new items is crucial before the revised SPCS might constitute a valid and reliable measure of sense of personal control in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australian populations, and it is possible to assess whether the SPCS can be measured without bias across these two populations."
https://openalex.org/W3091061391,"Human Fortilin, an antiapoptotic protein, has also been implicated in several diseases; however, several potential uses of fortilin have also been proposed. Bearing the implications of fortilin in mind, fortilin analog, which has no complication with diseases, is required. Since a recombinant full-length fortilin from Fenneropenaeus merguiensis (rFm-Fortilin (FL)) reported only 44% (3e-27) homologous to human fortilin, therefore the biological activities of the Fm-Fortilin (FL) and its fragments (F2, F12, and F23) were investigated for potential use against HEMA toxicity from filling cement to pulp cell. The rFm-Fortilin FL, F2, 12, and F23 were expressed and assayed for proliferation activity. The rFm-Fortilin (FL) showed proliferation activity on human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) and protected the cells from 2-hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate (HEMA) at 1–20 ng/ml. In contrast, none of the rFm-Fortilin fragments promoted HDPC growth that may be due to a lack of three conserved amino acid residues together for binding with the surface of Rab GTPase for proliferative activity. In addition, rFm-Fortilin (FL) activated mineralization and trend to suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines, including histamine (at 10 ng/ml) and TNF-α (at 100 ng/ml). Besides, the rFm-Fortilin (FL) did not mutate the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell. Therefore, the rFm-Fortilin (FL) has the potential use as a supplementary medical material to promote cell proliferation in patients suffering severe tooth decay and other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3090817945,"Climate change is a serious threat to biodiversity; it is therefore important to understand how animals will react to this stress. Ectotherms, such as ants, are especially sensitive to the climate as the environmental temperature influences myriad aspects of their biology, from optimal foraging time to developmental rate. In this study, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis to identify stress-induced genes in the winter ant (Prenolepis imparis). We quantified gene expression during heat and cold stress relative to a control temperature. From each of our conditions, we sequenced the transcriptome of three individuals. Our de novo assembly included 13,324 contigs that were annotated against the nr and SwissProt databases. We performed gene ontology and enrichment analyses to gain insight into the physiological processes involved in the stress response. We identified a total of 643 differentially expressed genes across both treatments. Of these, only seven genes were differentially expressed in the cold-stressed ants, which could indicate that the temperature we chose for trials did not induce a strong stress response, perhaps due to the cold adaptations of this species. Conversely, we found a strong response to heat: 426 upregulated genes and 210 downregulated genes. Of these, ten were expressed at a greater than ten-fold change relative to the control. The transcripts we could identify included those encoding for protein folding genes, heat shock proteins, histones, and Ca2+ ion transport. One of these transcripts, hsc70-4L was found to be under positive selection. We also characterized the functional categories of differentially expressed genes. These candidate genes may be functionally conserved and relevant for related species that will deal with rapid climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3091254898,"To deter the performance of illegal driving behaviours, traffic infringement notices may be issued. Whilst there is a substantial body of research that has examined rates of reoffending following a traffic infringement, there have been few studies examining the length of time to next traffic offence. Where this research has been conducted, the findings do not provide current understandings, given the substantial changes in traffic sanctioning over time. The aim of this study was to address this gap, by examining risk factors for recidivism following a driver receiving a traffic infringement notice, as well as the time to next traffic offence. Licensing and infringements data held in the Driver Licensing System (DLS), maintained by the road authority in Victoria, Australia were used. All drivers included in the study were born prior to 1975, and received their first Victorian drivers licence between 1994 and 2016. Data from 203,620 drivers were used. Cox proportional hazards modelling was undertaken to examine factors associated with recidivism within 12 months of receiving a traffic infringement. 131,691 (64.7%) drivers had received at least one traffic infringement in Victoria, Australia since receiving their Victorian driver’s licence. Factors found to be associated with longer time to further traffic offending in the year that followed the first infringement included being female; receiving a first Victorian driver’s licence when aged 45+ years; and being licenced 10+ years. Traffic infringements deter some groups of Victorian drivers, but not others. If drivers are to be deterred from further illegal driving behaviour, it is important other countermeasures are developed and trialled."

Different research fields are trying to understand the cycle of violence, such as the psychological field, to understand how these women's relational patterns and intrapsychic conflict function in the cycle of violence.To investigate the operationalized psychodynamic diagnosis of women victims of domestic violence, exploring the severity and experience of violence, structural functions, dysfunctional interpersonal patterns, and intrapsychic conflicts.We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative study using the OPD-2 Clinical Interviews, which were recorded and transcribed. The sample was composed by 56 women victims of domestic violence, mean age 30.07 (SD = ±9.65). Reliability was satisfactory for judges interviews(k>0,6).According to the OPD-2 evaluation, we found that the severity of the violence was associated with the intensity of women's subjective suffering. In the relational pattern, they stay in the relationship, leaving themselves vulnerable; perceive the partner as controlling, aggressive, offensive, and fear abandonment. As a defensive mechanism to relational discomfort and suffering victims anticipate the aggressor's desire, resulting in submissive behavior. The main psychic conflict was the ""need for care versus self-sufficiency"" (78.6%). And medium was the predominant structure level, in which they presented insecure internal objects, presenting difficulties in emotional regulation and perceiving reality in a distorted way. Hence, they do not recognize their limitations and needs. We found that 78.6% of the cases had some psychiatric disorder: MDD, PTSD.This study provides empirical evidence on clinical observations on the psychological functioning of this population and the issues that make up the maintenance of domestic violence against women. The understanding of internalized patterns, structural functions, and motivational tensions are fundamental for the prevention of re-victimization and improving coping mechanisms, as well as promoting greater adherence to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3091666582,"This paper studies the spatial and time series patterns of religious liberty across countries and estimates its effect on measures of human flourishing. First, while there are significant cross-country differences in religious liberty, it has declined in the past decade across countries, particularly among countries that rank higher in economic freedom. Second, countries with greater religious liberty nonetheless exhibit greater levels of economic freedom, particularly property rights. Third, using micro-data across over 150 countries in the world between 2006 and 2018, increases in religious freedom are associated with robust increases in measures of human flourishing even after controlling for time-invariant characteristics across space and time and a wide array of time-varying country-specific factors, such as economic activity and institutional quality. Fourth, these improvements in well-being are primarily driven by improvements in civil liberties, such as women empowerment and freedom of expression."
https://openalex.org/W3089360927,"C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a pivotal enhancer of endochondral bone growth and is expected to be a therapeutic reagent for impaired skeletal growth. Although we showed that CNP stimulates bone growth as a local regulator in the growth plate via the autocrine/paracrine system, CNP is abundantly produced in other various tissues and its blood concentration is reported to correlate positively with growth velocity. Therefore we investigated the systemic regulation of CNP levels using rodent models. In order to examine whether CNP undergoes systemic feedback regulation, we investigated blood CNP levels and local CNP expression in various tissues, including cartilage, of 4-week-old rats after systemic administration of sufficient amounts of exogenous CNP (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 3 days. This CNP administration did not alter blood NT-proCNP levels in male rats but decreased mRNA expression only in tissue that included cartilage. Decrease in expression and blood NT-proCNP were greater in female rats. To analyze the existence of direct autoregulation of CNP in the periphery as an autocrine/paracrine system, we estimated the effect of exogenous supplementation of CNP on the expression of endogenous CNP itself in the growth plate cartilage of extracted fetal murine tibias and in ATDC5, a chondrogenic cell line. We found no alteration of endogenous CNP expression after incubation with adequate concentrations of exogenous CNP for 4 and 24 hours, which were chosen to observe primary and later transcriptional effects, respectively. These results indicate that CNP is not directly autoregulated but indirectly autoregulated in cartilage tissue. A feedback system is crucial for homeostatic regulation and further studies are needed to elucidate the regulatory system of CNP production and function."
https://openalex.org/W3090193112,"It is shown that the statistical properties of connections between regions of the brain and their dependence on coarse-graining and thresholding in published data can be reproduced by a simple distance-based physical connectivity model. This allows studies with differing parcellation and thresholding to be interrelated objectively, and for the results of future studies on more finely grained or differently thresholded networks to be predicted. As examples of the implications, it is shown that the dependences of network measures on thresholding and parcellation imply that chosen brain regions can appear to form a small world network, even though the network at finer scales, or ultimately of individual neurons, may not be small world networks themselves."

https://openalex.org/W3090861947,"Objectives The study was designed to evaluate the tissue expression of NRP-1 and serum level of sNRP-1 in the same patients with intraepithelial laryngeal lesions or early staged laryngeal cancer to identify the clinical significance of these biomarkers in the diagnosis of laryngeal lesions. Material and methods A prospective analysis of tissue was performed on specimens and blood samples from 49 patients, who were admitted for surgical resection due to suspicious vocal fold lesions and were diagnosed as non-dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and invasive cancers. Results ELISA was conducted on 48 blood samples. The minimum level of sNRP-1 was 0.15 ng/ml and maximum– 37.71 ng/ml. The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance revealed no differences in sNRP-1 levels between different histopathological stages of vocal fold lesions (p = 0.234). IHC was conducted in 49 tissue samples. The evaluated mean scores of NRP-1 tissue expression were compared to histopathological stage of the lesion. The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance revealed no differences in NRP-1 tissue expression between different histopathological stages of vocal fold lesions (p = 0.536). The correlation of tissue NRP-1 expression and serum levels of NRP-1 within analyzed group was insignificant. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was 0.076 (p = 0.606). Conclusions The NRP-1 tissue expression and serum levels are unlikely to be a prognostic factor for identification of laryngeal dysplasia or early stage laryngeal cancer. Further studies investigating biomolecules involved in laryngeal carcinogenesis are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3089623955,"The dilution effect can occur by a range of mechanisms and results in reduced parasite prevalence in host taxa. In invaded ecosystems, the dilution effect can benefit native species if non-native species, acting as resistant or less competent hosts, reduce rates of parasitic infections in native species. In field experiments, we assessed whether manipulating biomass of the non-native snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, caused a dilution effect by reducing trematode infections in three taxa of native snails. In contrast to many studies showing resistant or less competent non-native hosts can “dilute” or reduce infection rates, we found no evidence for a dilution effect reducing infection rates of any of the native snails. We suggest that a dilution effect may not have occurred because most trematode taxa are highly host specific, and thus the trematode transmission stages did not recognize the invasive snail as a possible host. In this case, community composition appears to be important in influencing the dilution effect."
https://openalex.org/W3089991156,"Styrene in indoor air can adversely affect human health. In this study, styrene monomer and other chemical emission fluxes for products containing expanded polystyrene beads (pillows, cushions, and soft toys) were measured at various temperatures to simulate typical product use. The contributions of the products to styrene and other chemical concentrations in indoor air and human exposure to these chemicals were estimated, and health risk assessments were performed. The styrene monomer emission fluxes for the samples at 25°C were between 25.3 and 8.73×103 μg/(m2 h). The styrene emission fluxes for the product surfaces increased strongly as the temperature increased, from between 124 and 2.44×104 μg/(m2 h) at 36°C (simulating human body temperature) to between 474 and 4.59×104 μg/(m2 h) at 50°C (simulating inside an automobile in summer). The hexane, heptane, toluene, octane, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene, and dodecane emission fluxes at 25°C for the sample that emitted the analytes most readily were high. The maximum estimated styrene and xylene concentrations in indoor air caused by emissions from expanded polystyrene beads at 36°C in a bedroom and automobile were higher than the relevant guidelines. The maximum contribution of a product containing expanded polystyrene beads in a living room, bedroom, or automobile could cause the total volatile organic compound concentration in air to exceed the advisable value (400 μg/m3). The estimated maximum hazard quotients for styrene, toluene, and xylene emitted by a product containing expanded polystyrene beads at 36°C in a bedroom were 0.59, 0.30, and 0.37, respectively. These non-carcinogenic risk values for single products could contribute to the non-carcinogenic risk thresholds being exceeded when multiple products and other sources of chemicals are taken into consideration. The estimated styrene concentrations suggest that products containing expanded polystyrene beads are important sources of styrene to indoor air."

Despite this, most research in the health care sector has focused on secondary care settings, but has not addressed practice assistants in primary care. Knowledge about practice assistants' workplace-related stressors and resources is particularly scarce. This cross-sectional study addresses the mental workload of practice assistants working in primary care practices.Practice assistants from a network of 185 German primary care practices were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. The standardized `Short Questionnaire for Workplace Analysis' (German: Kurzfragebogen zur Arbeitsanalyse) was used to assess practice assistants´ mental workload. It addresses eleven workplace factors in 26 items: versatility, completeness of task, scope of action, social support, cooperation, qualitative work demands, quantitative work demands, work disruptions, workplace environment, information and participation, and benefits. Sociodemographic and work characteristics were also obtained. A descriptive analysis was performed for sociodemographic data and ""Short Questionnaire for Workplace Analysis"" factors. The one-sided t-test and Cohen´s d were calculated for a comparison with data from 23 professional groups (n = 8,121).A total of 550 practice assistants from 130 practices participated. The majority of practice assistants was female (99.3%) and worked full-time (66.5%) in group practices (50.6%). Compared to the other professional groups, practice assistants reported higher values for the factor social support (4.0 versus 3.7 [d 0.44; p<0.001]), information and participation (3.6 versus 3.3 [d 0.38; p<0.001] as well as work disruptions (2.7 vs. 2.4 [d 0.42; p<0.001]), while practice assistants showed lower values regarding scope of action (3.4 versus 3.8 [d 0.43; p<0.001]).Our study identified social support and participation within primary care practices as protective factors for mental workload, while work disruptions and scope of action were perceived as stressors."
https://openalex.org/W3090217774,"Background Swingers, heterosexuals who, as couples, practice mate swapping or group sex with other couples or heterosexual singles, are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess changes in sexual behaviour and STI testing behaviour, as well as predictors of STI testing. Methods Two cross-sectional studies were performed, using the same internet survey in 2011 and 2018. For trend analysis, sexual behaviour and STI testing behaviour were used. Socio-demographics, swinger characteristics, sexual behaviour, and psycho-social variables were used to assess predictors of STI testing in the past year, using multivariable regression analysis. Results A total of 1173 participants completed the survey in 2011, and 1005 in 2018. Condom use decreased for vaginal (73% vs. 60%), oral (5% vs. 2%), and anal sex (85% vs. 75%). STI positivity was reported in 23% and 30% of the participants, respectively, although testing for STI was comparable between both years (~65%). The following predictors of STI testing were significant: being female (OR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.2–2.9), having a high swinging frequency (>12 times a year, OR = 3.7, 95%CI: 1.9–7.3), swinging at home (OR = 1.6, 95%CI: 1.0–2.7), receiving a partner notification (OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2–2.6), considering STI testing important (OR = 4.3, 95%CI: 2.2–8.5), experiencing no pressure from a partner to test (OR = 0.6, 95%CI: 0.3–0.9), partners test for STI regularly (OR = 10.0, 95%CI: 6.2–15.9), perceiving STI testing as an obligation (OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.3–3.5), experiencing no barriers such as being afraid of testing (OR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.2–3.1), limited opening hours (OR = 1.6, 95%CI: 1.0–2.4), and forgetting to plan appointments (OR = 3.0, 95%CI: 2.0–4.6). Conclusions Swingers exhibit self-selection for STI testing based on their sexual behaviour. However, STI prevention efforts are still important considering the increasing numbers of reported STIs, the decreased use of condom use, and the one-third of swingers who were not tested in the previous year."

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in a Danish neuro-intensive step-down unit (NISU) specialising in early neurorehabilitation, we found that negotiation of futures takes place in the modern ICU in the present by strategically building upon past experiences. We have argued that the clinical programme therefore cannot be understood only from a “here and now perspective”, since the early neurorehabilitation practice is embedded in overlapping temporalities of the past, the present, and desired futures. The study discusses the underlying logics—often hidden or unnoticed—that impact clinical practice of early neurorehabilitation, in what we have termed a logic of clinical reenactment, a logic of future negotiation and a logic of paradox."

Molecular endoscopic imaging (MEI) using nanoparticles (NPs), coupled with fluorescently labeled antibody permits visualization of disease-specific molecular alterations. The aim of this ex vivo study was to assess the diagnostic applicability of MEI with NPs to detect Barrett's metaplasia.Seven patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance of known Barrett's esophagus were recruited. Freshly resected biopsy specimens were incubated with NPs coupled with FITC labeled Muc-2 antibodies and examined with MEI. Fluorescence intensity from Barrett's mucosa and control specimens were compared, followed by histological confirmation.Fluorescence signals, indicating the presence of goblet cells, were noted for traditional MEI using Muc-2 antibodies in Barrett's intestinal metaplasia. Significantly stronger fluorescence signals were achieved with NPs coupled with FITC-conjugated Muc-2 antibodies. The results of MEI with NPs for the prediction of Barrett's metaplasia correlated with the final histopathological examination in all the cases.Highly-specific NPs detected Barrett's metaplasia more efficiently than conventional MEI in this first feasibility study. MEI was as effective as standard histopathology for identifying Muc-2 containing goblet cells for diagnosis of Barrett's metaplasia. (DRKS-ID: DRKS00017747)."
https://openalex.org/W3090951390,"Theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that individual differences in infant visual attention correlate with variations in cognitive skills later in childhood. Here we tested this hypothesis in infants from rural Malawi (n = 198-377, depending on analysis), who were assessed with eye tracking tests of visual orienting, anticipatory looks, and attention to faces at 9 months, and more conventional tests of cognitive control (A-not-B), motor, language, and socioemotional development at 18 months. The results showed no associations between measures of infant attention at 9 months and cognitive skills at 18 months, either in analyses linking infant visual orienting with broad cognitive outcomes or analyses linking specific constructs between the two time points (i.e., switching of anticipatory looks and manual reaching responses), as correlations varied between -0.08 and 0.14. Measures of physical growth, and family socioeconomic characteristics were also not correlated with cognitive outcomes at 18 months in the current sample (correlations between -0.10 and 0.19). The results do not support the use of the current tests of infant visual attention as a predictive tool for 18-month-old infants' cognitive skills in the Malawian setting. The results are discussed in light of the potential limitations of the employed infant tests as well as potentially unique characteristics of early cognitive development in low-resource settings."

The average density of ganglion cells was 351.822 ± 31.434 GC/mm2. The peccary shows a well-developed visual streak. The average peak density was 6,767 GC/mm2 and located within the visual range and displaced temporally as an area temporalis. Displaced amacrine cells have an average density of 300 DAC/mm2, but the density was not homogeneous along the retina, closer to the center of the retina the number of cells decreases and when approaching the periphery the density increases, in addition, amacrine cells do not form retinal specialization like ganglion cells. Outside the area temporalis, amacrine cells reach up to 80% in the ganglion cell layer. However, in the region of the area temporalis, the proportion of amacrine cells drops to 32%. Thus, three retinal specializations were found in peccary’s retina by ganglion cells: visual streak, area temporalis and dorsotemporal extension. The topography of the ganglion cells layer in the retina of the peccary resembles other species of Order Artiodactyla already described and is directly related to its evolutionary history and ecology of the species."
https://openalex.org/W3089486762,"To prevent gastric cancer, it is important to accurately determine the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. However, correctly identifying HP-uninfected individuals is difficult when using the combination of HP antibody and pepsinogen (PG).The aim of this study was to discriminate true HP-uninfected individuals from others without the need for endoscopic examination.A total of 684 subjects with no history of HP eradication who underwent a medical checkup at our hospital were enrolled. The ""true uninfected individuals"" were determined by a negative stool antigen test and no endoscopic findings of HP-associated gastritis. HP antibody was measured by the latex immunoassay method. Logistic regression analysis using a combination of noninvasive parameters was performed to develop a formula for predicting true uninfected individuals.A total of 528 subjects were classified as true uninfected individuals. Logistic regression analysis showed that statistically significant factors for true uninfected individuals were age (p < 0.001), HP antibody (p <0.001), PGI (p <0.001), and PGII (p = 0.012). The areas under the curve (AUCs) for true uninfected individuals were the highest (0.944) upon applying the prediction formula including four parameters: age, HP antibody, PGI, and PGII. Both the sensitivity and the specificity of the four-parameter prediction formula were higher than those of the traditional three-parameter model using HP antibody, PGI, and PGI/II ratio (sensitivity: 93.2% vs. 86.6% and specificity: 88.5% vs. 82.7%).Our findings suggest that a model with a combination of four noninvasive parameters is useful for predicting true HP-uninfected individuals without the need for endoscopic examination."
https://openalex.org/W3089547495,"Migratory organisms have their own life histories that efficiently link multiple ecosystems. Therefore, comprehensive understanding of migration ecologies of these organisms is essential for both species conservation and ecosystem management. However, monitoring migration at fine spatiotemporal scales, especially in open marine systems, often requires huge costs and effort. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques that utilize DNA released from living organisms into their environment became available for monitoring wild animals without direct handling. In this study, we conducted an eDNA survey for understanding marine migration of an endemic fish species, Shishamo smelt (Spirinchus lanceolatus). We examined 1) seasonal habitat changes in coastal regions and 2) environmental factors potentially driving the migration of this species. The eDNA concentrations along a 100 km-long coastline exhibited spatiotemporal variation, suggesting that this species shifts their habitat away from nearshore areas between spring and summer. We also found a significantly negative association between the eDNA concentration and sea surface temperature. That finding suggests that the offshore migration of this species is associated with increased sea surface temperature. This study reveals new aspects of S. lanceolatus life history in coastal regions. Together with our previous eDNA study on the freshwater migration of S. lanceolatus, this study illustrates the potential of eDNA techniques for understanding the whole life history of this migratory species."
https://openalex.org/W3090201104,"Random-variable-valued measurements (RVVMs) are proposed as a new framework for treating measurement processes that generate non-deterministic sample data. They operate by assigning a probability measure to each observed sample instantiation of a global measurement process for some particular random quantity of interest, thus allowing for the explicit quantification of response process error. Common methodologies to date treat only measurement processes that generate fixed values for each sample unit, thus generating full (though possibly inaccurate) information on the random quantity of interest. However, many applied research situations in the non-experimental sciences naturally contain response process error, e.g. when psychologists assess patient agreement with various diagnostic survey items or when conservation biologists perform formal assessments to classify species-at-risk. Ignoring the sample-unit-level uncertainty of response process error in such measurement processes can greatly compromise the quality of resulting inferences. In this paper, a general theory of RVVMs is proposed to handle response process error, and several applications are considered."
https://openalex.org/W3090558337,"Open irrigation ablation catheters are now the standard in radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF). Among various irrigation catheters, laser-cut slit-based irrigation system (Cool Flex and FlexAbility) has a unique design to cool the catheter tip more efficiently. We aimed to assess the safety of slit-based irrigation catheters regarding prevention of procedure-related ischemic complication in AF patients undergoing RFCA. The analysis was performed with Korea University Medicine Anam Hospital RFCA registry. Procedure-related ischemic complication was defined as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurring within 30 days after RFCA. Patients were divided into 3 groups: non-irrigation, hole-based irrigation, and slit-based irrigation catheter groups. A total of 3,120 AF patients underwent first RFCA. Non-irrigation, non-slit-based irrigation, and slit-based irrigation catheters were used in 290, 1,539, and 1,291 patients, respectively. As compared with non-irrigation and non-slit-based irrigation catheter groups, slit-based irrigation catheter group had significantly older age, higher prevalence of non-paroxysmal AF, large left atrial size, and decreased left atrial appendage flow velocity. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was not different among the 3 groups. Procedure-related ischemic complication occurred in 17 patients (0.54%) with 16 ischemic strokes and 1 TIA event: 5/290 (1.72%), 11/1,539 (0.71%), and 1/1,291 (0.08%) events in non-irrigation, non-slit-based irrigation, and slit-based irrigation catheter groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Slit-based irrigation catheter was superior in direct comparison with non-slit-based irrigation catheter (0.71% vs. 0.08%; p = 0.009). Slit-based irrigation catheters were highly effective in preventing procedure-related ischemic complications."
https://openalex.org/W3090642553,"Prognostication after cardiac arrest (CA) needs a multimodal approach, but the optimal method is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neuroimaging could improve outcome prediction after CA treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).A retrospective observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent at least one NSE measurement between 48 and 72 hr; received both a brain computed tomography (CT) scan within 24 hr and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within 7 days after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); and were treated with TTM after out-of-hospital CA between 2009 and 2017 at the Seoul St. Mary's Hospital in Korea. The primary outcome was a poor neurological outcome at 6 months after CA, defined as a cerebral performance category of 3-5.A total of 109 subjects underwent all three tests and were ultimately included in this study. Thirty-four subjects (31.2%) experienced good neurological outcomes at 6 months after CA. The gray matter to white matter attenuation ratio (GWR) was weakly correlated with the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), PV400 and NSE (Spearman's rho: 0.359, -0.362 and -0.263, respectively). NSE was strongly correlated with the mean ADC and PV400 (Spearman's rho: -0.623 and 0.666, respectively). Serum NSE had the highest predictive value among the single parameters (area under the curve (AUC) 0.912, sensitivity 70.7% for maintaining 100% specificity). The combination of a DWI parameter (mean ADC or PV400) and NSE had better prognostic performance than the combination of the CT parameter (GWR) and NSE. The addition of the GWR to a DWI parameter and NSE did not improve the prediction of neurological outcomes.The GWR (≤ 24 hr) is weakly correlated with the mean ADC (≤ 7 days) and NSE (highest between 48 and 72 hr). The combination of a DWI parameter and NSE has better prognostic performance than the combination of the GWR and NSE. The addition of the GWR to a DWI parameter and NSE does not improve the prediction of neurological outcomes after CA treatment with TTM."
https://openalex.org/W3089417962,"Soil sealing increases surface runoff in a watershed and decreases infiltration into the soil. Consequently, urbanization poses a significant challenge for watershed management to mitigate faster runoff accumulation downstream and associated floods. Hydrological models are often employed to assess the impact of land-use dynamics on flood events. Alternatively, data-driven approaches combining time series of land use geodatasets and georeferenced flooded zones also allow to assess the relationship between soil sealing and flood severity. This study presents such data-driven analysis using a spatially explicit archive of flooded areas dating back to 1988 in the Flanders region of Belgium, which is characterized by urban sprawl. This archived data, along with time series of rainfall and land use, were analyzed for three middle-sized river subbasins using two machine learning methods: boosted regression trees and support vector regression. The machine learning methods were found suitable for this type of analysis, since their flexibility allows for spatially explicit models with larger sample sizes. However, the relationship between soil sealing and flood volume and extent could not be conclusively confirmed by our models. This may be due to data limitations, such as the limited number of recorded historical floods, inaccuracies in recorded historical flood polygons and inconsistencies in the land use classifications. It is therefore stressed that continued consistent monitoring of floods and land use changes is required."
https://openalex.org/W3089934052,"Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are the most effective therapy to terminate malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and therefore to prevent sudden cardiac death. Until today, there is no way to predict the onset of such VA. Our aim was to develop a mathematical model that could predict VA in a timely fashion. We analyzed the time series of R-R intervals from 3 groups. Two groups from the Spontaneous Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database (v 1.0) were analyzed from a set of 81 pairs of R-R interval time series records from patients, each pair containing one record before the VT episode (Dataset 1A) and one control record which was obtained during the follow up visit (Dataset 1B). A third data set was composed of the R-R interval time series of 54 subjects without a significant arrhythmia heart disease (Dataset 2). We developed a new method to transform a time series into a network for its analysis, the ε-regular graphs. This novel approach transforms a time series into a network which is sensitive to the quantitative properties of the time series, it has a single parameter (ε) to be adjusted, and it can trace long-range correlations. This procedure allows to use graph theory to extract the dynamics of any time series. The average of the difference between the VT and the control record graph degree of each patient, at each time window, reached a global minimum value of -2.12 followed by a drastic increase of the average graph until reaching a local maximum of 5.59. The global minimum and the following local maxima occur at the windows 276 and 393, respectively. This change in the connectivity of the graphs distinguishes two distinct dynamics occurring during the VA, while the states in between the 276 and 393, determine a transitional state. We propose this change in the dynamic of the R-R intervals as a measurable and detectable ""early warning"" of the VT event, occurring an average of 514.625 seconds (8:30 minutes) before the onset of the VT episode. It is feasible to detect retrospectively early warnings of the VA episode using their corresponding ε-regular graphs, with an average of 8:30 minutes before the ICD terminates the VA event."
