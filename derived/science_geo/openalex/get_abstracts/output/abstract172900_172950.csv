https://openalex.org/W2116835524,"Nitrotyrosine is widely used as a marker of post-translational modification by the nitric oxide (⋅NO, nitrogen monoxide)-derived oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO−). However, since the discovery that myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) can generate nitrotyrosine via oxidation of nitrite (NO 2−), several questions have arisen. First, the relative contribution of peroxidases to nitrotyrosine formation in vivo is unknown. Further, although evidence suggests that the one-electron oxidation product, nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2), is the primary species formed, neither a direct demonstration that peroxidases form this gas nor studies designed to test for the possible concomitant formation of the two-electron oxidation product, ONOO−, have been reported. Using multiple distinct models of acute inflammation with EPO- and MPO-knockout mice, we now demonstrate that leukocyte peroxidases participate in nitrotyrosine formation in vivo. In some models, MPO and EPO played a dominant role, accounting for the majority of nitrotyrosine formed. However, in other leukocyte-rich acute inflammatory models, no contribution for either MPO or EPO to nitrotyrosine formation could be demonstrated. Head-space gas analysis of helium-swept reaction mixtures provides direct evidence that leukocyte peroxidases catalytically generate ⋅NO2formation using H2O2 and NO 2− as substrates. However, formation of an additional oxidant was suggested since both enzymes promote NO 2−-dependent hydroxylation of targets under acidic conditions, a chemical reactivity shared with ONOO− but not ⋅NO2. Collectively, our results demonstrate that: 1) MPO and EPO contribute to tyrosine nitration in vivo; 2) the major reactive nitrogen species formed by leukocyte peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO 2− is the one-electron oxidation product, ⋅NO2; 3) as a minor reaction, peroxidases may also catalyze the two-electron oxidation of NO 2−, producing a ONOO−-like product. We speculate that the latter reaction generates a labile Fe-ONOO complex, which may be released following protonation under acidic conditions such as might exist at sites of inflammation.

Nitric oxide (⋅NO, nitrogen monoxide)-derived oxidants are believed to participate in antimicrobicidal activities as part of normal host defenses, cell signaling reactions, and a variety of homeostatic mechanisms. However, excess or inappropriate formation of NO-derived oxidants has also been linked to oxidative tissue injury and protein modification through nitration of tyrosine residues in inflammatory disorders (1Beckman J.S.

Evidence of a role for NO-derived oxidants in oxidative damage is primarily based upon immunohistological and mass spectrometric detection of nitrotyrosine (NO2-Tyr) (5Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z.

Although originally thought to serve as a specific marker for protein oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO−), it is now clear that a variety of reactive species may promote nitration of protein tyrosine (Tyr) residues in vitro. However, neither the identity nor the relative contribution of distinct intermediates in nitration reactions in vivo is known. By far the most widely studied nitrating intermediate is ONOO−, the reactive species formed during near diffusion-limited interaction of superoxide (O 2•−) and ⋅NO (1Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ONOO− promotes both nitration and hydroxylation reactions of targets and may be described as possessing chemical reactivity akin to a pair of caged radicals: hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2) (1Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that at physiological levels of carbon dioxide/bicarbonate (CO2/HCO 3−), ONOO− predominantly exists as the more potent nitrating species, nitrosoperoxocarbonate (ONOOCO2 −) (8Gow A. Duran D. Thom S.R. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K.

Production of ⋅NO and O 2•− is a characteristic feature at sites of inflammation. Consequently, both potential adverse effects of excess ⋅NO production and the detection of nitrotyrosine have been predominantly attributed to formation of ONOO− and ONOOCO2 −(1Beckman J.S.

MPO and EPO are unique in their ability to use halides and pseudohalides as co-substrates to generate hypohalous acids. At plasma levels of halides (Cl−, 100 mm; Br−, 100 μm), MPO uses Cl− as co-substrate to form hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (23Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol.

In contrast, EPO selectively utilizes plasma levels of Br− over Cl− to generate hypobromous acid (26Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiania S.

Consequently, both one- and two-electron oxidation products of NO 2− have been suggested to serve as potential diffusible oxidants formed by MPO and EPO (11van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B.

Biophys. 1998; 2: 207-213Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The formal oxidation states of nitrogen in NO 2− and its potential one- and two-electron oxidation products include: nitrite (NO 2−; +3), nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2; +4), nitronium cation (NO2 +; +5), and peroxynitrite (ONOO−; +5). Although the reactive nitrogen species formed following peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO 2− have not been directly established, rapid kinetics studies support formation of the one-electron oxidation product, ⋅NO2 (36Burner U.

It has been proposed that peroxidases might also generate the two-electron oxidation product of NO 2−, ONOO−, in reactions analogous to the addition of OH to halides forming hypohalous acids (35Sampson J.B., Ye, Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 2: 207-213Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence to support formation of ONOO− by peroxidases has not yet been reported. The relative contributions of peroxidases to formation of⋅NO-derived oxidants in vivo are unknown. Similarly, few studies have characterized the nature of the nitrating intermediate(s) formed following peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO 2−. Herein we have utilized recently developed MPO knockout (KO) (31Brennan M.L. Anderson M.M. Shih D.M. Qu X.D. Wang X.P. Mehta A.C. Lim L.L. Shi W. Hazen S.L. Jacob J.S. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W.

We also provide direct evidence that⋅NO2 gas is a physiological oxidant formed as a preferred product during MPO- and EPO-catalyzed oxidation of NO 2−. Finally, we provide several lines of evidence suggesting that MPO and EPO can also utilize NO 2− as substrate to form a ONOO−-like oxidant, which may be liberated from a labile Fe-ONOO complex at acid pH.

Protein was delipidated and desalted using two sequential extractions with a single phase mixture of H2O/methanol/H2O-saturated diethyl ether (1:3:8 v/v/v). Oxidized tyrosine standards (2 pmol each) and universal labeled tyrosine (2 nmol) were added to protein pellets. For nitrotyrosine analyses, proteins were hydrolyzed by incubating the desalted protein pellet with degassed 6N HCl supplemented with 1% phenol for 24 h under argon atmosphere. For chlorotyrosine and bromotyrosine analyses, samples were hydrolyzed in degassed 4N methane sulfonic acid supplemented with 1% phenol for 24 h at 100 °C under argon atmosphere. Amino acid hydrolysates were resuspended in Chelex-treated water and applied to mini solid-phase C18 extraction columns (Supelclean LC-C18SPE mini-column, 3 ml; Supelco, Inc., Bellefone, PA) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Following sequential washes with 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, oxidized tyrosines and tyrosine were eluted with 2 ml of 30% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried under vacuum, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry as described below. For nitrotyrosine analyses, tandem mass spectrometry was performed using electrospray ionization and detection with an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Deca, ThermoFinigann, San Jose, CA) interfaced with a Thermo SP4000 high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Samples were suspended in equilibration solvent (H2O with 0.1% formic acid) and injected onto an Ultrasphere C18 column (Phenominex, 5 μm, 2.0 × 150 mm).l-Tyrosine and its oxidation products were eluted at a flow rate of 200 μl/min using a linear gradient generated against 0.1% formic acid in methanol, pH 2.5, as the second mobile phase. Analytes were monitored in positive ion mode with full scan product ion MS/MS at unit resolution. Response was optimized with a spray voltage setting of 5 kV and a spray current of 80 μA. The heated capillary voltage was set at 10 V and the temperature to 350 °C. Nitrogen was used both as sheath and auxiliary gas, at a flow rate of 70 and 30 arbitrary units, respectively. The precursor ion isolation width was 1.0 and 3.0 for nitrotyrosine and tyrosine, respectively. The analyte abundance was evaluated by measuring the chromatographic peak areas of selected product ions extracted from the full scan total ion chromatogram, according to the corresponding ion trap product ion spectra. The ions monitored for each analyte were: 3-nitro[12C6]tyrosine (mass-to-charge-ratio (m/z) 227→181, and 210); 3-nitro[13C6]tyrosine (m/z 233→187, and 216); 3-nitro[13C9 15N1]tyrosine (m/z 237→190, and 219); [12C6]tyrosine (m/z182→136, and 165); and [13C9 15N1]tyrosine (m/z 192→145, and 174). The maximum ion injection time was 200 ms; a scan rate was used that permitted a minimum sampling rate of at least 9 points/chromatographic peak. Tyrosine and nitrotyrosine were base line-resolved under the HPLC conditions employed, permitting programming of the LCQ Deca for analysis over a span of 0 to 7 min for detection of tyrosine isotopomers and from 7 min on for detection of 3-nitrotyrosine isotopomers. For 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-bromotyrosine analyses, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed after derivatization of amino acids to their n-propyl/heptafluorylbutyryl or n-propyl/pentafluorylpropionyl derivatives using a Finnigan Voyager GC/MS in the negative ion chemical ionization mode, as previously described (30Wu W.

A conserved set of five amino acids in the central grooves of TPR1 and TPR2A form the so-called “two-carboxylate clamp” structure that serves as a socket for the binding of peptide ligand. The two-carboxylate clamp interacts tightly with both carboxylate functions of the conserved C-terminal Asp residue (Asp0) of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and is thus a potential fingerprint motif for novel EEVD-binding chaperone cofactors.Although the recent structures of TPR-peptide complexes revealed the general nature of TPR-mediated ligand binding (15Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), the extent to which recognition of the EEVD motif contributes to the interaction of the full-length proteins in the Hsp70·Hop·Hsp90 complex remains to be determined. Moreover, the relative significance of individual amino acid residues for peptide binding cannot easily be deduced from crystallographic data. In the present study we analyzed in quantitative terms the contribution of TPR-peptide interactions to the Hsp70/Hsp90 adapter function of Hop. The potential of short EEVD peptides to compete the interactions of the full-length proteins was evaluated, and the ligand recognition motifs of TPR1 and TPR2A were defined. We show that TPR-mediated binding to N-terminally extended EEVD peptides is necessary for complex formation of both full-length Hsp70 and Hsp90 with Hop. The TPR2A-MEEVD interaction represents the core contact between Hsp90 and Hop. However, additional binding sites outside the TPR1-PTIEEVD interface appear to play an important role in stabilizing the Hsp70·Hop complex. Although electrostatic interactions of Asp0 at the C terminus of Hsp70 and Hsp90 with the two-carboxylate clamp structure are indeed necessary for TPR domain binding, hydrophobic interactions contribute substantially to complex formation. Whereas the small hydrophobic residue Val-1 is critical for the general anchoring function of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 EEVD sequence, the highly conserved glutamate residues are not generally required and are recognized differentially by TPR1 and TPR2A. The hydrophobic residues Ile-4 in Hsp70 and Met-4 in Hsp90 are not only necessary for the high affinity of TPR interactions but are also the primary determinants of binding specificity. On the basis of these results, the development of small molecule inhibitors can be envisioned that specifically inhibit individual TPR-chaperone interactions. Such compounds would be useful in further dissecting the complex reaction mechanisms of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in vitro and in vivo.DISCUSSIONAs demonstrated in a recent structure-based approach, the isolated TPR1 and TPR2A domains of the Hsp70/Hsp90 adapter protein, Hop, specifically recognize 5–7-mer amino acid sequences in the C-terminal tails of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (15Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The peptide ligands of these TPR domains contain the motif EEVD, a C-terminal sequence highly conserved in all eukaryotic members of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families. Whereas EEVD was identified as a general anchor sequence for TPR cofactors of Hsp70 and Hsp90, specificity of binding is conferred by the 1–3 residues N-terminally to EEVD that are characteristic of either Hsp70 or Hsp90. In the present study we quantified the contribution of TPR-mediated peptide recognition for binary full-length protein interactions in the Hsp70·Hop·Hsp90 complex. Secondly, we analyzed the peptide binding motifs of the TPR1 and TPR2A domains and determined the principal driving forces of TPR-peptide interactions.Although the specific recognition of N-terminally extended EEVD sequences represents a central element in Hop·Hsp70 as well as Hop·Hsp90 complex formation, we also obtained evidence for the existence of additional, TPR-independent contact sites between the full-length proteins. These contacts contribute substantially to the interaction of Hsp70 with Hop but are less relevant in Hsp90·Hop binding. However, from the assessment of binding affinities and from our peptide competition analysis the TPR-independent contact sites are not sufficient for complex formation. Rather, the TPR-mediated binding of EEVD sequences provides the basis for the formation of stable as well as specific Hop·Hsp70 and Hop·Hsp90 complexes. Moreover, we find that short, extended EEVD peptides efficiently and specifically inhibit not only the binding of Hop to Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Figs. 3 and 4) but also the binding of other TPR cofactors, including PP5, CHIP, and Cyp40 (data not shown). Additional supporting evidence for the general relevance of TPR-EEVD interactions comes from the fact that the two-carboxylate clamp fingerprint motif of TPR domains can serve as a bioinformatic search parameter for identification of novel candidate Hsp70 and Hsp90 cofactors. For example, the Caenorhabditis elegans myosin assembly protein Unc-45 was recently characterized as a novel TPR co-chaperone of Hsp90 and possibly Hsp70 (43Barral J.M. Hutagalung A. Brinker A. Hartl F.U. Epstein H. Science. 2002; 295: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Identification of the two-carboxylate clamp structure in the TPR domain of Unc-45 immediately suggested Hsp70 and Hsp90 as potential interaction partners. In the case of CHIP, the insertion of a single point mutation into the two-carboxylate clamp of the full-length protein results in the complete loss of Hsp70 and Hsp90 binding. 4C. Patterson, personal communication.Although the TPR-mediated recognition of extended EEVD sequences is a major determinant for the formation of Hsp70·Hop·Hsp90 complexes, the presence in vivo of substrate proteins, nucleotides and a plethora of competing TPR cofactors and non-TPR co-chaperones is likely to impose an additional level of complexity and regulation on these interactions. Indeed, the proposed role of the conserved EEVD sequences as general docking sites for TPR cofactors is consistent with these sequences having additional regulatory functions that may or may not depend on TPR cofactor binding. Evidence has been presented that deletion of the EEVD sequence of Hsp70 affects the ATPase activity and the ability of Hsp70 to interact with substrates and Hsp40 cofactors (44Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). A regulatory effect of the EEVD-binding protein Sti1, the yeast homolog of Hop, on the ATPase of yeast Hsp90 has also been reported (12Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 745-762Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar).Our analysis of the TPR1 and TPR2A peptide binding motifs (Fig. 7) revealed the following basic features of TPR-mediated ligand recognition in Hsp70/Hsp90 multi-chaperone complexes.First, electrostatic interactions between the two-carboxylate clamp structures of the TPR domains of Hop and the conserved Asp0 residues in Hsp70 and Hsp90 are essential requirements for ligand binding. Removal of either the main-chain or side-chain carboxylate function of Asp0 or any single substitution of two-carboxylate clamp residues in the isolated TPR2A domain severely disrupts ligand binding. However, interactions mediated by the two-carboxylate clamp structure alone are insufficient to produce physiologically relevant ligand affinities. The tetrapeptide EEVD alone binds only very weakly to TPR1, TPR2A, and TPR2B. Additional interactions with adjacent amino acids are required to yield tightly binding peptide ligands for TPR1 and TPR2A (15Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). TPR2B, however, displays only a very low affinity for full-length Hsp70 and Hsp90, despite the presence of a two-carboxylate clamp, and the role of this TPR domain remains unclear. It is possible that TPR2B functions as a nonselective low-affinity binding site for Hsp70 or Hsp90, increasing the kinetics of Hsp70·Hop·Hsp90 complex formation. Thus, although the two-carboxylate clamp structure can be used as a fingerprint motif for the identification of novel TPR factors interacting with Hsp70 or Hsp90, predictions must be confirmed experimentally, and the actual binding preferences for Hsp70 or Hsp90 must be determined.Second, the other acidic residues of the EEVD anchor sequence are differentially recognized by TPR1 and TPR2A. TPR2A depends on both glutamate residues for efficient ligand binding. Of particular significance is residue Glu-3, shown to be involved in a network of electrostatic interactions with TPR2A (15Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). In light of the high degree of conservation of the EEVD sequence in the Hsp70 C terminus (Fig. 6), it is surprising that Glu-2 and Glu-3 have no influence on ligand recognition by TPR1. Moreover, a binding screen of the combinatorial peptide library O/X4-VD revealed a general preference of TPR1 for hydrophobic residues in position –3, with Leu clearly being favored. Apparently, the C terminus of Hsp70 is not evolutionarily optimized for high-affinity binding to the TPR1 domain of Hop, perhaps because additional contacts with other regions of Hsp70 contribute substantially to the interaction or because stronger binding would be functionally detrimental. In any case, the ligand recognition motif of TPR1 cannot explain the almost 100% conservation of Hsp70 sequences in positions Glu-2 and Glu-3. We therefore suggest that other Hsp70 cofactors may recognize different aspects of the extended Hsp70 EEVD motif and depend more strongly on its conserved glutamate residues.Finally, a third important aspect of TPR-mediated ligand recognition is the strong contribution of hydrophobic residues in the N-terminally extended EEVD ligands to both high affinity and specificity of binding. Whereas Val-1 is important in the peptide interactions with both TPR1 and TPR2A, supporting the general anchor function of the EEVD motif, Ile-4 and Met-4 determine primarily the specificity of Hsp70 and Hsp90 peptide ligands, respectively. Pro-6 in the Hsp70 C terminus does not contribute substantially to TPR1 binding and therefore might be regarded as a secondary determinant of specificity.Although it is clear from the present study and from additional data (18Taylor P.

For example, recent work suggests that CHIP, a cofactor of both Hsp70 and Hsp90, contains a TPR domain that binds EEVD peptides with high affinity but with a broader specificity, enabling CHIP to interact with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Refs. 45Ballinger C.A.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar and data not shown). How this is achieved is not yet understood. TPR proteins operating in entirely different functional contexts have also been found to recognize the C-terminal tails of target proteins. Two clusters of three TPR motifs each cooperate in the human peroxisomal targeting receptor PEX5 to mediate the high-affinity binding of peroxisomal targeting sequences ∼SKL-COOH (17Gatto G.J., Jr. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to compare structurally the TPR motifs in PEX5 to the six TPR motifs in domain TPR2L of Hop (Fig. 1). In both cases the TPR motifs are clustered in two pairs of three repeats. However, whereas in PEX5 these clusters form one single binding site for peptide ligand (17Gatto G.J., Jr. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), our results suggest that domains TPR2A and TPR2B in TPR2L do not act cooperatively but rather form independent ligand binding sites.An alternative mode of interaction of TPR modules has recently been described for the TPR protein p67phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase multi-protein enzyme. p67phox contains a β-hairpin insertion in its otherwise classical TPR scaffold. This insertion mediates the interaction of p67phox with the small GTPase, Rac (16Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An additional intramolecular interaction between a C-terminal extension of the p67phox TPR domain and the ligand binding groove of the domain (16Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J.

An alternative binding mode for TPR domains is also expected for Hip, a TPR cofactor of Hsp70. Unlike the TPR domains of Hop and CHIP, Hip does not interact with the EEVD tail of Hsp70 but rather binds to an as yet unidentified internal sequence of the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp70 (49Höhfeld J. Minami J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 50Demand J. Lüders J. Höhfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).In summary, protein domains containing TPR motifs represent a highly versatile class of protein interaction modules. The recognition of N-terminally extended EEVD sequences represents the predominant mode of interaction for TPR cofactors of Hsp70/Hsp90 multi-chaperone complexes. The insights now gained into these interactions at the molecular level may lead to the development of specific inhibitors for TPR cofactor binding to Hsp70 or Hsp90. Such compounds would be valuable tools for the functional dissection of the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone mechanism in vitro and in vivo. The coordinated interaction of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 molecular chaperones is required for the folding and conformational regulation of a variety of signal transduction proteins and cell cycle regulators in the eukaryotic cytosol (reviewed in Refs. 1Pratt W.B.

This family is composed of over 15 α and eight β subunits expressed in at least 22 different αβ heterodimeric combinations. Among these, a combination of six (αvβ3, αvβ5, α5β1, α2β1, αvβ1, and α1β1) has been implicated in angiogenesis (4.Hynes R.O. Bader B.L. Thromb.

Integrin αvβ3 binds to a wide variety of extracellular matrix proteins including vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, collagen, von Willebrand factor, osteopontin, and a fragment of MMP2 (PEX) among others (for a review, see Ref. 8.Eliceiri B.P.

Here, we demonstrate that E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs requires RhoA activation. In addition, we show that cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF1) contributes toE. coli K1 invasion of brain endothelial cells in vitro and traversal of the blood-brain barrier in the experimental hematogenous meningitis animal model. These in vitro and in vivo effects of CNF1 were dependent upon RhoA activation as shown by (a) decreased invasion and RhoA activation with the Δcnf1 mutant of E. coliK1 and (b) restoration of invasion frequency of the Δcnf1 mutant to the level of the parent E. coli K1 strain in BMECs with constitutively active RhoA. In addition, CNF1-enhanced E. coli invasion of brain endothelial cells and stress fiber formation were independent of focal adhesion kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.

For example, most cases of bacterial meningitis occur as a result of hematogenous spread, but it is unclear how circulating bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier (1Kim K.S. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 33: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli is the most common Gram-negative microorganism causing meningitis in the neonatal period. We have previously shown that E. coli K1 crossing of the blood-brain barrier in vivo requires a threshold level of bacteremia and invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)1 and identified several E. coli determinants (OmpA, Ibe proteins, AslA, and TraJ) contributing to BMEC invasion in vitro and in vivo (2Badger J.L.

Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that host cell actin cytoskeletal rearrangements are required for E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs, as shown by invasive E. coliK1-associated F-actin condensation and blockade of E. coliK1 invasion of BMECs by the microfilament-disrupting agents cytochalasin D and latrunculin A (8Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); but the specific host cell signaling pathways involved in E. coli K1 invasion and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements remain incompletely understood. Our recent studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of several host cell signaling molecules is involved in E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs, as treatment of BMECs with genistein, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs (9Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are crucial signaling pathways contributing to E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs (9Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol.

It is also unclear which microbial factors contribute to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in BMECs. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF1) is a dermonecrotic protein toxin produced by human and animal isolates of E. coli. CNF1 consists of 1014 amino acids with a molecular mass of 113.7 kDa. CNF1 is frequently associated with E. coli strains that cause extraintestinal infections in humans (11Caprioli A. Falbo V. Ruggeri F.M. Baldassarri L. Bisicchia R. Ippolito G. Romoli E. Donelli G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 146-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Falbo V. Famiglietti M. Caprioli A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2182-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact role of CNF1 in the pathogenesis of extraintestinal E. coliinfections is not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated that CNF1 induces phagocytosis in epithelial cells (13Caprioli A. Falbo V. Roda L.G. Ruggen F.M. Zona C. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Falzano L. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Michel E. Kocks C. Cossart P. Cabanie L. Oswald E. Boquet P. Mol.

Commun. 1998; 241: 341-346Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CNF1 has been shown to activate Rho GTPases by deamidation of glutamine 63, converting it into glutamic acid, thereby inhibiting GTP-hydrolyzing activity and constitutive activation of Rho, resulting in polymerization of F-actin and increased formation of stress fibers (16Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 17Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K.

In this study, we examined the role of CNF1 in E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs in vitro and traversal of the blood-brain barrier in the experimental hematogenous meningitis animal model and the mechanisms associated with CNF1 in E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs. E. coliK1 strain E44 is a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of strain RS218 (O18:K1:H7), a cerebrospinal fluid isolate from a neonate with meningitis (4Huang S.H. Fu Y.H. Chen Q. Stins M. Wang Y. Wass C. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli K12 strain JM101 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) was used as the host for plasmids, and SM10 λpir (19Taylor R.K. Manoil C. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host for suicide plasmids. E. coli strains were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria broth. Where appropriate, the medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (40 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), or rifampin (50 μg/ml). Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the published sequence of thecnf1 gene (20Falbo V. Pace T. Picci L. Pizzi E. Caprioli A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4909-4914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-kb DNA fragment was obtained using primers 5′-GGCAGCCATTTGATTTTG-3′ and 5′-TTCCGCTTGTAATGATTAC-3′ and cloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 0.9-kb DNA fragment upstream of cnf1 was produced using primers 5′-ACGGATCCCGCGACGGAAGCT-3′, incorporating aBamHI site (underlined), and 5′-AAGAATTCTTAATGTAATCGCT-3′, incorporating anEcoRI site (underlined), and cloned into the above-mentioned plasmid; and then a kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was inserted at the EcoRI site. The recombinant DNA was moved to suicide plasmid pET185.2 and then transferred to strain E44 by conjugation. The cnf1 deletion mutant was selected on kanamycin and verified by PCR. The cnf1 gene was amplified from E. coli K1 strain E44 using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ACGGATCCCGCGACGGAAGCT-3′, incorporating aBamHI site (underlined), and 5′-ACGAATTCTCATTTGTTTGCCTT-3′, incorporating anEcoRI site (underlined), and cloned into pBluescript KS at the same sites to produce pB-cnf1. CNF1 was expressed inE. coli JM101 and purified using published protocols (14Falzano L. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Michel E. Kocks C. Cossart P. Cabanie L. Oswald E. Boquet P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Human BMECs were isolated and cultured as previously described (21Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). BMEC cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% NuSerum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, essential amino acids, and vitamins. PI3K mutants Δp110 (a kinase-negative catalytic subunit of PI3K) and Δp85 (defective in interaction with p110) were prepared as previously described (10Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36769-36774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A FAK mutant lacking the autophosphorylation site (Phe397FAK) was prepared as described previously (9Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA, constructed by replacing threonine 19 with asparagine) and constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA, constructed by replacing glycine 14 with valine using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis) constructs were used as previously described (22Khosravi-Far R.

Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). All constructs were cloned into the pCMV-based vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and transfected into human BMECs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as previously described (10Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36769-36774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA-LipofectAMINE complex in RPMI 1640 medium was added to 50% confluent human BMEC monolayers. After 6 h of incubation, cells were washed and grown in complete medium for 72 h, followed by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Antibiotic-resistant colonies were pooled and confirmed by Western blotting. Invasion assays were performed as previously described (4Huang S.H. Fu Y.H. Chen Q. Stins M. Wang Y. Wass C. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of human BMECs (grown in 24-well plates) were incubated with 107E. coli cells (multiplicity of infection of 100) in experimental medium (Medium 199/Ham’s F-12 medium (1:1) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate). Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 90 min. Monolayers were washed with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with experimental medium containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The monolayers were washed again and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100. The released intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. To examine the role of RhoA in E. coliinvasion of human BMECs, cells were treated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Calbiochem) (24Bodie S.L. Ford I. Greaves M. Nixon G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and invasion assays were performed. To determine the effects of CNF1 on E. coli K1 invasion, monolayers were incubated with CNF1 in experimental medium for 2 h before addition of the bacteria. The cnf1deletion mutant was examined for its ability to enter the central nervous system using our neonatal rat model of hematogenous E. coli meningitis as previously described (25Huang S.H. Fu C. Wass Q. Prasadarao N.V. Stins M. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4470-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at 5 days of age, all members of each litter were randomly divided into two groups to receive subcutaneously 105 colony-forming units of E. coli K1 strain E44 or its cnf1 deletion mutant. At 18 h after bacterial inoculation, blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens were obtained for quantitative cultures. The development of meningitis was defined as positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures. All experiments were performed in compliance with National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines. Human BMECs were stimulated with CNF1 for 2 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against actin (Sigma) for 60 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit antibody for 60 min at room temperature, and visualized under an immunofluorescence microscope (8Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human BMECs were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for protein quantification. An equal amount of protein (500 μg to 1 mg) was incubated with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 45 min at 4 °C to collect active forms of RhoA, i.e. GTP-RhoA. The protein complex was washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 4% skim milk for 60 min at 22 °C. After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and subsequently incubated for 60 min at 22 °C with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody against mouse. Antibody-bound RhoA was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) (26Jin S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A single band of RhoA in the 21-kDa range was detected. To determine whether CNF1 plays a role in E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs, an isogenic E44 mutant (Δcnf1) was generated (Fig.1). The deletion of cnf1 in the mutant strain was verified by PCR (data not shown) as well as by Western blotting (Fig. 2). The growth characteristics of strain E44 and the Δcnf1 mutant were identical on Luria broth and blood agar. In addition, the total protein profiles as assessed by SDS-PAGE were identical for strain E44 and the Δcnf1 mutant (data not shown). Both strain E44 and the Δcnf1 mutant were used for invasion assays. We observed that the cnf1 deletion mutant was significantly less invasive in BMECs compared with the parent strain (Fig.3). To examine whether thecnf1 deletion mutant is indeed less invasive in vivo, the cnf1 mutant and the parent strain were administered to 5-day-old rats. As shown in TableI, subcutaneous injection of 105 colony-forming units of strain E44 or itscnf1 mutant resulted in bacteremia in 100% of the animals, and the magnitude of the bacteremia was similar between the two groups. A total of 10 of 26 animals (38%) infected with strain E44 were found to have meningitis. In contrast, only 3 of 28 animals (11%) developed meningitis, and this rate of meningitis was significantly less (p = 0.026) than the rate observed with thecnf1 mutant. These findings indicate that CNF1 is a critical determinant for E. coli K1 to invade human BMECs in vitro and to cross the blood-brain barrier in vivo. It is also important to recognize that the frequency of in vitro BMEC invasion (∼0.1%) corresponds to the enhanced bacterial penetration of the blood-brain barrier in vivo(Fig. 3 and Table I) (2Badger J.L.

Prasadarao N.V. Stins M. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4470-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

To determine the role of RhoA in E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs, monolayers were treated with Y-27632 (a Rho kinase inhibitor), and invasion assays were performed. Y-27632 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs (Fig. 4), suggesting that RhoA plays a role in E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs. To further confirm these findings, invasion assays were performed using BMECs expressing dominant-negative RhoA (ΔRhoA) or BMECs with constitutively active RhoA (RhoA). E. coli K1 invasion was decreased by >50% in human BMECs expressing dominant-negative RhoA (Fig. 5 and TableII), whereas BMECs with constitutively active RhoA exhibited a marked increase in E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs (Fig. 5). Taken together, these findings indicate that RhoA activation is required for efficient E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs.Figure 5Expression of dominant-negative RhoA decreases BMEC invasion by E. coli K1 strain E44, whereas expression of constitutively active RhoA increases BMEC invasion by strain E44 as well as by its cnf1 deletion mutant. Human BMECs were transfected with pcDNA3 cloned with dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA) or constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As controls, cells were transfected with pcDNA3 alone. Invasion assays were performed using E. coli K1 strain E44 or itscnf1 deletion mutant.

To assess whether the cnf1 deletion mutant lacks the ability of RhoA activation, human BMECs were incubated with E. coli K1 strain E44 and its cnf1 deletion mutant, and total lysates were compared for the activated GTP form of RhoA. The cnf1deletion mutant was significantly less efficient in activation of RhoA GTPase compared with parent strain E44 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6, a and b). Of interest, the cnf1 deletion mutant of E44 exhibited increased RhoA activation compared with the negative control (laboratory E. coli strain HB101) (Fig. 6, a andb). We have previously shown that several E. colideterminants such as OmpA, Ibe proteins, AslA, and TraJ contribute to BMEC invasion (2Badger J.L. Wass C.A. Weissman S.J. Kim K.S. Infect.

Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be possible that one or more of these microbial determinants also contribute to RhoA activation. Overall, these findings suggest that CNF1 contributes to E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs most likely via RhoA activation. This concept was further supported by the demonstration that the invasive ability of the cnf1 deletion mutant was restored to the level of the parent E. coli K1 strain in BMECs with constitutively active RhoA (Fig. 5). Next, to determine the effects of CNF1 on E. coli K1 invasion, we incubated human BMECs with purified CNF1 for 2 h prior to invasion assays. A >40-fold increase in E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs was observed in CNF1-treated cells (Table II). We previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylations of FAK and PI3K are essential for E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs, as shown by significantly decreased invasion of E. coli K1 in dominant-negative FAK- and PI3K-expressing BMECs (TableII) (9Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36769-36774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, CNF1-mediated E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs was independent of FAK and PI3K. This was shown by the demonstration that CNF1 enhanced E. coli K1 invasion of pcDNA-transfected BMECs as well as of both dominant-negative FAK- and PI3K-expressing BMECs (Table II). However, prior treatment of dominant-negative RhoA-expressing BMECs with CNF1 resulted in a minimal increase in E. coli K1 invasion, documenting that RhoA is the major target in CNF1-mediated invasion of E. coli K1 in human BMECs. In addition, human BMECs were treated with Y-27632 and then with CNF1, followed by the invasion assays. We observed that CNF1 did not increase invasion substantially in cells that were pretreated with Y-27632 (Table II), thus further confirming that CNF1-mediated increased E. coliK1 invasion of human BMECs requires RhoA activation. We have demonstrated that host cell actin cytoskeletal rearrangements are required for E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs (8Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CNF1 has been shown to activate Rho GTPases, resulting in polymerization of F-actin and increased formation of stress fibers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (18Vouret-Craviari V. Grall D. Flatau G. Pouyssegur J. Boquet P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3002-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CNF1 induces stress fiber formation in human BMECs, cells were incubated with CNF1 for 2 h, and immunofluorescence assays were performed. We observed increased stress fiber formation in CNF1-treated pcDNA-transfected BMECs (Fig. 7). Consistent with the above invasion data, CNF1-induced stress fiber formation was also observed in both dominant-negative FAK- and PI3K-expressing BMECs (Fig. 7). In contrast, CNF1 did not induce stress fiber formation in dominant-negative RhoA-expressing BMECs (Fig. 7) and in Y-27632-pretreated BMECs (data not shown). To verify the activation of RhoA following CNF1 treatment, human BMECs were stimulated with CNF1 for 30 min, and GTP-RhoA was collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed increased levels of GTP-RhoA in response to CNF1 in pcDNA-transfected BMECs as well as in both dominant-negative FAK- and PI3K-expressing BMECs (Fig. 8, a and b). CNF1 treatment of dominant-negative RhoA-expressing BMECs did not result in RhoA activation (Fig. 8, a and b). Taken together, these findings indicate that CNF1-mediated E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs and cytoskeletal rearrangements are independent of FAK and PI3K, but dependent on RhoA. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the role of CNF1 in the pathogenesis of meningitis due to E. coli K1. The cnf1 deletion mutant was significantly less invasive in human BMECs in vitro as well as significantly less efficient in penetration of the blood-brain barrier in the experimental hematogenous E. coli meningitis animal model in vivo compared with the parent E. coli K1 strain. We have previously shown that a high degree of bacteremia is a primary determinant for meningeal invasion by E. coli K1 (27Kim K.S. Itabashi H. Gemski P. Sadoff J. Warren R.L. Cross A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); however, the magnitude of bacteremia was similar between the two groups of animals infected with the cnf1 deletion mutant or the parent strain (Table I). These findings indicate that CNF1 is indeed a critical determinant for E. coli K1 penetration of the central nervous system in vivo. This finding is in contrast to previous reports describing the inconsistent contribution of CNF1 to uropathogenesis in vivo (28Fournout S. Dozois C.M. Odin M. Desautels C. Peres S. Herault F.

In addition, we have shown that PI3K interacts with FAK in human BMECs and that its interaction is increased in human BMECs stimulated with E. coli K1 (9Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol.

PI3K activation is abolished in dominant-negative FAK mutants (10Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36769-36774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), indicating that FAK is upstream of PI3K in E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs. CNF1 has been shown to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and formation of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (31Lacerda H.M. Pullinger G.D. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9587-9596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, as shown in this study, increased stress fiber formation and E. coli K1 invasion in response to CNF1 in human BMECs were independent of FAK and PI3K. These findings suggest that the requirement of FAK and PI3K for E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs was overcome by CNF1 treatment of human BMECs. We have previously shown that several determinants of E. coli K1 such as OmpA and Ibe proteins contribute to BMEC invasion (2Badger J.L. Wass C.A. Weissman S.J. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Hoffman J.A. Badger J.L. Zhang Y. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect.

Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that the contribution of OmpA and Ibe proteins to E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs may involve FAK and PI3K. Additional studies are needed to determine microbial factors contributing to E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs and also requiring FAK and PI3K activation. One of the novel findings in this study is that E. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs was dependent on Rho GTPase. This was shown using dominant-negative RhoA-expressing BMECs as well as the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, both of which showed significant decreases inE. coli K1 invasion of human BMECs. Of interest, thecnf1 deletion mutant was significantly less efficient in invasion of human BMECs as well as in RhoA activation compared with the parent E. coli K1 strain, suggesting that CNF1 contributes to E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs via RhoA activation. This concept was further supported by the demonstration that the decreased invasion observed with the cnf1 deletion mutant was restored to the level of the parent E. coli K1 strain using BMECs with constitutively active RhoA. Also, similar to the enhancing effects of CNF1 on E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs, invasion assays using BMECs with constitutively active RhoA resulted in significantly increased invasion, suggesting that RhoA activation can substitute for CNF1 in enhancing E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs. Taken together, these findings suggest that CNF1 mediates E. coliK1 invasion of BMECs via RhoA activation. Of interest, the enhancing effects of constitutively active RhoA on E. coli K1 invasion were not as high as those achieved using CNF1 (∼8-foldversus 40-fold increases, respectively). One explanation may be the use of different methods of activating RhoA, i.e.transfection versus CNF1 treatment. An alternative explanation may be related to the concept that CNF1 may activate RhoA and other Rho GTPases, resulting in greater E. coli K1 invasion of BMECs. In their active GTP-bound form, Rho GTPases interact with many effectors, including serine/threonine kinases, lipid kinases, and several adaptor proteins (32Hall A.

Several lines of evidence suggest that PI3K plays an important role in host cell cytoskeletal remodeling and trafficking (35Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). For example, PI3K controls Rho-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts (36Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that CNF1 treatment increased stress fiber formation in dominant-negative PI3K-expressing BMECs, whereas this effect was minimal in dominant-negative RhoA-expressing BMECs and in Y-27632-pretreated BMECs. In addition, RhoA activation (as shown by GTP-RhoA) was shown to occur in response to CNF1 in dominant-negative PI3K-expressing BMECs. Overall, these data indicate that E. coli K1-induced stress fiber formation of BMECs is dependent upon RhoA, FAK, and PI3K, but that CNF1 treatment is able to overcome the requirement of FAK and PI3K, suggesting different mechanisms for E. coli K1 and CNF1 for their abilities to induce stress fiber formation and also to induce bacterial entry into human BMECs. We have previously documented that other meningitis-causing bacteria such as group B Streptococcus (38Nizet V. Kim K.S. Stins M. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. Nguyen D. Rubens C.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5074-5081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andCitrobacter (39Badger J.L. Stins M.F. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4208-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are able to invade human BMECs by inducing host cell actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, but the basis of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements by these meningitis-causing bacteria is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CNF1 contributes toE. coli K1 invasion of BMECs by modulating actin cytoskeletal rearrangements through activation of RhoA. More importantly, we identified CNF1 as a critical determinant for E. coli K1 penetration of the central nervous system in vivo. Our findings with CNF1-producing E. coli K1 illustrate that CNF1 in a whole bacterium is able to contribute to BMEC invasion in vitro and penetration into the central nervous system in vivo. In contrast, previous reports describing CNF1-mediated enhancement of bacterial invasion of host cells have shown with addition of only exogenous CNF1 (14Falzano L. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Michel E. Kocks C. Cossart P. Cabanie L. Oswald E. Boquet P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Of interest, CNF1 is considered to be a cytosolic protein and not to be secreted from the whole bacterium. It remains unclear how CNF1 in the whole bacterium is able to provide the BMEC invasion phenotype and RhoA activation, and studies are in progress to address this issue. We thank A. Hall and M. Schwartz for providing dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA) and constitutively active RhoA (V14RhoA) constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2150787039,"Gene regulation can be tightly controlled by recognition of DNA deformations that are induced by stress generated during transcription. The KH domains of the FUSE-binding protein (FBP), a regulator of c-myc expression, bind in vivo and in vitro to the single-stranded far-upstream element (FUSE), 1,500 base pairs upstream from the c-myc promoter. FBP bound to FUSE acts through TFIIH at the promoter. Here we report the solution structure of a complex between the KH3 and KH4 domains of FBP and a 29-base single-stranded DNA from FUSE. The KH domains recognize two sites, 9-10 bases in length, separated by 5 bases, with KH4 bound to the 5' site and KH3 to the 3' site. The central portion of each site comprises a tetrad of sequence 5'd-ATTC for KH4 and 5'd-TTTT for KH3. Dynamics measurements show that the two KH domains bind as articulated modules to single-stranded DNA, providing a flexible framework with which to recognize transient, moving targets."

As inhibition of endocytosis using the K44A negative mutant of dynamin and RN-tre did not lead to activation of Smad-dependent transcription, the effects of the dominant-negative Rab5 are likely to be a consequence of altered membrane trafficking of constitutively formed TGFβ/activin type I/II receptor complexes at the level of early endosomes.

We have recently shown also that activin A affects endothelial cell function leading to inhibition of angiogenesis and decreased vessel wall integrity (8Breit S. Ashman K. Wilting J. Rossler J.

The latter associate with Smad4 and the resulting complex translocates to the nucleus, where they control transcription of target genes. Recent data show that, in the case of the TGFβ receptor and most likely in the case of activin (10Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.-I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T.

This targeting requires a FYVE finger, which by analogy to other FYVE fingers (reviewed in Ref. 12Stenmark H. Aasland R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4175-4183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been speculated to bind specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P). Even though the subcellular localization of SARA (11Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) is as yet uncharacterized, we hypothesized that this protein may localize to early endosomes, which are known to be enriched for PI(3)P (13Gillooly D.J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar).The concept that activated receptors interact with downstream signaling molecules at discrete endocytic locations has long been suspected (reviewed in Ref. 14Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, membrane trafficking plays an important role in controlling the location of signaling interactions and in regulating receptor degradation and/or recycling (reviewed in Ref. 15Leof E.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of the TGFβ/activin receptors, little is known about how endocytosis and receptor trafficking influences the assembly, localization, and activation of ligand-receptor-SARA-Smad complexes. Indeed, the temporal and spatial regulation of these interactions is not fully understood. Since SARA binds to membranes via its FYVE finger providing a potential link between membrane trafficking and TGFβ/activin signaling, we have addressed the intracellular localization of SARA and investigated the requirements for its FYVE finger-membrane lipid interaction. Motivated by our finding that SARA is localized on early endosomes, we reasoned that experimental perturbation of proteins which regulate endosome function would allow us to address the contribution of the endocytic pathway in the control of TGFβ/activin signaling. Toward this purpose, we have investigated the effects on Smad-dependent signaling of constitutively active and dominant-negative mutant forms of Rab5, a small GTPase that plays a key role in endosome dynamics and receptor signaling (16Bucci C.

Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence that endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes not only leads to signal attenuation (36Vieira A. Lamaze C. Schmid S. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), but may be also necessary to co-localize activated receptors with downstream effectors (37Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S.

Thus, the idea of signaling from the endocytic compartment is gaining momentum. In the case of the TGFβ/activin family receptors, it is unclear whether receptor internalization is required to reach the SARA-bound Smad substrate or to what extent endosome dynamics affect TGFβ family signaling.We have addressed the intracellular localization of SARA and found that SARA is present on the early endocytic compartment, suggesting that the Smad pathway signals from the early endosome. Furthermore, SARA significantly increases endosome size, suggestive of a role in endosome dynamics. We have observed by immunofluorescence that the FYVE finger of SARA is sufficient for its endosomal targeting. So far, the identified FYVE finger proteins have been shown to require additional binding partners for targeting to endosomal membranes. Thus, EEA1 and Rabenosyn 5 require the binding of an adjacent domain to endosomal Rab5GTP (29Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M.

Surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated that the SARA FYVE finger has a higher affinity (KD of 30 nm) than those of Hrs (KD of 38 nm) and EEA1 (KD of 45 nm) for PI(3)P. This difference in KD may partially account for the fact that the SARA FYVE finger is efficiently targeted to early endosomes, whereas the EEA1 and Hrs FYVE fingers are mainly cytosolic when expressed as such (13Gillooly D.J.

Since the dimerization of FYVE domains increases their avidity for PI(3)P-containing membranes (13Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the surface plasmon resonance experiments underestimate the differences in ligand affinities, we favor the view that endosomal targeting of SARA may rely solely on binding to endosome-located PI(3)P (13Gillooly D.J.

For instance, we did not find any direct interactions between SARA and Rab5 by the two-hybrid system (data not shown). However, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that our minimal FYVE finger construct may contain other binding elements which participate in dimerization or endosomal targeting.In the light of our initial results showing that SARA is located on early endosomes, we sought further evidence regarding the inter-relation between endosome dynamics and signaling. We reasoned that a certain level of regulation may exist at the level of this organelle and proteins, such as Rab5, regulating early endosome function may indeed alter signaling. Moreover, Rab5 has been implicated in EGFR signaling (20Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and is activated by EGF stimulation (19Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A striking finding of the present study was that Rab5S34N, a dominant-negative Rab5 mutant, stimulated transcription of a Smad-dependent promoter, in the absence of TGFβ/activins, in serum-free conditions. This activation was associated with phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins. Phosphorylation of Smads by Rab5S34N was independent of indirect effects such as establishment of a TGFβ/activin autocrine loop or depolymerization of microtubules. Indeed, microtubules sequester unphosphorylated Smads, and depolymerization of the microtubular network releases active, phosphorylated Smads by an uncharacterized mechanism (33Dong C., Li, Z. Alverez R. Feng X.-H. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of Smads by Rab5S34N occurred in serum-free conditions and since it has been previously shown that the cytoplasmic domains of type II and type I TGFβ receptors interact physically and functionally with each other in a ligand-independent manner (40Feng X.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13123-13129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to assume that Rab5S34N might be able to amplify such low-level constitutive TGFβ/activin receptor activation. Indeed, we have observed a considerable inhibition of the transcriptional activation of the Smad-dependent promoter by Rab5S34N when co-transfecting dominant-negative ALK2, ALK4, and ALK5 receptor constructs.Since Rab5S34N inhibits endocytosis, recycling, and early endosome fusion (31Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), the data suggested a regulatory role of membrane trafficking on the intensity of signaling cascades. A negligible effect of constitutively formed TGFβ-activin receptor complexes, on Smad-dependent transcription could be grossly amplified by Rab5S34N. Such amplification was unlikely to be derived from a decreased rate of endocytosis as blocking of plasma membrane endocytosis by expression of RN-tre, a specific Rab5 GAP (20Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), did not augment Smad-dependent transcription. Similarly, there was no increase in Smad-dependent transcription following inhibition of clathrin-coated pit- and caveolin-dependent plasma membrane endocytosis (41Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E.

These results implied that the Rab5S34N effect was rather a consequence of decreased degradative or recycling trafficking leading to accumulation of constitutively formed TGFβ-activin type I/II receptor complexes on early endosomal membranes, where SARA-Smad complexes reside. Such accumulation of TGFβ-activin type I/II receptor complexes, and increased residence time thereof, presumably accounts for the increase in signaling observed upon RabS34N expression. Likewise, the observed reduction of activin A-induced Smad promoter transcription by the constitutively active Rab5Q79L is likely to be a consequence of enhanced receptor trafficking leading to decreased residence in the early endosomal compartment. It appears that cycling of Rab5 between GTP and GDP forms may influence the length and intensity of TGFβ/activin signaling cascades by regulating TGFβ-activin type I/II receptor trafficking via the early endocytic compartment. Indeed, it has been shown that Rab5S34N reduces epidermal growth factor receptor degradation by influencing membrane trafficking (44Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.L. Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Rab5 could exert its effects by directly binding to components of the TGFβ/activin pathway or affecting TGFβ/activin receptor kinase activity, for instance, by modulating receptor-associated kinases or phosphatases (45Griswold-Prenner I. Kamibayashi C. Maruoka E.M. Mumby M.C. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toward this end, we did not observe any direct interactions between Rab5 and SARA or Smad2/3 proteins using the yeast 2-hybrid system (data not shown).In conclusion, we have revealed a critical role of early endosomes in regulating Smad-dependent signaling. Not only is SARA localized in the early endocytic compartment but also a dominant-negative Rab5 mutant causes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smads leading to transcriptional activation of a Smad-dependent promoter. Rab5S34N not only stimulated Smad-dependent transcriptional activation, but also inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells and keratinocytes mimicking the effects of TGFβ/activins. The results suggest an interconnection between events in early endosomes with signal transduction pathways and may have important implications in understanding how cells co-ordinate their cellular functions when responding to extracellular stimuli.

Members of this family play critical roles during embryogenesis and in maintaining tissue homeostasis in adult life.

The latter associate with Smad4 and the resulting complex translocates to the nucleus, where they control transcription of target genes. Recent data show that, in the case of the TGFβ receptor and most likely in the case of activin (10Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.-I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T.

This targeting requires a FYVE finger, which by analogy to other FYVE fingers (reviewed in Ref. 12Stenmark H. Aasland R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4175-4183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been speculated to bind specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P). Even though the subcellular localization of SARA (11Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) is as yet uncharacterized, we hypothesized that this protein may localize to early endosomes, which are known to be enriched for PI(3)P (13Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The concept that activated receptors interact with downstream signaling molecules at discrete endocytic locations has long been suspected (reviewed in Ref. 14Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, membrane trafficking plays an important role in controlling the location of signaling interactions and in regulating receptor degradation and/or recycling (reviewed in Ref. 15Leof E.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of the TGFβ/activin receptors, little is known about how endocytosis and receptor trafficking influences the assembly, localization, and activation of ligand-receptor-SARA-Smad complexes. Indeed, the temporal and spatial regulation of these interactions is not fully understood. Since SARA binds to membranes via its FYVE finger providing a potential link between membrane trafficking and TGFβ/activin signaling, we have addressed the intracellular localization of SARA and investigated the requirements for its FYVE finger-membrane lipid interaction. Motivated by our finding that SARA is localized on early endosomes, we reasoned that experimental perturbation of proteins which regulate endosome function would allow us to address the contribution of the endocytic pathway in the control of TGFβ/activin signaling. Toward this purpose, we have investigated the effects on Smad-dependent signaling of constitutively active and dominant-negative mutant forms of Rab5, a small GTPase that plays a key role in endosome dynamics and receptor signaling (16Bucci C.

Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONInternalization of ligand activated receptors has been considered merely as a signal attenuation mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 14Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence that endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes not only leads to signal attenuation (36Vieira A. Lamaze C. Schmid S. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), but may be also necessary to co-localize activated receptors with downstream effectors (37Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S.

Thus, the idea of signaling from the endocytic compartment is gaining momentum. In the case of the TGFβ/activin family receptors, it is unclear whether receptor internalization is required to reach the SARA-bound Smad substrate or to what extent endosome dynamics affect TGFβ family signaling.We have addressed the intracellular localization of SARA and found that SARA is present on the early endocytic compartment, suggesting that the Smad pathway signals from the early endosome. Furthermore, SARA significantly increases endosome size, suggestive of a role in endosome dynamics. We have observed by immunofluorescence that the FYVE finger of SARA is sufficient for its endosomal targeting. So far, the identified FYVE finger proteins have been shown to require additional binding partners for targeting to endosomal membranes. Thus, EEA1 and Rabenosyn 5 require the binding of an adjacent domain to endosomal Rab5GTP (29Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M.

Rocca G.J.D. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, the idea of signaling from the endocytic compartment is gaining momentum. In the case of the TGFβ/activin family receptors, it is unclear whether receptor internalization is required to reach the SARA-bound Smad substrate or to what extent endosome dynamics affect TGFβ family signaling. We have addressed the intracellular localization of SARA and found that SARA is present on the early endocytic compartment, suggesting that the Smad pathway signals from the early endosome. Furthermore, SARA significantly increases endosome size, suggestive of a role in endosome dynamics. We have observed by immunofluorescence that the FYVE finger of SARA is sufficient for its endosomal targeting. So far, the identified FYVE finger proteins have been shown to require additional binding partners for targeting to endosomal membranes. Thus, EEA1 and Rabenosyn 5 require the binding of an adjacent domain to endosomal Rab5GTP (29Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 38Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated that the SARA FYVE finger has a higher affinity (KD of 30 nm) than those of Hrs (KD of 38 nm) and EEA1 (KD of 45 nm) for PI(3)P. This difference in KD may partially account for the fact that the SARA FYVE finger is efficiently targeted to early endosomes, whereas the EEA1 and Hrs FYVE fingers are mainly cytosolic when expressed as such (13Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 22Gaullier J.-M. Ronning E. Gillooly D.J. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24595-24600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since the dimerization of FYVE domains increases their avidity for PI(3)P-containing membranes (13Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 39Sankaran V.G. Klein D.E. Sachdeva M.M. Lemmon M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8581-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the isolated FYVE domain of SARA has a higher propensity to dimerize than those of Hrs and EEA1. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the surface plasmon resonance experiments underestimate the differences in ligand affinities, we favor the view that endosomal targeting of SARA may rely solely on binding to endosome-located PI(3)P (13Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). For instance, we did not find any direct interactions between SARA and Rab5 by the two-hybrid system (data not shown). However, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that our minimal FYVE finger construct may contain other binding elements which participate in dimerization or endosomal targeting. In the light of our initial results showing that SARA is located on early endosomes, we sought further evidence regarding the inter-relation between endosome dynamics and signaling. We reasoned that a certain level of regulation may exist at the level of this organelle and proteins, such as Rab5, regulating early endosome function may indeed alter signaling. Moreover, Rab5 has been implicated in EGFR signaling (20Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and is activated by EGF stimulation (19Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A striking finding of the present study was that Rab5S34N, a dominant-negative Rab5 mutant, stimulated transcription of a Smad-dependent promoter, in the absence of TGFβ/activins, in serum-free conditions. This activation was associated with phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins. Phosphorylation of Smads by Rab5S34N was independent of indirect effects such as establishment of a TGFβ/activin autocrine loop or depolymerization of microtubules. Indeed, microtubules sequester unphosphorylated Smads, and depolymerization of the microtubular network releases active, phosphorylated Smads by an uncharacterized mechanism (33Dong C., Li, Z. Alverez R. Feng X.-H. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of Smads by Rab5S34N occurred in serum-free conditions and since it has been previously shown that the cytoplasmic domains of type II and type I TGFβ receptors interact physically and functionally with each other in a ligand-independent manner (40Feng X.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13123-13129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to assume that Rab5S34N might be able to amplify such low-level constitutive TGFβ/activin receptor activation. Indeed, we have observed a considerable inhibition of the transcriptional activation of the Smad-dependent promoter by Rab5S34N when co-transfecting dominant-negative ALK2, ALK4, and ALK5 receptor constructs. Since Rab5S34N inhibits endocytosis, recycling, and early endosome fusion (31Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), the data suggested a regulatory role of membrane trafficking on the intensity of signaling cascades. A negligible effect of constitutively formed TGFβ-activin receptor complexes, on Smad-dependent transcription could be grossly amplified by Rab5S34N. Such amplification was unlikely to be derived from a decreased rate of endocytosis as blocking of plasma membrane endocytosis by expression of RN-tre, a specific Rab5 GAP (20Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), did not augment Smad-dependent transcription. Similarly, there was no increase in Smad-dependent transcription following inhibition of clathrin-coated pit- and caveolin-dependent plasma membrane endocytosis (41Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 42Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27237-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by the dominant-negative K44A dynamin construct (34van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 35Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). These results implied that the Rab5S34N effect was rather a consequence of decreased degradative or recycling trafficking leading to accumulation of constitutively formed TGFβ-activin type I/II receptor complexes on early endosomal membranes, where SARA-Smad complexes reside. Such accumulation of TGFβ-activin type I/II receptor complexes, and increased residence time thereof, presumably accounts for the increase in signaling observed upon RabS34N expression. Likewise, the observed reduction of activin A-induced Smad promoter transcription by the constitutively active Rab5Q79L is likely to be a consequence of enhanced receptor trafficking leading to decreased residence in the early endosomal compartment. It appears that cycling of Rab5 between GTP and GDP forms may influence the length and intensity of TGFβ/activin signaling cascades by regulating TGFβ-activin type I/II receptor trafficking via the early endocytic compartment. Indeed, it has been shown that Rab5S34N reduces epidermal growth factor receptor degradation by influencing membrane trafficking (44Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.L. Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Rab5 could exert its effects by directly binding to components of the TGFβ/activin pathway or affecting TGFβ/activin receptor kinase activity, for instance, by modulating receptor-associated kinases or phosphatases (45Griswold-Prenner I. Kamibayashi C. Maruoka E.M. Mumby M.C. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toward this end, we did not observe any direct interactions between Rab5 and SARA or Smad2/3 proteins using the yeast 2-hybrid system (data not shown). In conclusion, we have revealed a critical role of early endosomes in regulating Smad-dependent signaling. Not only is SARA localized in the early endocytic compartment but also a dominant-negative Rab5 mutant causes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smads leading to transcriptional activation of a Smad-dependent promoter. Rab5S34N not only stimulated Smad-dependent transcriptional activation, but also inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells and keratinocytes mimicking the effects of TGFβ/activins. The results suggest an interconnection between events in early endosomes with signal transduction pathways and may have important implications in understanding how cells co-ordinate their cellular functions when responding to extracellular stimuli.

X11, Fe65, mDAb-1, and JIP-1 share as a common feature the presence of phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. PTB domains are protein interaction domains that bind tyrosine residues located within the cytoplasmic tails of activated cellular receptors (22.Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V.

To investigate further the interaction between APP and the proteins identified in the yeast 2-hybrid screen, we performed glutathioneS-transferase (GST) binding and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As a negative control for these assays, we used the PTB domain of Shc A, which has been reported not to interact with APP (18.Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

Surprisingly, we found that AID and the Shc A PTB domain interact in GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr682 of the amino acid sequence YENPTY (amino acids 682–687 of the APP695isoform), the PTB-binding motif that is contained in APP, was required for the APP-Shc A interaction. Tyrosine-phosphorylated AID also interacted with Shc C, an Shc isoform expressed in the brain. Finally, we show that endogenous APP and Shc C are physically associated in the adult mouse brain.

Samples were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and then boiled with SDS loading buffer and DTT. Immunoprecipitates and total lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies included FLAG mAb (Sigma; 1:1000); APP mAb (22C11; Roche Diagnostics; 1:4000); APP polyclonal (CT695; Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Immunoblots were processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and visualized using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). In experiments using GST fusion proteins, the presence of comparable amounts of GST was verified by Ponceau Red (Sigma) staining of the nitrocellulose membranes. Pervanadate was prepared by mixing sodium orthovanadate and H2O2 and adding the mixture (or PBS for the control wells) to the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C (final concentrations, of 0.1 and 0.3 mm, respectively). The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium, the addition of ice-cold PBS containing 2 mmNa3VO4, and lysis of the cells as outlined above. Mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1976 (revised in 1983) and the animal care regulations of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Adult BALB/c mice (age 3 months) were euthanized, and brains were removed and homogenized in lysis buffer as described above. One mg of protein was used for immunoprecipitations with αAPP antibody (C7; 1:200), Shc C polyclonal antibody (Ref. 26.Pelicci G.L. Dente A. De Giuseppe B. Verducci-Galletti S. Giuli S. Mele C.

IPs were performed overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation of immunoprecipitates with Sepharose beads (25 μl per IP), washing, and immunoblots as described above. The experimental details of the yeast 2-hybrid screen by means of which we identified X11 and Fe65 and the novel APP-interacting molecule, JIP-1, have been reported (20.Scheinfeld M.H. Roncarati R.

Shc A, which contains both a PTB and an SH2 domain (Fig. 1 B), has been reported not to interact with APP (17.Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cloned the Shc A PTB domain into pcDNA3.1-FLAG to use as a negative control for the investigation of the interaction between APP and X11, Fe65, or JIP-1. The Shc A PTB domain was produced in vitro and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to either GST alone, GST-AID, or GST APP-Ccas (the latter consists of APP residues 665–695, the C-terminal caspase cleavage product of APP; see Fig. 1 A) (29.Weidemann A.

Both AID and Ccas contain the Y682ENPTY687 PTB-binding motif (Fig. 1 A) that is fully conserved from Drosophila to mammalian APP, suggesting that it has an important biological role. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the Shc A PTB domain interacted with GST-AID and, to a reduced degree, with GST-Ccas but not with GST alone. In addition, the YENPTY hexapeptide alone, with or without the 2 flanking up- and downstream amino acids, was able to pull down Shc PTB, even though the interaction was weaker (Fig. 1 C). As reported elsewhere (20.Scheinfeld M.H. Roncarati R. Vito P. Lopez P.A. Abdallah M. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), an unrelated protein, ALG-2-interacting protein (AIP)-1 (27.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), was not pulled down by GST-AID (data not shown). In addition, neither the Shc A CH1 nor the SH2 domain nor the CH2 domain of the p66 isoform of Shc A interacted with any of the GST-AID proteins (Fig. 1 D). These in vitro results suggest that AID binds the Shc A PTB domain and that although the YENPTY sequence of APP is sufficient to bind the Shc A PTB domain, the interaction is augmented by AID residues outside the YENPTY motif. For the interaction with the PTB domains of X11, mDAB-1, Fe65, and JIP-1, tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of APP is not essential (16.Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B.

Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interaction between Shc A and both the epidermal and nerve growth factor receptors is promoted by tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor's NPXY consensus PTB binding sequence (34.Dikic I.

To determine whether the binding of Shc A PTB to the GST-AID proteins was influenced by phosphorylation of the AID YENPTY motif, we expressed GST-AID in the E. coli strain TKB1 and immunoblotted the bead-bound proteins with phosphotyrosine antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation was present in the GST-AID beads when expressed in TKB1 E. coli but not in BL21 E. coli(Fig. 1 D, right panel). Compared with GST-AID, phosphorylated GST-AID bound the in vitro translated Shc A PTB to a greater degree (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Tyrosine phosphorylation of C-terminal fragments of APP has been detected in brain homogenates (35.Russo C. Salis S. Dolcini V. Venezia V. Song X.H. Teller J.K. Schettini G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a recent report (36.Zambrano N. Bruni P. Minopoli G. Mosca R. Molino D. Russo C. Schettini G. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19787-19792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) describes tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of APP by a constitutively active form of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl. In the Y682ENPTY687 motif of APP, Tyr682 (not Tyr687, as might be expected from the sequence of the NPXY consensus PTB-binding motif) was phosphorylated by constitutively active Abl (36.Zambrano N.

To investigate further the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of the YENPTY motif for the interaction with Shc A PTB, we mutated Tyr682 of AID to glycine and expressed this mutated AIDY682G in TKB1 bacteria. Tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected, suggesting that AID is phosphorylated on Tyr682 (Fig. 1 D). Compared with wild type AID, binding of Shc A PTB was reduced to background levels when Shc A PTB was incubated with AIDY682G (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of AID Tyr682 is important for the interaction with the Shc A PTB domain. APP may also be phosphorylated on Thr668 (37.Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y. Nairn A.C. Suzuki T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which may result in alteration of the conformational structure of AID and reduced interaction with at least one cytoplasmic binding partner, Fe65 (38.Ando K. Iijima K. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,39.Ramelot T.A. Nicholson L.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Thr668 for the interaction of AID with Shc A PTB, we generated two AID mutants in which Thr668 was mutated to either Ala or Glu and expressed these constructs as GST fusion proteins. Interestingly, when in vitro translated Shc A PTB was incubated either with AIDT668A or with AIDT668E, the AID-Shc A PTB interaction was reduced (Fig. 1 C). These findings indicate, as has recently been shown for Fe65 (38.Ando K. Iijima K. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), that the interaction of AID with the PTB domain of Shc A is mediated by the AID Y682ENPTY687 motif, whereas Thr668, a residue N-terminal to this motif, may modulate the interaction. To reconcile our finding that Shc PTB interacts with AID in vitro with the negative results of Margolis and co-workers (18.Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) who did not find the PTB domain of Shc A to interact with APP, we expressed FLAG-tagged Shc A PTB in 293T cells, and we repeated the pulldown experiments with GST-AID proteins, followed by SDS-PAGE and anti-FLAG immunoblotting. These experimental conditions are analogous to those used by Margolis and co-workers (18.Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, Shc A PTB interacted with AID only when phosphorylated on tyrosine, because GST-AID expressed inE. coli strain BL21 as well as AIDY682G was unable to pull down Shc PTB. In addition, the YENPTY motif alone with or without the flanking two N- and C-terminal amino acids was sufficient to precipitate Shc PTB but only when phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, neither the CH2-, CH1-, nor the SH2 domain, a phosphotyrosine interaction domain, interacted with any of the GST-AID proteins (Fig. 2 A). As expected, overexpression of full-length Shc A p66 yielded the same results,i.e. precipitation by AID or YENPTY only when phosphorylated on Tyr682 (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that the Shc A PTB domain interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated AID in mammalian cells. It is unclear why the in vitro produced Shc A PTB domain interacts with unphosphorylated AID, whereas Shc A expressed in mammalian cells interacts only with phosphorylated AID. It is possible that modifications of Shc A or interactions with other proteins in vivo modulate its interaction with AID. Next we investigated whether GST-AID could interact with endogenous Shc A in 293T cells. Phosphorylated GST-AID precipitated both the p52 and the p46 isoform of endogenous Shc A from untransfected 293T cell lysates (Fig. 2 C), and the phosphorylated YENPTY sequence was sufficient to precipitate endogenous Shc A (Fig. 2 D). We then overexpressed an APP construct comprising the 99 C-terminal amino acids that is a cleavage product of β-secretase (C99; see Fig. 1 A), along with FLAG-tagged Shc PTB. As shown in Fig. 3 A, anti-FLAG antibodies immunoprecipitated C99 in these lysates. C99 was not precipitated in lysates where only C99 or C99 together with FLAG-tagged AIP-1 was expressed. These data suggest that Shc A interacts via its PTB domain with both AID and a longer C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) in mammalian cells. Under these experimental conditions that include overexpression of both C99 and Shc A PTB, the interaction occurred even without evident exogenous tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that C99 was basally phosphorylated to a certain extent. To investigate whether full-length APP interacts with endogenous Shc A in mammalian cells, we attempted unsuccessfully to immunoprecipitate Shc A with anti-APP antibodies and vice versa. One possible explanation was that adequate tyrosine phosphorylation of the APP YENPTY motif was not"

However, instead of conjugating ubiquitin, it conjugates a ubiquitin homologue, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1), also known as UBL1, GMP1, SMTP3, PIC1, and sentrin. The SUMO-1 conjugation pathway is very similar to that of ubiquitin with regard to the primary sequences of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), the three-dimensional structures of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and the chemistry of the overall conjugation pathway. The interaction of substrates with Ubc9 has been studied using NMR spectroscopy. Peptides with sequences that correspond to those of the SUMO-1 conjugation sites from p53 and c-Jun both bind to a surface adjacent to the active site Cys93 of human Ubc9, which has been previously shown to include residues that demonstrate the most significant dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Mutations in this region, Q126A, Q130A, A131D, E132A, Y134A, and T135A, were constructed to evaluate the role of these residues in SUMO-1 conjugation. These alterations have significant effects on the conjugation of SUMO-1 with the target proteins p53, E1B, and promyelocytic leukemia protein and define a substrate binding site on Ubc9. Furthermore, the SUMO-1 conjugation site of p53 does not form any defined secondary structure when either free or bound to Ubc9. This suggests that a defined secondary structure at SUMO-1 conjugation sites in target proteins is not necessary for recognition and conjugation by the SUMO-1 pathway.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The SUMO-1 and ubiquitin conjugation pathways share many similarities (for a review on ubiquitination, see Ref. 2Jentsch S. Annu. Rev.

In the SUMO-1 pathway, SUMO-1 is first activated by a heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2) (3Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Then, SUMO-1 is transferred to the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, in a transesterification reaction whereby the C-terminal Gly of SUMO-1 is conjugated to the SH group of the active site Cys93residue of Ubc9. In the final step, SUMO-1 is transferred from the SUMO-1·Ubc9 conjugate to the target protein. Similar to the ubiquitination pathway, the C-terminal Gly residue of the SUMO-1 molecule is involved in covalent linkage to the ε-amino group on a Lys residue of the target protein. At least in vitro, the SUMO-1 pathway does not appear to require the participation of activities equivalent to ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3). The SUMO-1 pathway has diverse substrate proteins that include transcription factors (p53, c-Jun, and tramtrack), topoisomerases, GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1, oncogene product MDM-2, cell cycle-related protein CDC3, the nuclear dot protein sp100, the promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML), the bovine papillomavirus E1 protein, homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2, and IκBα, which is an inhibitor of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (1Hay R.T.

Many other proteins have been shown to interact with Ubc9, including the DNA repair proteins RAD51 and RAD52, glucocorticoid receptor, the negative regulatory domain of the Wilms' tumor gene product, CLB2 (an M-phase cyclin), and CLB5 (an S-phase cyclin). Many of these proteins may well be SUMO-1 target proteins or potential regulators of the pathway. Unlike ubiquitination, SUMO-1 modification does not target proteins for degradation. SUMO-1 conjugation to RanGAP1 and PML appears to target these proteins to the nucleus or to subnuclear structures (9Matunis M.J., Wu, J. Blobel G. J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), although the mechanism is unclear. It appears that the SUMO-1 modification machinery recognizes diverse target proteins that contain the sequence ψKXE (consensus SUMO modification site, where ψ represents a large hydrophobic residue, and X represents any residue) (17Rodriguez M.S.

Short peptides that contain the ψKXE consensus sequence were shown to be sufficient for SUMO-1 conjugation. This suggests that the consensus sequence is important for the recognition of diverse target proteins by the SUMO-1 modification system.

Furthermore, the conformational flexibility of Ubc9 has been characterized using NMR methods (26Liu Q. Yuan Y.C. Shen B. Chen D.J. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which show that Ubc9 has an overall rigid conformation but that several regions have higher than average flexibility. In particular, a few residues near the active site have high mobility on the microsecond to millisecond and picosecond to nanosecond time scales. These residues have been proposed to play a role in substrate recognition or catalytic activity. We have examined the interactions of Ubc9 with two peptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding the conjugation sites in p53 and c-Jun. Some residues surrounding the active site, Cys93, of Ubc9 showed significant chemical shift perturbation by the binding of either peptide. These residues have been altered by mutation to examine their functional significance. SUMO-1 conjugation assays using Ubc9 containing these mutations show that these amino acid residues play important roles in target protein conjugation with SUMO-1. Mutants of Ubc9 (Q126A, Q130A, A131D, E132A, Y134A, and T135A) were created using a three-stage PCR process as described previously (27Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), using external primers 5′-CCAAGCGGAGCCCAAGCTTGTCGACATGCTTATGAGGGCGCAAACTTCTTGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGAGATATACCATGGGCCATCATCATC-3′, the D primer 5′-CCAAGCGGAGCCC-3′, and the mutant internal primers (5′-GGAACTTCTAAATGAACCAAATATCGCAGACCCAGCTCAAGCAGAGG-3′ (Q126A), 5′-CCAAATATCCAAGACCCAGCTGCAGCAGAGGCCTACACGATTTACTG-3′ (Q130A), 5′-TATCCAAGACCCAGCTCAAGACGAGGCCTACACGATTTACTGCC-3′ (A131D), 5′-CCAAGACCCAGCTCAAGCAGCGGCCTACACGATTTACTGCCAAAACAG-3′ (E132A), 5′-GACCCAGCTCAAGCAGAGGCCGCCACGATTTACTGCCAAAACAGAG-3′ (Y134A), and 5′-GCTCAAGCAGAGGCCTACGCGATTTACTGCCAAAACAGAGTGGAG-3′ (T135A)). Wild-type (wt) human Ubc9 and the mutants were subcloned into vector PET28 as described previously (28Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate a recombinant p53 substrate, GST was fused to an 11-amino acid sequence (381KKLMFKTEGPD391) representing amino acids 381–391 of p53 (17Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This was constructed by annealing the primers 5′-GATCCAAAAAATTGATGTTCAAGACGGAAGGCCCTGACTAGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCTAGTCAGGGCCTTTCCGTCTTGAACATCAATTTTTG-3′ before insertion into a pGEX2T expression plasmid cleaved withBamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. GST and the 11-amino acid p53 modification site were separated by a recognition motif (EPVYFQG) for the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease (29Dougherty W.G. Parks T.D. Virology. 1989; 172: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as described previously (30Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

GST-PML represents GST fused to residues 485–495 from human PML (PRKVIKMESEE) and was cloned by annealing the primers 5′-GATCCCCCCGAAAAGTTATTAAAATGGAATCCGAAAGAATGAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTCATTCTTCGGATTCCATTTTAATAACTTTTCG- GGGG-3′. GST-E1B represents GST fused to residues 99–109 from adenovirus E1B (GLKGVKRERGA). Cloned by annealing the primers 5′-GATCCGGTTTGAAGGGTGTTAAGCGTGAACGTGGTGCTTAGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCTAAGCACCACGTTCACGCTTAACACCCTTCAAACCG-3′. All DNA constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Recombinant SAE1/SAE2, SUMO-1, C52A-SUMO-1, and GST fusion p53, PML, and E1B peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli B834 and purified as described previously (30Tatham M.H. Jaffray E.

For Ubc9 and its mutants, E. coliBL21DE3 cells containing the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB media or M-9 minimal media containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin supplemented with trace minerals and basal medium Eagle vitamins.15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and/or [13C]glucose (2 g/liter) was used as the only nitrogen and carbon sources for 15N and/or 13C labeling. Expression of the protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 1.0 mm when the cells had grown to an A595 nm of 0.6–0.8. Cells were harvested 3–4 h after induction, and cell pellets were then suspended in buffer A (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The protein was extracted by sonication and centrifugation at 16,500 rpm for 50 min. The wt and mutant Ubc9 proteins were purified on columns packed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as follows. The supernatant was loaded onto the column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A, followed by 10 volumes of buffer B (20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and then eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer C (600 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The eluted proteins were concentrated and then exchanged to the buffer for the NMR studies (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm dithiothreitol, in 90% H2O/10% D2O). The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of the protein was estimated using Bradford's method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and one-dimensional proton NMR spectra. In addition, the structural integrity of the mutant proteins was confirmed by one-dimensional proton NMR spectra. All other recombinant protein concentrations were determined or verified using Bradford's method or calculated extinction coefficients for absorbance measurements at 280 nm. The p53 and c-Jun peptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis in the Peptide and Nucleic Acid Synthesis Facility of the City of Hope National Medical Center and verified by mass spectroscopy. The p53 peptide contains the last 30 amino acid residues of p53: AHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD (the target lysine is shown in bold). The c-Jun peptide contains 25 amino acid residues corresponding to the sequence at the SUMO-1 modification site of c-Jun: QMPVQHPRLQALKEEPQTVPEMPGE. The p53 and c-Jun peptides were dissolved in NMR buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.02% NaN3, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 90% H2O/10% D2O) at concentrations of 10 and 25 mm, respectively. All NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian UNITY-plus 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with four channels, pulse shaping, and z-axis pulsed field gradient capabilities. The resonance assignments of the p53 peptide were obtained using two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY, ROESY, and TOCSY spectra. The spectral width in both dimensions was 5995 Hz, with carrier frequency set at the water resonance. All three spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode (TPPI), using 512 and 1024 complex points in the F1 and F2 dimensions, respectively. NOESY experiments were performed using mixing times of 100 and 300 ms. ROESY experiments were performed using mixing times of 150 and 250 ms. TOCSY spectra were acquired with a clean-DIPSI-2 sequence with a mixing time of 54 ms (for a review of NMR methods, see Ref. 33Wüthrich K. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Google Scholar). Titration of the p53 or c-Jun peptide to Ubc9 was performed as follows. A sample of 0.7 mm15N-labeled Ubc9 was titrated with 10 mm p53 peptide or 25 mm c-Jun peptide to molar ratios of 1:3.9 or 1:11, respectively. Titration with the p53 and c-Jun peptides took 8 and 11 steps, respectively. At each titration point, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra (34Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar) were recorded for bound 15N-labeled Ubc9. In addition, two-dimensional ω1-15N-half-filtered TOCSY and ω1-15N-half-filtered NOESY (35Ikura M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2433-2440Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 36Chen Y. Reizer J. Saier M.H., Jr. Fairbrother W.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) were recorded for bound p53 at molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2.4, and 1:3.9. The spectral widths in the HSQC spectroscopy experiments were 1300 Hz in F1 and 6000 Hz in F2 dimensions, with 128 and 512 complex points in the F1 and F2 dimensions, respectively. In the ω1-half-filtered TOCSY and NOESY spectra, quadrature detections in the F1 dimension were achieved using the TPPI approach. In these experiments, spectral widths of 5995 Hz were used in both dimensions, and 512 and 1024 complex points were used in the F1 and F2 dimensions, respectively. Linear prediction in the indirect dimension and zero-filling in both dimensions were used before Fourier transformation. The peptides and Ubc9 have a fast exchange rate with respect to the differences in chemical shifts between the free and bound forms. Therefore, a single resonance is observed, which is the population-weighted average of the chemical shifts of the free and bound forms. Under this condition, the dissociation constant can be estimated based on chemical shift changes. The resonances of residue Ala129, which have the largest chemical shift changes upon formation of the complex, were used to estimateKd. The surface electrostatic potentials for Ubc9 were calculated using the DelPhi module of INSIGHTII (MSI, Inc.) and the crystal structure of Ubc9 (21Giraud M.F. Desterro J.M. Naismith J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,24Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21381-21387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The solvent dielectric constant was set to 80. The radius of the probe water molecule was 1.4. The grids in the calculation of the electrostatic potentials were with a spacing of 1.5. Secondary structure prediction was done using the PHD program on the entire sequences of RanGAP1, c-Jun, and PML and the first 100 amino acids of IκBα (10Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,11Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 14Desterro J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Sequences were deemed to be helical only when the program returned a probability value of ≥5 for two or more adjacent amino acid residues. Conjugation assays were set up using 6.44 μm125I-labeled SUMO-1-C52A and various concentrations of defined GST tag substrates (see above). SUMO-1-C52A was used instead of the wt to avoid experimental interference from the formation of SUMO-1-SUMO-1 disulfide-linked dimers. Assays were performed in 10-μl reaction volumes and also contained an ATP regeneration system described above (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 unit·ml−1 creatine kinase), 0.6 unit·ml−1inorganic pyrophosphatase, 120 ng of SAE1/SAE2, and 2.76 μm of each Ubc9 protein. Under these conditions wt-Ubc9 was seen to be rate-limiting, and the increase in concentration of the GST substrate-SUMO-1 conjugate was proportional to time over the 60-min incubation time (data not shown). Each Ubc9 mutant was assayed in triplicate using concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 μmof three different GST substrates. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min before the addition of SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Assay samples were subsequently fractionated by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, stained, destained, and dried before phosphorimaging analysis. Initial reaction velocity rates (V0) could then be calculated and used to extrapolate kinetic information for each Ubc9 mutant for three different recombinant substrates. It has been shown recently that short peptides containing the SUMO-1 modification consensus sequence, ψKXE, are sufficient forin vitro SUMO-1 modification by Ubc9 (17Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). We used chemical shift perturbation to determine whether peptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding the SUMO-1 conjugation sites of p53 and c-Jun form specific interactions with Ubc9 and to determine which residues from Ubc9 are involved in the interaction. The sequences of the two peptides are given in Fig. 1A. Chemical shift perturbation is extremely sensitive to molecular interactions and has been widely used to map binding surfaces. Specific chemical shift changes usually correlate to specific interactions. When two molecules form a specific complex, changes in the environments of the nuclei at the interface will inevitably cause changes in chemical shifts. Conformational changes due to the interaction will result in additional chemical shift perturbation beyond the direct contacting surface. Because chemical shift perturbation is sensitive to specific interactions over a wide range of affinities, it has been successfully used in drug screening to identify molecules that bind to a protein target. This approach is known as “SAR (structureactivity relationship) by NMR” (38Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). 15N-1H HSQC spectra were used to identify the interaction between Ubc9 and the p53 or c-Jun peptide and to map the binding site of these peptides on Ubc9. 15N-enriched Ubc9 and unlabeled p53 or c-Jun peptides were used for this study.15N-1H HSQC spectroscopy selectively observes signals from Ubc9 in the complex with the p53 and c-Jun peptides. Specific chemical shift perturbation was observed in1H-15N HSQC spectra of Ubc9 upon complex formation with the p53 or c-Jun peptide. These changes were consistent from the beginning of the titration, when the concentration of Ubc9 was ∼0.7 mm and that of the p53 (or c-Jun) peptide was 0.3 mm (or 0.5 mm for the c-Jun peptide), until the final concentrations of Ubc9 and the p53 (or c-Jun) peptide reached ∼0.6 and 2.3 mm respectively (or 0.5 mm for Ubc9 and 6.0 mm for the c-Jun peptide). The affinity of the interaction between Ubc9 and the p53 or c-Jun peptide was estimated as described under “Materials and Methods” from the chemical shift changes of Ala129, and the dissociation constant was ∼3–6 mm (data not shown). Superpositions of the HSQC spectra of free Ubc9 and that in complex with the p53 and c-Jun peptides are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. Plots of chemical shift changes in Ubc9 upon binding to the p53 and c-Jun peptides versus residue number are shown in Fig. 2A. The low affinity is partly responsible for the small chemical shift changes observed. Residues that show significant chemical shift changes induced by the p53 and c-Jun peptides are indicated in red in the three-dimensional structure of Ubc9 as shown in Fig. 2B. Most resonances of Ubc9 were not affected, indicating that complex formation does not cause overall conformational changes in Ubc9. Both peptides, which have no apparent sequence similarity outside the consensus sequence, produced similar chemical shift changes in residues surrounding the active site Cys93 of Ubc9. Ala129 displays the largest chemical shift change that accompanies binding to either peptide. The side chain of Ala129 approaches that of the conjugation active site Cys93, and the two side chains are less than 5 Å apart. In addition, residues Leu94, Glu99, Gln126, and most of the observable residues between residues 129 and 135 show significant chemical shift changes. This surface is adjacent to the conjugation active site. Residue Val148 also displayed chemical shift changes induced by complex formation with both peptides. This residue is next to the segment composed of residues 129–135 in the structure. Because both peptides produced similar chemical shift changes in residues near Cys93, it is likely that these residues are important for target protein recognition. A number of residues that are not adjacent to the active site also show some chemical shift perturbation specific to either the c-Jun or p53 peptide. It is most likely that these correspond to nonspecific interactions. For example, some residues that only show chemical shift changes upon binding of the p53 peptide are scattered on a surface that has a strong negative electrostatic potential. The p53 peptide has a net overall positive charge; therefore, the p53 peptide and this surface on Ubc9 have opposing electrostatic potentials, and nonspecific interactions between them may occur. Electrostatic interactions are generally long range and not highly specific and may generate the pattern of chemical shift changes observed in these residues. In the SUMO-1 pathway, the Ubc9·SUMO-1 conjugate interacts with target proteins, to which it attaches SUMO-1. To investigate whether the residues near the active site of Ubc9 identified by NMR chemical shift perturbation studies are relevant to target protein recognition in the SUMO-1 pathway, the mutants Q126A, Q130A, A131D, E132A, Y134A, and T135A were made and tested in in vitro conjugation assays. The side chains of these amino acid residues are located on the surface of the protein, and their alteration did not cause overall structural disruption, as determined by one-dimensional NMR analysis of the mutant proteins (Fig.3). The region of the spectra displayed (Fig. 3) corresponds to signals of methyl and methylene groups, which include those from amino acid residues in the hydrophobic core of the protein, such as Ile, Leu, and Val. The one-dimensional spectra indicate that the mutants have three-dimensional structures very similar to that of the wt protein. The residue showing the largest chemical shift perturbation in the NMR binding studies, Ala129, was not altered due to its apparent involvement in important hydrophobic contacts in the Ubc9 structure. To probe the roles of these residues in substrate modification by the SUMO-1 pathway, steady-state kinetics studies were conducted for the wild-type and mutant versions of Ubc9. In both ubiquitin and SUMO modification pathways, the E1 enzyme catalyzes three distinct reactions: (a) adenylation of SUMO, (b) formation of E1-SUMO thiolester, and (c) transfer of SUMO from E1 to form a E2-SUMO thiolester (39Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the previously described reactions in the ubiquitin systems, the reactions mediated by the SUMO-activating enzyme occur very quickly, and the overall rate of the conjugation reaction is limited by the rate at which Ubc9 transfers SUMO to substrates, (in the absence of an E3 enzyme). 2M. H. Tatham et al., submitted for publication. There are two reactions involving Ubc9: (a) formation of SUMO-Ubc9 thiolester, and (b) transfer of SUMO from Ubc9 to substrates. This reaction therefore fits the ping-pong Bi Bi mechanis"

Nuclear IRS-1 was detected in T-antigen-positive cell lines and in T-antigen-positive biopsies from patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma. The IRS-1 domain responsible for a direct JC virus T-antigen binding was localized within the N-terminal portion of IRS-1 molecule, and the binding was independent from IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and was strongly inhibited by IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. In addition, competition for the IRS-1-T-antigen binding by a dominant negative mutant of IRS-1 inhibited growth and survival of JC virus T-antigen-transformed cells in anchorage-independent culture conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a novel role for the IRS-1-T-antigen complex in controlling cellular equilibrium during viral infection.

Keller S.R. Morrione A. Lienhard G.E. Baserga R. Surmacz E. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 557-562PubMed Google Scholar). Other reports have confirmed the transforming potential of IRS-1. Elevated levels of IRS-1 have been detected in human pancreatic cancer, in early stages of hepatocellular carcinomas, in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, and in medulloblastomas (17.Bergmann U.

Finally, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which possess functional IGF-IR, are easily transformed by IRS-1 overexpression alone (4.D'Ambrosio C. Keller S.R. Morrione A. Lienhard G.E. Baserga R. Surmacz E. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 557-562PubMed Google Scholar). The aforementioned interaction between IRS-1 and the simian virus 40 T-antigen prompted us to investigate whether human counterpart of the SV40 T-antigen, JCV T-antigen, interacts with IRS-1 and whether such an interaction may actually contribute to the transformation in humans. insulin receptor substrate 1 insulin-like growth factor I IGF-I receptor pleckstrin homology domain GFP OKA, okadaic acid JC virus empty retroviral vector The human neurotropic polyomavirus JC (JCV) asymptomatically infects nearly 90% of the human population (21.Padgett B.L.

The early genome of this virus encodes the regulatory protein JCV T-antigen, which has transforming properties in vitro, induces tumors of neuronal origin in experimental animals (22.Krynska B.

In this article we report for the first time immunocytochemical detection of nuclear IRS-1 in JCV T-antigen-positive murine medulloblastoma cell lines, in fibroblasts stably transfected with JCV T-antigen cDNA, and in living cells expressing a GFP-IRS-1 fusion protein. Importantly, IRS-1 co-precipitates with the JCV T-antigen, and the interaction is independent of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and is strongly inhibited by IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. We further show that the IRS-1-JCV T-antigen binding is direct, that it maps within the N-terminal portion of IRS-1, and that the N-terminal fragment (PH/PTB) efficiently competes for the T-antigen binding and inhibits anchorage-independent growth of JCV T-antigen-positive medulloblastoma cell lines. Importantly, nuclear IRS-1 was detected in human medulloblastoma biopsies that were also positive for anti-JCV T-antigen immunostaining. Based on these findings, we postulate that the interaction with T-antigen may uncouple IRS-1 from its surface receptors initiating series of nuclear events, which in turn could affect JCV T-antigen-mediated cellular transformation. We used four cell lines Bs-1a, BsB8, BsB13, and BsB14 derived from cerebellar medulloblastoma of transgenic mice expressing the early genome of the archetype form JC virus (23.Krynska B. Del Valle L. Gordon J. Otte J. Croul S. Khalili K. Virology. 2000; 274: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,26.Khalili K. Krynska B. Del Valle L. Katsetos C.D. Croul S. Lancet. 1999; 353: 1152-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bs-1a cells are JCV T-antigen-negative, and BsB8, BsB13, and BsB14 are JCV T-antigen-positive. R600 embryo fibroblasts (27.Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28.Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were developed from R− cells, which originated from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR gene (29.Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). R600 cells were transiently transfected with PCDNA3zeo/JCVT plasmid by calcium phosphate reagents from Promega. Culture conditions and characterization of LNCaP cells, which are IRS-1-negative prostate cancer cells, and LNCaP cells stably expressing different mutants of IRS-1 are described in our previous work (13.Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Tu X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Finally, anchorage-independent growth of BsB8 and Bs-1a cells was evaluated in 35-mm culture dishes covered with PolyHema (Aldrich) by the methodology routinely used in our laboratory (20.Wang J.Y. Del Valle L. Gordon J. Rubini M. Romano G. Croul S. Peruzzi F. Khalili K. Reiss K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3857-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27.Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q.

We employed thin paraffin sections and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex system (Vectastain Elite ABC peroxidase kit; Vector Laboratories). The sections were processed according to the protocol previously described (20.Wang J.Y. Del Valle L. Gordon J. Rubini M. Romano G. Croul S. Peruzzi F. Khalili K. Reiss K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3857-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25.Del Valle L. Gordon J. Assimakopoulou M. Enam S. Geddes J.F. Varakis J.N. Katsetos C.D. Croul S. Khalili K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4287-4293PubMed Google Scholar). We used rabbit anti-IRS-1 antibodies that recognize either C-terminal portion of IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or N-terminal IRS-1 (A-19; Santa Cruz) and rabbit anti-SV40 T-antigen (Oncogene) that cross-reacts with JCV T-antigen (25.Del Valle L. Gordon J. Assimakopoulou M. Enam S. Geddes J.F. Varakis J.N. Katsetos C.D. Croul S. Khalili K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4287-4293PubMed Google Scholar) as primary antibodies. Biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) was used as a secondary antibody. For monolayer cultures, we used rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to fluoresceine (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and rhodamine (Vector). To avoid cross-reactivity between secondary antibodies, the cells were first incubated with anti-T-antigen antibody, and with the anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Following intensive washing, the cells were incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody and with corresponding anti-rabbit rodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. For all immunocyto- and immunohistochemical staining, we performed routine controls by omitting primary antibody or by using irrelevant, anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody instead of primary antibodies. We used rabbit anti-SV40 T-antigen (Ab-2; Oncogene) antibody that recognizes JCV T-antigen for both Western blot detection and immunoprecipitation of JCV T-antigen. For IRS-1 immunoprecipitation and Western blot, we used anti-rabbit IRS-1 antibody that recognizes the C-terminal portion of the IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology). To detect the PH/PTB mutant, we employed rabbit antibody that recognizes epitope mapping at the N terminus of IRS-1 (A-19, Santa Cruz). To determine tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, quiescent cells (48 h in serum-free medium) were stimulated with IGF-I (50 ng ml−1), or were left without stimulation (hypophosphorylated IRS-1), and total proteins were extracted 15 min later. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of protein extract with rabbit anti-IRS-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and agarose-conjugated protein A (Calbiochem). Corresponding blots were developed first with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20; Transduction Laboratories) and reprobed with N-terminal anti-IRS-1 antibody (Santa Cruz). We induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by incubating BsB8 cells with 2 μm okadaic acid (Sigma) for 40 min and monitored the effectiveness of the procedure by mobility shift (13.Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Tu X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We cloned JCV T-antigen cDNA (31.Safak M. Gallia G.L. Ansari S.A. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10146-10157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (PCR-amplified) into theKpnI/EcoRI site of pcDNA3zeo expression vector (Invitrogen). The start primer was 5′-CGGggtaccATGGACAAAGTGCTGAATAG-3′, and the end primer was 5′-CCGgaattcGCTTTACTTAACAGTTGCAG-3′. Lowercase letters correspond to the KpnI and EcoRI sites, respectively. GFP-IRS-1 fusion protein was prepared by cloning PCR-amplified IRS-1 cDNA (13.Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Tu X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) into HindIII site of pLEGFP-N1 retroviral expression system (Promega). The start primer was 5′-TCACCCaagcttATGGCGAGCCCTCCGGATAC-3′, and the end primer was 5′-TCACCCaagcttTTGACGATCCTCTGGCTGC-3′. Lowercase letters correspond to the HindIII restriction site. In an attempt to prepare IRS-1 cDNA fragments with the GST sequence at the 5′ end, the cDNA inserts were produced by PCR with a pCMV/IRS-1 plasmid as a DNA template (13.Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Tu X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to amplify IRS-1 truncation mutants: IRS-1 (1–300), start primer, 5′-CGggatccTCATGGCGAGCCCTCCGGATAC-3′, and end primer, 5′-CGgaattcAAGTTCGAGATCTCCGAGTCAG-3′; IRS-1 (212–529), start primer, 5′-CGggatccTCTGGATGCAAGTGGATGAC-3′, and end primer, 5′-CGgaattcAAATGGTAGGAGATGTGCCTG-3′; IRS-1 (462–740), start primer, 5′-CGggatccCTGCATGGGTGGCAAGGG-3′, and end primer, 5′-CGgaattcAGCTGCTGGTGTTGGAATCTC-3′; IRS-1 (701–1000), start primer, 5′-ATAAGAATgcggccgcACCATACTCATGCCCTTCC-3′, and end primer, 5′-ATAAGAATgcggccgcTCATGGTGAGGTATCCACATAGC-3′; and IRS-1 (931–1233), start primer, 5′-CGggatccCTGGCTCGGAAGAGTACATG-3′, and end primer, 5′-CGgaattcATTGACGATCCTCTGGCTGC-3′. With the exception of the IRS-1 (701–1000) mutant, all of the start primers contain BamHI restriction sites, and end primers contain EcoRI restriction sites in the overhangs, which are shown in lowercase letters. Because IRS-1 (701–1000) mutant contains an internalEcoRI site, a NotI restriction site was introduced instead. The correct size products were excised from the gel and purified with a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified PCR products were digested with BamHI andEcoRI restriction enzymes, ligated intoBamHI/EcoRI cloning sites of pGEX-5X-3, and sequenced to check for eventual misincorporations. IRS-1 (701–1000) mutant was digested with NotI and cloned into theNotI site of pGEX-5X-3. We expressed and purified GST-IRS-1 fusion proteins according to previously described protocol (31.Safak M. Gallia G.L. Ansari S.A. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10146-10157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, radiolabeled JCV T-antigen was synthesized with the transcription and translation-coupled wheat germ extract system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). For thein vitro binding assays, we used 3 μl of35S-labeled, in vitro translated JCV T-antigen (95 kDa) and 5 μg of GST or appropriate GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS/PAGE. We obtained a total of 17 human medulloblastoma samples from the pathology archives (Medical College of Pennsylvania-Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical resections were histologically classified according to the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Nervous System. To investigate a potential involvement of IRS-1 in JCV T-antigen-associated transformation, we analyzed the levels of the expression and the localization of IRS-1 in JCV T-antigen-negative (Fig. 1, a–c) and JCV T-antigen-positive (Fig. 1, d–f) medulloblastomas cell lines. The cell lines derived from transgenic mice expressing the early genome of the archetype form of the JC virus (22.Krynska B. Otte J. Franks R. Khalili K. Croul S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These mice develop cerebellar tumors characterized by the presence of JCV T-antigen-positive and -negative cells. On this basis we have developed both JCV T-antigen-positive and -negative medulloblastoma cell lines (23.Krynska B. Del Valle L. Gordon J. Otte J. Croul S. Khalili K. Virology. 2000; 274: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 b at low magnification and in Fig. 1 c at higher magnification, JCV T-antigen-negative cells (Bs-1a) are characterized by a typical cytoplasmic IRS-1 immunostaining. In contrast, JCV T-antigen-positive cells (BsB8) have a strong nuclear and much less apparent cytoplasmic immunostaining for IRS-1 (Fig. 1, e and f). Nuclear localization IRS-1 in JCV T-antigen-positive cells prompted us to confirm this unexpected finding by other methodologies. Within 48 h after retroviral delivery of GFP fused in frame with IRS-1 cDNA, we detected a strong nuclear fluorescence from living cultures of T-antigen-positive BsB8 cells (Fig. 2, e and f) and a predominant cytoplasmatic fluorescence in T-antigen-negative Bs-1a cells (Fig. 2, b and c). Fig. 2 (c andf) shows the exact localization of the IRS-1-associated green fluorescence in monolayer cultures by superimposing the phase contrast images (Fig. 2, a and d) with corresponding fluorescent images (Fig. 2, b ande). Therefore, by employing two independent experimental techniques, immunocytochemistry and the expression of GFP-IRS-1 fusion protein, we show that cells expressing JCV T-antigen translocate substantial amounts of IRS-1 from cytoplasm to the nuclear compartment of the cell. The availability of JCV T-antigen-positive cell lines that express relatively high levels of the IRS-I protein (20.Wang J.Y. Del Valle L. Gordon J. Rubini M. Romano G. Croul S. Peruzzi F. Khalili K. Reiss K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3857-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) allowed us to determine whether JCV T-antigen and IRS-1 co-localize within the nucleus. BsB8 cells were double stained with anti-IRS-1 and anti-T-antigen antibodies (Fig. 3, a–c). The majority of BsB8 cells in the field showed a typical nuclear T-antigen staining visualized as green fluorescence (Fig. 3 a). The cells showed a weak cytoplasmic and strong nuclear immunoreactivity with anti-IRS-1 antibody as red fluorescence (Fig. 3 b). Finally, by superimposing Fig. 3 a with Fig. 3 b, we visualized (in yellow) nuclear co-localization of IRS-1 and JCV T-antigen (Fig. 3 c). Using the same approach, IRS-1 was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm of the T-antigen-negative Bs-1a cells (Fig. 3, d–f). To determine whether T-antigen-mediated IRS-1 translocation to the nucleus is cell type-specific, R600 mouse embryo fibroblasts (27.Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were transfected with an expression vector containing JCV T-antigen cDNA (pcDNA3/zeo/JCVT). Within 48 h after transfection, three of 10 cells depicted in the field were positive for T-antigen (Fig. 3 g). Only these three cells showed IRS-1 in the nucleus (Fig. 3 h) and its nuclear co-localization with JCV T-antigen (Fig. 3 i). The other seven cells, which do not express T-antigen, demonstrated that IRS-1 localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. This observation further verifies that IRS-1 translocation to the nucleus is associated with JCV T-antigen and that the process is not limited to cells of nervous system lineage. A possible molecular interaction between IRS-1 and JCV T-antigen was characterized by immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis in three T-antigen-positive medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig. 4 a, lanes 2–4). As expected, the immunocomplex was not detected in T-antigen-negative Bs-1a cells (lane 1) or in control samples tested with irrelevant primary antibody (not shown). The association between IRS-1 and JCV T-antigen was then confirmed, in reverse, by initially immunoprecipitating T-antigen and then developing the blot with anti-IRS-1 antibody (Fig. 4 a, lower panel). We next asked whether the IRS-1-JCV T-antigen interaction depends on the state of IRS-1 phosphorylation. This is particularly important, because IRS-1 has multiple tyrosine and serine residues, whose state of phosphorylation regulate IRS-1 function (32.Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Culturing BsB8 cells in serum-free medium maintains IRS-1 in a hypophosphorylated state. IGF-I treatment induces IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and treatment with okadaic acid (OKA) induces IRS-1 phosphorylation on serine residues (33.D'Ambrosio C. Valentinis B. Prisco M. Reiss K. Rubini M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3264-3271PubMed Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation of IRS-1, the resulting Western blots (Fig. 4 b) were processed with anti-T-antigen antibody (top panel), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (middle panel), and anti-IRS-1 antibody (bottom panel). Both the hypophosphorylated form of IRS-1 and IRS-1 phosphorylated on tyrosine residues bound JCV T-antigen equally well. In contrast, the binding was severely impaired in cells treated with OKA, which induces IRS-1 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 b, top panel). The middle panel of Fig. 4 b shows that following IGF-I stimulation, IRS-1 is heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The blot was purposely overexposed to visualize residual IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in serum-free medium or following OKA treatment. Finally, the bottom panel of Fig. 4 b shows that IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated equally in all three samples. Notably, the band corresponding to IRS-1 after the OKA treatment migrates significantly slower than other two IRS-1 bands on the blot. Because the mobility shift is considered a hallmark of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation (34.Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), this additionally confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment with OKA. If serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 decreases T-antigen binding, one would expect a gradual loss of nuclear IRS-1 and its reappearance in the cytoplasm in the presence of OKA. Prior to OKA treatment, GFP/IRS fusion protein was detected predominantly in the nuclei of BsB8/GFP-IRS cells (Fig. 4 c). Within 6 h after the addition of OKA, cytoplasmic fluorescence became much more intense (Fig. 4 d), and after 12 h, the majority of the GFP-IRS-1 was observed in the cytoplasm, and some remained still in the nucleus (Fig. 4 e). Because longer treatment with OKA resulted in massive cell death, we were not able to reach the point in which GFP/IRS-1 could be visible exclusively within the cytoplasm. The above results indicate that IRS-1 binding to JCV T-antigen is not only responsible for IRS-1 translocation but also may play a role in maintaining IRS-1 within the nuclear compartment. A series of IRS-1 truncation mutants were employed in a GST pull-down assay to characterize the region responsible for the interaction with JCV T-antigen. The strongest T-antigen binding mapped within the first 300-amino acid stretch of IRS-1 (Fig. 5 a). This region of IRS-1 contains a PH domain and a PTB domain (6.White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 (Suppl. 2): 2-17Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 32.Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The other mutant still capable of pulling down T-antigen comprises the region between amino acids 212 and 529. Because this part of IRS-1 overlaps with 97 amino acids of the PTB domain, it is likely that the PTB domain is involved in T-antigen binding. On the other hand, the PH/PTB fragment binds T-antigen more efficiently than the 212–529 fragments, suggesting the possibility of more than one binding site for T-antigen in PH/PTB region. The other mutants spanning the entire C-terminal fragment of IRS-1 did not bind T-antigen. To test the ability of the PH/PTB domain to function as a dominant negative mutant competing for the IRS-1-T-antigen binding, we prepared protein extracts from BsB8 cells transduced either with the PH/PTB cDNA or with the EV. Following selection, the mixed population of transduced BsB8 cells expressed PH/PTB protein (Fig. 5 b,lane 2) as compared with the PH/PTB band from the previously characterized LN/PH/PTB cells (lane 1), which overexpress PH/PTB and do not express wild type IRS-1 (13.Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Tu X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Morrione A. Tu X. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2687-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We precipitated T-antigen from both BsB8/EV cells (lane 4) and BsB8/PH/PTB cells (lane 5). The apparent weaker binding detected in BsB8/PH/PTB cells suggests a dominant negative action of the PH/PTB fragment against the binding between endogenous IRS-1 and T-antigen. We further evaluated whether expression of the"

UV irradiation alters the expression of multiple genes that encode functions to repair DNA damage, arrest cell growth, and induce apoptosis. In addition, UV irradiation inhibits protein synthesis, although the mechanism is not known. In this report, we show that UV irradiation induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 on the α-subunit (eIF2α) and inhibits protein synthesis in a dosage- and time-dependent manner. The UV-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α was prevented by the overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant of eIF2α (S51A). PERK is an eIF2α protein kinase localized to the endoplasmic reticulum that is activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of trans- dominant-negative mutants of PERK also prevented eIF2α phosphorylation upon UV treatment and protected from the associated translation attenuation. The luminal domain of dominant-negative mutant PERK formed heterodimers with endogenous PERK to inhibit the PERK signaling pathway. In contrast, eIF2α phosphorylation was not inhibited by overexpression of a trans-dominant-negative mutant kinase, PKR, supporting the theory that UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation is specifically mediated by PERK. These results support a novel mechanism by which UV irradiation regulates translation via an endoplasmic reticulum-stress signaling pathway.

PERK contains a signal peptide (amino acids 1–31) and a domain (amino acids 32–521) that resides in the ER lumen and shares 20% identity with the ER-stress-sensing luminal domain of mammalian IRE1 (an ER resident transmembrane kinase). The Ser/Thr protein kinase domain (amino acids 589–1114) is 40% identical to the kinase domain of the double-stranded RNA-activated eIF2α protein kinase PKR. PERK specifically phosphorylates the serine 51 residue of eIF2α in vitro and in vivo and thereby inhibits translation initiation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α limits the frequency of polypeptide chain initiation in general, although it can permit the preferential translation of certain mRNAs, possibly those that have open reading frames within the 5′-untranslated regions or those that have internal ribosomal entry sites (11Hinnebusch A.G.

One mRNA selectively translated under these conditions encodes the basic leucine zipper-containing activating transcription factor ATF4 that likely contributes to ER-stress-induced transcription as a component of the unfolded protein response. Expression of a catalytically inactive PERK kinase mutant (K618A) acts in a trans-dominant-negative manner to protect eIF2α from phosphorylation (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PERK results in spontaneous activation to inhibit translation of its own mRNA (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the isolated luminal domain of PERK (PERKΔC) inhibits ER-stress-induced expression of a subset of unfolded protein-responsive genes such as BiP and CHOP10 (GADD153) (8Harding H.P.

However, the mechanism for UV-induced protein synthesis inhibition is not clear. It was proposed that UV-induced translational inhibition undergoes a ribotoxic stress signaling pathway, which is based on the fact that the UV-induced translational inhibition is correlated with rRNA damage and JNK activation (16Iordanov M.S.

In this article we provide evidence that UV irradiation induces phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibits protein synthesis in intact cells. We also provide evidence that the UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and translational inhibition are mediated by PERK through an ER-stress signaling pathway. The myc-tagged PERK and PERK (K618A) expression vectors (in pcDNA1, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were kindly provided by Dr. David Ron (New York University School of Medicine). Using restriction enzyme digestion and ligation we subcloned the genes into the mammalian expression vector pETFVA−, which is identical to the other expression vectors (PKR mutants, eIF2α, and eIF2α-51A) used in our experiments. The luminal domain of PERK (PERKΔC, amino acids 1–536) was amplified from pcDNA1-PERK using the PCR method. A high fidelity DNA polymerase (Pwo, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for the PCR. A T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMG) was added to the C terminus of PERKΔC. The PCR products were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pETFVA−. To construct the pBiP-EGFP vector the BiP promoter was excised from pGL3-BiP using restriction enzyme digestion and was subcloned into pd2EGFP-1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which encodes a short-lived form of EGFP. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). MCF-7 and hamster insulinoma tumor (HIT) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). All of the above reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. For construction of an MCF-7 cell line that expresses PERKΔC the PERKΔC was subcloned from pETFVA−-PERKΔC into the pZ vector to form pZ-PERKΔC. MCF-7 cells were transfected with pZ-PERKΔC using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (0.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen). Expression of PERKΔC was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-PERK antibody. The PERKΔC stably transfected MCF-7-PERKΔC cells were identified and cultured in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. MCF-7 cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 105cells per well at 18 h pretransfection. The cells were transfected with pd2EGFP-BiP (0.8 μg/well) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 18 h post-transfection, the cells were irradiated with 30 J/m2UVC. The images of EGFP expression were then captured by an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) using a Kodak M290 camera (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an exposure time of 0.25 s. The expression of GFP was quantified by Image* Pro Plus 4.1 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD) for each cell count integrated optical density of the green channel. Merged cells were manually separated, and artifacts (items or noise too small to be cells) were removed before the quantitation. The average integrated optical density per cell was generated by Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Co., Seattle, WA). UVC was generated from a 15-watt UVC light source (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). The intensity of UVC was standardized using a UV meter (UVP Inc.) and set at 3 watts/m2. The medium was withdrawn during the UVC irradiation. After UV irradiation fresh medium was added to each plate. The UV-irradiated cells were labeled with Redivue Pro Mix [35S]Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml; 1,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS). The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein DC assay kit. The 35S incorporation was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For electrophoresis equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (R-250), prepared for fluorography by treatment with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and autoradiographed. For trichloroacetic acid precipitation equal amounts of cell lysate were added to 0.5 ml of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 0.02% sodium azide and placed on ice. Ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (0.5 ml) was added, vortexed vigorously, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cell suspension was filtered through a Millipore filtration apparatus onto a glass microfiber disc (Whatman). Disks were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and twice with 1 ml of 100% ethanol. Disks were air-dried, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). For analysis of endogenous eIF2α phosphorylation HIT cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UVC. Immediately after UV irradiation, the cells were cultured in fresh medium containing 0.5 μm okadaic acid (OA) and 100 μm N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-norleucinal (ALLN). At 4 h postirradiation the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane. The total amount of eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α were probed with antibodies against eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL) (17DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The levels of eIF2α expression and phosphorylation were visualized by the SuperSignal chemiluminescent system as recommended by the supplier (Pierce). For phosphorylation analysis of the transiently transfected eIF2α, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with eIF2α expression vector (pETFVA−-2α) by the DEAE-dextran procedure as described previously (18Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After 48 h the transfected cells were UV-irradiated and lysed in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at the indicated postirradiation time. The expression levels of eIF2α in each sample were first determined by Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-eIF2α monoclonal antibody (19Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After quantification of the expression levels of eIF2α equal amounts of eIF2α were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The levels of eIF2α expression and phosphorylation were determined using the same methods as described above. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pETFVA−-PERK (K618A)-myc and pETFVA−-PERKΔC-T7 using the DEAE-dextran procedure. After 48 h the cells were pulse-labeled using [35S]Met/Cys for 20 min in Met/Cys-free minimal essential medium. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The dimerization of PERK (K618A)-myc and PERKΔC-T7 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-T7 antibody or anti-myc antibody in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Antibody-antigen complexes were absorbed by protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, prepared for fluorography by treatment with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and dried. The dried gels were autoradiographed with Kodak BioMax-MR film. To first establish that UV irradiation inhibits protein synthesis, a 35S incorporation assay was used to quantify the rate of protein synthesis after irradiation. MCF-7 cells were irradiated with increasing doses of UVC and metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys at 4 h post-irradiation. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and trichloroacetic acid precipitation demonstrated that protein synthesis was reduced to 56% with increasing doses of irradiation (Fig. 1 A, left panel). At 30 J/m2 protein synthesis was reduced to 18% 24 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 1 B, left panel). However, translational recovery was observed at 48 h postirradiation (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Because the same quantity of protein was loaded in each lane (Fig. 1,A and B, right panels) the amount of35S incorporation represents the relative level of protein translation. Previously published studies demonstrated that protein synthesis could be inhibited within 10 min in fibroblasts after a high dose (300–600 J/m2) of UVC irradiation (16Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that translational inhibition can occur at a much lower dose (30 J/m2) of UV irradiation and is dosage- and time-dependent. In addition protein synthesis is eventually restored after UV irradiation (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, UV-induced protein synthesis inhibition is a prolonged and reversible process. To further elucidate the mechanism of UV-induced translational inhibition we examined whether UV irradiation induces the phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2α. Because endogenous eIF2α is not detectable in MCF-7 cells we used hamster insulinoma tumor (HIT) cells, which express a higher level of eIF2α. The cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UVC. To prevent the dephosphorylation and degradation of the phosphorylated proteins cells were cultured in medium containing OA and ALLN for 4 h after irradiation and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The phosphorylation state of eIF2α was then examined. Phosphorylation of eIF2α increased when cells were treated with OA and ALLN alone (Fig. 2 A) and was likely caused by the inhibition of phosphatase-1 and phosphatase-2A by OA as previously reported (20Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When the cells were treated with UV the phosphorylation of eIF2α increased further by 70% (Fig. 2 A). These results show that UV irradiation induces endogenous eIF2α phosphorylation. PERK activation was also examined in these cells. However, we were unable to detect a significant increase in PERK phosphorylation in the UV-irradiated cells (data not shown). This may be because UV-induced PERK activation is a prolonged process that does not produce a clear up-shifting band as is normally observed for phosphorylated PERK (21Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). 2D. Ron, personal communication. To further confirm that UV irradiation induces eIF2α phosphorylation we analyzed whether UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation is dependent on dosage and time. COS-1 cells were used in this experiment because the cell line is conveniently and efficiently transiently transfected and expresses high levels of proteins from transfected genes. In addition, because the endogenous eIF2α is undetectable in COS-1 cells by Western blot analysis (18Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) the eIF2α that was detected represents eIF2α derived from transfected DNA in the subpopulation of transfected cells. A mammalian expression vector encoding eIF2α was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells, and phosphorylation of the expressed eIF2α was detected using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α and compared with reactivity for an antibody that is specific for total eIF2α (17DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the levels of total expressed eIF2α did not significantly vary at these doses and time points (Fig. 2, B and C), differential reactivity to the antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α is indicative of differential phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that a significant increase in eIF2α phosphorylation occurs within 4 h after irradiation at 50 and 100 J/m2 (Fig. 2 B). At 50 J/m2 UV irradiation eIF2α phosphorylation was detectable after 2 h and peaked at 12 h. The kinetics of eIF2α phosphorylation correlated with the inhibition of protein synthesis after UV irradiation (Fig. 1 B). In addition these data are consistent with the restoration of protein synthesis after 48 h of UV irradiation (Fig. 1 B). Our results show that eIF2α phosphorylation in response to UV irradiation is dosage- and time-dependent (Fig. 2, B and C). However, a high dosage (50–100 J/m2) of UV was needed to visualize the eIF2α phosphorylation. Because a small increase (10%) in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2α is sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis initiation (22Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lower doses of irradiation (such as 30 J/m2) may also inhibit protein synthesis through eIF2α phosphorylation although it is difficult to measure the increase in eIF2α phosphorylation at these doses. Both PKR and PERK were suggested to mediate stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 23Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant-negative kinase mutant PKR (K296P) inhibits eIF2α phosphorylation catalyzed by endogenous PKR (19Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, a kinase-defective K618A mutant PERK acts in a trans-dominant-negative manner to inhibit eIF2α phosphorylation upon activation of endogenous PERK by ER-stress (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the isolated luminal domain of PERK (PERKΔC) inhibits ER-stress-induced transcriptional induction of CHOP10, a gene that acts as a marker of the unfolded protein response (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 15Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). We examined whether overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant forms of PKR and/or PERK could also inhibit UV-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α. COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with eIF2α and the expression vectors indicated (Fig. 3). The transfected cells were irradiated with UVC. At 4 h post-irradiation the cells were harvested, and the expression and phosphorylation of eIF2α were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-eIF2α and anti-eIF2α-P antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” This analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation of overexpressed wild-type eIF2α increased with UV treatment. However, overexpression of a phosphorylation site mutant S51A eIF2α significantly prevented the phosphorylation of co-transfected eIF2α upon UV treatment (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). These results support the theory that phosphorylation of eIF2α upon UV treatment occurs on residue Ser-51. Overexpression of wild-type PERK constitutively increased eIF2α phosphorylation, which was further increased after UV treatment (Fig. 3, lanes 10–12). Significantly, overexpression of either PERK (K618A) or PERKΔC inhibited UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 3,lanes 13–18). Although a previous report suggested that UV irradiation (27 J/m2, 45 min) does not induce autophosphorylation and activation of PERK (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar) this analysis did not vary the time and dosage of UV treatment. We believe that the discrepancy is because of the time- and dosage-dependent activation of PERK. Our data show that increased eIF2α phosphorylation cannot be detected at 4 h after 30 J/m2 irradiation (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to mutant PERK overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant PKR (K296P) did not affect the UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 3,lanes 7–9). These results support that UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation is specifically mediated by PERK and not by PKR. It was reported that UV irradiation induces the activation of CHOP10 (24Luethy J.D. Fargnoli J. Park J.S. Fornace A.J., Jr. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an ER-stress-inducible gene (25Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). ER-stress-induced CHOP10 activation may be mediated by ATF4, which is downstream of PERK activation and eIF2α phosphorylation (26Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether UV irradiation induces ER-stress to activate PERK. Because increasing levels of the ER luminal chaperone BiP inhibit PERK activation and eIF2α phosphorylation (21Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar), we determined whether UV irradiation activates the BiP promoter. A BiP-regulated EGFP expression vector (pBiP-EGFP) was used as a reporter to measure BiP promoter activation after UV irradiation. UV irradiation induced GFP expression by 2.9-fold (15 J/m2 UV) to 3.8-fold (30 J/m2 UV) (Fig. 4 B). In parallel, thapsigargin (200 nm) induced GFP expression by 3.4-fold (Fig. 4 B). Our data indicate that UV induction of the BiP promoter is comparable with thapsigargin induction in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, UV irradiation induces the ER-stress response, which results in the activation of the BiP promoter. These results suggest that UV-induced PERK activation with subsequent transcriptional induction of BiP would increase the level of BiP in the ER lumen and thereby prevent further PERK activation. Although UV treatment inhibits protein synthesis it is possible that the BiP mRNA is efficiently translated upon UV treatment because it has an internal ribosomal entry site element within the 5′ end of its mRNA. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation is not inhibited upon eIF2α phosphorylation (13Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To confirm that PERK mediates UV-induced translational inhibition, protein synthesis after UV irradiation in MCF-7 and the MCF-7-PERKΔC cell line was measured. Whereas protein synthesis was reduced to 18% in control MCF-7 cells at 24 h after 30 J/m2 UVC, protein synthesis remained at 50% in MCF-7-PERKΔC cells (Fig. 5 B). The incomplete protection of UV-induced translational inhibition may be caused by the activation of endogenous PERK or other factors (such as a ribotoxic stress response) (16Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when MCF-7-PERKΔC cells were irradiated with a high dose (100 J/m2) of UVC, PERKΔC failed to prevent UV-induced translational inhibition. Because expression of PERKΔC in the MCF-7-PERKΔC is not reduced after UV irradiation (Fig. 5 C) the result suggests that another signaling pathway also may be involved in translational regulation after UV irradiation. Our data show that UV-induced translational inhibition is at least partially mediated through PERK (Fig. 5,A and B). To examine the possibility that overexpressed PERK mutants form inactive dimers with endogenous PERK, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was established to measure dimerization between intact PERK and the N-terminal luminal domain of PERK in vivo. Because the wild-type PERK inhibits translation of its own mRNA and is expressed at a very low level, we used the kinase-inactive PERK mutant K618A in this analysis. COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with pETFVA−-PERK (K618A)-myc and pETFVA−-PERKΔC-T7. After pulse-labeling the transfected cells with [35S]Met/Cys the interaction between intact PERK and PERKΔC was measured by co-immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen Corp., Madison, WI) or anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Total cell protein extracts and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation of the T7-tagged PERKΔC yielded the expected polypeptide at 80 kDa as well as a 130-kDa polypeptide that represented the PERK (K618A) (Fig. 6, lane 6). Immunoprecipitation of the myc-tagged PERK (K618A) showed that expression levels of PERK (K618A) were slightly different in the transfected cells (67:100; Fig. 6, lane 8 versus lane 9). PERKΔC co-immunoprecipitated myc-tagged PERK (K618A) (Fig. 6, lane 9). The amount of dimerization was quantitated using NIH Image (Version 1.62f). The intensity of PERK (K618A) was 24% of the associated PERKΔC (Fig. 6, lane 6). The intensity of the PERKΔC was 8.8% of the associated PERK (K618A). After correcting the numbers for the molecular weight of the peptides, the amount of heterodimerized peptides was 14.5 ± 0.2%. These results suggest that the overexpression of a mutated PERK may inhibit endogenous PERK by forming inactive heterodimers. In summary, our findings demonstrate that UV irradiation induces an ER-stress-induced signaling pathway that activates PERK and inhibits protein synthesis in mammalian cells. These studies are a first step to understand the mechanistic details of how UV light activates an ER-stress response that may mediate downstream responses. We hypothesize that UV light disrupts protein folding in the ER resulting in the accumulation of unfolded proteins to promote PERK dimerization and activation. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α subsequently results in protein synthesis inhibition. We also propose that upon PERK activation the translation of selective mRNAs (such as ATF4) (26Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

IRE1 is a protein kinase and site-specific endoribonuclease that signals transcriptional activation of a large set of genes upon activation of the unfolded protein response in the ER (28Tirasophon W. Lee K. Callaghan B. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because PERK and the protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1 both are activated by identical degrees and types of ER-stress (29Bertolotti A. Ron D. J.

Cell Bio. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and that this may contribute to the ribotoxic effects associated with UV irradiation (16Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L.

Increased expression of the eIF2α phosphatase GADD34 may provide cell protection by reversing the translational inhibition associated with PERK activation and eIF2α phosphorylation (31Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the reversal of eIF2α phosphorylation and increased translation that we observed after longer periods of UV treatment. In addition, activated IRE1 can activate JNK to initiate an apoptotic program (33Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), a signaling pathway known to be activated by UV light (34Huang C., Ma, W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol.

Future studies should elucidate the factors that are required for PERK and/or IRE1 activation, and the studies also should clarify the mechanisms for downstream signaling in response to UV light. These studies should encourage the development of drugs to target PERK and/or IRE1 in order to prevent and treat UV-related development of skin cancers. We thank Jeffrey C.

Although the enzyme was discovered in the late 1950s (1Amdur B.H. Rilling H. Bloch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2646Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Tchen T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1100-1103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it suffered over three decades of neglect, as research on the isoprenoid pathway was focused on HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the previous step in the pathway, i.e. the formation of mevalonic acid from HMG-CoA. However, interest in MK has been revived recently, because it was recognized that this enzyme, together with HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase, is involved in coordinate regulation of this pathway and therefore may represent a secondary control point. The recent recognition of the involvement of the diverse non-sterol isoprenoid metabolites in various cellular functions (e.g. protein prenylation, protein glycosylation, and cell cycle regulation) has also increased interest in this enzyme. In addition, the significance of MK has been further highlighted by the implication of the enzyme in human inherited diseases, such as mevalonic aciduria and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D/periodic fever syndrome (HIDS, Mendelian Inheritance in Man 260920). mevalonate kinase rat mevalonate kinase homoserine kinase hyperimmunoglobulinemia hyperimmunoglobulinemia/periodic fever syndrome 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase multiwavelength anomalous dispersion root mean square deviation The enzyme is found in eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and some eubacteria.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Kinetic studies suggest that the enzyme catalyzes an ordered sequential reaction, with mevalonic acid binding first to the enzyme and phosphomevalonate the first product released from the enzyme (3Beytia E. Dorsey K.J. Marr J. Cleland W.W. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5450-5458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranyl pyrophosphate, both of which are downstream products of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, are potent inhibitors of the enzyme with respect to ATP (6Dorsey K.J. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4667-4670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis studies have been employed to identify catalytic residues and to investigate the mechanism of the enzyme action. Asp204 has been suggested as the catalytic base that abstracts the proton from the C5-OH group of mevalonic acid (5Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); Ser146, located in a conserved glycine-rich region, has been implicated in the binding of Mg-ATP (7Cho Y.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12573-12578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); and Lys13 has shown to be involved in the binding of ATP as well as facilitating catalysis (8Potter D. Wojnar J.M. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mevalonate kinase is a member of the GHMP kinase family, one of the three distinct sugar kinase families classified by sequence comparison and originally, including galactokinase,homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, andphosphomevalonate kinase (9Tsay Y.H. Robinson G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The list keeps growing, now including mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (11Codier H. Lacombe C. Karst F. Berges T. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 38: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), isopentenyl monophosphate kinase (12Lange B.M. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13714-13719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methylerythritol kinase (13Luttgen H. Rohdich F. Herz S. Wungsintaweekful J. Hecht S. Schuhr C.A. Fellermeier M. Sagner S. Zenik M.H. Bacher A. Eisenreich W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. . 2000; 97: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons revealed that these kinases share three highly conserved glycine-rich motifs that are implicated in the binding of ATP. The structure of homoserine kinase (HSK) from Methanococcus jannaschii has been solved with and without substrates/analogs (14Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 12: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The M. jannaschii HSK shares ∼20% sequence identity with rat MK but is smaller by about 100 residues than the mevalonate kinase. Similar to other known kinase structures, the HSK structure is composed of two domains, the smaller N-terminal domain and the larger C-terminal domain, and the active site is located at the cleft between the two domains. The bound ATP adopts an unusual syn conformation, and a conserved glycine-rich motif (P XG XGLGSSAA) forms the phosphate-binding loop. However, no strong nucleophile that might act as a catalytic base can be found near the phosphoryl acceptor hydroxyl group. Very recently, the structure of M. jannaschii MK has been reported (16Yang D. Shipman L.W. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9462-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As expected from sequence homology, the overall polypeptide folding is similar to that of HSK; however, the rare syn ATP-binding mode could not be confirmed, because the structure determined is that of the apo form of the enzyme. We here report the three-dimensional structure of rat MK in complex with Mg-ATP determined at 2.4-Å resolution. The detailed disposition of the residues involved in the active site, together with previously determined kinetic and mutagenesis studies, allows us to propose a plausible mechanism of the enzyme action. Because the amino acid sequence of the rat enzyme is 82% identical to that of the human enzyme, it is expected that structural conclusions drawn from the rat enzyme will apply to the human enzyme. Furthermore, comparison of the rat MK structure with those of HSK and MK both from M. jannaschii reveals the differences as well as similarities in structure and catalytic mechanism between the two members of the GHMP kinases. In addition, the conclusions derived here are likely to be applicable to other members of the kinase family, including galactokinase and phosphomevalonate kinase. Recombinant rat MK (RMK) was expressed and purified as previously described (8Potter D. Wojnar J.M. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding rat mevalonate kinase was inserted into pET-11a vector, expressed in Escherichia coli, BL21, and purified by chromatography using a Fast-Q anion exchange column followed by a hydrophobic column (phenyl-agarose). Crystals of RMK were grown at 4 °C using the sitting drop method by mixing equal volumes of an RMK solution (13 mg/ml protein, 1 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) and a precipitant solution containing 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 17.5% polyethylene glycol-5000 monomethylester. The crystals appeared within 3 days and grew to an approximate size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm in a week. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with cell dimensions a = 77.31, b = 118.64, and c = 42.30 Å. Assuming one monomer per asymmetric unit, the calculated Vm value (17Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 3: 491-497Crossref Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) is 2.4 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 54%. The mercury derivative was obtained by cocrystallization with 1 mm thimerosal in the above conditions, and all other derivatives were obtained by soaking the native crystals in an artificial mother liquor solution containing each respective heavy atom compound. A thimerosal cocrystal was used for the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data collection. The MAD data set, one native (NAT1) set, and the osmium derivative set were collected at −180 °C on a synchrotron beamline (SBC-19ID) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The second native data set (NAT2) and two other derivative sets, mercury and platinum, were obtained at 4 °C on an R-axis IIC imaging plate detector system equipped with Osmic mirrors. For cryo-data collection, crystals were soaked for 2 min in the mother liquor containing 18% ethylene glycol prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Each data set was obtained with an oscillation angle of 0.5° per frame, and the exposure times were 2 s for the synchrotron data and 10 min for the R-AXIS data. All data were processed with the program package DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Wladek M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The initial phasing was carried out using NAT1 as the native. The heavy atom positions (one mercury, one osmium, and one platinum) were determined using the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 155: 849-861Crossref Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Difference and anomalous Patterson syntheses confirmed the mercury position, and cross difference Fourier synthesis using the mercury phasing also confirmed the osmium and platinum sites. Phase refinements employing both MIR and MAD techniques were carried out using the program package SHARP (20De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), yielding an overall figure of merit of 0.52 at 2.3-Å resolution. The resulting phases were further improved by solvent flattening, and at this point, well-defined α helices and β strands were easily identified. The model building was carried out using the interactive graphics program TURBO-FRODO (21Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO, The Manual, version 4.2. Biographics, LCCMB, Marseille, France1994Google Scholar). After building the initial model of RMK containing 337 residues (out of a total 395 residues), electron density maps were generated by combining the experimental phases with those of the model by using the SIGMAA algorithm in the CCP4 program package. The resulting map allowed all but 17 residues (16 residues from #73 to #88 and the last C-terminal residue, #395) to be traced. The model was subjected to several rounds of simulated annealing procedure using the CNS package (22Brunger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) with alternating manual fitting. Despite further rounds of refinement with CNS and manual re-checking of the model using omit maps, the R-values remained at 31% for Rcrystal and 36.7% for Rfree. At this point, the NAT2 data set, which was collected on an R-AXIS at 4 °C, was introduced as the native and was used in all subsequent analyses. After a few rounds of CNS refinement, the Rcrystal and Rfree values dropped to 25 and 31%, respectively. At this stage, ATP was clearly visible and in the subsequent cycles, a magnesium ion and water molecules were added. The final model was refined using 2.4-Å resolution data and has an Rcrystal of 21.7% and Rfree of 26.6%. The C-terminal residue and residues 73–88 were disordered and were not included in the final model.

Open table in a new tab The overall monomer structure (Fig. 1) is dumbbell-shaped (84 × 45 × 43 Å) with two domains. The N-terminal domain (blue in Fig. 1) is composed of a large, mixed, concave seven-stranded β-sheet (β1, β4–β8, and β15) packed with seven helices (α2–α7 and α13) and a small, antiparallel, four-stranded β-sheet (β2, β3, β9, and β10) extending upward from the large seven-stranded sheet. The convex side of the large sheet is mostly exposed to the solvent and covered only by a short C-terminal helix (α13). Residues 73–88, located between the α2 and α3 helices, are disordered and lie at the surface of the molecule. The C-terminal domain (green in Fig. 1A) is composed of another antiparallel, four-stranded β-sheet, facing the N-terminal small sheet on one side, and five long α helices (α8–α12) crowning the solvent side of the monomer. Thus, the two antiparallel β-sheets make up the interface of the two domains. The interface area is about 1150Å2 per domain and is about 17% of the total surface of the smaller C-terminal domain. Because of this relatively tight interface and because the polypeptide traverses twice between the domains, the linkage between the two domains (the dumbbell handle) appears to be rather rigid. Therefore, the molecule is less likely to undergo a large conformational change (i.e. to bend the dumbbell handle) to allow the cleft between the two domains to change in shape and size. This is different from the case of the catalytic domain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, in which its cleft is open or closed depending on whether the substrate is bound or not (23Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowaadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the structure of the catalytic domain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is also bi-lobal with a deep cleft between the lobes, which are connected by a flexible linker. The enzyme is reported to be a homodimer in solution, with no unusual hydrodynamic properties that would indicate its asymmetric shape (5Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Dorsey K.J. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4667-4670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, however, the 2-fold axis is located at the tip of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1B), making the dimer molecule extremely elongated, with its longest and shortest dimensions of 120 and 40 Å, respectively. The dimer interface area is 2450 Å2 per dimer, which is only 7.6% of the total surface area. It is composed of residues from two α helices, residues 259–270 (helix α9) and residues 300–308 (helix α10) of each monomer, making a classic four-helix bundle with hydrophobic side chains interdigitating at the core of the bundle. It is unlikely that these hydrophobic interactions are due to the crystal packing. Therefore, the dimer structure observed in the crystalline state is most likely the same as that which exists in solution. However, rigorous hydrodynamic characterizations of the enzyme are necessary to confirm this. It is interesting to note that the crystalline M. jannaschii MK protein is a monomer, whereas the protein is reported to be a dimer in solution (16Yang D. Shipman L.W. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9462-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that a majority of the hydrophobic residues involved in the dimer interface in the rat and human MK proteins are not conserved in M. jannaschii MK; most of them are replaced by hydrophilic residues. The overall polypeptide folding of rat MK (RMK) is very similar to that of homoserine kinase (HSK) from M. jannaschii (Zhou et al. (14Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 12: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar)), as predicted from their sequence homology. However, there are some significant differences between the two structures. First of all, RMK (395 residues) is significantly larger than HSK (300 residues), and consequently there are many additional parts in the rat MK structure. There are three large insertions, all of them lying in the N-terminal domain. The largest one (about 50 residues) lies between β5 and α6, forming β6-α2-loop-α3-loop. This insertion is situated at the surface of the molecule (the concave side of the seven-stranded β-sheet) and includes the disordered region, residues 73–88. The next insertion is a long excursion, including β8, lying between α5 and α6. Both β6 and β8 are parts of the concave β-sheet, expanding it to a seven-stranded sheet (one strand on each side of the sheet), as compared with the five-stranded sheet found in the structure of HSK. The third insertion is the C-terminal tail (residues 381–395) lying on the convex side of the β-sheet. Because all of these insertions lie at the surface of the molecule, they are probably not directly involved in either the catalytic function or the dimer formation of the enzyme. However, these insertions must play a role in the stability of the RMK protein. Excluding these three regions and other minor loop areas, the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the main-chain atoms between the two structures is 4.1 Å for 265 residues. However, the r.m.s.d. values for the individual domains are much smaller, 1.1 Å for the N-terminal domain (105 residues) and 1.2 Å for the C-terminal domain (160 residues), suggesting that the relative orientations of the two domains in the two structures are different. Fig. 2 shows an overlay of the two structures using only the two N-terminal domains for superposition. The RMK structure is straighter, whereas that of HSK is bent about 15° from the vertical axis, making its active-site cleft, located at the interface between the two domains, more closed than that of the RMK structure. Both structures are of binary complexes with the nucleotide substrate/product, RMK with ATP and HSK with ADP. Unlike the M. jannaschii MK protein, which is a monomer in the crystalline state, the HSK protein is also a dimer. The dimer interface in the HSK protein involves β-strands in addition to the corresponding helices that are involved in the rat MK dimer formation. Consequently, the overall dimer shape in the HSK structure is less elongated than that of the RMK structure. In addition to these differences in the overall structure, a few minor, but functionally significant insertions/deletions exist between the two structures, as discussed below. Using the structures of both RMK and HSK, a structure-based sequence alignment of representative members of the GHMP family has been constructed (Fig. 3).Figure 3Structure-based sequence alignment of rat MK and M. jannaschii HSK together with other representative members of the GHMP family.MK, mevalonate kinase; GAL, galactokinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; HSK, homoserine kinase,RAT, Rattus norvegicus; HUM,Homo sapiens; AF, Archaeoglobus fulgidus; MJ, M. jannaschii; YE,S. cerevisiae.

A difference Fourier map calculated at a later stage of the refinement yielded extra electron densities at the cleft between the two domains. These densities can be fitted with an ATP molecule and a magnesium ion (Fig. 4). The nucleotide in the enzyme-bound ATP has an anti conformation. In contrast, in the structure of HSK complexed with either ADP or ATP analogs, the nucleotide adopts a syn conformation (14Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 12: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As in the case of the HSK structure, the enzyme-bound ATP in the RMK structure also appears to have multiple conformations at its triphosphate moiety. Although the electron density for the adenosine portion of the bound nucleotide is well defined, that of the triphosphate moiety was best fitted with two different conformations: a major (estimated occupancy, 70%, shown as thick sticks in Fig. 4) and a minor conformation (30% occupancy, thin sticks in Fig. 4). For clarity and simplicity, in the following discussion the major conformation of ATP is used, unless noted otherwise. Fig. 5shows residues involved in the nucleotide binding. Both the amide carbonyl group of Asn-55 and the hydroxyl group of Ser135are hydrogen-bonded to the amino group of the adenine ring, and the 2′-OH and 3′-OH of the ribose moiety are bound to Ser108and Asn104, respectively. The magnesium-triphosphate moiety is surrounded by a glycine-rich loop, Motif 2 (residues140GAGLGSSAA148, see Fig. 3), and the magnesium ion is coordinated to both β- and γ- (α- in the minor conformer) phosphates. It is also coordinated to the carboxyl of Glu193 and the hydroxyl group of Ser146, both of which are hydrogen-bonded to each other. The hydroxyl group of Ser146 is also hydrogen-bonded to α-PO4 in the minor conformer and is about 3.7 Å away from a γ-phosphate oxygen, suggesting that they might form a hydrogen bond in solution. Of particular interest is the interaction between Lys13 and Asp204, making a salt bridge. Lys13 also makes a close interaction with the γ-PO4 of ATP. This is consistent with the results of the pyridoxal phosphate inactivation of the RMK and its protection by ATP (8Potter D. Wojnar J.M. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the mutagenesis studies by same authors, in which the replacement of Lys13 with methionine (K13M) diminished its Kd for ATP b"

Recently, we demonstrated a direct role for the IGF-IR in the rescue of DNA-damaged fibroblasts by activating a DNA repair pathway (Héron-Milhavet, L., Karas, M., Goldsmith, C. M., Baum, B. J., and LeRoith, D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 18185–18192). p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that can block progression of the cell cycle, modulate DNA repair, and trigger apoptosis. In this work, we tested the effect of IGF-I on the regulation of the p53 signaling cascade. The DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide was applied to NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing normal IGF-IRs (NWTb3 cells). We showed that after 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced DNA damage, IGF-I induced exclusion of the p53 protein from the nucleus and led to its degradation in the cytoplasm, whereas p53 mRNA was unaffected. Degradation of the p53 protein was associated with an increase in MDM2, an upstream modulator of the half-life and activity of the p53 protein. p53 degradation was also associated with down-regulation of p21. We further showed that the effects of IGF-I on mdm2 transcription and on MDM2/p19 ARF association were mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. In conclusion, we describe a novel role for IGF-I in the regulation of the MDM2/p53/p21 signaling pathway during DNA damage.

Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The IGF-IR is expressed by many tumors and, upon activation by IGFs, plays an important role in cell growth by inducing mitogenesis and transformation and by protecting cells from apoptosis (2Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). IGF-I can protect fibroblasts from apoptosis induced by UVB light via activation of the Akt protein kinase signaling pathway (3Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). It has also recently been demonstrated that activation of the IGF-IR can rescue 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-damaged cells by activating a DNA repair pathway predominantly mediated by signaling through the stress-activated protein kinase p38 (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers. The role of p53 in tumor suppression was demonstrated in p53−/− (knockout) mice, which are highly prone to developing a variety of different cancers (5Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). The specific biological roles attributed to p53 are very complex, but p53 essentially protects the genome from mutations and genetic alterations. Structural analyses have shown that p53 is a transcription factor with a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain in its central region and a transcription activation domain at its N terminus (6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, cellular p53 protein levels are relatively low. However, in response to DNA damage and/or various stresses, the p53 protein is stabilized, and its ability to bind specific DNA sequences is activated. Both stabilization and DNA binding are modulated by post-translational modifications of the p53 protein, including phosphorylation and acetylation (7Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The upstream regulatory interactions and downstream events involved in stabilization of p53 are part of a complex network of signaling pathways that lead to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). A number of genes have been identified as primary targets of p53 (6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 9Smith M.L. Ford J.M. Hollander M.C. Bortnick R.A. Amundson S.A. Seo Y.R. Deng C.X. Hanawalt P.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, stabilization of p53 blocks the cell cycle by binding directly to genomic p53 response elements and stimulating the expression of p21waf1/cip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (10Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been reported that p21waf1 is mainly responsible for p53-induced G1 arrest (11Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). GADD45 is another target of p53 and may participate in the coupling between chromatin assembly and DNA repair (9Smith M.L. Ford J.M. Hollander M.C. Bortnick R.A. Amundson S.A. Seo Y.R. Deng C.X. Hanawalt P.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Zhao et al. (12Zhao H. Jin S. Antinore M.J. Lung F.D. Fan F. Blanck P. Roller P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Zhan Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) demonstrated that these two p53 targets, p21 and GADD45, act upon different signaling pathways that suppress cell growth. One crucial regulator of p53 is the cellular protein MDM2 (13Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). MDM2 can both inhibit the function of p53 and target p53 for degradation in the cytoplasm (see Ref. 14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 175-186PubMed Google Scholar for review). The MDM2 protein is a RING finger ubiquitin ligase that can induce destabilization and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53 (15Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have established a relationship between IGF-I, cell growth, and p53. For example, it has been shown that the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I in myocytes is mediated by its ability to depress p53 transcriptional activity (16Leri A. Liu Y. Claudio P.P. Kajstura J. Wang X. Wang S. Kang P. Malhotra A. Anversa P. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 567-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, IGF-I-induced growth stimulation in MCF-7 cells is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of p53 (17Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated a role for IGF-IR activation in DNA repair in response to 4-NQO-induced damage in NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of particular interest to determine whether, in our experimental system, stimulation of the IGF-IR exerts its effects through the modulation of p53 and its network of transcriptional events and effects. 4-NQO was purchased from Sigma, and recombinant human IGF-I was a gift of Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Anti-p53 (Pab240) and anti-p21 (M19) antibodies used for Western blotting were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse anti-MDM2 antibody was a gift from Dr. G. Lozano (M. D. Anderson Cancer Institute, Houston, TX), and the mouse anti-p19ARF antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, including anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG, were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-HA antibody was obtained from Covance (Vienna, VA), and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Specific protein kinase inhibitors (LY294002, SB202190, and U0126) were from Calbiochem. The mouse RNA probe templates for mdm2, p53, and 18 S RNA used for Northern blots were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). The RNA probe templates for p19ARF were kindly provided by Drs. T. Ouchi (Mt. Sinai Medical School, New York, NY) and C. Sherr (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The NWTb3 cell line established in this laboratory expresses wild-type human IGF-IRs at a level of ∼4 × 105 receptors/cell (18Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 300 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 0.5 g/liter G418 in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. NWTb3 cells were seeded the day prior to transfection. The cells were then transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence, cells were transfected with the pcDNA3-HAp53 construct (human p53), kindly provided by Dr. W. G. Kaelin, Jr. (Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute, Boston, MA). After transfection, the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting to assess the efficiency of the transient transfection. The transfection efficiency in NWTb3 cells was determined in our previous study using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NWTb3 cells were also transfected with a dominant-negative p38 construct (pCMV5-p38AGF) with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as previously described (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with 4-NQO in the absence or presence of IGF-I. Total RNA was extracted, andmdm2 Northern blotting was performed as described below. NWTb3 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish) as described above. One day after plating, the cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium. The UV-mimetic drug 4-NQO was dissolved in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 2 mm. A 100 μm stock solution was prepared by diluting the concentrated solution in serum-free medium and stored in aliquots at −20 °C for use throughout the study. All 4-NQO exposures were performed at a final concentration of 2.5 μm in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Following the drug treatment, cells were rinsed twice with prewarmed (37 °C) serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of specific protein kinase inhibitors at the appropriate concentrations. Two different doses of UV treatment were used: a low dose of 6 J/m2 and a high dose of 24 J/m2 (19Wu L. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 441-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), known to increase p53 protein levels (20Zhu Q. El-Wani M.A. Mahdy M. Wani G. Wani A.A. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were rinsed twice with serum-free medium, and both 4-NQO- and UV-treated cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of IGF-I for various times and at various concentrations as indicated on the figures. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total cell lysates were prepared exactly as described previously (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, aliquots of lysates containing 400 μg of protein were incubated with 40 μl of the anti-p19ARF antibody (0.1 μg/μl) at 4 °C overnight, and protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the lysate. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel and immunoblotted with the anti-MDM2 antibody. All antibodies used (anti-p53, anti-actin, and anti-p21) were diluted in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin according to the manufacturers’ recommended conditions, except for the anti-ARF antibody, which was diluted in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, and the anti-MDM2 antibody, which was diluted in 0.1% Tween 20 supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. Immunofluorescence was performed on NWTb3 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged human p53 as described above. Briefly, cells were seeded on Nunc chamber slides and then washed and fixed in 2% formaldehyde solution. The samples were blocked for 15 min with Dulbecco’s PBS and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated with the mouse anti-HA primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in Dulbecco’s PBS and 10% fetal bovine serum. Samples were then incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature in the same buffer. Slides were mounted with mounting medium and sealed. Samples were viewed using an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (Axiovert 100S, Zeiss) at a magnification of ×64. Cells were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA (20 μg) was loaded onto a 1.25% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. Ethidium bromide staining was utilized to assess the integrity of the RNA and to estimate loading efficiencies. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred onto Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) by capillary action and fixed by UV cross-linking. mRNA levels were determined by hybridizing Northern blots with 32P-labeled riboprobes specific formdm2, p53, and 18 S mRNA or with DNA probes for p19ARF and excision repaircross-complementing 1(ercc-1). Quantification of the specific message according to the 1.8-kb 18 S message was performed using Image Reader software and Image Gauge software together with a Fuji 1800II instrument. Our study was performed in NWTb3 cells overexpressing normal human IGF-IRs (18Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that the IGF-IR plays a role in rescuing these cells from DNA damage (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the regulation of apoptosis and because IGF-I signaling plays a role in DNA repair, we examined the effect of IGF-IR activation on p53 protein levels in response to DNA damage. As described above, the cells were treated with 4-NQO (2.5 μm) and stimulated with a physiological concentration of IGF-I (50 nm). p53 protein levels were determined by Western blotting samples treated with 4-NQO alone, IGF-I alone, or 4-NQO followed by IGF-I. No significant changes in p53 levels were observed in cells treated with 4-NQO alone (Fig.1A). Both the time course (0–6 h) and the dose dependence (0–100 nm) of IGF-I effects were evaluated (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). After induction of DNA damage with 4-NQO, IGF-I treatment resulted in a 50% decrease in the level of p53 after 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 1A). A slight decrease in p53 protein levels was observed when the cells were stimulated with IGF-I alone for 6 h, but this effect did not exhibit dose dependence (Fig.1B). On the other hand, a marked dose-dependent reduction in the expression of p53 was observed in samples that were treated with IGF-I for 6 h after 4-NQO exposure (Fig.1B). These data suggest that IGF-IR activation plays a role in the regulation of p53 protein levels in NWTb3 cells and that this effect is most pronounced after cellular DNA damage has already occurred. To determine the cellular localization of p53, NWTb3 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged human p53. Western blotting with a specific antibody against human p53 confirmed that the human p53 protein was expressed (data not shown). Using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody against the HA epitope tag, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to localize p53 under various conditions (4-NQO only, IGF-I only, or 4-NQO + IGF-I). In a control experiment, cells were transfected with p53, but did not receive any treatment. As shown in Fig.2A, p53 was present in the nucleus and more specifically in the nucleoplasm under these conditions. No fluorescence was detected in the non-transfected NWTb3 cells (data not shown). When cells were treated with IGF-I for 2 h (Fig. 2B) or for 5 h (Fig. 2C), no differences were observed in p53 localization. Similarly, no differences in the cellular localization of p53 were observed in cells exposed to 4-NQO alone for 2 or 5 h (Fig. 2, D andE, respectively). In striking contrast, when 4-NQO-treated cells were subsequently exposed to IGF-I, p53 localization was partially shifted from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm of NWTb3 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, F andG). Thus, in response to 4-NQO-induced DNA damage, stimulation with IGF-I promotes the shuttling of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. MDM2 is a proto-oncoprotein that is known to negatively regulate p53 (21Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, we also studied the effects of 4-NQO and IGF-I on MDM2 and investigated whether MDM2 plays a role in the reduction of p53 protein levels. First, we focused on the decrease observed in p53 protein levels after DNA damage and subsequent IGF-I treatment. Northern blot analysis was used to assess mdm2 and p53 mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 3A, p53 mRNA levels stayed relatively constant after IGF-I, 4-NQO, or 4-NQO + IGF-I treatment, suggesting that the decrease in p53 protein levels shown in Fig. 1 was due to a post-translational effect. A 2-h incubation with IGF-I increased mdm2 mRNA levels by ∼2-fold, whereas 4-NQO exposure followed by IGF-I treatment increased mdm2mRNA levels by ∼4-fold. This effect appeared to plateau at the 2-h time point. These results were confirmed by measuringmdm2 mRNA levels in an RNase protection assay (data not shown). Moreover, the MDM2 protein was also slightly increased in response to 4-NQO exposure followed by IGF-I treatment, although to a lesser degree than the mRNA (∼2-fold), as shown in Fig.3B. Because MDM2 is a negative regulator of the p53 protein, the results presented may suggest that IGF-I stimulation occurring after DNA damage plays a role in the degradation of the p53 protein via induction of MDM2. To determine the functional consequences of changes in p53 protein levels, we studied the expression of p21WAF1, a downstream target of p53 that acts as a cell cycle checkpoint (22Kannan K. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Kela I. Kaminski N. Getz G. Domany E. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). As expected, no difference was observed in p21 protein levels when cells were treated with 4-NQO alone (data not shown) and/or IGF-I alone (Fig.4). On the other hand, p21 protein levels were progressively decreased in a time-dependent manner when cells were treated with IGF-I after 4-NQO exposure. To further characterize MDM2-induced p53 degradation, we investigated the effects of DNA damage and subsequent IGF-I treatment on p19ARF, which is known to inhibit MDM2 and to indirectly stabilize p53. Western blot analysis was used to determine p19ARF protein levels in response to the various treatments. As shown in Fig. 5, p19ARF protein levels did not vary significantly in response to exposure to 4-NQO, IGF-I, or 4-NQO + IGF-I. p19ARF mRNA levels were also determined by Northern blot analysis. p19ARF mRNA levels are relatively low in NIH-3T3 cells (23Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.Y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no changes were observed in p19ARF mRNA levels (data not shown), in agreement with the lack of effect of the p19ARF protein. These results suggest that p19ARF may not be directly involved as an upstream component in the MDM2/p53 signaling pathway targeted by IGF-I in response to DNA damage. One factor that regulates p53 stabilization involves the interaction between p19ARF and MDM2, which inhibits MDM2 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity and consequently stabilizes p53. Thus, we studied the effect of IGF-I on the association between the two proteins. Fig.6 shows a representative experiment in which ARF was immunoprecipitated from NWTb3 cell lysates, and the resulting samples were immunoblotted with the anti-MDM2 antibody. In the absence of DNA damage, the association between ARF and MDM2, which is known to stabilize the p53 protein, reached a maximum 2 h after IGF-I treatment (in the absence of 4-NQO-induced DNA damage), as shown in Fig. 6. To investigate whether the effect seen with 4-NQO and IGF-I may be 4-NQO-specific, we used UV light (254 nm) to irradiate NWTb3 cells, and we treated the cells with IGF-I (50 nm) for 0, 2, 6, and 24 h. Two different doses of UV light were used: a low and a high dose of UV radiation, previously described to increase p53 protein levels (24Latonen L. Taya Y. Laiho M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows a typical experiment in which p19ARF was immunoprecipitated from NWTb3 cell lysates. Immunoblotting was then performed with the anti-MDM2 antibody. In the presence of either a low or a high UV dose and IGF-I post-treatment, no association between ARF and MDM2 could be detected. The association did occur when the cells were stimulated with IGF-I alone (data not shown).Figure 7Effects of IGF-I and UV light on the association between MDM2 and p19ARF. NWTb3 cells were treated with UV light at two different doses: 6 J/m2 (low dose) and 24 J/m2 (high dose). The cells were then harvested at the indicated times after IGF-I treatment, and protein lysates were prepared. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 6. WB, Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, in the presence of UV- or UV-mimetic-induced DNA damage, IGF-I treatment failed to promote the association between ARF and MDM2 and therefore would not be expected to suppress MDM2 E3 activity. Thus, these findings suggest that treatment with IGF-I after UV-induced DNA damage may promote degradation of the p53 protein, which is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1. In a previous study, we showed that NWTb3 cells can be rescued from 4-NQO-induced cell proliferation inhibition by activation of the IGF-IR and that this effect is mediated primarily through the p38 MAPK pathway (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether the p38 MAPK pathway plays a role in the regulation of mdm2 gene expression, we treated the NWTb3 cells with 4-NQO and IGF-I in the presence or absence of compounds that inhibit various protein kinases. The increase in mdm2 mRNA induced by treatment with 4-NQO + IGF-I was completely blocked in cells pretreated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, but not in cells pretreated with a phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitor or an ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitor (data not shown). Moreover, we investigated whether p38 MAPK is involved in the regulation of MDM2/ARF association. When the cells were treated with SB202190 (after 4-NQO exposure and before IGF-I stimulation), the association between the two proteins could be restored, as shown in Fig. 8. This result indicates that in addition to a slight regulation of the MDM2 protein levels, p38 MAPK seems to be involved more specifically in the modulation of MDM2/ARF association to promote degradation of the p53 protein. We have investigated the role of the IGF-IR in the regulation of the p53 network and its relationship to DNA repair in response to UV-mimetic (4-NQO)-induced DNA damage. Previously, IGF-I has been clearly implicated both in the protection of cells from apoptosis and in DNA repair. In this report, we now provide evidence that p53, MDM2, and p19ARF are part of the pathway used by IGF-I to promote DNA repair in damaged cells. In the context of 4-NQO-induced DNA damage, subsequent IGF-I treatment induced an increase in mdm2 mRNA levels with concomitant decreases in p53 protein levels and p53 functional activity (as shown by reduced levels of the p21 protein). In UV-mimetic-treated cells, IGF-I failed to induce an association between p19ARF and MDM2. The lack of association between p19ARF and MDM2 (association that appears to be p38 MAPK-dependent) thereby enables activation of MDM2 and facilitates MDM2-induced degradation of p53. Moreover, IGF-I promoted the nuclear export of p53 in 4-NQO-treated cells, thus further promoting its degradation through MDM2 (a negative regulator of p53). Three competing models have been described to explain the nuclear export of p53 (14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 175-186PubMed Google Scholar). The first model proposes that MDM2 binds to p53 in the nucleus and shuttles p53 to the cytoplasm (25Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The second model suggests that p53 itself contains a nuclear export signal capable of mediating its own nuclear export (26Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Finally, the third model proposes that MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 in the nucleus and that this ubiquitination promotes its nuclear export and subsequent cytoplasmic degradation (27Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although all three models suggest that nuclear transport is necessary for the degradation of p53, none explain why p53 must transfer to the cytoplasm to be degraded by the proteasome. No regulation of ARF mRNA or protein could be detected when the cells were treated with IGF-I after 4-NQO-induced DNA damage. However, IGF-I was shown to regulate MDM2 activity by inhibiting the association between ARF and MDM2 in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. ARF also plays an important role in stabilizing p53 by inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, at least in part by blocking the nuclear export of p53 and MDM2. The function of mouse p19ARF (or human p14ARF) (23Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.Y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) may involve direct binding to MDM2, thereby leading to the stabilization of p53 (21Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The MDM2/ARF interaction stabilizes p53 by a mechanism that involves inhibition of the intrinsic E3 activity of MDM2, which is required for p53 degradation (28Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MDM2-induced shuttling of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded by the proteasome, may also represent a mechanism by which the MDM2/ARF interaction stabilizes p53 (29Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). ARF is found predominantly in the nucleolus, whereas MDM2 and p53 are usually nucleoplasmic and shuttle in and out of the nucleus to deliver ubiquitinated p53 to the cytoplasmic proteasome (29Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that nucleolar localization is not essential for the function of ARF, but that it may enhance the availability of ARF to inhibit MDM2 (21Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, when IGF-I was used to rescue NWTb3 cells from UV-mimetic-induced DNA damage, the p53 protein was degraded through the MDM2/ARF-mediated pathway. Our data are consistent with a secondary down-regulation of p21 in response to a decrease in p53 when cells are sequentially exposed to 4-NQO and then to IGF-I. This may occur as a mechanism of rescuing NWTb3 cells from DNA damage through the degradation of p53. Nucleotide excision repair is considered to be the major repair system that cells use to eliminate a large range of DNA lesions. The identification of DNA lesions is a complex process whereby lesions are localized, a stretch of nucleotides containing the damage is excised, and a repair patch is synthesized (for a review on DNA repair, see Ref.30Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair genes, including ERCC-1 andXPB/ERCC-3, are thought to determine cellular sensitivity to a variety of DNA lesions (31Lee-Kwon W. Park D. Bernier M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The humanERCC-1 gene is a DNA repair gene (32van Duin M. de Wit J. Odijk H. Westerveld A. Yasui A. Koken H.M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Bootsma D. Cell. 1986; 44: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The ERCC-1 protein has been shown to play a crucial role in the early excision step of damaged DNA by virtue of its intrinsic structure-specific nuclease activity. In a previous study, it has been shown that overexpression of the IGF-IR induces an increase in ERCC-1gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (33Perfetti R. Lee-Kwon W. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A correlation between ERCC-1 levels and protection from UV-induced cell death was also established (33Perfetti R. Lee-Kwon W. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Supraphysiological concentrations of insulin have also been shown to increase ERCC-1 mRNA levels in serum-deprived cells overexpressing insulin receptors (34Lee-Kwon W. Park D. Bernier M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found that IGF-I induced a time-dependent 2-fold increase inERCC-1 mRNA levels in the absence or presence of 4-NQO (data not shown). Furthermore, this IGF-I-induced increase inERCC-1 gene expression was p38-dependent (data not shown). We propose a model for the mode of action of IGF-I in response to UV-mimetic-induced DNA damage (Fig. 9). Under basal conditions, IGF-I facilitates the association of p19ARF with MDM2. However, after UV-induced DNA damage, IGF-I treatment cannot promote this association. Thus, MDM2 remains active (i.e. not inhibited by p19ARF) and can ubiquitinate p53, thereby targeting it to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. As a consequence, there is a decrease in p53 activity, as evidenced by down-regulation of p21. In summary, this study demonstrates that p38 MAPK mediates IGF-I regulation of both induction of DNA repair and modulation of the MDM2/ARF/p53 network. Thus, we have identified a signaling cascade involving p53 as a target for IGF-IR activation. This complements our previous work showing that IGF-I promotes DNA repair in damaged cells through p38 MAPK (4Héron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women, and the lifetime risk of developing this malignancy has reached 10% in many countries in the Western world. The great majority of breast cancer is sporadic, and only a small proportion has been attributed to germ line mutations in predisposing genes (1.Newman B. Austin M.A. Lee M. King M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). BRCA1 was the first major breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene identified (2.Miki Y. Swensen J.

Its germ line mutations contribute to about 3% of all breast cancers in Caucasians. On the other hand, somatic mutations in this tumor suppressor gene are very rare in sporadic breast cancer (3.Khoo U.S. Ozcelik H. Cheung A.N. Chow L.W. Ngan H.Y. Done S.J. Liang A.C. Chan V.W.

Several lines of evidence strongly suggest the involvement ofBRCA1 in the etiology of sporadic breast and ovarian cancer through reduced expression.

Lower or undetectable levels of expression of the BRCA1 protein have been observed in sporadic breast cancer (10.Taylor J. Lymboura M. Pace P.E. A'hern R.P. Desai A.J. Shousha S. Coombes R.C. Ali S.

Antisense inhibition ofBRCA1 expression enhances the growth rate of the breast cancer cell line (5.Thompson M.E. Jensen R.A. Obermiller P.S. Page D.L. Holt J.T. Nat.

Different mechanisms have been shown to be responsible for the reduced expression of BRCA1. One of them is allelic deletion at the BRCA1 locus (LOH) 1The abbreviations used are: LOH, loss of heterozygosity; CE, capillary electrophoresis; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; nt, nucleotide; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; uORF, upstream open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; WGE, wheat germ extract; RT, reverse transcription. observed in about 40–80% of sporadic breast cancers and in a slightly lower percentage of ovarian cancers (13.Futreal P.A.

Epigenetic silencing of the BRCA1gene at the transcriptional level by means of promoter methylation is another mechanism involved (14.Dobrovic A. Simpfendorfer D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3347-3350PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Mancini D.N. Rodenhiser D.I. Ainsworth P.J. O'Malley F.P. Singh S.M. Xing W. Archer T.K.

These two events may represent two hits required to inactivate the tumor suppressor gene in cancer (18.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 386: 761-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). A great majority of tumors with a methylated BRCA1 promoter also show LOH at this locus, which is consistent with this scenario (19.Esteller M. Silva J.M. Dominguez G. Bonilla F. Matias-Guiu X. Lerma E. Bussaglia E. Prat J. Harkes I.C. Repasky E.A. Gabrielson E. Schutte M. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). However, methylation of the CpG island in which theBRCA1 promoter is located occurs in only 13% of unselected sporadic breast cancers and in 9% of sporadic ovarian cancers (20.Bianco T. Chenevix-Trench G. Walsh D.C. Cooper J.E. Dobrovic A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This fraction of cancers is several times smaller than that in which the LOH is observed, which implies the existence of other mechanisms ofBRCA1 silencing. The structure of the 5′-region of the BRCA1 gene (Fig. 1 A) reveals additional potential mechanisms for regulating its expression. The gene contains two alternative first exons, 1a and 1b, resulting in two BRCA1 transcripts with different 5′-UTR (21.Xu C.F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These transcripts, which are formed by the selective use of different promoters, α and β (22.Xu C.F. Chambers J.A. Solomon E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20994-20997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), are present at different levels in various normal and tumor tissues and cell lines (21.Xu C.F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TheBRCA1 open reading frame in both transcripts starts at the same position in exon 2 (2.Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Bell R. Rosenthal J. Hussey C. Tran T. McClure M. Frye C. Hattier T. Phelps R. Haugen-Strano A. Katcher H. Yakumo K. Gholami Z. Shaffer D. Stone S. Bayer S. Wray C. Bogden R. Dayananth P. Ward J. Tonin P. Narod S. Bristow P.K. Norris F.H. Helvering L. Morrison P. Rosteck P. Lai M. Barrett J.C. Lewis C. Neuhausen S. Cannon-Albright L. Goldgar D. Wiseman R. Kamb A. Skolnick M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). Interestingly, three additional upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are present in the 5′-UTR containing exon 1b. These uORFs may lower the efficiency of the BRCA1 protein synthesis and contribute to putative translational regulation of theBRCA1 expression (21.Xu C.F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that BRCA1 is indeed translationally regulated, and we provide evidence that stable structures present in a longer mRNA leader, and to a lesser extent the uORFs, are factors involved in this regulation. This has led us to the hypothesis that the deregulation of the BRCA1transcription in cancer, resulting in a higher proportion of translationally inhibited transcripts containing exon 1b, contributes to the decrease in the BRCA1 protein observed in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer. Total RNA was extracted from human tissues using standard procedures (23.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). To prepare cDNA from total RNA, random hexamers and avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RT-PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing a cDNA template, 1 μm each of primers F and R, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm of each of the dNTPs, and 0.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles, 94 °C for 1 s, 55–62 °C for 1 s, and 72 °C for 20 s (see Table I for primer sequences and fragment-specific annealing temperatures). Expression studies were performed using the Quick Screen cDNA from human testis and three cDNA libraries (all from CLONTECH), one from a normal human mammary gland and two from breast cancer tissue from different individuals. They confirmed the results obtained for cDNAs prepared from the corresponding tissues that were described earlier (21.Xu C.F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Two mRNAs were prepared that contained BRCA1 exon 1a or exon 1b sequences in their 5′-UTRs fused with the entire luciferase coding sequence. The corresponding DNA templates were synthesized by ligating two phosphorylated PCR products: either luc and ex1a or luc and ex1b (Table I). The pGEM-luc vector and luciferase-specific primers Fluc and Rluc (Table I) were used to amplify the luciferase cDNA fragment. The 5′-terminal phosphates were introduced during PCR with phosphorylated primers (Fluc, Rex1a, or Rex1b). Ligation substrates were purified in polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. DNA ligation reaction performed for 16 h at 4 °C contained 0.5 pmol of each PCR product, 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (Promega), 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP. Ligation products served as templates to amplify two cDNA constructs ex1a-luc (primers Fex1a and Rluc) and ex1b-luc (primers Fex1b and Rluc) in the following PCR cycling conditions: 25 cycles, 94 °C for 1 s, 58 °C for 1 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products that were used to prepare templates for in vitro transcription were purified by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels and were reamplified with DNA oligomers containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (T7Fex1a or T7Fex1b) as forward primers and Rluc as a reverse primer. Four BRCA1 transcripts described in the legend to Fig. 7 B were also prepared. The two gel-purified PCR products described earlier, ex1a-2 and ex1b-2, were used as templates in the amplification of T7ex2stop, T7ex1a-2stop and T7ex1b-2stop, T7ex1b(M4)-2stop DNA constructs, respectively. Two other purified amplification products ex1a-11 and ex1b-11 were used for synthesis of longer templates for in vitrotranscription, T7ex1a-11 and T7ex1b-11. The PCR conditions used were as described under ”RT-PCR Analysis of BRCA1 mRNA Expression“ and are shown in Table I. Next four BRCA1-specific transcripts were prepared from DNA templates T7ex1b-11-mut1AUG, T7ex1b-11-mut2AUG, T7ex1b-11-mut3AUG, and T7ex1b-11-mut1–3AUG, which contained mutations either in the individual or in all three AUG codons of uORFs (Fig. 7 E). These templates were generated in two steps from a purified amplification product ex1b-11, by a modification of the overlap extension PCR mutagenesis protocol (24.Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 603-612Google Scholar). In the first step two different types of products, with partially overlapping sequences, were obtained. The first type of PCR product was amplified using Fex1b primer and one of the mutagenic primers as follows: Rmut1AUG, 5′-tccccctcaaggcttattc; Rmut2AUG, 5′-agacttagtgtccccctc; Rmut3AUG, 5′-ctcttgaccagccgacg; and Rmut1–3AUG, 5′-ctcttgaccagccgacgtttttaaagacttagtgtccccctcaaggcttattc (mutated bases are underlined), in the conditions described above. The second type of PCR product was obtained with primers Fmut and R11.1. Primer Fmut, 5′-taagcgctgaggatcagga, introduced a mutation at the 5′-end of the amplified BRCA1 cDNA fragment, which was required for the further selection of pure mutants. These two types of PAGE-purified PCR products (0.1 pmol each) served as both a template and as a primer in the second PCR step carried out under the following conditions: 5-min initial denaturation at 94 °C, and 10 cycles, 20 s at 94 °C and 2 min at 70 °C. 2 μl of this crude PCR product was used to prepare templates for in vitrotranscription. The 20-μl amplification reaction was performed with primers T7Fex1b and R11.1 in the conditions described above. The control transcript EMCV RNA was synthesized by in vitrotranscription of a template generated by PCR from the pIRES-EGFP vector (CLONTECH). This transcript contains the 5′-UTR region of the EMCV virus and the enhanced GFP ORF encoding the 27-kDa polypeptide. The DNA sequences of all constructs and structures of their transcripts were determined. Twelve DNA constructs that are described above served as templates for the synthesis of 10BRCA1 mRNA fragments as follows: Ex2stop, Ex1a-2stop, Ex1b-2stop, Ex1b(M4)-2stop, Ex1a-11, Ex1b-11, Ex1b-11-mut1AUG, Ex1b-11-mut2AUG, Ex1b-11-mut3AUG, Ex1b-11-mut1–3AUG and two chimericBRCA1-luciferase transcripts, Ex1a-luc and Ex1b-luc. A transcription reaction carried out in a 50-μl volume contained 1–3 pmol of DNA template, 400 units of T7 RNA polymerase, 0.05 mm GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, UTP, 0.5 mm m7GpppG cap analog and 50 units of RNasin, in a 1× T7 polymerase buffer (Promega) supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Uncapped transcripts were synthesized using a 0.5 mm concentration of GTP instead of cap analog. Incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h. The RNA products were purified in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Transcripts encoding short BRCA1 peptides (5 pmol), the longer BRCA1transcripts Ex1a-11, Ex1b-11 (2 pmol), and chimericBRCA1-luciferase mRNAs (2 pmol) were used as templates for an in vitro translation reaction carried out in a 50-μl volume, containing 35 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (Promega), 2 μCi of [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol; ICN), and other amino acids at a 20 μm concentration. Translation reactions were performed at 30 °C for 1 h. The luciferase-encoding chimeric mRNAs were also used for in vitro translation in wheat germ extract (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All reactions were stopped by adding an SDS sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 10 min. Translation products were analyzed in 10–18% Tris glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by PhosphorImaging (Typhoon, Molecular Dynamics). Translation efficiencies were determined from measurements of [35S]methionine incorporated into a polypeptide. DNA templates for in vitrotranscription were synthesized by PCR from purified amplification products, ex1a-2, ex1a-11, ex1b-2, and ex1b-11 (see ”RT-PCR Analysis of BRCA1 mRNA Expression“), using forward primers containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. PCR conditions used were as described above and shown in Table I. The in vitro transcription was performed as described above, with an exception that the cap analog was replaced by a 3 mm guanosine, and GTP was used at a concentration of 0.5 mm. The RNA products were purified and 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN). All labeled transcripts were controlled for the number of stable conformers in which they exist by 6–10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1), performed under nondenaturing conditions (25.Krzyzosiak W.J. Napierala M. Drozdz M. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 303-314Google Scholar). The fluorescent labeling of in vitrotranscripts at their 3′-end was achieved with 6-carboxyrhodamine derivative R110 of dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Transcripts were extended by a single [R110]dUTP residue only. The reaction mixture contained 50 pmol of transcript, 10 pmol of [R110]dUTP, 25 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Promega), 20 units of RNasin, 100 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.5 mm CoCl2, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled transcripts were purified in polyacrylamide gel, dissolved in a 50 μl buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 40 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, denatured at 75 °C, renatured by slow cooling, and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The analysis was performed on an ABI 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under denaturing conditions (4% GeneScan polymer, 6.5 m urea, 90 mm Tris borate buffer and 2 mm EDTA) and under nondenaturing conditions (5% GeneScan polymer, 45 mm Tris borate buffer), using a standard capillary 42 cm long by 50 μm. The RNA samples were electroinjected, together with either the ROX-500 or TAMRA-500 internal standard, at 15 kV for 10 s, and electrophoresis was performed at 13 kV. Prior to structure probing reactions, the32P-labeled transcripts were supplemented with an unlabeled RNA carrier to the final concentration 8 μm and were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedures in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, by heating the sample at 75 °C for 1 min and slowly cooling it to room temperature. Limited RNA hydrolysis was initiated by mixing 5 μl of the RNA sample described above with 5 μl of a probe sample containing lead ions, S1, T1, V1, or Cl3 nucleases in water at different concentrations, as described in the legends to figures. All reactions were performed at 20 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (7.5m urea, 20 mm EDTA, and dyes) and sample freezing. The products of the RNA cleavages were separated in 6–12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea, 90 mmTris borate buffer, and 2 mm EDTA, along with products of limited digestion of the same RNA with ribonuclease T1 in semidenaturing conditions and with an alkaline hydrolysis ladder prepared by incubating the labeled RNA in hot formamide (26.Michalowski D. Wrzesinski J. Krzyzosiak W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10727-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis performed at 1500 V was followed by autoradiography at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. PCR primers were designed to amplify sequences corresponding to BRCA1 exon 1a, exon 1b, exon 2, exons 1a-2, and exons 1b-2 from cDNA (Fig. 1 A). BRCA1 mRNA with both types of first exon fused to exon 2 was detected in total cDNA from normal human testis tissue (Fig. 1 B). All of the PCR products that were obtained were of the length expected. Nucleotide sequencing (Fig. 1 C) confirmed their identity with the corresponding fragment of the BRCA1 sequence from GenBank™ (accession number L78833). The BRCA1transcripts expressed in a normal mammary gland were compared with those expressed in breast cancer tissue (Fig. 1 D). It is apparent that BRCA1 mRNA containing the exon 1b sequence is expressed in breast cancer tissue but not in a normal mammary gland. On the other hand, BRCA1 mRNA containing exon 1a was present in both normal and cancer tissue. The corroborated results that have been reported by other authors (21.Xu C.F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) provided a rationale for the analysis of the translational abilities of these mRNAs. In order to evaluate the influence of transcripts from BRCA1 exons 1a and 1b on translation efficiency, two constructs were prepared by fusing these exons with the coding sequence of the luciferase gene (Fig. 2 A). The translatability of transcripts from these constructs was investigated in RRL and in wheat germ extract (WGE) (Fig. 2 B). The expected 62-kDa translation product obtained from the transcript containingBRCA1 exon 1b was much less abundant than from the transcript with exon 1a. The difference was about 9 times in RRL and 10 times in WGE (Fig. 2 C). Our further experiments were designed to determine the molecular basis of this large difference in translation efficiency. We began with the structure analysis of two different 5′-UTRs of the BRCA1 mRNA. The 121-nt exon 1a contributes 87% to the total length of BRCA1 5′-UTRa. To determine its secondary structure limited chemical cleavages and enzymatic digestions of the transcript were performed under conditions preserving the natural folding of the RNA. The 5′-end-labeled transcript Ex1a was treated with lead ions that cleave the flexible single-stranded regions (27.Krzyzosiak W.J. Marciniec T. Wiewiorowski M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Giege R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5771-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28.Ciesiolka J. Michalowski D. Wrzesinski J. Krajewski J. Krzyzosiak W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and with nucleases T1 and Cl3 showing the specificity for G and C residues, respectively, within the single-stranded regions. Two other nucleases were also used as follows: S1 and V1, digesting single- and double-stranded regions, respectively, but having no base specificity (29.Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Attempts to correlate the experimental data with any secondary structure predicted by the Mfold program (30.Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar) failed, suggesting the co-existence of two or more stable conformers. Thus, further structure analysis was aided by a newly developed method allowing for an assessment of the number of co-existing stable conformers. This method, which is based on capillary electrophoresis of transcripts fluorescently labeled at their 3′-end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, was found superior to traditional PAGE of RNA under non-denaturing conditions. It detected four distinct species in the Ex1a transcript (Fig. 3 A), and the fact that individual peaks indeed contain different RNA structu"
https://openalex.org/W2020736624,"The minibrain kinase (Mnbk)/dual specificity Yak 1-related kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) gene is implicated in the mental retardation associated with Down's syndrome. It encodes a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase whose function has yet to be defined. We have used a solid-phase Mnbk/Dyrk1A kinase assay to aid in the search for the cellular Mnbk/Dyrk1A substrates. The assay revealed that rat brain contains two cytosolic proteins, one with a molecular mass of 100 kDa and one with a molecular mass of 140 kDa, that were prominently phosphorylated by Mnbk/Dyrk1A. The 100-kDa protein was purified and identified as dynamin 1. The conclusion was further supported by evidence that a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing dynamin isoform 1aa was phosphorylated by Mnbk/Dyrk1A. In addition to isoform 1aa, Mnbk/Dyrk1A also phosphorylated isoforms 1ab and 2aa but not human MxA protein when analyzed by the solid-phase kinase assay. Upon Mnbk/Dyrk1A phosphorylation, the interaction of dynamin 1 with the Src homology 3 domain of amphiphysin 1 was reduced. However, when Mnbk/Dyrk1A phosphorylation was allowed to proceed more extensively, the phosphorylation enhanced rather than reduced the binding of dynamin 1 to amphiphysin 1. The result suggests that Mnbk/Dyrk1A can play a dual role in regulating the interaction of dynamin 1 with amphiphysin 1. Mnbk/Dyrk1A phosphorylation also reduced the interaction of dynamin with endophilin 1, whereas the same phosphorylation enhanced the binding of dynamin 1 to Grb2. Nevertheless, the dual function of Mnbk/Dyrk1A phosphorylation was not observed for the interaction of dynamin 1 with endophilin 1 or Grb2. The interactions of dynamin with amphiphysin and endophilin are essential for the formation of endocytic complexes; our results suggest that Mnbk/Dyrk1A may function as a regulator controlling the assembly of endocytic apparatus."

The intracellular production of reactive oxygen species during exposure to hyperoxia is widely held to be responsible for both the lung injury seen in intact animals and the death of cells in culture following exposure to hyperoxia. In whole lung homogenates, cells in culture, and isolated mitochondria, exposure to hyperoxia increases the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 (7Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B.

Gabrielson E.W. Sylvester J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Most of these excess ROS are generated in the mitochondria through an increased flux of electrons through the ubisemiquinone/ubiquinone pathway at site III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (8Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10986-10992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sanders S.P. Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Harrison S.J. Bassett D.J. Gabrielson E.W. Sylvester J.T. J. Clin.

These ROS are thought to be responsible for the induction of necrosis and apoptosis in cultured cells and the lung injury in animals observed following exposure to hyperoxia (11Barazzone C. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Many stimuli that cause cell death (e.g. growth factor withdrawal, the chemotherapeutic agent staurosporine, and ultraviolet radiation) result in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane with the release of cytochrome c (reviewed in Ref. 12Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). This mitochondria-dependent apoptosis is initiated by the translocation or activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak and prevented by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules from the same family (Bcl-XL or Bcl-2) (13Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane results in release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it combines with Apaf-1 to activate caspase-9 in the apoptosome. Caspase-9 then activates the terminal caspase cascade, resulting in apoptosis (14Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In animal models of hyperoxic lung injury, investigators have reported alterations in the expression of both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (15O'Reilly M.A. Staversky R.J. Huyck H.L. Watkins R.H. LoMonaco M.B. D'Angio C.T. Baggs R.B. Maniscalco W.M. Pryhuber G.S. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Ward N.S. Waxman A.B.

It is not known, however, whether the expression of these proteins is required for or can prevent cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. We sought to test the hypothesis that exposure to hyperoxia triggers mitochondria-dependent apoptosis that requires the generation of ROS from mitochondrial electron transport. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that exposure to hyperoxia caused apoptosis through a mechanism that required Bax or Bak and was inhibited by Bcl-XL. Surprisingly, however, neither the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species nor a functional electron transport chain was required for cell death. Rat1a cells and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified essential medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 20 mm HEPES, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cell lines were passaged every 2–3 days and were discarded after 65 generations. Rat1a cells constitutively overexpressing Bcl-XL and empty plasmid encoding neomycin resistance (control cells) were a kind gift from Dr. N. Hay (17Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The ρ0 HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were generated by incubating wild type cells in medium containing ethidium bromide (100 ng/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (100 μg/ml) for 3–5 weeks (18Chandel N.S.

Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). These cells were immortalized with simian virus 40 (5 plaque-forming units/cell), a kind gift of Dr. Kathleen Rundell (21Porras A. Gaillard S. Rundell K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3102-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2) or normoxia (21% O2, 5% CO2, 74% N2) in sealed, humidified 1-liter glass chambers at 37 °C. The chambers were continuously perfused with the appropriate gas mixture at a flow rate of 4 liters/min. Medium volume loss is <3% over 72 h in this system. All experiments were performed with cells at 15–20% confluence at the beginning of the experiment. After exposure to hyperoxia or normoxia for the indicated time, the cells were removed from the plate using trypsin (0.25%), which was subsequently inactivated with medium. The cells were centrifuged (200 ×g for 5 min) and then resuspended in PBS containing tetramethyrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (2 μm) and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (10 μm) where indicated for 30 min. TMRE is a cationic dye that accumulates in the mitochondria in proportion to the mitochondrial membrane potential. TMRE fluorescence was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) (22Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). LDH release was measured using a commercially available assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After gentle agitation, 500 μl of medium was removed, and the remaining cells were lysed by adding the same volume of 1% Triton X-100. After 30 min, 500 μl of the lysate was removed. The samples were incubated (30 min) with buffer containing NAD+, lactate, and tetrazolium. LDH converts lactate to pyruvate generating NADH. The NADH then reduces tetrazolium (yellow) to formazan (red), which was detected by flourescence (490 mm). LDH release is expressed as the ratio of the LDH in the medium over the total LDH (lysate). DNA-histone complexes were measured using a commercially available assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were placed in a streptavidin-coated microplate with a mixture of anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody and incubated for 2 h. The anti-histone biotin-labeled antibody binds to the histone component of the nucleosomes and fixes the immunocomplex to the streptavidin-coated microplate. The peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody binds the DNA component of the nucleosomes and uses 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-sulfonate). After washing, nucleosome concentration is determined photometrically. Values are expressed as the -fold induction over normoxic controls. Nuclear morphology was assessed with DAPI staining as previously described (23McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, floating cells were aspirated, and adherent cells were removed from the plate using phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA. Floating and adherent cells were combined and incubated with 0.15% glutaraldehyde (15 min, 25 °C), centrifuged and resuspended in 80 μl of DAPI (10 μg/ml, 15 min, 37 °C), and then placed on a slide for fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were scored as apoptotic if they demonstrated nuclear fragmentation or condensation and reported as the percentage of total cells counted (100 cells). Caspase-9 activity was measured using a commercially available kit (R & D Systems). At the designated time, the cells were removed from the plate with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, combined with the supernatant, centrifuged, washed twice in PBS, and then lysed. The supernatant was then incubated with a caspase-9-specific peptide connected to a fluorescent reporter molecule, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, and fluorescence was measured. Values are expressed as -fold induction over untreated cells. Adherent cells were removed from the plate with calcium-free PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, washed, and incubated overnight in 95% ethanol (4 °C). The cells were then incubated in stain solution (propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), RNase, (180 units/ml), Triton X-100 (0.1%), citrate buffer (4 mm), and polyethylene glycol (3%)) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The solution was briefly vortexed, and an equal volume of salt solution (propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), Triton X-100 (0.1%), NaCl (4 m), and polyethylene glycol (3%)) was added (24Tlsty T. Briot A. Poulose B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells grown to 20–40% confluence were exposed to hyperoxia for the times shown. Adherent cells were removed using PBS/EDTA (1 mm), washed, and spun onto glass slides (Cytospin 3, Thermo Shandon, 200 × g, 5 min). The cells were fixed with a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone (5 min, −20 °C), blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (30 min, 25 °C), and incubated with 1 μg of anti-cytochrome cantibody (clone 6H2.B4; PharMingen) per ml of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (120 min, 37 °C). The cells were washed four times with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (15 min each), incubated with 1 μg of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (60 min, 37 °C), and washed as above. The slides were mounted with DAPI/DABCO (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (25Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release was assessed with fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescent photos were obtained with a 12-bit cooled Hamamatsu CCD camera and analyzed with Openlab 3.0 software (Improvision). Appropriate filters were used to detect rhodamine and DAPI. Single fluorophore images were collected, and an overlay of the images was then created. Cells were counted as having released cytochrome c if there was a loss of punctuate staining. Approximately 100 cells were counted for each condition (average of 5–10 fields). Results are expressed as cells releasing cytochrome c as a fraction of total cells. For immunoblotting, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence on five 100-mm plates per condition and exposed to air or hyperoxia for 60 h. Adherent and floating cells were removed (PBS/EDTA, 1 mm), washed, and resuspended in sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol) on ice for 30 min. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in an equal volume of sucrose buffer and transferred to a Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes). The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (400 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was then centrifuged (20,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was used for the analysis. A whole cell lysate was prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer for 2 min followed by sonication (30 s) as a positive control. Cytosolic or mitochondrial fractions (80 μg) were mixed with sample loading buffer (125 mm Tris base (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). After heating, the protein was resolved on an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, the gel was stained with Ponceau S to verify uniform loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-T (100 mm Tris base (pH 7.5), 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with 1 μg of the 7H8.2C12 anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen) per ml or with 0.5 μg of 20E8-C12 anti-cytochrome coxidase subunit IV antibody (Molecular Probes) per ml overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) (23McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X.

Cells were washed with PBS and then loaded with 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) (10 μm) for 30 min in modified Eagle’s medium without phenol red. The acetoxymethyl group on CM-H2DCFDA is cleaved by nonspecific esterases within the cell, resulting in a charged molecule that does not cross the cell membrane. Intracellular generation of H2O2irreversibly oxidizes the dye causing it to fluoresce (28Xie Z. Kometiani P. Li J. Liu J. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19323-19328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cells loaded with CM-H2DCFDA were exposed to normoxia (21% O2), hyperoxia (95% O2), or antimycin A (10 μg/ml) for 6 h in the presence of the CM-H2DCFDA (10 μm) as described above. All procedures were carried out in the dark. After the exposure, the cells were washed and removed from the plate (PBS/EDTA, 1 mm), centrifuged (200 ×g for 5 min), and resuspendend in PBS, and fluorescence was measured using FACS analysis. One-way analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in measured variables between groups. Where the F statistic indicated a significant difference, individual differences were explored using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level. Rat1a cells stably transfected with Bcl-XL or empty plasmid (control-transfected cells) were exposed to hyperoxia for 72 h. The constitutive overexpression of Bcl-XL prevented cell death following exposure to hyperoxia (Fig.1a). Untransfected Rat1a cells die at a rate similar to control transfected cells (data not shown). To confirm that cell death following exposure to hyperoxia was apoptotic, Rat1a cells were exposed to hyperoxia for 72 h, and DNA fragmentation was assessed. Control transfected cells had similar increases in LDH release and DNA fragmentation following exposure to hyperoxia, whereas Bcl-XL-transfected cells did not show increases in DNA fragmentation above that observed in control cells (Fig. 1b). The protection conferred by overexpression of Bcl-XL against apoptosis in response to hyperoxia suggests that hyperoxia-induced apoptosis occurs via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. To further investigate this hypothesis, we measured the activation of caspase-9 and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol at the time when the cells committed to die during exposure to hyperoxia. To determine the duration of exposure to hyperoxia necessary to induce a commitment to die, Rat1a cells transfected with control vector or Bcl-XLwere exposed to hyperoxia for 24, 32, and 40 h and then brought back to 21% oxygen for 48, 40, and 32 h, respectively. Then cell death was measured. Cell death after 40 h of exposure to hyperoxia was similar to that seen after 72 h of exposure to hyperoxia, suggesting that the cells committed to die between 32–40 h of exposure to hyperoxia (Fig. 2a). We measured caspase-9 activation before and after the commitment to die. The timing of caspase-9 activation paralleled the timing of the commitment to die (Fig. 2b). In concordance with these findings, the percentage of control transfected cells that had released cytochrome c was increased after 40 h of exposure to hyperoxia when compared with normoxic controls (Fig.3). Other investigators have shown that Rat1a cells are relatively resistant to CD95L-induced apoptosis (29Klefstrom J. Vastrik I. Saksela E. Valle J. Eilers M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5442-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We found no significant activation of caspase-8 following exposure to hyperoxia for 40 h (data not shown).Figure 3The overexpression of Bcl-XL prevents cytochrome c release following exposure to hyperoxia. a, control and Bcl-XL-transfected Rat1a cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2) or air (21% O2) for 50 h, and cytochrome c release was determined by immunoblotting of the cytosolic fraction (right four lanes) and the whole cell lysate (left lane) for cytochrome c. Immunoblotting for cytochrome oxidase subunit IV was performed on the same sample to confirm appropriate cell fractionation. b, cytochrome c release in Rat1a cells exposed to hyperoxia or air was also determined by immunostaining. Results are expressed as the percentage of cells demonstrating a loss of punctuate staining. The results of three independent experiments are shown ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 for comparison between control and Bcl-XL-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimuli that induce apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway have been shown to require the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak. Cells deficient in Bax and Bak have been shown to be resistant to multiple proapoptotic stimuli including the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs, growth factor withdrawal, and ultraviolet radiation but continue to undergo apoptosis upon exposure to CD95L (20Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). To confirm that hyperoxic cell killing required Bcl-2 proteins, we exposed immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts isolated from mice deficient in both Bax and Bak (bax−/−bak−/−) and wild type controls to hyperoxia for 72 h and measured cell death. Cells lacking Bax and Bak were protected against exposure to hyperoxia, indicating that Bax or Bak are required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia (Fig. 4). Depolarization or hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane has been observed before the commitment to die following the administration of a number of apoptotic stimuli that act through a mitochondria-dependent pathway. Therefore, we measured the mitochondrial membrane potential in control and Bcl-XL-transfected cells before and after the commitment to die. In control transfected cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained following up to 32 h of exposure to hyperoxia after which a population of markedly depolarized cells was observed. In cells overexpressing Bcl-XL, the mitochondrial membrane potential did not change following exposure to hyperoxia (Fig.5). These results demonstrate that a significant fall in mitochondrial membrane potential does not precede the commitment to die following exposure to hyperoxia. Several groups of investigators have proposed that exposure to hyperoxia might result in DNA damage, causing both growth arrest and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 30O'Reilly M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L291-L305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These investigators have demonstrated that hyperoxia results in growth arrest in both the G0 and S phases of the cell cycle, perhaps suggesting two distinct mechanisms of hyperoxia-induced growth arrest. This growth arrest might protect or sensitize cells to hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. To determine whether Bcl-XLprevented hyperoxia-induced cell cycle arrest, we exposed cells that overexpress Bcl-XL to hyperoxia for 48 h (a dose of hyperoxia that is lethal to control transfected cells) and measured the percentage of cells in each stage of the cell cycle. Overexpression of Bcl- XL did not prevent the S phase cell cycle arrest observed after 48 h of exposure to hyperoxia (Fig.6). These results are similar to those of Strasser et al., who demonstrated that apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest following exposure to ultraviolet irradiation was prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-XL in T lymphoma cells (31Strasser A. Harris A.W. Jacks T. Cory S. Cell. 1994; 79: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Compared with cells exposed to 21% O2, cells exposed to hyperoxia generate excess reactive oxygen species from the mitochondria (8Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10986-10992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sanders S.P. Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Harrison S.J. Bassett D.J. Gabrielson E.W. Sylvester J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These ROS have been widely hypothesized to be responsible for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. We therefore sought to determine whether abrogation of the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species prevented mitochondria-dependent apoptosis following exposure to hyperoxia. Control transfected Rat1a cells were pretreated with antioxidants for 30 min and then exposed to 72 h of continuous hyperoxia in the presence of these antioxidants (Fig.7a). Neither ebselen (a glutathione peroxidase mimetic), Mn(III) TBAP (a superoxide dismutase mimetic), the combination of ebselen and Mn(III) TBAP, norN-acetylcysteine prevented cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. Both the combination of Mn(III) TBAP with ebselen and withN-acetylcysteine prevented the increase in fluorescence of CM-H2DCFDA seen following exposure to antimycin A (10 μg/ml) for 6 h (data not shown). The failure of these antioxidants to prevent hyperoxia-induced cell death suggested that cell death following exposure to hyperoxia might not require the mitochondrial generation of ROS. To further test this hypothesis, we generated ρ0 HT1080 cells and exposed them to hyperoxia. These cells lack mitochondrial DNA and are therefore unable to generate ROS from electron transport. Wild type HT1080 cells but not ρ0 HT1080 cells demonstrated significant increases in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence, a measure of H2O2 production, following exposure to hyperoxia (6 h). Whereas ρ0 HT1080 cells demonstrated a small increase in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence in response to antimycin A (10 μg/ml), this response was markedly less than that observed in wild type cells (Fig. 7). Nevertheless, cell death following exposure to hyperoxia for 72 h was similar in ρ0 cells and wild type controls (Fig.8). Consistent with these findings, a similar percentage of ρ0 cells and wild type cells had released cytochrome c after 40 h of exposure to hyperoxia (Fig. 8). These results suggest that neither the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species nor a functional electron transport chain is required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. We sought to determine the mechanism by which exposure to hyperoxia results in cell death in cultured cells. We found that exposure to hyperoxia causes apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway and can be prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-XL (Fig.9). Exposure to hyperoxia results in the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytosol accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The release of cytochrome c is associated with the activation of caspase-9 and the commitment of the cells to die. Bcl-XL prevents apoptosis following exposure to hyperoxia by preventing changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation. The overexpression of Bcl-XL did not prevent growth arrest in S phase following exposure to hyperoxia. Recently, Wei et al. and Lindsten et al. have demonstrated that multiple stimuli that trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis including growth factor withdrawal, UV irradiation, etoposide, staurosporine, and thapsigargan require the presence of Bax or Bak (20Wei M.C.

Mitochondria-dependent apoptotic stimuli cause translocation of Bax and Bak from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where they cause mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) inhibit mitochondrial permeabilization by sequestering or preventing the activation of Bax and Bak (33Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Our finding that Bax or Bak are required for and Bcl-XLprevents apoptosis following exposure to hyperoxia is consistent with this hypothesis. Our results indicating that Bcl-2 family members regulate cell death following exposure to hyperoxia might be used to explain the mechanism by which a variety of strategies protect against hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Pharmacologic pretreatment with or genetic overexpression of a number of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-11, growth factors (insulin-like growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor)), the β subunit of the Na+K+ ATPase, and heme oxygenase 1 have been shown to protect animals from subsequent hyperoxic injury (reviewed in Ref. 11Barazzone C. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Some of these protective strategies may alter the expression or activity of pro- or antiapoptotic factors such as Bax, Bak, Bcl- XL, or Akt. For example, Ward et al. (16Ward N.S. Waxman A.B. Homer R.J. Mantell L.L. Du O. Einarsson Y. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing the cytokine IL-6 survived hyperoxia, whereas wild type controls did not. In whole lung homogenates from these animals, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased. The antiapoptotic protein Akt attenuates mitochondria-dependent apoptosis through a mechanism that acts in part through Bcl-2 proteins (34del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). In rats, Lu et al. (35Lu Y. Parkyn L. Otterbein L.E. Kureishi Y. Walsh K. Ray A. Ray P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) demonstrated that adenoviral overexpression of Akt attenuated hyperoxic lung injury. Surprisingly, we were unable to prevent cell death following exposure to hyperoxia by administering exogenous antioxidants or preventing the formation of reactive oxygen species by the mitochondria. We exposed wild type Rat1a cells to hyperoxia in the presence of several antioxidants. Mn(III) TBAP is a superoxide dismutase mimetic, and ebselen is a glutathione peroxidase mimetic. The administration of Mn(III) TBAP should accelerate the conversion of the superoxide anion to H2O2, and ebselen should accelerate the conversion of H2O2 to water. Neither of these agents, alone or in combination, prevented cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine also failed to prevent cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. Mitochondrial ROS generation during exposure to hyperoxia might overwhelm antioxidant defense mechanisms even in the presence of exogenously administered antioxidants. To determine whether mitochondrial ROS are required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia, we exposed cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA to hyperoxia. The mammalian mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 polypeptides including critical catalytic subunits for complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), complex III (Bcl complex), complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and the F1F0-ATP synthase (19King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 36Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cells lacking mitochondrial DNA contain intact mitochondria and undergo apoptosis with release of cytochrome c after growth factor withdrawal or the administration of staurosporine but are protected against cell death following exposure to anoxia (23McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Wang J. Silva J.P. Gustafsson C.M. Rustin P. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4038-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). While an increase in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence was not observed in ρ0 cells exposed to hyperoxia, a small increase in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence was seen in the ρ0cells following exposure to antimycin A. This increase appeared to affect the majority of the cell population (FACS). While the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear, the increase in fluorescence was substantially smaller than that observed in wild type cells. Despite this marked attenuation in intracellular ROS generation observed in the ρ0 cells following both exposure to hyperoxia and antimycin A, no reduction in cell death following exposure to hyperoxia was observed. These results, suggesting that the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species is not required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia, are consistent with those of Senturkeret al. (38Sentürker S. Tschirret-Guth R. Morrow J. Levine R. Shacter E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that apoptosis following administration of VP-16 and cisplatin did not require ROS generation in human B lymphoma cells. In whole lung homogenates and in endothelial cells, several groups of investigators have demonstrated that the mitochondrial generation of ROS increases during exposure to hyperoxia (8Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D.

However, in 6–8-week-old mice overexpressing manganese superoxide dismutase, the primary antioxidant enzyme in the mitochondria, Wispeet al. (39Wispe J.R. Warner B.B. Clark J.C. Dey C.R. Neuman J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23937-23941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that 80% of the animals died during the hyperoxic exposure (albeit 4 days later than controls). In 6–8-week-old mice overexpressing extracellular superoxide dismutase, Folz et al. (40Folz R.J. Abushamaa A.M. Suliman H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) found that several markers of lung injury were attenuated compared with wild type controls; mortality, however, was not significantly improved. White et al. (3White C.W. Avraham K.B. Shanley P.F. Groner Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported that death was delayed in older (5.5-month-old) transgenic mice overexpressing the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, the major antioxidant enzyme in the cytosol. Younger transgenic mice (2.5 months old) all survived a 10-day exposure to hyperoxia (3White C.W. Avraham K.B. Shanley P.F. Groner Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Some strategies that are effective at attenuating lung injury following exposure to hyperoxia (e.g. the overexpression of either IL-6 or heme oxygenase 1) do not effect the expression of antioxidant enzymes (6Otterbein L.E. Kolls J.K. Mantell L.L. Cook J.L. Alam J. Choi A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar,16Ward N.S. Waxman A.B. Homer R.J. Mantell L.L. Du O. Einarsson Y. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that neither the mitochondrial generation of ROS nor a functional electron transport chain is required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia in vitro. The generation of ROS during exposure to hyperoxia, however, might modulate other pathways contributing to lung injury in vivo. In conclusion, exposure of cultured cells to hyperoxia results in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis that is prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-XL and requires the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak. Bcl-XL acts by preventing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria but does not prevent cell cycle arrest during exposure to hyperoxia. The mitochondrial generation of ROS is not required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism(s) by which exposure to hyperoxia activates Bax or Bak, triggering the process of cell death. We thank Mary C.

The type 1 fimbriae and the P-fimbriae of Escherichia coli have both been described to be important for the establishment of urinary tract infections. While P-fimbriae recognize kidney glycosphingolipids carrying the Galα4Gal determinant, type 1 fimbriae bind to the urothelial mannosylated glycoproteins uroplakin Ia and Ib. The F1C fimbriae are one additional type of fimbria correlated with uropathogenicity. Although it was identified 20 years ago its receptor has remained unidentified. Here we report that F1C-fimbriated bacteria selectively interact with two minor glycosphingolipids isolated from rat, canine, and human urinary tract. Binding-active compounds were isolated and characterized as galactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide, both with phytosphingosine and hydroxy fatty acids. Comparison with reference glycosphingolipids revealed that the receptor specificity is dependent on the ceramide composition. Galactosylceramide was present in the bladder, urethers, and kidney while globotriaosylceramide was present only in the kidney. Using a functional assay, we demonstrate that binding of F1C-fimbriated Escherichia coli to renal cells induces interleukin-8 production, thus suggesting a role for F1C-mediated attachment in mucosal defense against bacterial infections.

Epithelial linings of the host function as very efficient barriers against microorganisms. To achieve this protective effect the mucosal lining utilizes a variety of mechanisms that engage multiple signaling pathways upon bacterial exposure. The most commonly studied mechanism for the induction of the host's innate immune response in urinary tract infections is bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. Although this is reported as one of the most important virulence trait of uropathogenic Escherichia coli, bacterial adhesion also leads to induction of the host's immune system (1Bäckhed F. Söderhall M. Ekman P. Normark S. Richter-Dahlfors A. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Hedlund M. Svensson M. Nilsson A. Duan R.D. Svanborg C. J. Exp.

Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Accordingly, adhesion to the epithelium acts as a double-edged sword for bacteria. Adhesion of Gram-negative bacteria to epithelial cells is often mediated by fimbria or pili. These rod-shaped, proteinaceous, filamentous polymeric organelles are expressed on the surface of bacteria. P and type 1 fimbriae are the two best characterized attachment organelles, both known for their central role in urinary tract infections (4Johnson J.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 80-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Expression of P fimbriae is mainly associated with pyelonephritogenic isolates of uropathogenic E. coli. Binding of P fimbriae to Galα4Gal-carrying glycosphingolipids, an epitope present in the human kidney, is of major importance for the establishment of disease (5Källenius G. Möllby R. Svenson S.B.

The type 1 fimbriae are mainly associated with cystitis, and confer binding to mannosylated proteins such as uroplakin that are abundant within the lower urinary tract (8Aronson M. Medalia O.

Although the biogenesis as well as binding characteristics of P fimbriae and type 1 fimbriae have been studied in detail, uropathogenic isolates of E. coli express other fimbriae that are less well characterized, in part because their target tissue receptors are unidentified. One such example is the F1C fimbriae, which are expressed by 14–30% of all uropathogenic strains of E. coli (12Siitonen A. Martikainen R. Ikaheimo R. Palmgren J. Mäkelä P.H. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 15: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,13Pere A. Nowicki B. Saxen H. Siitonen A. Korhonen T.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1987; 156: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The F1C fimbriae are structurally related to, and genetically organized as, the type 1 fimbriae. However, comparison of the amino acid sequence reveals that F1C is more closely related to the S fimbriae (14van Die I. Kramer C. Hacker J. Bergmans H. Jongen W. Hoekstra W. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The S fimbriae confer binding to sialyl-α2–3Galβ-containing receptor molecules, and are associated to sepsis and meningitis caused by E. coli in newborn children (15Parkkinen J. Rogers G.N.

The kidney has been reported to be the target tissue of F1C expressing E. coli using in vitro models and strictly biochemical approaches (17Virkola R. Westerlund B. Holthofer H. Parkkinen J.

In the present study, we use in vivo and in vitro model systems to identify the glycosphingolipid receptor for F1C expressing strains of uropathogenic E. coli within the human, rat, and canine urinary tract.

Hanson L.-Å. Kaijser B. Larsson P. Olling S. Svanborg-Eden C. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 639-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The non-fimbriated E. coli strain HB101 was transformed with the plasmid L40 carrying the foc operon from the pyelonephritogenic strain KS71 (20Rhen M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 571-580PubMed Google Scholar). The Galα4Gal binding recombinant E. coli strain HB101/pPIL291-15, carrying a plasmid-borne pap gene cluster with a class II papG allele, was obtained from Dr. I. van Die (Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). E. coli strains were cultured (37 °C, 12 h) on Luria-agar plates supplemented with 10 μl of [35S]methionine (400 mCi;Amersham Biosciences, UK). Bacteria were harvested by scraping, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3), then resuspended to a bacterial density of 1 × 108 colony forming units/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% mannose (w/v). The specific activity of bacterial suspensions was ∼1 cpm per 100 bacteria. Total acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were obtained by standard procedures (21Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The individual glycosphingolipids were isolated by repeated chromatography on silicic acid columns of the native glycosphingolipid fractions or acetylated derivatives thereof. The identity of the purified glycosphingolipids was confirmed by mass spectrometry (22Samuelsson B.E. Pimlott W. Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 623-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), proton NMR spectroscopy (23Koerner T.A., Jr. Prestegard J.H. Demou P.C. Yu R.K.

Reference galactosylceramide was obtained from Sigma. Mixtures of glycosphingolipids (40 μg) or pure glycosphingolipids (0.1–4 μg) were separated on glass- or aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) as solvent system. Borate-impregnated plates were prepared by spraying the HPTLC plates with 1% (w/v) aqeous sodium tetraborate followed by activation for 30 min at 120 °C (26Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Leffler H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The solvent system used for borate-impregnated plates was chloroform/methanol/water (100:30:4, by volume). Anisaldehyde was used for chemical detection (27Waldi D. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1962: 496-515Google Scholar). Binding of 35S-labeled bacteria to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatograms was performed as previously reported (28Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Strömberg N. Thurin J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Dried chromatograms were dipped for 1 min in diethylether/n-hexane (1:5, by volume) containing 0.5% (w/v) polyisobutylmethacrylate (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI). After drying, the chromatograms were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.1% NaN3 (w/v), and 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. The chromatograms were covered with a suspension of radiolabeled bacteria. Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature, chromatograms were extensively washed (phosphate-buffered saline), and then exposed to XAR-5 x-ray films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 12 h. Autoradiograms were replicated using a CCD camera (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN), and analysis of the images was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health, and available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Acid and non-acid glycosphingolipids were isolated from rat, canine, and human kidneys by standard methods (21Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were isolated from samples of canine urethra, urinary bladder, the trigonum area of the urinary bladder, urethers, and kidney.

Open table in a new tab HPLC separation of the total non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions of rat, canine, and human kidneys was performed using a Kromasil 5 Silica column (1 × 25 cm inner diameter, particle size 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrence, CA). The fractions obtained were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using anisaldehyde for detection, and the glycosphingolipid-containing fractions were tested for binding of F1C-fimbriated E. coli using the chromatogram binding assay. Part of the total non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction of rat kidney (3.5 mg) was separated by HPLC eluted with a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol/water 80:20:1 to 60:35:8 (by volume) during 180 min with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The monoglycosylceramides eluted in tubes 8–13, and the binding-active compound was found in tubes 12 and 13. Pooling of these tubes gave ∼100 μg of pure binding-active monoglycosylceramide (designated fraction R1). Isolation of non-acid glycosphingolipids from 520 g dry weight human kidneys has been described previously (29Holgersson J. Jovall P.-Å. Samuelsson B.E. Breimer M.E. Glycoconj. J. 1991; 8: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction was subjected to repeated silicic acid chromatography, and the mono- to triglycosylceramides were pooled, giving 700 mg. This fraction was further separated by HPLC by an isocratic elution with chloroform/methanol/water (80:25:0.5, by volume) during 180 min and a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Pure binding-active monoglycosylceramide (5.0 mg; designated fraction H1) eluted in tube 5, while tube 12 (158 mg) contained the binding-active compound migrating in the tri- to tetraglycosylceramide region. Since the latter fraction also contained several non-binding compounds, this fraction was further separated by HPLC eluted with a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol/water (80:20:1 to 60:35:8 (by volume)) during 180 min, and with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Pooling of tubes 70–170 resulted in 2.0 mg of pure binding-active glycosphingolipid, which was designated fraction H2. Part of the total non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction of canine kidney (15.0 mg) was separated on a 20-g Iatrobeads column (Iatron Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan) eluted stepwise with increasing amounts of methanol and water in chloroform (29Holgersson J. Jovall P.-Å. Samuelsson B.E. Breimer M.E. Glycoconj. J. 1991; 8: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pure binding-active monoglycosylceramide (1.0 mg; designated fraction C1) and triglycosylceramide (1.3 mg; designated fraction C2) was thereby obtained. Hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids with β-galactosidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (Oxford Glycosystems Ltd., Abingdon, UK) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glycosphingolipids were also treated with green coffee bean α-galactosidase (Glyko, Inc., Novato, CA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Negative ion FAB mass spectra were recorded on a JEOL SX-102A mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The ions were produced by 6 keV xenon atom bombardment, using triethanolamine (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as matrix, and an accelerating voltage of −10 kV. EI mass spectrometry was performed on permethylated aliquots of the isolated glycosphingolipids (30Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The derivatized samples were analyzed on a JEOL SX-102A mass spectrometer, using the in beam technique (31Breimer M. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Leffler H. Pascher I. Pimlott W. Samuelsson B.E. Quayle A. Advances in Mass Spectrometry. 8. Heyden & Son, London1980: 1097-1108Google Scholar). The analyses was performed with an electron energy of 70 eV, trap current of 300 μA, and acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The temperature was raised from 150 to 410 °C, by increases of 10 °C/min. 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian 500 MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. Samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/D2O (98:2, by volume) after deuterium exchange. The human renal epithelial cell line A498 (ATCC HTB-44) was grown in 24-well cell culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At confluency, cells were washed before control medium (no additives) or medium containing 2 × 106 colony forming units of HB101 or HB101/L40 was added. Supernatants were collected 6 and 25 h post-infection and were analyzed by enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay for IL-8 (Diaclone, Besancon, France). The uropathogenic E. coli strain ARD6 was originally isolated from a child suffering from pyelonephritis (19Mattsby-Baltzer I. Hanson L.-Å. Kaijser B. Larsson P. Olling S. Svanborg-Eden C. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 639-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has also been shown to cause pyelonephritis in rat (32Uhlen P. Laestadius A. Jahnukainen T. Söderblom T. Bäckhed F. Celsi G. Brismar H. Normark S. Aperia A. Richter-Dahlfors A. Nature. 2000; 405: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To identify renal receptor(s) to which ARD6 binds, non-acid and acid glycosphingolipids were isolated from kidneys of 20-day-old, non-infected rats. Similar preparations were also isolated from canine and human tissues. A binding assay of 35S-labeled ARD6 to non-acid glycosphingolipids separated on thin-layer chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1. A selective interaction with a distinct minor band migrating in the monoglycosylceramide region in the non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions of rat (lane 1) and canine (lane 2) kidney is seen, together with a band migrating in the tri- to tetraglycosylceramide region in the canine kidney sample. Binding to the monoglycosylceramide region and tri- to tetraglycosylceramide region was also obtained when using non-acid glycosphingolipids from human kidney (see Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Occasionally, a band migrating in the diglycosylceramide region was detected in the human and canine kidney samples. No binding to the acid glycosphingolipid fractions of rat (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), canine, or human kidney (data not shown) was obtained. In comparison to this distinct binding pattern, the Galα4Gal-binding P-fimbriated E. coli (Fig. 1 C) displayed a broader binding pattern with several binding-active compounds in each tissue sample.Figure 2Binding of wild type and recombinant F1C-fimbriated E. coli to non-acid glycosphingolipids of rat, canine, and human kidneys. The glycosphingolipids were separated on aluminum-backed silica gel plates and visualized with anisaldehyde (A). Duplicate chromatograms were incubated with radiolabeled F1C-fimbriated E. coli strains ARD6 (B) and HB101/L40 (C), followed by autoradiography for 12 h, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The solvent system used was chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume). The lanes were: non-acid glycosphingolipids of rat kidney, 40 μg (lane 1); non-acid glycosphingolipids of canine kidney, 40 μg (lane 2); non-acid glycosphingolipids of human kidney, 40 μg (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate which attachment organelles are expressed by ARD6, PCR analysis was performed, using primers for detection of P pili, type 1 fimbriae, F1C fimbriae, and afimbrial adhesins. This analysis showed that ARD6 harbors the genes for type 1 fimbriae and F1C fimbriae but not P fimbriae or afimbrial adhesin (data not shown). This was further verified in agglutination studies. ARD6 did not agglutinate human erythrocytes due to lack of P fimbriae expression. In contrast, ARD6 induced mannose-sensitive agglutination of yeast, which is the hallmark for type 1 fimbriae expression (data not shown). However, type 1 fimbriae are not likely to be responsible for binding of ARD6 to glycosphingolipid receptors, because the binding assays are routinely performed in the presence of 1% mannose, which inhibits binding via the type 1 fimbriae. To investigate whether the F1C fimbriae are responsible for the observed bacterial binding to glycosphingolipids, the F1C-expressing plasmid L40 was introduced into the non-fimbriated E. coli strain HB101. When the resulting strain, HB101/L40, was tested in the chromatogram binding assay, an identical binding pattern was observed as for ARD6,i.e. binding to the monoglycosylceramide region in the rat, canine, and human kidney samples along with binding to the tri- to tetraglycosylceramide region in the canine and human kidney samples (Fig. 2 C). No binding was observed using HB101. Thus, binding of ARD6 to glycosphingolipids is mediated by the F1C fimbriae. Further characterization of the binding-active compound migrating in the monoglycosylceramide region from rat (fraction R1), human (fraction H1), and canine kidney (fraction C1) identified galactosylceramide (Galβ1Cer) with phytosphingosine and hydroxy 20:0–24:0 fatty acids as the binding-active component. This conclusion is based on the following five observations. (i) The binding-active monoglycosylceramides of fraction R1, H1, and C1 all migrated as distinct bands at the lower margin of the monoglycosylceramide region in TLC analysis. (ii) TLC experiments using borate-impregnated silica gel plates showed that the isolated monoglycosylceramides co-migrated with the reference galactosylceramide (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5). (iii) Negative ion FAB mass spectrometry (exemplified in Fig. 4) identified a monohexosylceramide with phytosphingosine and hydroxy 20:0–24:0 fatty acids. (iv) Proton NMR spectroscopy (data not shown) showed a single anomeric proton resonance of Galβ1Cer at 4.04 ppm (33Dabrowski J. Egge H. Hanfland P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1980; 26: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Treatment of the total non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions of rat, canine, and human kidneys with β-galactosidase abolished the binding of F1C-fimbriated bacteria to the monoglycosylceramide region (exemplified in Fig. 7 B,lane 2).Figure 4Negative ion FAB mass spectrum of the binding-active monoglycosylceramide isolated from rat kidney. The series of molecular ions (M-H+)− at m/z 788–844 indicate a glycosphingolipid one hexose and phytosphingosine and hydroxy 20:0–24:0 fatty acids. A series of ceramide ions, obtained by elimination of the carbohydrate unit, is found at m/z 626–682 (M-Hex-H+)−. Thus, the glycosphingolipid was identified as a monohexosylceramide with phytosphingosine and hydroxy 20:0–24:0 fatty acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Effects of β-galactosidase and α-galactosidase hydrolysis on binding of F1C-fimbriated E. coli to non-acid kidney glycosphingolipids.

Duplicate chromatograms were incubated with radiolabeled F1C-fimbriated E. coli strain HB101/pL40 (B), followed by autoradiography for 12 h, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The solvent system used was chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume). The lanes on chromatograms (A) and (B) were: non-acid glycosphingolipids of human kidney, 40 μg (lane 1); non-acid glycosphingolipids of human kidney after hydrolysis with β-galactosidase, 40 μg (lane 2); triglycosylceramide (fraction H2) isolated from human kidney, 2 μg (lane 3); and the lanes on chromatograms (C) and (D) were: non-acid glycosphingolipids of human blood group A erythrocytes, 40 μg (lane 1); non-acid glycosphingolipids of canine kidney after hydrolysis with α-galactosidase, 40 μg (lane 2); non-acid glycosphingolipids of canine kidney, 40 μg (lane 3).

This conclusion was based on the following four properties. (i) EI mass spectrometry of the permethylated fraction H2 and fraction C2 resulted in almost identical mass spectra (exemplified in Fig. 5), identifying a trihexosylceramide with phytosphingosine and hydroxy 20:0–24:0 fatty acids. (ii) The proton NMR spectra of the triglycosylceramides of human (Fig. 6) and canine (data not shown) kidney both had three H1 anomeric signals at 4.78 ppm (α), 4.25 ppm (β), and 4.21 ppm (β), respectively, and the compounds were thus identified as Galα4Galβ4Glcβ1Cer through comparison with previously published spectra (34Poppe L.

https://openalex.org/W1982078028,"Differentiating osteoblasts in culture undergo a commitment stage, during which cobblestone-like cells grow to high density past confluency. In contrast to earlier proliferative stages, the cell cycle during this commitment stage is inhibited by glucocorticoids (GC). Chronic GC treatment also impedes mineral deposition if steroid administration commences early enough during commitment. This study defines a role for glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and its target, c-Myc, in the GC-sensitive osteoblast persistent cell cycle. c-Myc levels decreased as cells reached confluence, but then increased during growth to high density. GC administration at this stage resulted in down-regulation of c-Myc. This was accompanied by GC-mediated attenuation of GSK3β Ser9 inhibitory phosphorylation and increased GSK3β kinase activity. Down-regulation of c-Myc was attributable to enhanced Thr58 phosphorylation, leading to accelerated degradation. In contrast, GC did not inhibit the c-Myc synthesis rate or the level of β-catenin, a transcriptional coactivator of c-myc. The attenuated cell cycle and the reduced c-Myc level were returned to control levels by specific inhibition of GSK3β using lithium chloride. These results suggest that tonal GSK3β repression at the cobblestone stage of osteoblast differentiation permits osteoblast growth to high density. GC interfere with this growth-permissive axis by GSK3β activation, resulting in c-Myc down-regulation and impediment of the G1/S cell cycle transition.

Kream B. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 533-548Google Scholar). The most important single mechanism contributing to bone loss in GC-treated patients is inhibition of osteoblastic bone formation (for review, see Refs. 2Manolagas S.C. Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner.

During this stage, proliferation persists, but is regulated uniquely compared with control of the cell cycle prior to confluence. At this commitment stage (but not earlier), GC inhibit cell cycle progression (4Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Differentiating nontransformed osteoblasts that grow to high density do exhibit growth inhibitory signals, e.g. increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, decreased cyclin E, and reduced free E2F DNA-binding activity (4Smith E.

To explain the persistent growth, we postulated that the Wnt signaling pathway, which links cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to the cell cycle (7Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P.

Wingless/Wnt-mediated cell-cell signaling molecules play a major role in organogenesis and are conserved among vertebrates, flies, and primitive multicellular organisms (11Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 12Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 13Hobmayer B.

Components of the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway participate in cell-cell adhesion, body patterning, cell growth, and tumorigenesis (11Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 12Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Forced activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by overexpression of either Wnt1 (18Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or its target, β-catenin (19Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), results in cell growth to high density. The β-catenin pool relevant to Wnt signaling resides in the cytoplasm and is distinct from a membrane-associated pool that plays a role in cell-cell adherence. In response to Wnt signaling, cytoplasmic β-catenin increases and enters the nucleus, where it cooperates with lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor in the transcriptional activation of cell cycle stimulatory genes such as c-myc (9He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (10Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). A major regulator of β-catenin is glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). β-Catenin and GSK3β are found in a cytoplasmic complex called the β-catenin destruction complex, which also contains axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (25Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The association of β-catenin with GSK3β results in rapid degradation of β-catenin, probably mediated by phosphorylation. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in decreased GSK3β intrinsic activity and, more importantly, disruption of the β-catenin destruction complex, leading to increased stability and accumulation of β-catenin. GSK3β also plays a role in regulating growth signals elicited by molecules such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (14Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P.

These signals inhibit the intrinsic activity of GSK3β, but do not usually lead to disruption of the β-catenin destruction complex. In this study, we examined the involvement of the GSK3β/β-catenin/c-myc axis in GC inhibition of the persistent cell cycle in post-confluent differentiating osteoblasts. We found that GC-treated differentiating osteoblasts displayed increased GSK3β activity and decreased levels of c-Myc; however, c-Myc down-regulation by GSK3β was not mediated via β-catenin, but rather by direct phosphorylation and enhanced degradation of c-Myc itself. The MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells used in this study were derived from a subclone recently isolated based on its robust mineralization potential (4Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A.

This subclone was expanded to ∼109 cells, at which time frozen stocks were prepared and defined as passage 1. Cells were maintained up to passage 12 in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. All experiments were performed under differentiation conditions, i.e. in the presence of 50 μm ascorbic acid and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate.

These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml Geneticin. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared essentially according to Verona et al. (21Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4. Cells were left to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s and spun at 500 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant (containing the cytoplasmic lysate) was supplemented with 0.33 volume of 80% glycerol and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with hypotonic buffer and lysed in 2 nuclear pellet volumes of lysis buffer containing 100 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 28% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The nuclear extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris. Between 60 and 100 μg of protein from the nuclear extract, cytoplasmic lysate, or whole cell pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane using a Mini Trans-Blot Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad), and immunodetection was performed using ECL (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturers' recommendations, followed by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. Results were quantitated by photodensitometry using an AlphaImager 2000 system (Alpha Innotech Corp.) and are expressed as means ± S.D. Differences were considered significant when p was ≤0.05 as determined by a paired t test. These were performed essentially as described by Diehl et al. (22Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mm NaF, and 0.4 mm NaVO4. GSK3β was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of total protein extract using 1 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-GSK3β antibodies and protein A/G-agarose beads.

After 30 min at 30 °C, 8 μl of 4× loading buffer (final concentrations: 4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% Serva blue G) were added. The mixture was boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a Tricine-16.5% acrylamide gel (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography and quantitation as described above. Cell cycle analysis was performed according to Darzynkiewicz et al. (24Darzynkiewicz Z., Li, X. Gong J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Robinson J.P. Crissman H.A. Flow Cytometry. 2nd Ed. 41.

Briefly, cells were lightly trypsinized, resuspended in Hanks' buffer, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, washed with Hanks' buffer, and suspended in 1 ml of Hanks' buffer containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 5 Kunitz units of DNase-free RNase A. The percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2/M was determined using an EPICS® Profile Analyzer. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies against GSK3β (G22320) and β-catenin (C19220) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-phospho-Ser9 GSK3β (catalog no. 9336) and anti-phospho-Thr58 c-Myc (catalog no. 9401) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-c-Myc antibodies (SC-764) and protein A/G-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphoglycogen synthase peptide II was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). MG132 was fromCalbiochem. Protein concentration was determined using a micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). We have recently shown that GC inhibit persistent cell cycle progression at a commitment stage during osteoblast differentiation characterized by a cobblestone appearance (4Smith E. Redman R.A.

We postulated that components of the Wnt signaling pathway might play a role during this commitment stage in mediating cell cycle persistence and its inhibition by GC. One of these components is GSK3β, a cell cycle guardian that is inactivated by a variety of growth stimuli. We evaluated GSK3β in non-treated and GC-treated MC3T3-E1 cells at and immediately after the cobblestone stage. As determined by Western analysis, DEX treatment of cells that had just become confluent resulted in a small but consistent increase in the total cellular levels of GSK3β (Fig. 1 A). Because nuclear localization of GSK3β has recently been proposed to play a cell cycle-related role (22Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), we also performed Western analysis on nuclear extracts and found that the increase in GSK3β levels was even more pronounced in the nuclear fraction of DEX-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). Notably, this effect was attenuated in cultures that had already grown to high density (Fig. 1 A, Day 9). Accordingly, we thereafter confined our work specifically to cells that just initiate growth to high density. GSK3β activity is subject to functionally critical post-translational modifications. We therefore measured GSK3β activity by immunoprecipitation and kinase assays using a glycogen synthase-derived peptide as substrate. As exemplified in Fig. 1 B (upper left panel), DEX significantly increased GSK3β activity, and this increase amounted to 1.77 ± 0.1-fold in three independent experiments. An important post-translational modification of GSK3β is the phosphorylation of Ser9, which results in GSK3β inhibition, such as seen following growth factor stimulation (14Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar,15Saito Y. Vandenheede J.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).2 We therefore evaluated the effect of GC on GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 B, DEX decreased the level of Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β (middle left panel) while increasing total GSK3β (lower left panel). In three independent experiments, DEX induced an average 2.4-fold decrease in the level of Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β (Fig. 1 B, right panel, pGSK). When corrected for the total levels of GSK3β, DEX reduced by 3-fold the relative level of GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B,right panel, pGSK/GSK). These results suggest that GC attenuate the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β mediated by growth stimulatory signals. Higher activity of GSK3β, a cell cycle inhibitor, might contribute to the antimitogenic effect of GC in post-confluent MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts (4Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An important downstream target of the Wnt signaling pathway is β-catenin, which participates in the transcriptional activation of cell cycle stimulatory genes such as c-myc (9He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (10Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation promotes the degradation of β-catenin. We therefore examined whether β-catenin is down-regulated in GC-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. However, as shown in Fig. 1 C, DEX did not decrease either the nuclear or the cytoplasmic β-catenin level, suggesting that β-catenin is resistant to GC-mediated activation of GSK3β in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. This is consistent with the notion that some GSK3β exists in pools that are physically and functionally distinct from those found complexed with adenomatous polyposis coli, axin, and β-catenin (for review, see Ref. 25Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). GSK3β can down-regulate cell cycle regulatory factors such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 in both β-catenin-dependent and -independent manners. The β-catenin-independent pathway entails direct phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58, followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (26Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 27Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, despite the persistence of β-catenin in GC-treated MC3T3-E1 cells, Western blot analysis of c-Myc revealed reduced levels in DEX-treated compared with non-treated cultures (Fig. 1 D). In three independent experiments, c-Myc levels were significantly decreased by 2.3 ± 0.2-fold. c-Myc has been previously found to express in osteoblasts and chondrocytes in vivo (28Liang J.D. Hock J.M. Sandusky G.E. Santerre R.F. Onyia J.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 65: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Aizawa T. Kokubun S. Kawamata T. Tanaka Y. Roach H.I. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Br. 1999; 81: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed c-Myc by Western blot analysis during MC3T3-E1 osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Expectedly, as cells reached confluence (Fig. 2 A, Day 5), c-Myc levels decreased (Fig. 2 B, Day 5 versus Day 3). The same was observed in NIH3T3 cells under similar culture conditions (data not shown). However, 2 days after the cobblestone stage (Fig. 2 A, Day 7) c-Myc was up-regulated back to levels observed in pre-confluent cultures (Fig. 2 B, Day 7). This was not seen with the NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). In contrast to c-Myc, cyclin A, which is down-regulated by GC in post-confluent persistently cycling osteoblasts (4Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was expressed at steady levels during pre-confluence and confluence and until at least 2 days after confluence (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, this expression pattern and the effect of DEX (Fig. 1 D) suggest a role for c-Myc in driving the post-confluent osteoblast persistent cell cycle. Based on the activation of GSK3β (Fig. 1 B), without an accompanying decrease in β-catenin (Fig. 1 C), the decreased c-Myc level in GC-treated MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 1 D) is attributable to protein instability. We therefore studied c-Myc synthesis and degradation in GC-treated cultures. Initially, we evaluated c-Myc synthesis rates by blocking degradation using the proteasomal inhibitor MG132; this was immediately followed by concomitant MG132 withdrawal and administration of cycloheximide to block protein synthesis during the measurement of the c-Myc degradation rate. As shown in Fig. 3, which represents one of three experiments with similar results, DEX did not inhibit c-Myc synthesis. However, c-Myc degradation was significantly accelerated in DEX-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Half-life values can only be approximated in these experiments because proteasomal recovery following MG132 withdrawal is not instantaneous. Assuming complete recovery at 1.5 h post-MG132 withdrawal, c-Myc was degraded in the DEX-treated cells over the following hour with an apparent half-life value 3.2 ± 0.7 times greater than that measured in the non-treated cells (p = 0.02; n = 3). GSK3β has been shown to target c-Myc for proteasomal degradation by phosphorylation at Thr58 (26Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 27Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the c-Myc Thr58 phosphorylation status in DEX-treated versus non-treated cells. Samples from 4-h MG132-treated cultures (as in Fig. 3 A) were subjected to Western analysis using anti-phospho-Thr58 c-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 C, DEX increased the c-Myc Thr58phosphorylation level. Corrected for total c-Myc, the relative DEX-mediated increases in c-Myc Thr58 phosphorylation were 1.7- and 2.6-fold in two independent experiments. These results are consistent with the insensitivity of β-catenin to GC (Fig. 1 C) and strongly suggest that increased c-Myc phosphorylation by GSK3β in GC-treated osteoblasts leads to accelerated degradation and reduced c-Myc steady-state levels. The increased GSK3β activity in GC-treated cells (Fig. 1 B) may be a result, not a cause, of cell cycle attenuation (30Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We therefore tested GSK3β activity following short periods of GC treatment (before an effect on the cell cycle is mounted). Triton X-100 extracts of 2- and 5-h treated cultures were subjected to GSK3β immunoprecipitation and kinase assays. These short treatment periods did not alter the distribution of cells among the phases of the cell cycle (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 (upper panel), DEX activated GSK3β within as little as 2 h of treatment, with somewhat lesser activation observed at 5 h. Next, Triton X-100 extracts as described above were subjected to Western blot analysis using either anti-GSK3β or anti-phospho-Ser9 GSK3β antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, 2-h DEX treatment significantly reduced Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β, and this reduction amounted to 47 ± 5% in three independent experiments. Corrected for total GSK3β, the change in the relative Ser9 phosphorylation level (calculated, as in Fig. 1 B, as the ratio between phospho-GSK3β (DEX)/phospho-GSK3β (control) and GSK3β (DEX)/GSK3β (control)) was significantly reduced within the 2-h treatment period by 46 ± 20% (n = 3). The GC effect on the relative Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β was similar at the 5-h time point, amounting to a significant 50 ± 18% reduction (n = 3). Because Ser9 phosphorylation is a major (albeit not the only (31Kim L. Liu J. Kimmel A.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) determinant influencing GSK3β activity, our data suggest that the fast decrease in GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation following 2 h of treatment may be the initial event leading to GSK3β activation, c-Myc down-regulation, and cell cycle attenuation. Consistent with this, a reduction in c-Myc levels was apparent at the 5-h (although not at the 2-h) treatment time point (Fig. 4, lower panel). c-Myc plays a critical role in the response of the cell cycle machinery to growth signals. To examine the c-Myc immediate response to serum stimulation, MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h and then refed with medium containing 10% serum. DEX was administered 2 h prior to and again during serum stimulation. Following serum stimulation, c-Myc immediately began to accumulate in the non-treated cells (Fig. 5). In three independent experiments, c-Myc levels significantly increased by 2.5 ± 1.1-fold within 20 min of serum stimulation. In contrast, c-Myc accumulation was blunted in the DEX-treated cells, where an insignificant 27 ± 25% increase was measured following serum stimulation. The antimitogenic effect of DEX in serum-stimulated cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis at 12 h following serum stimulation with or without DEX (Fig. 5 B). Following serum stimulation, Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β consistently accumulated in the non-treated cultures (Fig. 5); the accumulation rate in the DEX-treated cultures was reduced by an average of 27% as compared with the control cultures, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.15;n = 3). However, when corrected for the respective total GSK3β values, the increase in relative GSK3β Ser9phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in the DEX-treated cultures to levels 63% lower than the respective control values (p = 0.03; n = 3). Thus, GC attenuate the Ser9 inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β in serum-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells, potentially blunting the c-Myc accumulation. If GSK3β plays a role in the antimitogenic effect of GC, then inhibition of GSK3β may ameliorate the inhibitory effect of GC on cell cycle progression. We therefore tested the antimitogenic effect of DEX on the post-confluent osteoblast cell cycle in the presence of lithium, a specific GSK3β inhibitor (32Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, exposure to lithium accelerated cell cycle progression in both DEX-treated and non-treated post-confluent osteoblast cultures. However, the lithium effect on the DEX-treated cells"

PIAS1 is expressed predominantly in testis including cell types that express AR and mediate the actions of androgen on spermatogenesis. In addition to PIAS1 that inhibits STAT1, another member of the PIAS family, PIAS3, has been shown to be an inhibitor of STAT3 signaling. PIAS3 mRNA was also abundant in human testis, but unlike PIAS1, it was expressed at similar levels in other organs (38.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K.

Here we report that PIAS family members have characteristics of nuclear scaffold attachment factors (SAF). PIAS family members were bi-directional transcriptional coregulators with AR. In cells where there is expression of more than one family member, our studies suggest that the coregulatory effects of PIAS1 are modulated by interactions with other members of the PIAS family. Full-length PIAS1 sense and antisense vectors and the mutant PIAS1delF vector with deletion of amino acids 341–536 were described previously by Tan et al. (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Full-length PIASxα, PIASxβ, PIASy, and mouse PIAS3 (mPIAS3) were recovered from digestions of pFLAG-PIASxα, -xβ, -y, and mPIAS3 and cloned into pSG5 to create pSG5-PIASxα, -xβ, -y, and mPIAS3. pFLAG-PIAS vectors were provided by Ke Shuai, UCLA (36.Liu B.

BamHI-Klenow filled in fragments of PIASxα and -xβ derived from pSG-PIASxα and -xβ were cloned into the SmaI site of pBDGalCAM to create yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain vectors, pBDGalCAM-PIASxα and -xβ. The same fragments were cloned into the filled in XhoI site of pGADGH to create yeast Gal4 activation domain vectors pGADGH-PIASxα and -xβ. A specific probe for PIAS1 was generated by PCR of pGADGH-PIAS1 (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using 5′ primer (GGTCTAGAGTCTTCCACATCAAGC) and 3′ primer (CAGATCGAATGAACTTGGGAATTC). The PCR product was digested withXbaI-EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pBKCMV (Stratagene). Probes specific for PIASxα and -xβ mRNAs were generated by PCR with 5′ primer (GCTCTAGAGCATGTCATCAGATTTGCCAGG) and 3′ primer (CCACAACTAGAATGCAGTG) using pSG5-PIASxα and -xβ as templates. A probe specific for PIASy was generated by PCR with 5′ primer (GCTCTAGAAGGAGCGCAGCTGCA) and 3′ primer (CCACAACTAGAATGCAGTG) with pSG5-PIASy as template. PCR products were digested withXbaI-BglII and cloned into pBKCMVXbaI-BamHI site. To create the vector pGBT-PIAS1 amino acids 7–651 of PIAS1 were excised withSmaI-XhoI and cloned into pGBT8. pGEX-PIAS1-(1–135) and pGEX-PIAS1delSAP (1–166 del 11–45) were constructed by PCR of templates pSG5-PIAS1 and pSG5-PIAS1delSAP with 5′ primer CTCTGAGTCCAAACCGGGCCCCTCTGC and 3′ primer TCTCGAAAGCGCTGACTGTTGTCTGATGC. For cell-free binding assays GST-PIAS1 (amino acids 7–651) was created by digesting pGADGH-PIAS1 (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) withSpeI-XhoI and cloning the purified PIAS1 into theXbaI-XhoI site of pGEX-KG. GST-AR (amino acids 544–634) was constructed by PCR of human pCMVhAR and cloning into pGEX-2T BamHI-EcoRI sites. All constructs were confirmed by automatic sequencing using a Perkin Elmer model 377 DNA sequencer. The probasin-luciferase reporter was provided by Dr. R. J. Matusik, Department of Urologic Surgery, Vanderbilt University, and the prostate-specific antigen-luciferase reporter by Dr. M. D. Sadar, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells as described (41.He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J.

Scaffold attachment region-like A/T-rich oligonucleotides (AATTCAGAAAATAATAAAATAAAACTAGCTATTTTATATTTTTTC and AATTGAAAAAATATAAAATAGCTAGTTTTATTTTATTATTTTCTG) were synthesized and annealed by heating to 70 °C and cooling slowly to room temperature. Annealed oligonucleotide or E. coli DNA was added in excess to glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST or GST-PIAS1 proteins and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was washed several times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (∼150,000 cpm) was added and the incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C. After several washes in the same buffer, the samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. COS7 cells were cultured in two chamber glass slides and transfected with pSG5-PIAS1 as described earlier for AR (42.Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed (43.Ordronneau P. Lindstrom P.B. Petrusz P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against a glutathione transferase-PIAS1 fusion protein containing 102 C-terminal amino acids (549–650), provided by J. Liao and K. Shuai, UCLA (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Yeast Y190 cells were used for the liquid β-galactosidase assay. For assay of intrinsic transcriptional activity of PIAS family members, Y190 yeast cells were transformed with the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector (pBDGalCAM) containing PIAS1, the PIAS1 mutant PIAS1delF, PIASxα, or PIASxβ. For two-hybrid protein-protein interactions of PIAS1 with PIASxα or PIASxβ, Y190 cells transformed with the pGBT-PIAS1 and the Gal4 activation domain vector (pGADGH) containing PIASxα or PIASxβ were incubated at 30 °C in 2 ml of selective medium without Trp and Leu. In the case of yeast transformed with the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector alone, medium lacked only Trp and if transformed with the Gal4 activation domain vector alone lacked only Leu. After incubation for 20 h, YPD medium (8 ml) was added, and incubations were continued for 3–4 h at the same temperature. The liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the protocol of CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA. Cotransfection assays were performed in triplicate as described (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, monkey kidney CV1 cells were transfected with the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat-luciferase reporter vector, MMTV-luciferase (2.5 μg), prostate-specific antigen, PSA-luciferase (2.5 μg) or probasin-luciferase reporter (5 μg), human androgen receptor (pSG5-hAR) 0.1 μg, and various amounts of pSG5 expression vectors containing PIAS cDNAs. To control for possible DNA effects, CV1 cells were transfected with or without equimolar amounts of the empty pSG5 vector, pSG5-PIAS1 antisense vector, or pSG5-BTG1 that expresses the B cell translocation gene 1 (44.Raburn D.J. Hamil K.G. Tsuruta J.K. O'Brien D.A. Hall S.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5769-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 6-cm culture dishes and transfected by the CaPO4 method when 70–80% confluent. After 15% glycerol shock for 4 min, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H without phenol red and serum in the presence or absence of 0.1 nmdihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 40 h. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA), and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer. Luciferase activity was expressed as mean ± S.D. light units of three replicates and as fold increase in the presence of hormone over background in the absence of hormone. Assay results in each figure are representative of three or more experiments. pBKCMV-PIAS1, -xα, -xβ, and -y were used for in situ hybridization analysis. Antisense PIAS1-(1587–2101), PIASxα-(1628–1719), PIASxβ-(1628–1866), and PIASy-(1232–1533) RNAs were synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals RNA labeling kit, and in situ hybridization of mouse testis was performed as described (45.Nuovo G.J. PCR in Situ Hybridization Protocols and Applications. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 123-197Google Scholar). pSG5-PIAS1, -xα, -xβ, and -y (36.Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-19631Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) vectors were used as DNA templates forin vitro synthesis of labeled protein by coupled in vitro transcription-translation. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-AR binding assays were performed as described (46.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Petrusz P. French F.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3440-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, the above cDNA vectors were incubated with [35S]methionine and reticulocyte lysate from the TnT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System kit (Promega), and the labeled proteins were incubated with GST-AR DNA binding domain (amino acids 544–634) glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrix. After incubation and extensive washes, labeled proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, gel-dried, and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. Recombinant PIAS family members synthesized and labeled with [35S]methionine as described above were incubated with GST-PIAS1 (amino acids 7–651) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. The gel was washed several times, and labeled proteins were eluted and processed as above. Total RNA was extracted from testes of rats at different ages by a modification of the method of Chirgwinet al. (47.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) and Northern hybridizations performed as described (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the DNA probes specific for PIAS1, PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy as indicated above. Ribosomal RNA was stained with methylene blue to compare the amounts of sample loaded in each lane. Sample loadings were also checked by hybridization of 18 S rRNA. The cDNA for 18 S rRNA was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX) and labeled with 32P using a random priming kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A 35-amino acid N-terminal sequence (aa 11–45) common to PIAS family members and a number of other eukaryotic proteins is referred to as the scaffold attachment factor, SAF box (48.Kipp M. Göhring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), or SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS (SAP) domain (49.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Secondary structure modeling predicts the sequence forms two amphipathic helices (Fig. 1) with homology to helices 1 and 2 of homeodomain proteins that are known to fold into a hook-like structure with two α-helices separated by a turn (48.Kipp M. Göhring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Within the conserved sequence is a bipartite distribution of hydrophobic and polar amino acids separated by a region that contains an invariant glycine (49.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In contrast to homeodomains that contain three α-helices and bind to strictly defined sequences in the major groove of DNA, SAF box binding to DNA occurs through a cooperative binding mode that recognizes scaffold attachment region DNA through minor groove interactions with multiple clustered adenine (A) tracts (48.Kipp M. Göhring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In different molecules the SAF box/SAP domain is linked to a diverse set of domains, several of which are known to be involved in pre-mRNA processing (49.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To learn whether PIAS1 has the DNA binding properties of a scaffold attachment region binding protein, we tested its binding to A-T-rich DNA using an affinity matrix assay with the protein attached to Sepharose beads (Fig. 2). GST or GST-PIAS1 (aa 1–135) were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with32P-labeled A/T-rich oligonucleotide using a batch method. Either unlabeled A-T-rich oligonucleotide or E. coli DNA was used in competition with the 32P-labeled A-T-rich oligonucleotide to demonstrate specific binding. It has been demonstrated previously (48.Kipp M. Göhring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 50.Renz A. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 51.Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that scaffold attachment proteins do not bind E. coli DNA. Radioactive A-T-rich DNA bound to GST-PIAS1-Sepharose was more than 300-fold higher than that bound to the GST-Sepharose control, and binding was inhibited by cold-A-T-rich DNA but not by E. coli DNA. Deletion of the SAF box/SAP domain (GST-PIAS1 aa 1–166 del 11–45) abolished the binding to A-T-rich DNA demonstrating the potential role of this domain in PIAS1 binding to scaffold attachment region DNA. Immunostaining of PIAS1 transfected into COS cells revealed a speckled pattern of localization in nuclei (Fig. 3) similar to that of the scaffold attachment proteins SAF-B (52.Nayler O. Strãtling W. Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and SAF-A (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U) (53.Eggert M. Michel J. Schneider S. Bornfleth H. Baniahmad A. Fackelmayer F.O. Schmidt S. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28471-28478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Under the microscope this same pattern of PIAS1 staining in nuclei could be visualized in testis tissue sections by fine adjustment of focusing, but the speckling was not apparent in photographs. Coregulatory effects of the PIAS family with DHT-dependent AR transactivation were analyzed in CV1 cell cotransfection assays with three different luciferase reporter genes, the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (MMTV), the rat probasin gene 5′-flanking region (nucleotides −426 to +28), and the human prostate-specific antigen gene (PSA) (nucleotides −630 to +12). With the MMTV-Luc reporter gene PIAS1 had bi-directional effects on AR-induced transcriptional activity (Fig. 4, top panel). At lower amounts (0.01 and 0.05 μg) transfected PIAS1 inhibited DHT-dependent AR transactivation relative to equivalent amounts of the antisense PIAS1 control. At a higher amount (0.5 μg) PIAS1 stimulated a 3-fold increase in DHT-dependent AR transactivation. Similar results were obtained using the probasin-Luc reporter gene (Fig. 4, middle panel). There was inhibition with 0.01 μg of PIAS1 and enhancement with 0.5 μg. PIAS1 (0.5 μg) also increased DHT-dependent AR transactivation of the PSA-Luc reporter above the level obtained with equivalent amounts of pSG5PIAS1 antisense control vector or the PIAS1delF mutant control that was shown previously (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to lack coactivator function (Fig. 4, bottom). We were unable to test the inhibitory amounts of PIAS1 (0.01–0.1 μg) with the PSA-LUC reporter because of its lower responsiveness to AR-induced transactivation. PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy (0.5 μg) each inhibited AR induction of MMTV-Luc transcription relative to the pSG5 antisense control, whereas lower amounts (0.01 and 0.05 μg) were either less inhibitory than PIAS1 or had no effect (Fig. 4, top panel). In assays with the probasin reporter gene (Fig. 4, middle panel) PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy had either no effect or were inhibitory (Fig. 4, middle panel). With the PSA reporter gene PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy (0.5 μg) were inhibitory (Fig. 4, bottom panel). In affinity matrix assays full-length 35S-PIAS proteins bound glutathione S-transferase (GST) AR (amino acids 544–634). This region of AR includes the entire DNA binding domain and small portions of the N-terminal and hinge regions (14.Lubahn D.B. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Tan J.-A. Higgs H.N. Larson R.E. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Each of the proteins PIAS1, PIASxα, PIASxβ, or PIASy bound the AR DNA binding domain region (Fig. 5 A) suggesting they interact with AR by similar mechanisms. From previous studies we concluded that a sequence within PIAS1 amino acids 1–318 is required for AR binding; however, the precise binding motif remains to be identified (37.Tan J.-A. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K."
https://openalex.org/W2074886945,"The molecular mechanisms by which arachidonic acid (AA) and ceramide elicit translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) were investigated. Ceramide translocated εPKC from the cytoplasm to the Golgi complex, but with a mechanism distinct from that utilized by AA. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we showed that, upon treatment with AA, εPKC was tightly associated with the Golgi complex; ceramide elicited an accumulation of εPKC which was exchangeable with the cytoplasm. Stimulation with ceramide after AA converted the AA-induced Golgi complex staining to one elicited by ceramide alone; AA had no effect on the ceramide-stimulated localization. Using point mutants and deletions of εPKC, we determined that the εC1B domain was responsible for the ceramide- and AA-induced translocation. Switch chimeras, containing the C1B from εPKC in the context of δPKC (δ(εC1B)) and vice versa (ε(δC1B)), were generated and tested for their translocation in response to ceramide and AA. δ(εC1B) translocated upon treatment with both ceramide and AA; ε(δC1B) responded only to ceramide. Thus, through the C1B domain, AA and ceramide induce different patterns of εPKC translocation and the C1B domain defines the subtype specific sensitivity of PKCs to lipid second messengers.

The conventional PKCs (cPKC; α, βI, βII, and γ) are Ca2+-dependent and activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters. The novel PKCs (nPKC; δ, ε, η, and θ) are activated by diacylglycerol (DG) or phorbol esters, but are Ca2+-independent (5Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y.

The regulatory domain of the PKCs contains a variable region 1 (V1), a pseudosubstrate motif (PS), and a conserved region 1 (C1). The V1 of εPKC has been reported to be a selective inhibitor of εPKC translocation (11Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly Rosen D. J. Biol.

In the resting state, the PS is bound in the active site of the catalytic domain, keeping the enzyme inactive by blocking the catalytic site. The binding of activators to the regulatory domain causes a conformational change which releases the PS from the active site and activates the enzyme (13Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). DG and phorbol ester binding have been localized to the C1 domain (2Nishizuka Y.

GFP-tagged C1A-C1B or C1A translocated to the plasma membrane in response to receptor or phorbol esters stimuli, whether significant plasma membrane translocation of C1B was only observed in phorbol esters stimulation (20Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, distinct roles for the C1A and C1B domains in the activation of the enzyme have been shown (21Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the C1A and C1B domains of PKCs are functionally distinct.The activity of PKC can be regulated not only by DG and phorbor ester but also by other lipids such as arachidonic acid (AA) (22Kasahara K. Kikkawa U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Shinomura T. Asaoka Y. Oka M. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1999; 57: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Like DG/phorbol esters, these lipid second messengers also induce translocation of PKCs. Immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry in fixed cells have shown that AA induces translocation of εPKC (26Huang X.P., Pi, Y. Lokuta A.J. Greaser M.L. Walker J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar) and ceramide translocates εPKC and δPKC from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PKCs and live cell imaging, we have shown that AA translocates εPKC, but not δPKC, from the cytoplasm to the Golgi complex (28Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1335-1343PubMed Google Scholar) and that ceramide translocates δPKC from the cytoplasm to the Golgi complex (30Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism underlying these translocations. Here we identified the intramolecular domains of ε- and δPKC that respond to ceramide and AA to clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the lipids-dependent translocation of nPKCs.DISCUSSIONThe importance of ceramide and AA as lipid messengers has only recently begun to be appreciated. Ceramide is involved in such processes as cell differentiation (34Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). AA has been shown to act as a retrograde transmitter (39Herrero I. Miras Portugal M.T. Sanchez Prieto J. Nature. 1992; 360: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) in the generation of long-term potentiation, as a regulator of ion channels (40Nojima H. Sasaki T. Kimura I. Brain.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both ceramide and AA can regulate the activity and/or translocation of PKC. AA activates εPKC but not δPKC in vitro (22Kasahara K. Kikkawa U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and inhibits the ceramide-induced activation of ζPKC (25Macdonald N.J. Perez Polo J.R. Bennett A.D. Taglialatela G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). O'Flaherty (43O'Flaherty J.T. Chadwell B.A. Kearns M.W. Sergeant S. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24743-24750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that αPKC, βPKC, and δPKC can be translocated by low concentrations of AA. In contrast, Oancea et al. (20Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) reported that AA inhibits translocation of the C1A domain of γPKC. Ceramide translocates δPKC and εPKC from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and αPKC from the cytoplasm to the membrane (24Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that both ceramide and AA play important roles in signal transduction and implicate their involvement in the regulation of subtype-specific activation or translocation of PKCs.In this study, we showed that ceramide translocates εPKC from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region and identified this region as the Golgi complex by WGA staining (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that AA also induces the translocation of εPKC to the Golgi complex (Fig. 1B) (28Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In those studies, 10 μm ceramide and 100 μm AA were used to detect translocation of PKCs clearly and constantly, although the translocation to the Golgi complex could be detected even at 25 μm AA and 1 μmceramide. The concentrations of these lipids might be relatively higher than that of physiological condition. It, however, is noteworthy that εPKC is translocated to the Golgi complex when ceramide is generated by receptor stimuli with tumor necrosis factor-α as seen in the case of exogenous ceramide stimulation (data not shown), and that εPKC accumulates in the Golgi complex in the brain (data not shown). These findings suggest that translocation of εPKC to the Golgi complex occurs under physiological conditions.Although both ceramide and AA translocated εPKC from the cytoplasm to the Golgi complex, the pattern of localization was subtly, but distinctly, different. First, in ceramide-treated cells εPKC was concentrated in the well defined Golgi complex with uniform distribution in the cytosol. In contrast, upon AA treatment εPKC accumulated in a diffuse pattern around the nucleus with heterogeneous fluorescence in the cytosol. Second, TPA application after ceramide or AA revealed differences in the dissociation of εPKC from the Golgi complex. The ceramide-stimulated interaction of εPKC with the Golgi complex was transient, as shown by the TPA-induced relocalization from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, interaction of AA-stimulated εPKC was strong enough to resist being translocated by TPA stimuli. Third, FRAP analysis also revealed distinct interaction of εPKC with the Golgi complex. The fact that, in ceramide-treated cells, fluorescence recovery in the Golgi complex was coincident with decreased cytosolic fluorescence suggests the εPKC exchanges with the cytosolic pool. As staining in the unbleached regions of the Golgi complex did not change, it is unlikely that there is significant movement of εPKC in the Golgi complex in response to ceramide. On the other hand, after AA treatment, the recovery came from unbleached regions of the Golgi complex rather than the cytosol. This suggests that AA mediates a tight association of εPKC with the Golgi complex resulting in low exchange with cytosolic εPKC pools. Finally, AA-translocated εPKC was sensitive to redistribution by ceramide but AA did not alter the ceramide-translocated εPKC. This indicates that AA-mobilized εPKC is responsive to ceramide, but the ceramide-treated εPKC cannot be further translocated by AA. Taken together, these differences imply that distinct mechanisms are involved in the translocation of εPKC mediated by ceramide and AA. Similarly, different effects of ceramide and AA on PKC translocation have been reported for γPKC-C1A (20Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In those studies, pretreatment with AA reduced the DG-induced translocation of γPKC-C1A to the plasma membrane but pretreatment with ceramide had no effect on the translocation.To identify the domains of εPKC necessary for AA- and ceramide-induced εPKC translocation, we constructed a series of deletion mutants and studied their translocation characteristics. Loss of the V1, PS, and/or C1A domains did not alter translocation in response to ceramide or AA as compared with εPKC. However, deletion of the C1B domain rendered the mutants insensitive to both ceramide and AA. These results indicate that the C1B domain is necessary for the translocation induced by both ceramide and AA. Although the mechanisms causing the distinct translocation are unknown, they may include differences in phosphorylation, interaction partners, and/or specific conformation changes.The fact that the C1B, but not the C1A domain, is involved in the AA- and ceramide-induced translocation suggests that C1A and C1B have different roles in translocation. Even in the case of TPA, difference between C1A and C1B was observed. Unlike ceramide and AA, TPA induced translocation of both ΔC1A and ΔC1B but the mutants lacking both C1A and C1B (ΔV1-PS-C1A-C1B and ΔC1A-C1B) were insensitive to TPA, indicating that either C1A or C1B can mediate TPA-induced translocation. However, the translocation of ΔC1B was weaker than that of ΔC1A (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the report that the C1B domain of εPKC has higher affinity for phorbol esters than the C1A domain (19Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, several reports suggest distinct contributions of C1A and C1B domain in the regulation of PKC. For example, Shieh et al. (44Shieh H.L. Hansen H. Zhu J. Riedel H. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 12: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Shieh H.L. Hansen H. Zhu J. Riedel H. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1996; 20: 576-589PubMed Google Scholar) used mutants of αPKC lacking either C1A or C1B and showed no differences in TPA stimulated activity, suggesting that TPA regulates αPKC activity via either C1A or C1B. In contrast, mezerein regulation occurs predominantly via the C1A. Second, Bogi et al. (46Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Acs P. Szallasi Z. Wagner G.S. Blumberg P.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that translocation of δPKC by PMA requires the C1B domain but not C1A, although C1A and C1B domains of αPKC have equivalent roles for the PMA-induced translocation. Finally, the γPKC-C1A fragment was preferentially translocated to the plasma membrane compared with the γPKC-C1B or γPKC-C1AC1B fragment upon treatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with IgE or ligands of PAF receptor. (20Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a considerable body of literature consistent with our findings that C1A and C1B domains differentially regulate PKC translocation.We used point mutations in the C1A (P180G and C186G) and C1B (P253G and C259G) domains to confirm that the C1B domain is responsible for the AA- or ceramide-induced translocation, and that either the C1A or the C1B domain is sufficient for the TPA-induced translocation. The proline mutants have a decreased affinity for PDBu, and the cysteine to glycine mutation eliminates PDBu binding (33Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ceramide and AA translocate the C1A mutants, but not the C1B mutants; TPA translocates all. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that the εC1B domain is required for ceramide- and AA-stimulated translocation, while TPA has a less stringent requirement, needing only one cysteine-rich loop of C1 domain, in either C1A or C1B, for membrane localization.Like εPKC, ceramide induces the translocation of δPKC from the cytosol to the Golgi complex (30Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Unlike εPKC, δPKC is not sensitive to AA (29Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1335-1343PubMed Google Scholar). What then, are the differences between εPKC and δPKC? Our results show that the εC1B is necessary for AA-induced translocation of εPKC. Can the differences between the C1B domains of εPKC and δPKC account for their differential sensitivity to AA? If so, the chimera of δPKC having the C1B domain of εPKC, (δ(εC1B)), should translocate in response to AA, but the chimera of εPKC having the C1B domain of δPKC, (ε(δC1B)), should not. δ(εC1B), but not ε(δC1B), translocated in response to AA. This difference is not due to a general nonresponsiveness of the ε(δC1B) as it does translocate in response to ceramide (Fig. 8). Instead the data suggests inherent differences between the δC1B and εC1B. Specifically, our data demonstrates that εC1B domain responds to both ceramide and AA, but δC1B is sensitive only to ceramide. These differences in the C1B domain may determine the subtype-specific responses of ε- and δPKC to lipid second messengers.How the differences between εPKC and δPKC to the lipid second messengers contribute their physiological roles? For example, AA is thought to be one of retrograde transmitters (39Herrero I. Miras Portugal M.T. Sanchez Prieto J. Nature. 1992; 360: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and AA indeed facilitates long-term potentiation by the enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (47Williams J.H. Errington M.L. Lynch M.A. Bliss T.V. Nature. 1989; 341: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 48Drapeau C. Pellerin L. Wolfe L.S. Avoli M. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 115: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 49Nomura T. Nishizaki T. Enomoto T. Itoh H. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2885-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Enzymologically, εPKC is activated with AA even in the absence of DG, although δPKC is not activated with AA at all (22Kasahara K. Kikkawa U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). εPKC is enriched in hippocampus and cerebral cortex and is localized mainly in the presynaptic terminals (50Saito N. Itouji A. Totani Y. Osawa I. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Ogita K. Tanaka C. Brain Res. 1993; 607: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Taken together, AA-induced activation of εPKC, but not δPKC might be in involved in the expression of hippocampal long-term potentiation. On one hand, receptor stmulations with γ-interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and vitamin D3 result in the production of ceramide, leading to apoptosis (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that these physiological phenomena via ceramide are mediated by δ- or εPKC. In fact, Sawai et al. (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) reported that ceramide translocated δ- and εPKC, not α, β2, γ, nor ζPKC, to the cytoplasm, resulting in apoptosis in human leukemia cells (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These results indicate that not only DG but also ceramide and AA regulate the activity and distribution of each PKC subtype, contributing to the subtype-specific physiological roles in long-term potentiation or apoptosis. In other words, even though several PKC isoforms are expressed in the same cell, each subtype of PKC can be regulated by specific activators and play a subtype-specific role in various signal transduction.In conclusion, ceramide and AA translocate εPKC to the Golgi complex by distinct mechanisms involving the C1B domain. In contrast, TPA requires only C1A or C1B domain for translocation. The subtle differences in the C1B domains of εPKC and δPKC apparently account for their differential sensitivity to AA. These results indicate that different domains of PKC mediates translocation in response to different second messengers and the distinct characteristics of the domain determine the subtype-specific translocation, thereby contributing to the subtype-specific function.

The conventional PKCs (cPKC; α, βI, βII, and γ) are Ca2+-dependent and activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters. The novel PKCs (nPKC; δ, ε, η, and θ) are activated by diacylglycerol (DG) or phorbol esters, but are Ca2+-independent (5Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y.

However, the ternary complex with FTHF and glycine shows the reported conformational changes. In contrast to the Escherichia coli enzyme, this complex shows asymmetric binding of the FTHF to the two monomers within the dimer in a way similar to the murine SHMT. Comparison of the ternary complex with the native enzyme reveals the structural basis for the conformational change and asymmetric binding of FTHF. The four structures presented here correspond to the various reaction intermediates of the catalytic pathway and provide evidence for a direct displacement mechanism for the hydroxymethyl transfer rather than a retroaldol cleavage.

The importance of SHMT in DNA synthesis coupled with the observed high level of enzyme activity in rapidly proliferating cells has focused attention on SHMT as a potential target for the development of anticancer and antimicrobial agents (4.Thorndike J.

The crystal structures of human liver SHMT (hcSHMT) and rabbit liver SHMT (rcSHMT) and Escherichia coli SHMT (eSHMT) as well as murine cytoplasmic SHMT (mcSHMT) have been reported (9.Renwick S.B.

The structure of a reduced form of rcSHMT representing a gem diamine equivalent has also been reported (10.Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. Radaev S. Schirch V. Wright H.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8347-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although these structures have provided a wealth of information regarding the architecture of the enzyme, active site, and residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis, several aspects of SHMT catalytic mechanism remain uncertain (7.Matthews R.G. Drummond J.T. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1275-1290Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13.Matthews R.G. Drummond J.T. Webb H.K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 8: 377-392Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A detailed comparison and analysis of several structures of the enzyme corresponding to different intermediate steps and in complex with various substrates, substrate analogs, and product analogs are required to unravel the finer molecular details of the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, it would be better if these structures could be compared from the same enzyme to eliminate the ambiguities arising from differences in sequence, crystallization conditions, and crystal packing. In this paper we describe and compare the crystal structures of SHMT from Bacillus stearothermophilus (bsSHMT) in its internal aldimine form, external aldimine form with bound serine and glycine, and as a ternary complex with glycine and FTHF. Although the structures of the internal aldimine form and ternary complex have been reported earlier (9.Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10.Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. Radaev S. Schirch V. Wright H.T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the external aldimine form with bound serine and glycine are presented in this paper for the first time. A detailed analysis of bsSHMT structures and a comparison with previously reported structures allows an accurate determination of conformational changes in protein structure, orientation of the PLP ring, and key amino acid residues during different stages of catalysis. An analysis of these results provides structural evidence for a direct transfer mechanism for the SHMT catalyzed reaction. The SHMT gene was PCR-amplified from B. stearothermophilus genomic DNA using the following primers: sense primer, 5′-GGGGGAGCTACATATGAACTACTTGCCAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GAGCGGAAACGGATCCGTCAAAGCGGCGAC-3′, containingNdeI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined nucleotides). The primers were designed using the sequence of SHMT gene from B. stearothermophilus available in the data base (GenBank™ accession number E02190). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pRSET C vector at the same sites. The clones were screened by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmid designated PR bsSHMT was transferred into E. coliBL21(DE3) pLysS strain. A single colony was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 30 °C. These cells were used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. After 4 h of growth at 30 °C, the cells were induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. The isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and sonicated. The supernatant was loaded on a MonoQ column equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and loaded on a phenyl Superose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The protein was eluted using the same buffer without ammonium sulfate. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and precipitated using ammonium sulfate (65% saturation). The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmEDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl) and further purified on a Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer B. Peak fractions corresponding to the dimer were pooled and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using a 50-kDa cutoff Centricon (Amicon). SHMT protein crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 25 °C. Protein crystals were obtained by mixing 4 μl of protein solution with 4 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmEDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals started appearing within 4–5 days and grew to a maximum size in 5–10 days. SHMT crystals complexed with serine and glycine were obtained under the same condition as that of the native protein, except that the reservoir solution contained additional 10 mm serine or glycine. The ternary complex crystal of SHMT with glycine and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (Sigma) were obtained by adding FTHF to the protein solution (2 mm final concentration) and 10 mm glycine to the reservoir solution. The hanging drops were incubated for 3 h at 18–20 °C and subsequently transferred to room temperature (25 °C). Crystals were soaked for a few seconds in a harvesting solution containing 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 25% glycerol and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream (Oxford cryosystems) at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku Ru-300 x-ray generator using MAR345 image plate detector. The HKL suite was used for data reduction and scaling (14.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The native crystals as well as the serine and glycine complex crystals belonged to the space group P21212 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. These crystals diffracted to better than a 2 Å resolution. Final data sets were collected to a 1.93 Å resolution. The ternary complex crystals with glycine and FTHF belonged to the space group P21 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit and diffracted poorly compared with the native crystals. The final data set was collected to a resolution of 2.7 Å.

Open table in a new tab r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Initially the structure of the internal aldimine form (native form) was determined by molecular replacement technique. A polyalanine model of the structure of E. coli SHMT, which shows a sequence identity of 60.8% with the bsSHMT sequence, served as an excellent search model (Protein Data Bank entry 1df0). The final model was composed of residues 5–403 of the E. coli structure, modified by omission of residues 243–245 corresponding to insertion in the E. coli sequence, based on sequence alignments using CLUSTALW (15.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar). Rotation and translation searches were made using the CCP4 (16.Collaborative Computing Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar) program AMoRe (17.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Best solutions were obtained using the data between 10 and 3 Å of resolution. The transformed model was subjected to rigid body refinement using the program XPLOR (18.Brunger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains (residues 5–280 and 281–403) of the model were refined independently during rigid body refinement. The phases were improved and extended to 1.93 Å of resolution by solvent flattening using the program DM (19.Cowtan, K. (1994) Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, Vol. 31, pp. 34–38Google Scholar). These phases were used to calculate a 2F o − Fc map and visualized using the graphics program TURBO-FRODO (20.Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). The map was readily interpretable, and the electron density for the PLP cofactor, which was omitted from the model, was clearly visible. Most of the side chains were built into the map, and the model was refined using maximum likelihood positional refinement in REFMAC, with restrained temperature factors (21.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar). After each cycle of refinement, manual rebuilding was performed wherever necessary, and previously undefined side chains were built into the electron density map. The PLP molecule from the eSHMT structure was manually adjusted and built into the electron density map. Solvent molecules were added during final cycles of refinement. The crystallographic free R-factor (22.Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar) was monitored at each stage to prevent model bias. The quality of the structure was evaluated using the Ramachandran plot and the program PROCHECK (23.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics on the final model are presented in Table I. The electron density maps for the serine and glycine complex crystals were computed using data to a 1.93 Å resolution from these crystals and refined phases from the native SHMT model without PLP and solvent molecules. The models for the serine- and glycine-bound form were subsequently refined in the same manner as the native form. The model for the ternary form with bound glycine and FTHF was obtained by molecular replacement searches using the native form as the search model. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit were subjected to rigid body refinement before manual model building and subsequent refinement. Strict non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (tight restraints for main chain and medium restraints for the side chain) were applied during refinement. The non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were gradually reduced and completely relaxed during the final round of refinement. Although one of the subunits showed a good electron density for the bound FTHF molecule, the other subunit revealed a much weaker density for the FTHF, and there was no appreciable density for the monoglutamate side chain. Initially the FTHF molecule from the E. coli structure was manually adjusted and built into the electron density map for the subunit, showing good density for the bound FTHF. During the final stages of refinement, part of the FTHF molecule (without the monoglutamate side chain) for the other subunit was also included in the model. Comparison of the bsSHMT structures and earlier reported structures were carried out by manual superposition followed by rigid body refinement option in TURBO-FRODO as well as with the CCP4 program LSQKAB. Differences between the structures were detected visually and by calculating the distances between corresponding Cα atoms. Differences in the orientation of the PLP ring were calculated using the CCP4 program GEOMCALC. The final model of bsSHMT consists of 405 (1–405) residues, including the N-terminal methionine. Seventeen residues were inserted at the C terminus due to the cloning strategy employed. These residues were not visible in the electron density map and, consequently, were not included in the final model. The overall fold of the native enzyme is very similar to that of other known SHMT structures and other PLP-dependent enzymes of the α-class, such as aspartate aminotransferase. Briefly, the monomer fold comprises two major domains, the N-terminal domain (residues 1–279) and a C-terminal domain (280–405). The N-terminal domain can be further divided into two sub-domains, a small N-terminal sub-domain (residues 1–80) and a larger PLP binding domain (residues 81–279). The small N-terminal domain comprises three α-helices and one β-strand, whereas the larger N-terminal domain folds into an αβα structure consisting of a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices on both sides. The C-terminal domain folds into an αβ sandwich. All the SHMTs studied to date are either homodimers or homotetramers, the dimer being the minimum structure necessary for the catalytic activity. The four known structures of SHMT (hc-, rc-, mc-, and eSHMT) are all reported to be tetramers, although the quaternary organization of eSHMT structure is different from the mammalian SHMT structures (9.Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10.Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. Radaev S. Schirch V. Wright H.T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the quaternary structure of bsSHMT is a dimer. The crystallographic asymmetric unit consists of a monomer, and the two monomers of the dimer are related by the crystallographic symmetry. No tetrameric contacts are visible in the crystal structure. This is consistent with the gel filtration experiments (data not shown), which shows that the protein elutes at a position corresponding to a dimer. The overall structure of the bsSHMT is depicted in Fig. 1. The structures of the serine and glycine complexes of bsSHMT are virtually identical to that of the native enzyme except for local conformational changes involving the PLP ring and side-chain atoms in the active site region. When compared with the native structure, the serine and glycine complexes show a root mean square deviation of 0.11 and 0.13 Å, respectively, over the 405 superposed Cα atoms. Several studies have suggested that SHMT undergoes a conformational change upon binding of substrates with a 3-hydroxyl group, resembling the transition that occurs in aspartate aminotransferase from an “open” to “closed” form on binding of the aspartate or 2-methylaspartate substrates (24.Stover P. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2155-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25.Huang T. Wang C. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V.

Chem. 1991; 266: 759-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thermal stability of the SHMT increases upon binding of serine, and this change in thermal stability of the enzyme has been attributed to a conformational change in SHMT, like that in aspartate aminotransferase (27.Stover P. Zamora M. Shostak K. Gautam-Basak M. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17679-17687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Picot D. Jansonius J.N. Lesk A.M.

Acta. 1994; 1209: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of mcSHMT and eSHMT complexed to glycine and FTHF indeed show a conformational change compared with the unliganded hc- and rcSHMT structures. However, the observed conformational changes have been largely attributed to the binding of the amino acid substrate (11.Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structures of serine and glycine aldimine forms of bsSHMT clearly show that the amino acid substrate binding alone does not induce significant conformational changes in the protein. The conformational changes observed earlier could be a result of FTHF binding. The reported thermal stability of the enzyme is most likely due to the interaction of the serine with the enzyme, particularly those that bridge the two monomers of the dimer, and filling the active site cavity. The electron density for the bound amino acid substrates was very clear, allowing the substrate to be placed unambiguously. The electron density around the bound serine substrate is shown in Fig. 2. The PLP ring in the serine complex rotates by ∼24° (primarily around the C5-C5′ bond) compared with its internal aldimine form (Fig. 3). A similar rotation of the PLP ring has been reported for aspartate aminotransferase (∼25°) and between the reduced and unreduced forms of rcSHMT structures (31.Jager J. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32.Arnone A. Bogers P.H. Hyde C.C. Briley P.D. Mrtzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Christen P. Metzler D.E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8347-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a small rotation of the PLP ring (∼8°) has been reported in the E. coliternary complex structure relative to the unliganded hc- and rcSHMT structures (11.Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the PLP ring in the E. colistructure shows a rotation of about 21° compared with the native form of bsSHMT. The orientation of the PLP is very similar between the two external aldimine forms of the bsSHMT, except for minor movements in the serine complex, to accommodate the additional interactions due to the hydroxyl group of the serine.Figure 3Stereoview of the superposition of active site regions in the internal aldimine and external aldimine structures of bsSHMT showing the rotation of the PLP ring and conformational change in the Tyr-61 residue.

The bound glycine shows exactly the same interactions, except for those formed by the hydroxyl group of the serine. The hydroxyl group of serine is in close proximity of the carboxylate group of GluB53 (2.5 Å). It is also within hydrogen-bonding distance from the imidazole group of HisA122 (2.80 Å). The carboxylate group of serine forms a tight ion pair with ArgA357. In addition, one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group also interacts with the imidazole of HisA200, and the other can form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of SerA31 and TyrB61. An interesting conformational change observed is that of Tyr-61 (Fig. 3). In the native structure, the side chain of TyrB61 is within hydrogen-bonding distance from ArgA357 (2.72 Å), away from GluB53 (5 Å). However, in the serine complex, it flips toward GluB53, away from ArgA357, presumably due to the interaction of the substrate carboxylate group with ArgA357. This conformational change leads to new interaction of TyrB61 with GluB53 and serine carboxylate group and brings the hydroxyl group of TyrB61 close to the Cβ of serine (2.81 Å). The ternary complex of bsSHMT with bound glycine and FTHF shows small but significant conformational changes compared with the native structure, similar to that observed in the structures of mc- and eSHMT (11.Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12.Szebnyi D.M.E. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of the ternary complex structure of bsSHMT is the lack of structural symmetry and differences in the FTHF interaction between the two monomers of the dimer. Although one of the monomers showed a strong density for the FTHF molecule (monomer A), the other monomer revealed a much weaker density, and there was no appreciable density for the monoglutamate part of the molecule in that monomer (monomer B; see “Discussion”). The first clue toward the asymmetry between the two monomers came from the breakdown of orthorhombic symmetry in the crystals of the ternary complex. The crystals of the native and aldimine forms belong to the orthorhombic system with a monomer in the asymmetric unit, whereas the ternary complex crystals belong to the monoclinic system, with a dimer in the asymmetric unit, although the cell dimensions were not very different from the other three forms (Table I). When compared with the native form, both the monomers of the ternary complex show movements in the C-terminal domain (residues 280–405) and parts of the N-terminal domain, particularly around the active site region. The difference between the two monomers of the dimer in the ternary complex appear to be mainly in the extent of these movements. A comparison of the monomer A (showing good density for FTHF) of the bsSHMT ternary complex to the native structure shows a difference of about 4° in the hinge angle between the N- and C-terminal domains, whereas this difference is only 2.5° in the monomer B. A superposition of the monomer A of the bsSHMT ternary complex with the native structure is shown in Fig. 4. Apart from an overall movement of the C-terminal domain, the ternary complex structure reveals most obvious differences in the region of residues 315–330 and 342–352 of the C-terminal domain and, to a lesser extent, in the regions 27–31 and 114–118 of the N-terminal domain compared with the native structure. Differences in similar regions have been reported in the structures of the ternary complexes of the mc- and eSHMT (11.Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12.Szebnyi D.M.E. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Bioche"
https://openalex.org/W2003160212,"The role of activating protein-1 (AP-1) in muscle cells is currently equivocal. While some studies propose that AP-1 is inhibitory for myogenesis, others implicate a positive role in this process. We tested whether this variation may be due to different properties of the AP-1 subunit composition in differentiating cells. Using Western analysis we show that c-Jun, Fra-2, and JunD are expressed throughout the time course of differentiation. Phosphatase assays indicate that JunD and Fra-2 are phosphorylated in muscle cells and that at least two isoforms of each are expressed in muscle cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays combined with antibody supershifts indicate the appearance of Fra-2 as a major component of the AP-1 DNA binding complex in differentiating cells. In this context it appears that Fra-2 heterodimerizes with c-Jun and JunD. Studying the c-jun enhancer in reporter gene assays we observed that the muscle transcription factors MEF2A and MyoD can contribute to robust transcriptional activation of the c-jun enhancer. In differentiating muscle cells mutation of the MEF2 site reduces transactivation of the c-jun enhancer and MEF2A is the predominant MEF2 isoform binding to this cis element. Transcriptional activation of an AP-1 site containing reporter gene (TRE-Luc) is enhanced under differentiation conditions compared with growth conditions in C2C12 muscle cells. Further studies indicate that Fra-2 containing AP-1 complexes can transactivate the MyoD enhancer/promoter. Thus, an AP-1 complex containing Fra-2 and c-Jun or JunD is consistent with muscle differentiation, indicating that AP-1 function during myogenesis is dependent on its subunit composition.

Phosphatase assays indicate that JunD and Fra-2 are phosphorylated in muscle cells and that at least two isoforms of each are expressed in muscle cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays combined with antibody supershifts indicate the appearance of Fra-2 as a major component of the AP-1 DNA binding complex in differentiating cells. In this context it appears that Fra-2 heterodimerizes with c-Jun and JunD. Studying the c-jun enhancer in reporter gene assays we observed that the muscle transcription factors MEF2A and MyoD can contribute to robust transcriptional activation of the c-jun enhancer. In differentiating muscle cells mutation of the MEF2 site reduces transactivation of the c-jun enhancer and MEF2A is the predominant MEF2 isoform binding to this cis element. Transcriptional activation of an AP-1 site containing reporter gene (TRE-Luc) is enhanced under differentiation conditions compared with growth conditions in C2C12 muscle cells. Further studies indicate that Fra-2 containing AP-1 complexes can transactivate the MyoD enhancer/promoter. Thus, an AP-1 complex containing Fra-2 and c-Jun or JunD is consistent with muscle differentiation, indicating that AP-1 function during myogenesis is dependent on its subunit composition.

The diverse cellular responses to AP-1 activity may, in part, be mediated by the specific subunit composition of the AP-1 complex. This complex is a dimer of the Jun and Fos proto-oncogene families that binds to acis element termed the TRE (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element) with the consensus 5′-TGAC/GTCA-3′ (1.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). AP-1 is thus formed by a dimeric association between Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) family proteins or a subset of ATF proteins. Therefore, a primary issue in understanding AP-1 activity concerns the functional properties of the different AP-1 dimer combinations. For example, in mouse fibroblasts JunD has an antiproliferative role, whereas c-Jun promotes S-phase entry and proliferation (2.Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3.Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5015-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of AP-1 in apoptosis is complex, dependent on the cellular context, and while c-Jun appears to be pro-apoptotic, JunD protects cells from senescence and apoptosis (4.Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Since AP-1 components are differentially expressed during development and in different tissues, it is likely that heterogeneous AP-1 complexes fulfill distinct roles in cells of different lineage. This idea is supported by gene targeting experiments in which c-Fos −/− mice have impaired bone development but are viable (5.Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R.

The importance of AP-1 composition for specific biological responses is also exemplified in cellular transformation of NIH 3T3 by Ras; JunD is down-regulated in contrast to c-Jun levels, which increase. Overexpression of JunD also antagonizes transformation. The Jun proteins are responsive to an array of stimuli such as UV irradiation, cytokines, oxidative stress, and growth factors (1.Angel P.

Thus, the specific AP-1 dimer composition and also the targeting of these components by cellular signaling pathways provide the cell with complex machinery to modulate genes bearing this TRE element. Additional studies to clarify the function of specific AP-1 dimers in different cell types are therefore paramount to understanding the biology of AP-1 function in vivo, both during development and also in the adult.The process of muscle differentiation has proved to be a powerful model for studying mechanisms of tissue-specific transcriptional control (17.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar,18.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The identification and extensive characterization of the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors have led to the establishment of a paradigm for the regulation of tissue specific gene expression (17.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 18.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In contrast, the physiological role for AP-1 during myogenesis is not well defined. Initial studies showed that c-Jun represses myogenesis due to a direct physical antagonism of the activity of the MRF family members, MyoD and myogenin (19.Li L. Chambard J. Karin M. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20.Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M.

However, one hallmark of these studies was that the effects on myogenesis were dependent on high levels of c-Jun overexpression from retroviral vectors, possibly implying that the mechanism of inhibition was through competition with the MRFs for a limiting factor such as CBP/p300. Moreover, mice expressing an H-2K-v-Jun transgene develop malignant sarcomas that contain focal areas of skeletal muscle (22.Scuh A.C. Keating S.J. Yeung M.C. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 667-676PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the idea that expression of v-Jun in transgenic tumors is compatible with skeletal muscle differentiation.Since these studies, the full complexity of AP-1 has been documented, and it is possible that c-Jun overexpression in these earlier investigations disturbed the requirement for precise balance of AP-1 components in the cells. This idea is supported by observations that AP-1 components can be detected in differentiating myogenic cells, and some of the MRF gene promoters and certain muscle structural genes contain TRE elements. Thus, co-expression of AP-1 proteins with myogenic and structural proteins is compatible with a positive role for physiological levels of AP-1 in myogenic differentiation (23.Aurade F. Pfarr C.M.

Also, the transcriptional control of the c-jungene promoter becomes partially under the control of muscle specific transcription complexes during differentiation. These data highlight the complex role of heterogeneous AP-1 complexes in the context of muscle cell differentiation.DISCUSSIONHere we present data pertaining to the expression and activity of AP-1 in myogenic cells. AP-1 activity in differentiating muscle cells raises the possibility, contrary to previous ideas, that it may play a positive role during myogenesis. Since the AP-1 complex in proliferating myoblasts is distinct from that of terminally differentiated myotubes, differentiation-specific changes in AP-1 composition may reflect dynamic changes in the activation of AP-1 target genes in these cells. In differentiating muscle cells the predominant AP-1 complex consists of a heterodimer comprised of Fra-2 complexed with c-Jun or JunD. The increased level of Fra-2 in the myotube AP-1 complex is correlated with cell cycle withdrawal and the activation of muscle gene expression. Thus, these data suggest that a different set of AP-1 target genes may be activated by heterogeneous AP-1 complexes during differentiation. It is likely that there are a multitude of AP-1 target genes in muscle, but one notable target could be MRF family members. Here we show that Fra-2-containing AP-1 complexes can transactivate the MyoD core enhancer. Although the functional implications of changes in the AP-1 subunit composition are incompletely understood at this point, it is clear that the AP-1 complex in differentiating muscle cells is distinct from that in proliferating myoblasts.An important level of regulation of AP-1 occurs through controlling its activity and concentration within the cell (1.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). For example the activity of c-Jun and Fra-2 is regulated through phosphorylation (14.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar,36.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar, 37.Murukami M. Sonobe M.H. Ui M. Kabuyama Y. Atanabe H. Takahashi A. Han H. Iba H.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In response to various stressors such as UV, heat, or TNF-α, c-Jun is phosphorylated on Ser63 and, more prominently, Ser73 in its activation domain by the JNKs (14.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar, 16.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). This phosphorylated c-Jun can then interact with co-activators CBP/p300 to increase transactivation of target genes. The abundance of c-Jun is also regulated at the level of protein stability. The half-life of c-Jun is ∼90 min, and degradation of c-Jun has been shown to be mediated by the ubiquitin pathway (36.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of c-Jun by the JNKs decreases c-Jun ubiquitination and increases its stability (36.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar). Less is known concerning the regulation of Fra-2 by phosphorylation, but the present study indicates that both JunD and Fra-2 are modified by phosphorylation in myogenic cells. The implications of this post-translational regulation of Fra-2 and JunD during myogenesis is thus of considerable interest.Activation of c-jun transcription through the c-jun enhancer/promoter is elevated in growing HeLa cells. We attribute this to the various sites in the enhancer, i.e. NF-jun, jun1, jun2, SP1, and the CAAT box, which are bound by various transcription factor complexes. However, endogenous MEF2 proteins in HeLa do not contribute to this activation, since the c-jun enhancer, which contains a mutated MEF2 binding site, has the same activity as the wild type enhancer when it is transfected. Therefore in HeLa cells, the basal levels of c-jun transcription do not depend on the MEF2 site. In contrast to the minimal role played in proliferating cells, we show that the MEF2 site in the c-jun enhancer is an important regulatory element in myogenic cells, since a mutated MEF2 site in the c-jun enhancer leads to a considerable diminution of reporter activity during differentiation. The residual enhancer activity remaining when the MEF2 site is mutated is due to the contribution from the other transcription factor binding sites or possibly as yet unknown cis elements in the c-junenhancer.Previous studies have suggested that a putative AP-1/CRE element at −342 to −322 of the MyoD promoter is a negative regulator of MyoD expression (38.Pedraza Alva G. Zingg J.-M. Jost J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element is not a classical AP-1 site but fits the consensus as a cAMP-responsive element. Previous studies suggest the involvement of AP-1 in the regulation of this element. However, even though c-Jun and c-Fos were implicated in negative control of the MyoD promoter through this element, it is not yet known what the role of a different AP-1 dimer combination could be. Our initial studies with overexpression of Fra-2 indicate that it can activate the 2.5-kb MyoD promoter containing this element, thus supporting the notion that there could be differential regulation through this element depending on the specific AP-1 dimer binding there. Additional studies of the MyoD gene have indicated the presence of a consensus AP-1 site in the middle of a region referred to as the MyoD core enhancer, which is located 20 kb away from the transcriptional start site (27.Kucharczuk K.L. Love C.M. Dougherty N.M. Goldhamer D.J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1957-1965PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, further studies dissecting the role of AP-1 dimer combinations on the MyoD promoter may be important in determining the control of MyoD expression.Considering our data, along with those of others, we propose a testable model (Fig. 6) for the inclusion of specific AP-1 complexes in a sub-circuit of the myogenic regulatory hierarchy. In this model we propose that MEF2, which is strongly induced during myogenic differentiation, activates c-Jun expression. JunD/c-Jun dimerize with Fra-2 that becomes a major component of the AP-1 complex in differentiating cells. Since Fra-2 is expressed throughout the time course of differentiation, this change in Fra-2's contribution to the AP-1 complex likely reflects post-translational control of its DNA binding properties. Fra-2-containing AP-1 complexes can then target muscle genes and also contribute to the transcriptional activation of the MRFs. The MRFs are known to be able to induce MEF2 activity; and in the current study, we also present data suggesting that one of the MRFs, MyoD, can affect the transcription of c-jun through the MEF2 element, thus completing a self-reinforcing feedback circuit. This model is based on data from the current study and those of others (18.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Several studies in the early nineties suggested that AP-1 is inhibitory for myogenesis because of the observation that overexpression of c-Jun inhibits myogenesis due to a direct physical antagonism between the leucine zipper of c-Jun and the helix-loop-helix domain of MyoD (19.Li L. Chambard J. Karin M. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20.Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M.

While the physical basis for the antagonism between the two proteins when overexpressed is correct, based on our current data, we contend that these observations have masked the role of endogenous AP-1 in myogenic cells. A role for specific AP-1 complexes is not without precedent having been implicated in cellular differentiation in ovarian granulosa cells and osteoblasts (39.Sharma S.C. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33718-33728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40.McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4398-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic and often contradictory functional role of AP-1 raises the question of how can AP-1 mediate such contrasting processes? One possible explanation, based on evidence presented by others and ourselves, is that changes in the composition or phosphorylation of AP-1 subunits can modulate its activity such that its target genes and biological function are dynamically altered. We therefore propose that physiological levels of an AP-1 complex consisting of a JunD/Fra-2 or a c-Jun/Fra-2 heterodimer is consistent with, and not antagonistic to, myogenic differentiation. We also show data indicating that AP-1 may play a role in the full activation of MyoD expression due to direct effects on the MyoD promoter. These data implicate specific AP-1 subunits in the positive control of muscle differentiation.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The identification and extensive characterization of the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors have led to the establishment of a paradigm for the regulation of tissue specific gene expression (17.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 18.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In contrast, the physiological role for AP-1 during myogenesis is not well defined. Initial studies showed that c-Jun represses myogenesis due to a direct physical antagonism of the activity of the MRF family members, MyoD and myogenin (19.Li L. Chambard J. Karin M. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20.Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M.

However, one hallmark of these studies was that the effects on myogenesis were dependent on high levels of c-Jun overexpression from retroviral vectors, possibly implying that the mechanism of inhibition was through competition with the MRFs for a limiting factor such as CBP/p300. Moreover, mice expressing an H-2K-v-Jun transgene develop malignant sarcomas that contain focal areas of skeletal muscle (22.Scuh A.C. Keating S.J. Yeung M.C. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 667-676PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the idea that expression of v-Jun in transgenic tumors is compatible with skeletal muscle differentiation. Since these studies, the full complexity of AP-1 has been documented, and it is possible that c-Jun overexpression in these earlier investigations disturbed the requirement for precise balance of AP-1 components in the cells. This idea is supported by observations that AP-1 components can be detected in differentiating myogenic cells, and some of the MRF gene promoters and certain muscle structural genes contain TRE elements. Thus, co-expression of AP-1 proteins with myogenic and structural proteins is compatible with a positive role for physiological levels of AP-1 in myogenic differentiation (23.Aurade F. Pfarr C.M.

Here, we report that the subunit structure of the AP-1 complex undergoes a transition from a “proliferation”- to “differentiation”-specific, Fra-2-containing complex during myogenesis. Also, the transcriptional control of the c-jungene promoter becomes partially under the control of muscle specific transcription complexes during differentiation. These data highlight the complex role of heterogeneous AP-1 complexes in the context of muscle cell differentiation. DISCUSSIONHere we present data pertaining to the expression and activity of AP-1 in myogenic cells. AP-1 activity in differentiating muscle cells raises the possibility, contrary to previous ideas, that it may play a positive role during myogenesis. Since the AP-1 complex in proliferating myoblasts is distinct from that of terminally differentiated myotubes, differentiation-specific changes in AP-1 composition may reflect dynamic changes in the activation of AP-1 target genes in these cells. In differentiating muscle cells the predominant AP-1 complex consists of a heterodimer comprised of Fra-2 complexed with c-Jun or JunD. The increased level of Fra-2 in the myotube AP-1 complex is correlated with cell cycle withdrawal and the activation of muscle gene expression. Thus, these data suggest that a different set of AP-1 target genes may be activated by heterogeneous AP-1 complexes during differentiation. It is likely that there are a multitude of AP-1 target genes in muscle, but one notable target could be MRF family members. Here we show that Fra-2-containing AP-1 complexes can transactivate the MyoD core enhancer. Although the functional implications of changes in the AP-1 subunit composition are incompletely understood at this point, it is clear that the AP-1 complex in differentiating muscle cells is distinct from that in proliferating myoblasts.An important level of regulation of AP-1 occurs through controlling its activity and concentration within the cell (1.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). For example the activity of c-Jun and Fra-2 is regulated through phosphorylation (14.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar,36.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar, 37.Murukami M. Sonobe M.H. Ui M. Kabuyama Y. Atanabe H. Takahashi A. Han H. Iba H.E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In response to various stressors such as UV, heat, or TNF-α, c-Jun is phosphorylated on Ser63 and, more prominently, Ser73 in its activation domain by the JNKs (14.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar, 16.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). This phosphorylated c-Jun can then interact with co-activators CBP/p300 to increase transactivation of target genes. The abundance of c-Jun is also regulated at the level of protein stability. The half-life of c-Jun is ∼90 min, and degradation of c-Jun has been shown to be mediated by the ubiquitin pathway (36.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of c-Jun by the JNKs decreases c-Jun ubiquitination and increases its stability (36.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar). Less is known concerning the regulation of Fra-2 by phosphorylation, but the present study indicates that both JunD and Fra-2 are modified by phosphorylation in myogenic cells. The implications of this post-translational regulation of Fra-2 and JunD during myogenesis is thus of considerable interest.Activation of c-jun transcription through the c-jun enhancer/promoter is elevated in growing HeLa cells. We attribute this to the various sites in the enhancer, i.e. NF-jun, jun1, jun2, SP1, and the CAAT box, which are bound by various transcription factor complexes. However, endogenous MEF2 proteins in HeLa do not contribute to this activation, since the c-jun enhancer, which contains a mutated MEF2 binding site, has the same activity as the wild type enhancer when it is transfected. Therefore in HeLa cells, the basal levels of c-jun transcription do not depend on the MEF2 site. In contrast to the minimal role played in proliferating cells, we show that the MEF2 site in the c-jun enhancer is an important regulatory element in myogenic cells, since a mutated MEF2 site in the c-jun enhancer leads to a considerable diminution of reporter activity during differentiation. The residual enhancer activity remaining when the MEF2 site is mutated is due to the contribution from the other transcription factor binding sites or possibly as yet unknown cis elements in the c-junenhancer.Previous studies have suggested that a putative AP-1/CRE element at −342 to −322 of the MyoD promoter is a negative regulator of MyoD expression (38.Pedraza Alva G. Zingg J.-M. Jost J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element is not a classical AP-1 site but fits the consensus as a cAMP-responsive element. Previous studies suggest the involvement of AP-1 in the regulation of this element. However, even though c-Jun and c-Fos were implicated in negative control of the MyoD promoter through this element, it is not yet known what the role of a different AP-1 dimer combination could be. Our initial studies with overexpression of Fra-2 indicate that it can activate the 2.5-kb MyoD promoter containing this element, thus supporting the notion that there could be differential regulation through this element depending on the specific AP-1 dimer binding there. Additional studies of the MyoD gene have indicated the presence of a consensus AP-1 site in the middle of a region referred to as the MyoD core enhancer, which is located 20 kb away from the transcriptional start site (27.Kucharczuk K.L. Love C.M. Dougherty N.M. Goldhamer D.J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1957-1965PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, further studies dissecting the role of AP-1 dimer combinations on the MyoD promoter may be important in determining the control of MyoD expression.Considering our data, along with those of others, we propose a testable model (Fig. 6) for the inclusion of specific AP-1 complexes in a sub-circuit of the myogenic regulatory hierarchy. In this model we propose that MEF2, which is strongly induced during myogenic differentiation, activates c-Jun expression. JunD/c-Jun dimerize with Fra-2 that becomes a major component of the AP-1 complex in differentiating cells. Since Fra-2 is expressed throughout the time course of differentiation, this change in Fra-2's contribution to the AP-1 complex likely reflects post-translational control of its DNA binding properties. Fra-2-containing AP-1 complexes can then target muscle genes and also contribute to the transcriptional activation of the MRFs. The MRFs are known to be able to induce MEF2 activity; and in the current study, we also present data suggesting that one of the MRFs, MyoD, can affect the transcription of c-jun through the MEF2 element, thus completing a self-reinforcing feedback circuit. This model is based on data from the current study and those of others (18.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Several studies in the early nineties suggested that AP-1 is inhibitory for myogenesis because of the observation that overexpression of c-Jun inhibits myogenesis due to a direct physical antagonism between the leucine zipper of c-Jun and the helix-loop-helix domain of MyoD (19.Li L. Chambard J. Karin M. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20.Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M.

While the physical basis for the antagonism between the two proteins when overexpressed is correct, based on our current data, we contend that these observations have masked the role of endogenous AP-1 in myogenic cells. A role for specific AP-1 complexes is not without precedent having been implicated in cellular differentiation in ovarian granulosa cells and osteoblasts (39.Sharma S.C. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33718-33728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40.McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4398-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic and often contradictory functional role of AP-1 raises the question of how can AP-1 mediate such contrasting processes? One possible explanation, based on evidence presented by others and ourselves, is that changes in the composition or phosphorylation of AP-1 subunits can modulate its activity such that its target genes and biological function are dynamically altered. We therefore propose that physiological levels of an AP-1 complex consisting of a JunD/Fra-2 or a c-Jun/Fra-2 heterodimer is consistent with, and not antagonistic to, myogenic differentiation. We also show data indicating that AP-1 may play a role in the full activation of MyoD expression due to direct effects on the MyoD promoter. These data implicate specific AP-1 subunits in the positive control of muscle differentiation. Here we present data pertaining to the expression and activity of AP-1 in myogenic cells.

Interestingly, it does not share any sequence similarity with the classic iron-sulfur proteins, although four cysteines (which are strongly conserved in the thermophilic members of Family 4 UDGs) may represent the metal coordinating residues. The conservation of these residues in other members of the family suggest that 4Fe4S clusters are a common feature. Although 4Fe4S clusters have been observed previously in Nth/MutY DNA repair enzymes, this is the first observation of such a feature in the UDG structural superfamily.

Uracil-DNA glycosylases are ubiquitous DNA repair enzymes responsible for the excision of uracil bases from DNA as the first step in a base excision repair pathway. Uracil arises in DNA either as a result of the hydrolytic deamination of cytosine residues in G:C base pairs (1.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar) or from incorporation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (instead of thymidine monophosphate) opposite adenine during DNA replication (2.Tye B.-K. Chien J. Lehman I.R. Duncan B.K. Warner H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). If left uncorrected the former process would cause G:C to A:T transition mutations (1.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar), whereas the latter may result in the disruption of specific regulatory DNA-protein interactions (3.Focher F. Verri A. Verzeletti S. Mazzarello P. Spadari S. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: S67-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Because hyperthermophiles do not exhibit any greater susceptibility to this type of damage they presumably possess more effective repair enzymes (5.Jacobs K.L. Grogan D.W. J.

These G:T/U mismatch-specific enzymes (Family 2) are structurally and mechanistically related to the UNG-type UDGs (Family 1) (12.Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J.

Huber R. Drobner E. Rachel R. Burggraf S. Trincone A. Stetter K.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2918-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fosmid-based genomic map of the 1.7-MbP. aerophilum genome was constructed and used to identify 474 putative genes (16.Fitz-Gibbon S. Choi A.J. Miller J.H. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Swanson R. Kim U.J. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but no homologues of the UNG or MUG/TDG UDG families were initially identified. Following the identification ofTm-UDG (a novel UDG weakly related to E. coli MUG) in the thermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima, a homologous open reading frame was identified inP. aerophilum encoding a new protein (designatedPa-UDG) with significant homology to Tm-UDG (9.Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we show Pa-UDG to be an iron-sulfur protein with the characteristics of a 4Fe4S high potential iron protein center (HiPIP). Comparison of amino acid sequences and molecular modeling identified residues constituting the iron-sulfur cluster, suggesting that this is a common (although not universal) structural feature of the Family 4 UDGs. Pa-UDG was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS from plasmid pET28-Pa-UDG essentially as described (9.Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal His6 tag. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and stored at −20 °C. Cells were lysed by thawing followed by a brief sonication on an ice/ethanol slurry (15 × 9-s bursts with 9-s cooling periods between bursts). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 ×g, and the supernatant was then incubated for 5 min at 80 °C to denature and precipitate the thermolabile E. coli proteins. The sample was cooled on ice, clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g, and then loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The flow-through was discarded, as was a subsequent 10-column volume wash of buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole.Pa-UDG was eluted in 5-column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. The sample fractions were identified in the first instance by SDS-PAGE analysis (15% acrylamide) and subsequently by the yellow color. Sample fractions were pooled, and volume was reduced (if required) to 10 ml by concentration in a Centriprep 20 spin concentrator (5-kDa cut off) (Amicon). The sample buffer was then exchanged using a desalting column pre-equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors). A cation exchange step was then used to complete the purification. During initial preparations an HR5/5 Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) was chosen, but during later preparations an XK26/10 column packed with SP-Sepharose fast flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) was selected instead. Flow rates were used as recommended by the manufacturer for the column selected. In both cases the sample was applied to a column already equilibrated in buffer B. Both the flow-through and a 5-column volume of buffer B wash were discarded. Bound protein was eluted via a linear NaCl gradient (10–500 mm) over 20-column volumes. The purified protein fractions were pooled and concentrated (as described above) and then transferred into buffer A supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol using a PD10 desalting column (Bio-Rad). Purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), and the protein was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC recording spectrophotometer. Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were obtained using a JEOL RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments liquid helium cryostat. Samples were analyzed as prepared following reduction with sodium dithionite and oxidation with potassium ferricyanide. The His6-tagged Pa-UDG was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells using a pET28c(+)-Pa-UDG construct (9.Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The protein was purified from the cell lysate by heat treatment and immobilized metal-ion chromatography and cation exchange chromatography to give an essentially pure sample migrating with an approximate molecular mass of 25 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 a), whereas MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a more precise mass of 24.248 kDa (Fig. 1 b). Both results were consistent with the theoretical mass for His-tagged Pa-UDG (24.628 kDa). N-terminal analysis of the purified protein prior to and following removal of the His6 tag by digestion with thrombin confirmed its identity as Pa-UDG. Uracil-DNA glycosylase activity of the purified protein at 70 °C was confirmed as described (6.Koulis A. Cowan D.A. Pearl L.H. Savva R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pure protein was dialyzed against a minimal buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for concentration and subsequent crystallographic analysis. The protein was highly soluble and could be concentrated to >30 mg ml−1. Unexpectedly, dilutedPa-UDG (∼1 mg ml−1) was observed to be yellow in color, and this color intensified to dark olive and eventually brown as the sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The retention and concentration of the color against a 5-kDa cutoff membrane suggested a high molecular mass protein-associated chromophore rather than a small molecule contaminant. Consistent with this observation, an adsorption spectrum of the concentrated protein displayed a broad peak around 370–400 nm (in addition to the normal absorption peaks around 280 nm) caused by side chains of aromatic amino acid residues (Fig. 2). Absorption peaks in the 370–400-nm region can result from a variety of common biological chromophores ranging from carotenes to porphyrins and iron-sulfur clusters. To determine whether any metals were present in the purified protein the buffered sample was lyophilized and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, which confirmed the presence of iron within the protein with an estimated stoichiometry of ∼3 iron atoms per mol of protein. To ascertain the nature of the iron present in purifiedPa-UDG we recorded continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of protein prepared using a Mono S cation exchange step in the first instance (Fig. 3). The EPR spectra of the enzyme clearly demonstrated the presence of iron-sulfur centers in the sample. As prepared, the enzyme showed a weak spectrum characteristic of oxidized 3Fe4S centers with g values at approximately 2.02. Upon reduction with sodium dithionite, this was replaced by a weak ferredoxin-like spectrum with peaks at g values of approximately 2.06, 1.95, and 1.85. Upon oxidation with potassium ferricyanide a much stronger signal was observed, partly indicating an increase in the oxidized 3Fe4S center but also showing strong signals at g values of 2.12 and 2.04, which is characteristic of an oxidized 4Fe4S high potential iron protein center and demonstrates the presence of both 3Fe and 4Fe centers in the preparation. When a Mono S column was used as the final purification step thePa-UDG eluted essentially as a single peak, although the chromatogram suggested that there actually may have been two peaks present (which had not been fully resolved). When the Mono S column was replaced by an SP-Sepharose fast flow column Pa-UDG reproducibly eluted as two distinct peaks (Fig. 4 a) designated as species 1 and 2. Each peak contained a pure colored protein that migrated in SDS-PAGE with a molecular weight consistent with Pa-UDG (Fig. 4 b) and was confirmed as such by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Edman N-terminal sequencing in both cases (data not shown). The EPR spectra of the two peaks were very similar (Fig. 4 c). Both samples contained a 4Fe4S HiPIP center giving large signals in the oxidized state but little signal as prepared or in the reduced state. However, species 2 contained a small amount of the 3Fe center observed in previously described preparations, whereas species 1 did not. Taken together the UV-visible, atomic absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic data all point to the presence of an integral cuboidal iron-sulfur cluster of the 4Fe4S HiPIP type in the Family 4 UDG from P. aerophilum. Depending on the methodology used in the purification of Pa-UDG, the 3Fe4S and 4Fe4S clusters may co-exist and may be interconvertible as in other iron-sulfur proteins such as aconitase (17.Kennedy M.C. Bienert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 263: 8194-8198Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18.Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Bienert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the 3Fe centers may be the result of damage or partial denaturation during the purification process. Resolution of two apparently compositionally identical 4Fe4S species in an ion exchange column suggests that multiple oxidation states with different net charges may be possible also. Cuboidal iron-sulfur clusters have been observed previously in DNA repair enzymes of the MutY/Nth/Ogg structural superfamily (19.Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Sponner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) such as the eubacterial endonuclease III (20.Cunningham R.P. Asahara H. Bank J.F. Scholes C.P. Salerno J.C. Surerus K. Munck E. McCracken J. Peisach J. Emptage M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and the archaeal Pa-MIG (also identified in P. aerophilum) (21.Yang H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Marcotte E.M. Tai J.H. Hyman E.C. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge Pa-UDG is the first example of such a feature in the uracil-DNA glycosylase structural superfamily (14.Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. DNA Repair. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Iron-sulfur clusters of the HiPIP type are usually attached via tetrahedrally directed bonds from the iron atoms to the Sγ atoms of four cysteine residues in the polypeptide chain. The Pa-UDG sequence contains six cysteine residues of which four are totally conserved in the characterizedT. maritima and Archeoglobus fulgidus Family 4 UDGs (7.Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8.Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19146-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in many homologous archaeal and eubacterial (putative) UDG sequences (Fig. 5). These four cysteine residues are not totally conserved throughout Family 4 homologues, the first and third being replaced by aromatic residues inRickettsia, for example, nor are they restricted to hyperthermophiles, being present in Family 4 UDG homologues from spirochaetes, mycobacteria, Clostridia, andDeinococcus radiodurans. In previously described HiPIP-type cuboidal iron-sulfur proteins the sequence distribution of cysteine ligands varies considerably, and consensus can be obtained only within protein families. The putative ligands in the Family 4 UDGs conform to a pattern, Cys-X 2-Cys-X n-CysX (14–17)-Cys, where n ranges from 70 to 100. This is quite distinct from the Nth/MutY DNA repair enzymes, which show a much more localized consensus pattern, Cys-X 4-Pro-X-Cys-X 2Cys-X (6–8)-Cys, and it does not resemble any known distributions of cysteine ligands in other iron-sulfur proteins characterized to date. If these conserved cysteines act as ligands as we suggest, then Pa-UDG must be able to fold so that the N-terminal Cys-X 2-Cys motif comes within sufficiently close proximity to the central Cys-X (14–17)-Cys motif to bond to the iron atoms at the corners of the cuboidal 4Fe4S cluster. To date no structure for a Family 4 UDG has been reported. However, sequence threading and profile analysis techniques suggest that Family 4 UDGs will have a similar overall fold to the bacterial Family 2 MUG enzymes (14.Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. DNA Repair. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Mapping the Pa-UDG sequence onto the crystal structure of E. coli MUG (12.Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13.Barrett T.E. Schärer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) locates the central pair of putative iron-sulfur cluster ligands on the surface-exposed face of helix four and the loop that precedes it (Fig. 6 a). Cysteine residues at these positions (corresponding approximately to residues 72 and 87 in the MUG structure) would be well located to provide two ligands for a 4Fe4S cluster. The N-terminal CX 2C motif occurs in a segment of the Pa-UDG sequence that precedes the N terminus of MUG, and topologically equivalent residues therefore cannot be located in the known MUG structure. However, the N terminus of MUG is on the same face of the protein as the residues corresponding to the central cysteine pair in Pa-UDG. The N-terminal pair of putative 4Fe4S ligand residues occurs 8 and 11 residues upstream of the residue in the Pa-UDG sequence that corresponds to the N terminus of MUG and would certainly be on the same face of the protein as the central pair of putative cluster ligands. Although the E. coli MUG protein lacks residues corresponding to this segment ofPa-UDG, the more distantly related Family 1 UDGs do possess corresponding segments of sequence. In Family 1 UDG structures this segment forms a turn and a preceding helix that lies over the surface carrying the topological equivalents of MUG residues 71 and 87. If a similar structure were present in Pa-UDG it would comfortably deliver the N-terminal CX 2C motif into a position suitable for providing the remaining pair of ligands for the iron-sulfur cluster. (Fig. 6 b). Iron-sulfur clusters occur in a wide range of enzymes primarily as redox active co-factors participating directly in electron-transfer catalytic mechanisms. However, cuboidal 4Fe4S clusters have also been identified in non-redox enzymes, most notably in the Nth/MutY family of DNA repair enzymes (20.Cunningham R.P. Asahara H. Bank J.F. Scholes C.P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A variety of biochemical and biophysical studies suggests that the 4Fe4S cluster in these enzymes is not involved directly in catalysis (24.Fu W.G. Ohandley S. Cunningham R.P. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16135-16137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead it functions as a structural cross-link analogous to disulfide bonds or zinc fingers and nonetheless contributes to substrate recognition by maintaining the structure of protein segments involved in DNA interactions (25.Porello S.L. Cannon M.J. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6465-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26.Golinelli M.P. Chmiel N.H. David S.S.

Science. 1992; 258: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). On the basis of the structural homology between the Family 4 enzymes and the Family 2 bacterial MUG, the deduced site of the 4Fe4S cluster inPa-UDG suggests that it would not participate directly in glycosylase activity. However, the central pair of putative conserved cysteine ligands map to the beginning and end of a loop segment in MUG that is involved in contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone (Fig. 6 c) (12.Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13.Barrett T.E. Schärer O.D. Savva R.

Determination of the precise role of the cuboidal 4Fe4S cluster in Family 4 uracil-DNA glycosylases must await the results of structural and mutagenesis studies, which are ongoing.

The protein primer for the synthesis of poliovirus RNA includes, at a minimum, the 22-amino acid viral peptide 3B (also called VPg), which is found covalently linked to the 5′ ends of all newly synthesized positive and negative strands. Poliovirus translates its proteins as a single, large polyprotein that is cleaved into the proteins required for virion formation, host modification, and RNA replication. In many cases, proteolytic precursors have functions distinct from those of the limit digestion products. Evidence for the use of 3B. As a protein primer comes from in vitro experiments in which it was demonstrated that 3B is uridylylated in the presence of UTP, the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D), and an RNA template (9Paul A.V. Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The RNA used to template the uridylylation of 3B can either be poly(A), poliovirus RNA, or the small cis replication enhancer RNA (10Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J.

Almond J.W. Barclay W. Evans D.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4590-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Whether 3B itself serves as the primer within infected cells and how it is brought into the RNA replication complex are not yet known. Evidence for direct binding between polymerase and 3B was observed in the two-hybrid system (13Xiang W. Cuconati A. Hope D. Kirkegaard K. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a stronger signal was observed between the polymerase and a larger polypeptide that contains the 3B, sequences, 3AB (13Xiang W. Cuconati A. Hope D. Kirkegaard K. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When mutations of 3AB were tested to identify those that disrupted interactions with the poliovirus polymerase in the two-hybrid system, only those that mapped within the 3B sequences were found to be disruptive (13Xiang W. Cuconati A. Hope D. Kirkegaard K. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that many of the direct contacts between the polymerase and 3AB are within the 3B sequence. All positive-strand RNA viruses, from picornaviruses such as poliovirus and foot and mouth disease virus to flaviviruses such as Dengue and hepatitis C virus, form their RNA replication complexes in association with cytoplasmic membranes whose identity differs for different viruses (Refs. 15Chen J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3841-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and the references therein). Protein 3AB contains an extended hydrophobic domain and associates with membranes both in vitro and when expressed in isolation in tissue culture cells (18Ho J.S. Towner T.V. Semler B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26810-26818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,19Datta U. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4468-4477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-bound 3AB has been recovered from Escherichia coli expression systems and found to both stimulate the proteolytic activity of the precursor of poliovirus polymerase, 3CD (20Lama J. Paul A.V.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A specific interaction between 3AB and poliovirus polymerase can also be observed with purified, detergent-solubilized 3AB, which stimulates poliovirus polymerase activity (20Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2715-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data have led to a model in which membrane-associated 3AB or one of its larger precursors (25Towner J.S. Mazanet M.M. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7191-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) binds directly to the soluble RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, facilitating its recruitment to the membranes upon which viral RNA replication occurs. Previously, it was shown that the V391L mutation in poliovirus polymerase confers a specific defect in the interaction of the polymerase with viral protein 3AB in the yeast two-hybrid system andin vitro (14Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Val391 is located near motif E, a motif conserved among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases; the positions of Val391 and several motifs conserved among polymerases are shown in Fig. 1 (26Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). According to the frequently used analogy comparing polymerase structures to right hands, the “thumb” of polymerases such as HIV1 reverse transcriptase,Taq DNA polymerase, and T7 DNA polymerase binds to the double-stranded portion of the template strand, positioning the primer, the 3′-hydroxyl of the nascent strand, at the active site (reviewed in Ref. 27Jager J. Pata J.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The precise orientations of the template, the protein primer, and the nascent RNA strand in the poliovirus polymerase structure are not yet known. To define the 3AB binding site further and to determine whether residues in that site are important for 3B uridylylation, mutagenesis of the surface residues that surround the V391L mutation was undertaken. The ability of 14 mutant polymerases to bind to viral protein 3AB, catalyze RNA-dependent RNA polymerization, and uridylylate 3B was determined. The wild-type identities of several clustered surface residues near motif E were found to be involved in all 3AB- and 3B-mediated functions. Flanking residues appear to have additional functions in the enzymology of protein priming. Mutations were introduced into the pT5T3D plasmid, designed to express polymerase 3D in E. coli, using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or the megaprimer method (28Ke S.H. Madison E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3371-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) with the primers described in Table I. The flanking primers for the megaprimer mutagenesis were CTGGGAGCAATAAAG and CCCAGGAGTGATAACAGGTTCAGCAGTGGG, amplifying the coding region of 3D polymerase from nucleotide 606–1348. The PCR products were cleaved with NsiI and MfeI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and inserted into similarly cleaved wild-type pT5T3D.

Open table in a new tab To construct two-hybrid bait plasmids, the 3D polymerase coding region was amplified from mutant pT5T3D using primers CCGAATTCGGTGAAATCCAGTGGATGAGA and CGGGATCCTCGAGTTACTAAAATGAGTCAAGCC, cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI, and cloned into pLex202+PL (29Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The appropriate sequence in all plasmids constructed using PCR was confirmed by sequencing. Wild-type and mutant poliovirus polymerases were purified as described previously (30Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Activity assays were performed with 2 μm polymerase in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmMnCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 30 mm NaCl, 70 μg/ml poly(A) (200 μmnucleotide), 25 μg/ml oligod(T)16 (100 μm nucleotide), 400 μm UTP, and 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were incubated for 10 min on ice, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and spotted onto DE81 paper wetted in wash (5% dibasic sodium phosphate and 2% sodium pyrophosphate (w/v)). The paper was washed five times for 5 min in 200 ml of wash and then washed for 1 min in 200 ml of distilled H2O and 1 min in 200 ml of 95% ethanol. The paper was allowed to dry, and bound 32P was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For expression in the yeast two-hybrid system, the coding regions of wild-type polymerase and all mutant polymerases that were successfully expressed in E. coli were cloned into the C-terminal coding region of a lexA-encoding “bait” plasmid (29Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Expression of these lexA-polymerase bait proteins was comparable to that of the wild-type lexA-polymerase fusion protein (data not shown; Ref. 14Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (14Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the permeabilized cell method of Miller (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C in medium containing 2% raffinose to A600 = 0.1/cm. Galactose was then added to 2% (w/v), and cells were incubated at 25 °C until they reached A600 = 0.3/cm, at which time the cells were harvested. Membranes containing 3AB were prepared basically according to the protocol of Lama et al. (20Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli (BL21) containing pKK3AB (20Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in LB with 150 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C toA660 = 0.5/cm. The cultures were then grown at 22 °C until they reached A660 = 0.75/cm, at which time they were induced with 0.5 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 11,000 × g at 4 °C (8500 rpm in a Beckman JA-14 rotor) for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 5% glycerol and harvested as described above. This wash step was repeated one additional time. The final pellet was frozen at −80 °C. The pellet was thawed and resuspended on ice in 10 ml/liter original culture of Buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). This suspension was lysed by passage through a chilled French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 40 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 9000 rpm at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 30 min (100,000 × g) in a Beckman SW-41Ti rotor at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended to 12.5 mg/ml protein in Buffer A and stored at −80 °C. Control membranes were prepared identically from cells harboring the pGEM vector. Ten μl of membranes (125 μg of total protein) was mixed with 30 μl of a preparation that contained 5 μm wild-type or mutant polymerase, diluted using the buffers from the final column of the purification (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15% glycerol, 0.5% octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and glycerol to 40% and 600 mm NaCl. The reaction was incubated on ice for 1 h and then incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was spun at 14,000 rpm (16,000 × g) at room temperature for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mmdithiothreitol). The membranes were collected by centrifugation as described above, and the pellet was resuspended in 8 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar), vortexed, and boiled for 4 min. The proteins were resolved on a 12.5% SDS gel (29:1, acrylamide:bis). The gel was stained with Sypro Red (Molecular Dynamics) diluted 1:5000 in 7.5% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. The gel was destained for 30 min in 7.5% acetic acid. Staining was visualized using the Molecular Dynamics Storm in red fluorescence mode. Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Wild-type and mutant polymerase preparations were adjusted to 20 μm polymerase, 50% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl using the buffers from the final column of the purification and glycerol. 30 μl of solution that contained 10 μl of 75% acetonitrile and 20 μl of column buffer supplemented to 4 m NaCl was added to 100 μl of polymerase. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. An aliquot (100 μl) of the mixture was dialyzed against 100 mm NaCl and 50% glycerol for 6 h. (Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Units; Pierce). Protein concentration was then adjusted to 10 μmpolymerase with dialysis buffer. Polymerase (10 μl) was then added to 40 μl of reaction buffer to final concentrations of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 8% glycerol, 140 μg/ml poly(A) (400 μm/nt), 200 μm 3B (VPg), 2 μm UTP, and 10 μCi/ml [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer. The products were resolved on a 12% (29:1, acrylamide:bis) Tris-tricine gel. The gel was dried onto 3MM Whatman paper and analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Analysis of the crystal structure of poliovirus 3D polymerase was performed using Swiss-PDB Viewer (Ref. 33Guex N. Peitsch M.S. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9554) Google Scholar; available at www.expasy.ch/spdbv/) using coordinates from Hansenet al. (26Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Images were rendered using POV-Ray freeware (available at www.povray.org). We predicted that if the genetic screen that identified the V391L mutation accurately identified the 3AB binding site on the poliovirus polymerase (14Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then polymerases that contained mutations in residues adjacent to Val391should display phenotypes similar to that of the V391L polymerase. Mutations were introduced into 14 additional residues surrounding Val391, as shown on the three-dimensional structure of polymerase (26Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) in Fig. 5A and summarized in TableI. For Asp358, Lys359, Glu369, Glu370, Lys375, Arg376, Phe377, Arg379, Glu382, His389, Pro393, and Lys395, codons that encode alanine were substituted for the wild-type codons (Table I). Mutational analyses of Asn424 (changed to Asp, His, and Tyr) and Met394 (changed to Thr) have been described previously, and the resulting viruses have been shown to be temperature-sensitive for RNA synthesis (34Burns C.C. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1992; 189: 568-582Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Barton D.J. Morasco B.J. Eisner-Smerage L. Collis P.S. Diamond S.E. Hewlett M.J. Virology. 1996; 217: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, the published mutations N424D, N424H, N424Y, and M394T were introduced at these positions. Because the R379A mutant polymerase exhibited decreased solubility, making it unsuitable for direct binding assays, an additional mutant polymerase, R379E, was created. Mutant polymerases D358A, K359A, E369A, K375A, F377A, R379A, R379E, E382A, V391L, M394T, K395A, and N424H were successfully expressed and purified. The effects of mutations in the putative 3AB-binding domain of poliovirus polymerase on its interactions with 3AB in the two-hybrid system are shown in Fig.2. Testing the effect of these mutations on the interaction of polymerase with known ligands in addition to 3AB provided controls for proper folding of the lexA-polymerase bait fusion protein. Those mutations that conferred a defect in polymerase binding to the 3AB “prey” but not to other preys (human Sam68 protein or other polymerase molecules) were considered to confer specific defects in 3AB binding (13Xiang W. Cuconati A. Hope D. Kirkegaard K. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36McBride A.E. Schlegel A. Kirkegaard K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 2296-2301Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mutations F377A, R379A, R379E, and V391L all caused specific defects in polymerase-3AB binding (Fig. 2, first two rows). However, mutations in flanking residues D358A, K359A, E369A, E370A, K375A, E382A, M394T, K395A, and N424Y had no significant effect on the interaction of polymerase with 3AB, other polymerase molecules, or Sam68 (Fig. 2). Therefore, Phe377, Arg379, and Val391 are likely to constitute at least part of the 3AB binding site, as summarized in Fig. 5B. To test the effect of mutations on the ability of the polymerase to bind 3AB outside of the context of a fusion protein, membranes that contained 3AB were used to recruit mutant and wild-type 3D polymerases from solution. E. coli membranes were prepared from cells that did or did not express plasmid-encoded 3AB. Equivalent amounts of these membranes were used as affinity matrices to recruit soluble polymerases from solution. Whereas expression of 3AB in eukaryotic systems has been reported (19Datta U. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4468-4477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Towner J.S. Mazanet M.M. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7191-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these expression levels are low (37Barco A. Carrasco L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), so that obtaining sufficient quantities from these systems to perform the analyses reported here would be difficult. As shown in Fig. 3A, the presence of 3AB in the membranes allowed the recruitment from solution of wild-type polymerase (lanes 2 and 3) and E369A mutant polymerase (lanes 5 and 6). However, recruitment was significantly disturbed by the R379E mutation (lanes 8 and 9), even though equivalent amounts of all polymerases were present in the reaction mixtures (lanes 10–12). These data and similar data for other mutant polymerases are quantified in Fig. 3B, where the amounts of wild-type and mutant polymerases recruited by the 3AB-containing membranes are compared for several independent experiments. Consistent with the results of the two-hybrid experiments, mutant polymerases R379E, V391L, and F377A all displayed reduced binding to the 3AB-containing membranes. In addition, E382A mutant polymerase displayed reduced binding, whereas none of the other mutant polymerases displayed significantly reduced interactions with membrane-associated 3AB. These data are summarized on the three-dimensional structure of the polymerase in Fig. 5C. The clustering of the residues in a hydrophobic pocket on the protein surface and the lack of apparent misfolding of the mutant polymerases argue that these residues identify a site of direct 3AB binding. It is not clear whether the 3AB binding site on poliovirus polymerase identified the binding site for 3B as well. However, available evidence (see “Introduction”) supports the hypothesis that important contacts for 3AB with polymerase are contained in the 3B sequences. In addition, the 3AB binding site identified by two-hybrid and membrane recruitment assays (Fig. 5,B and C) is close to the active site for phosphodiester bond formation (26Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), making the 3AB binding site an attractive candidate for the binding of the 3B sequences during uridylylation. To determine whether mutations in the binding sites for 3AB affect 3B uridylylation, 12 different mutant polymerases whose effects on the binding of 3AB had been defined (Figs. 2 and 3) and 2 mutant polymerases that contained mutations in the active site for polymerization (Y326A and D328A/D329A) were studied. Uridylylation of 3B was quantified during the initial, linear phase of the uridylylation reaction (data not shown), therefore giving a measure of the reaction rate. As can be seen from the direct labeling of 3B by α-[32P]UTP (Fig. 4,"

In the present study we demonstrate that PIP-5kin is essential for neurite remodeling, which is regulated by actin cytoskeletal reorganization in neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells. Overexpression of wild-type mouse PIP-5kin-α inhibits the neurite formation that is normally stimulated by serum depletion, whereas a lipid kinase-defective mutant of PIP-5kin-α, D266A, triggers neurite extension even in the presence of serum and blocks lysophosphatidic acid-induced neurite retraction. These results phenocopy those previously reported for the small GTPase RhoA and its effector p160 Rho-associated coiled coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK). However, the ROCK-specific inhibitor Y-27632 failed to block the inhibition by PIP-5kin-α of neurite extension, whereas D266A did block the neurite retraction induced by overexpression of ROCK. These results, taken together, suggest that PIP-5kin-α functions as a downstream effector for RhoA/ROCK to couple lysophosphatidic acid signaling to neurite retraction presumably through its product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

Axon guidance is a critical event in the establishment of neuronal networks during embryogenesis and is regulated by extracellular cues such as chemoattractants and chemorepellents, which are recognized by growth cones at the tips of axons (1.Keynes R.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). Axons extend toward chemoattractants and away from chemorepellents through mechanisms involving actin cytoskeletal reorganization in the growth cone (3.Lin C.H. Thompson C.A. Forscher P. Curr. Opin.

Recently accumulated evidence suggests that the Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) play crucial roles in reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton in neurons, thereby regulating the morphology of neurites and growth cones (5.Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 7.Kaibuchi K.

In mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rho prevents neurite formation (9.Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Evidence for this includes the findings that overexpression of ROCK as well as the active mutant of RhoA, RhoAV14, inhibits neurite formation in N1E-115 cells (16.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N.

Although the downstream pathways that link ROCK signaling to actin cytoskeletal reorganization remain to be clarified, myosin II and LIM kinase (LIMK) appear to be involved (18.Kimura K. Ito M.

ROCK leads to an increase in the phosphorylation level of myosin light chain by direct and indirect mechanisms (18.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J.

The indirect mechanism includes inactivation of myosin phosphatase by phosphorylation of its myosin binding subunit. Furthermore, the ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain has been reported to be involved in LPA-induced neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells (16.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y.

ROCK also directly phosphorylates LIMK and thereby activates it, which in turn phosphorylates the actin-associated protein cofilin (20.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A.

Recently it has been reported that semaphorin 3A increases and then subsequently decreases the phosphorylation level of cofilin at collapsing growth cones (24.Aizawa H. Wakatsuki S. Ishii A.

Although myosin II and LIMK are required participants in the ROCK-mediated repulsion, activated myosin II or LIMK alone do not completely mimic ROCK-mediated effects in this system (16.Amano M.

An additional ROCK effector candidate would be phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP-5kin), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at the D-5 position of the inositol ring to generate the versatile signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (26.Loijens J.C.

The potential relevance of this candidate is suggested by the following reports: 1) the PIP-5kin product, PI(4,5)P2, reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton through direct interaction with actin-associated proteins (29.Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Irvine R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); 2) overexpression of PIP-5kin in COS-7 and CV1 cells promotes the formation of short actin fibers and robust actin stress fibers, respectively (32.Shibasaki Y.

Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and this group have reported that the small GTPase ARF directly activates PIP-5kin in a GTP-dependent manner (35.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), Rho and its effector ROCK also directly or indirectly activate PIP-5kin (37.Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 38.Oude Weernink P.A. Schulte P. Guo Y. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Haverland S. Voss M. Schmidt M. Mayr G.W. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These observations led us to speculate that PIP-5kin is also a component of the signaling pathway from Rho/ROCK to repulsive reactions in neuronal cells. Because the Rho/ROCK pathway plays a key role in neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells as well as in growth cone collapse in primary cultured neurons (11.Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), N1E-115 cells would appear to be a good model for the analysis of axon guidance. To examine possible PIP-5kin involvement in neurite remodeling in this study we overexpressed wild type and a lipid kinase-defective mutant of PIP-5kin-α in N1E-115 cells and analyzed the effects on cell morphology and LPA-induced neurite retraction. The results obtained indicate that PIP-5kin-α at least in part functions as a downstream effector for RhoA/ROCK to couple it to neurite retraction. pcDNA3-Myc-mouse PIP-5kin-α was constructed as previously described (35.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). A cDNA for the lipid kinase-deficient mutant D266A (details in the text) was constructed using a PCR-based strategy and subcloned into pcDNA3-Myc and pcDNA3-HA vectors (a generous gift of Dr. Nakayama). pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 and pCAG-Myc-ROCK were generous gifts of Drs. K. Kaibuchi and S. Narumiya, respectively. Mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). To analyze by immunofluorescence microscopy cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 4 × 104 cells per 3.5-cm dish, cultured over-night, and then transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). For analysis of the effects of PIP-5kin-α and its mutant D266A on cell morphology, transfected cells were further cultured in the absence or presence of FCS for 18 or 48 h. To analyze the effects of D266A on LPA-induced neurite retraction and those of Y-27632 on the actions of RhoAV14, ROCK, and PIP-5kin-α, transfected cells cultured in the absence of FCS for 18 h were treated with 1 μm LPA (Sigma) for 10 min and 10 μm Y-27632 for 48 h, respectively. Cells treated as described above were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as previously described (35.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The cells were then imunostained for Myc-tagged and HA-tagged proteins using monoclonal mouse anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz) and monoclonal rat anti-HA (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibodies, respectively, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-mouse and anti-rat IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory), respectively. Tubulin and F-actin were visualized using a Cy3-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody (TUB2.1, Sigma) and rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes), respectively. The immunofluorescently stained cells were imaged using an immunofluorescence microscope (Axiovert S100, Zeiss). The cell morphology of 100–150 cells was scored as follows: round, rounded cells without neurites; flat, flattened cells without neurites; neurite, cells with at least one process greater than the cell diameter. The data presented are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Myc-PIP-5kin-α and Myc-D266A were transfected in N1E-115 cells and overexpressed for 18 h in the presence of FCS as described above, except that the cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody affinity resin (9E10, Santa Cruz) after lysis in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifugation of the lysate as previously described (Honda et al., Ref. 35.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates, which contained comparable amounts of PIP-5kin-α and D266A, were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 μm phosphatidic acid, 50 μm PI(4)P, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/assay). [32P]PI(4,5)P2 produced by the incorporation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) into PI(4)P (Sigma) was quantitated as previously reported (35.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells are spherically shaped in the presence of serum, but when deprived of serum they become flat and then form neurites. When wild type PIP-5kin-α was overexpressed in these cells, neurite formation induced by serum depletion was inhibited, and the cells retained their spherical shapes, whereas GFP-expressing and non-transfected control cells flattened and formed neurites (Fig. 1, A and C). To examine whether PIP5-kin α lipid kinase activity was essential for this effect we generated D266A, a PIP-5kin-α mutant in which Ala was substituted for a presumably critical Asp in the putative ATP and PI(4)P binding site (40.Rao V.D. Misra S. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1998; 94: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In vitro lipid kinase analysis of recombinant D266A revealed that it was inactive as anticipated (Fig. 1 B). When overexpressed, D266A failed to interfere with the cell flattening and neurite extension induced by serum depletion (Fig. 1, A and C), demonstrating that the lipid kinase activity of PIP-5kin-α is essential for this effect. In fact, neurite formation by the D266A-overexpressing cells was modestly but significantly enhanced over that of the GFP-expressing control cells (Fig. 1 C), possibly caused by the inhibition of endogenous PIP-5kin activity and suggesting possibly that there is a basal level of PIP-5kin activity that opposes neurite formation at all times. These results, taken together, provide evidence that elevating PIP-5kin-α activity signals N1E-115 cells to remain spherical and that this overrides opposing neurite formation signaling pathways. The requirement for endogenous Rho and ROCK in preventing neurite formation when serum is present has been well documented (for example, Refs. 17.Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar and 41.Jalink K. van-Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The observation above of neurite formation being enhanced by the expression of an inactive and potentially dominant negative PIP-5kin suggested that this might also be the case for PIP-5kin as well. To test this we examined whether overexpression of the lipid kinase-defective mutant D266A in N1E-115 cells would result in neurite formation even in the presence of serum. Cells overexpressing D266A formed extremely extended bipolar neurites even in the presence of serum (Fig. 2,A and B), demonstrating that D266A functions as a dominant negative mutant and that endogenous PIP-5kin activated by serum stimulation acts normally to block neurite formation. Although the extended bipolar neurites formed in D266A-overexpressing cells appeared somewhat different in morphology than the neurites found in control cells in the absence of serum (Fig. 1 A), the control cell neurites became longer and bipolar if the cells were cultured for longer periods of time (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that D266A may also be promoting more rapid maturation of the neurites formed. In D266A-overexpressing cells, about 80% of total cells formed neurites when cultured in the absence of FCS (Fig. 1 C), whereas only 50% of cells did so in the presence of FCS (Fig. 2 B). This difference may reflect the fact that the variable level of expression achieved for the D266A mutant did not suffice to override the endogenous inhibition of neurite formation in all transfected cells when serum signaling pathways were activated. After formation by N1E-115 cells neurites can be triggered to retract in response to the bioactive phospholipid LPA, which is present in abundance in serum (42.Suidan H.S. Stone S.R. Hemmings B.A. Monard D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 363-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 43.Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Postma F.R. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H.

Recent reports have shown that LPA stimulation activates PIP-5kin-α in endothelial cells and in NIH-3T3 cells (45.Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 46.Park S.J. Itoh T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4781-4787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These observations, taken together with the results described above, raised the possibility that PIP-5kin-α is also involved in LPA-induced neurite retraction. To explore this, we tested the effects of D266A expression on LPA-induced neurite retraction. Whereas the neurites formed by GFP-transfected and non-transfected control cells cultured in the absence of serum retracted in response to LPA stimulation, overexpression of D266A blocked the response (Fig. 3), suggesting that PIP-5kin-α activity is essential for LPA-induced neurite retraction. In N1E-115 cells the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK play crucial roles in the retention of spherical cell shapes in the presence of serum and in the retraction of extended neurites as triggered by LPA (9.Kozma R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The effects of PIP-5kin-α described above phenocopy those of RhoA and ROCK, raising three possibilities for mechanisms through which PIP-5kin-α might regulate neurite remodeling in N1E-115 cells: 1) PIP-5kin-α is an upstream regulator of RhoA/ROCK; 2) it functions as a downstream effector for RhoA/ROCK; or 3) it regulates neurite remodeling independently of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. To investigate these possibilities we first tested the effects of Y-27632 (a specific inhibitor of ROCK (47.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar)) on the ability of PIP-5kin-α to promote spherical cell shapes despite serum deprivation in comparison to its effects on RhoAV14 (the constitutively active RhoA) and ROCK. Consistent with a previous report (17.Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), Y-27632 inhibited the effects of RhoAV14 and ROCK, resulting in the formation of neurites in cells despite overexpression of these proteins (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the inhibitor was without effect on the PIP-5kin-α inhibition of neurite formation (Fig. 4 A). These results rule out the first possibility that PIP-5kin-α is an upstream regulator of RhoA/ROCK. The second and third possibilities described above were next examined by investigating whether D266A could interfere with the downstream actions promoted by ROCK. Co-expression of D266A with ROCK significantly blocked the ability of ROCK to make serum-deprived cells stay spherical, resulting in the formation of extremely extended bipolar neurites similar to those formed in cells transfected with D266A alone (Fig. 4, B and C). However, the blockade was partial; only 35% of the co-transfected cells extended neurites, whereas in cells overexpressing D266A alone about 80 and 50% extended neurites in the absence and presence of FCS, respectively (Figs. 1 C and 2 B, respectively). This may have occurred for technical reasons because co-expression can lead to lower levels of expression (making the D266A ineffective in some cells) or may suggest that regulation by ROCK of neurite remodeling is partially mediated by other signaling molecules such as myosin II and LIMK (16, 25; see below). Nevertheless, these results exclude the third possibility that PIP-5kin-α regulates neurite remodeling independently of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. Taken together, we conclude that PIP-5kin-α at least in part functions as a downstream effector for ROCK in the signaling pathway coupling to neurite retraction. This notion is also supported by the observation by Oude Weernink et al. that ROCK stimulates PIP-5kin activity in cell lysates (38.Oude Weernink P.A. Schulte P. Guo Y. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); however, it remains imprecisely defined whether the regulation of PIP-5kin-α activity by ROCK is direct or indirect. It has been reported that although the activation of myosin II and LIMK is involved in the repulsive responses downstream of Rho/ROCK, it does not suffice to trigger the repulsive events on its own (16.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25.Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PIP-5kin-α alone in neurite-bearing N1E-115 cells with the adenovirus expression system (similar to the activation of myosin II and LIMK) failed to trigger neurite retraction (data not shown) unlike RhoAV14 and ROCK (9.Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 48.Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These results, taken together with the findings described above, suggest that PIP-5kin-α is essential but not sufficient for neurite retraction and thus that cooperation of PIP-5kin-α with the other ROCK effectors (myosin II and LIMK) is required for the Rho/ROCK-mediated repulsive reactions. Nonetheless, the findings obtained in this study provide evidence for a novel function of PIP-5kin-α in the regulation of neurite remodeling. Rho/ROCK regulation of the repulsive response by cultured neuronal cell lines and primary neurons is attributable to the regulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization (5.Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 7.Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M.

The molecular mechanism by which these signaling molecules regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization, however, remains unclear. Because in the present study we demonstrated that PIP-5kin-α at least in part functions as a novel downstream effector for ROCK to couple the LPA signal to neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells, actin cytoskeletal reorganization by Rho/ROCK might be mediated by PIP-5kin-α. Furthermore, it is most likely that the regulation by PIP-5kin-α of actin cytoskeletal reorganization is mediated by its product PI(4,5)P2, which has been implicated in the reorganization of actin filament structures through the actin-associated proteins such as profilin, gelsolin, and α-actinin (29.Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Irvine R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 49.Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 50.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 51.Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The PIP-5kin-α effect through PI(4,5)P2 on the repulsive response of neurites seems to be attributable to its ability to polymerize actin and stabilize the formed F-actin, because in PIP-5kin-α-overexpressing cells intense staining of F-actin was observed at the plasma membrane of the rounded cell bodies (data not shown). This assumption is consistent with the finding by Raucheret al. with laser-based optical tweezers that PI(4,5)P2 regulates actin cytoskeleton-plasma membrane adhesion to modulate membrane tension, which is critical for membrane dynamics and cell morphology (52.Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). From these findings we propose that stabilization of cortical actin filaments by PI(4,5)P2produced by the action of PIP-5kin-α at restricted sites in the neuronal plasma membrane increases the membrane tension and thereby triggers neurite retraction. Although we have proposed a simple explanation for the effects of PIP-5kin-α on the repulsive response of neurites through actin polymerization and stabilization of formed actin filaments, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be extremely complicated. It has been reported that depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin D stimulates neurite outgrowth in cultured neuronal cell lines (including Neuro 2a and PC12 cells) and primary neurons (53.Joshi H.C. Chu D. Buxbaum R.E. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 54.Spero D.A. Roisen F.J.

Commun. 2000; 278: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 56.Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of actin-depolymerizing factor in rat cortical and spinal cord neurons has been reported to stimulate neurite outgrowth (57.Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2459-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the idea that depolymerization of actin filaments initiates neurite formation and extension and conversely that actin polymerization triggers neurite retraction. On the other hand, however, it has been reported that chemorepellent semaphorin 3A, which induces growth cone collapse and subsequent axonal growth arrest, induces actin depolymerization (58.Fan J. Mansfield S.G. Redmond T. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Raper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,59.Fritsche J. Reber B.F. Schindelholz B. Bandtlow C.E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, at present it is controversial as to which type of actin cytoskeletal reorganization (depolymerization or polymerization) regulates which type of neurite remodeling (neurite formation or retraction). A possible explanation for this apparent contradiction has been proposed by Bradke and Dotti, explaining that the neurite formation and retraction signals include actin polymerization and depolymerization in different places within the growth cone (60.Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the report that F-actin concentration dramatically decreases in the leading edge of growth cone in response to semaphorin 3A, although at the center of growth cone it is relatively unchanged (58.Fan J. Mansfield S.G. Redmond T. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Raper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 59.Fritsche J. Reber B.F. Schindelholz B. Bandtlow C.E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alternatively, temporal reorganization of actin filaments may be critical for the type of neurite remodeling triggered. Further studies on spatial and temporal analysis of actin polymerization and depolymerization will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms through which neurite formation and retraction are regulated.

Recent identification of several Caenorhabditis elegans mutants deficient in GAG biosynthesis and transport has demonstrated a critical role for GAGs in growth and development (13.Herman T.

Red enhanced yellow fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin high performance liquid chromatography thymidine 5′-diphosphate uridine 5′-diphosphate UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase endoplasmic reticulum Proteoglycans are comprised of a core protein covalently connected to GAG chains. Multiple different GAG chains exist, including chondrotin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate/heparin. While the disaccharide repeat units comprising the polymeric chains differ, each of these shows a common form of covalent attachment to the core protein. Specifically, they attach to a serine of the core protein by a tetrasaccharide that serves as a primer for polysaccharide growth. This tetrasaccharide comprises a xylose (which is O-linked to serine), galactose, galactose, and glucuronate (Fig. 1). Participation in the GAG linkage appears to be the sole established function of xylose in vertebrate biology. Xylose is formed by the decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronate to UDP-xylose (Fig. 1). The UDP group is removed by xylosyltransferase, which directly attaches xylose to serine (16.Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity responsible for the formation of UDP-xylose via decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronate has been characterized for over 30 years. However, despite its importance as a regulatory and possibly rate-limiting enzyme in GAG biosynthesis, UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase (UGD) has been difficult to purify and clone, presumably because of its very low abundance in most tissues. Very recently a fungal form of the enzyme has been cloned (17.Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate Akt (protein kinase B) protein-binding partners/substrates, we identified UGD as an Akt-interacting protein. In the present study, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of UGD in mammalian tissues and identify a selective localization to the Golgi. Full-length rat Akt was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from adult rat brain total RNA. Utilizing PCR-based mutagenesis we constructed a triple mutant activated, kinase-dead Akt (Akt*KD, T308D, S473D, and K179A) (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

Wild type Akt, activated Akt (Akt*, T308D, S473D), kinase-dead Akt (AktKD, K179A), and activated kinase-dead Akt (Akt*KD) were evaluated for expression and enzymatic activity by GST- or HA-tagged fusion protein plasmid expression in HEK293T cells. The activity characterization agreed with previously published data (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 19.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Akt*KD was subcloned as bait into yeast expression vector pPC97 containing the GAL4 binding domain and used to screen a rat hippocampal and cortical cDNA library in pPC86 expressing the GAL4 transactivation domain (20.Li X.J.

The plasmids were introduced sequentially by LiAc-mediated transformation (21.Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) into the PJ69 yeast strain. A total of 1.0 × 107 independent clones were screened. Positive interactions were identified by selecting for histidine and adenine prototrophy. Positive clones were further evaluated for β-galactosidase expression on plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Plasmids rescued from positive clones were retransformed into the HF7C yeast strain (CLONTECH) and once again selected for histidine prototrophy and evaluated for β-galactosidase expression by nitrocellulose filter lift assays (21.Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). A rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) was screened per the manufacturer's protocol. The probe was generated from the UGD yeast two-hybrid fragment by random priming (Invitrogen) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Full-length UGD was subsequently subcloned into pCMV-HA and pCMV-GST vectors. UDP-galactose-4-epimerase activity was assayed essentially as described previously (22.Ng W.G. Donnell G.N. Hodgman J.E. Bergren W.R. Nature. 1967; 214: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Modifications included the use of 100 μg of lysates from GST-UGD transformed bacteria and 0.011 units of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Sigma) per a final reaction volume of 500 μl. The assay described by Varaet al. (23.Vara J.A. Hutchinson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14992-14995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was modified by the use of unlabeled TDP-glucose as substrate and NaB3H4 for the reduction of a 4-keto reaction product. Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography on aluminum-backed silica plates with a solvent mixture of pyridine, ethyl acetate, and water 26:66:8 (v/v/v). Dried plates were visualized by autoradiography and stained by spraying with a solution of 10% H2SO4 in ethanol followed by heating for 20 min at 120 °C. Alternatively, the plates were scraped and assayed by scintillation counting. We also assayed for a dehydratase product spectrophotometrically as described previously (24.Ma Y. Stern R.J. Scherman M.S. Vissa V.D. Yan W. Jones V.C. Zhang F. Franzblau S.G. Lewis W.H. McNeil M.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

Decarboxylase activity was assayed as described previously (25.John K.V. Schutzbach J.S. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8013-8017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from GST-UGD-transformed bacteria or alternatively from transfected HEK293T cells, 2 mm NAD+, and 750 μmunlabeled UDP-glucuronate (Sigma) were incubated in the presence of 0.2 μCi of uniformly labeled [glucuronyl-U-14C]UDP-glucuronate (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Where indicated, cell lysates from untransfected HEK293T were used alone or in combination with lysates from transfected cells for activity assays. Reaction buffer consisted of 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter EDTA, and 5 ml/liter β-mercaptoethanol. Detection of UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase activity was based on the detection of released14CO2. During the reaction, released14CO2 was trapped in an inner tube containing 0.2 ml of ethanolamine and 2-methoxyethanol, 1:2 (v/v). Released14CO2 was then determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Enzyme reactions for HPLC analysis were conducted as described above utilizing 25,000–50,000 cpm of uniformly labeled [glucuronyl-U-14C]UDP-glucuronate. Uniformly labeled [xylose-U-14C]UDP-xylose was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. Assays were quenched with ice-cold perchloric acid and neutralized as described previously (26.Shears S. Signalling by Inositides: A Practical Approach (The Practical Approach Series). IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). Where indicated, the enzyme was heat-inactivated by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C. HPLC analysis of reaction products and standard was conducted using a Zorbax SAX column (Hewlett-Packard) that was eluted with a gradient generated by mixing solution A (1 mmNa2EDTA) and buffer B (solution A plus 1.3 m(NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.85 with H3PO4) as follows: 0–5 min, 0% buffer B; 5–65 min, 0–30% buffer B; 65–75 min, 100% buffer B; 75–90 min, 0% buffer B. The fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and counted using 5 ml of Ultima-Flo AP LCS mixture (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Enzyme reactions were conducted as described above with 1 mg of lysates from GST-UGD-transformed bacteria. Alternatively, the enzyme was heat-inactivated by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were desalted and prepared for mass spectrometry analysis of nucleotide sugars by charcoal adsorption and elution as has been described previously (27.Mandeles S. Kammen H.O. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 17: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted in the elution solvent (ethanol/water/concentrated ammonia, 600/400/6.5 (v/v/v)) so that a 30 μm concentration of original UDP-glucuronate (as calculated from starting material) was obtained. This was then directly injected into a PE SCIEX API 150EX mass spectrometer with an electrospray source at a flow rate of 9 μl/min. Negative ion spectra were obtained. A multiple tissue Northern blot membrane (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of mRNA/lane was hybridized using Expresshyb (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's instructions with a probe generated from the yeast two-hybrid fragment by random priming (Invitrogen) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Multiple cell line blots were prepared from cell lysates using Trizol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Each lane contained 20 μg of total RNA. Equal amounts of ribosomal RNA and β-actin were present in each lane. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed (after 48 h) in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaOV4, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm microcystin. Lysates were briefly sonicated, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant used in activity assays. DH5α subcloning efficiency Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) were transformed with a GST-UGD plasmid, and fusion protein expression was induced as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were sonicated, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant used in activity assays or snap-frozen and kept at −80 °C for up to 3 months without loss of activity. HEK293T cells were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with GST-UGD and HA-AKT, HA-AKTKD, HA-AKT*, or an unrelated fusion protein designated HA-X. Similar experiments were performed with HA-UGD and the corresponding GST-Akt plasmids (data not shown). After 48 h, cells were lysed in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. After centrifugation, 1.0 mg of the supernatants was incubated with a 50% slurry of prepared glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at 4.0 °C with slow rotation. Samples were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). The agarose was resuspended in sample loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies. Anti-GST (Sigma) and anti-HA (Covance) primary antibodies were both used at dilutions of 1:2000. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against GST-tagged UGD yeast two-hybrid fragment (Covance). The antibody was affinity-purified as described previously (28.Bar-Peled M. Raikhel N.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed with a primary antibody dilution of 1:1000. Brains from five male adult rats were homogenized in 100 ml of 0.32 m sucrose with a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g to give pellet (P1) and supernatant (S1). S1 was centrifuged for 15 min at 9200 × g to give pellet (P2) and supernatant (S2). S2 was centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g to give pellet (P3) and supernatant (S3). The P2 fraction was resuspended in 3 ml of 0.32 m sucrose and hypotonically lysed in 27 ml of ice-cold water. Lysate was homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Hepes (2 m; pH 7.4) was added to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the sample was centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g to give pellet (LP1) and supernatant (LS1). LS1 was centrifuged for 90 min at 165,000 × g to give pellet (LP2) and supernatant (LS2). Protein concentration of the fractions was determined, and 12 μg of protein from each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with a total of 2 μg of pDsRed-UGD and either pEYFP-Golgi or pEYFP-ER (CLONTECH) using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). pEYFP-Golgi encodes a fusion protein consisting of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and a sequence encoding the NH2-terminal 81 amino acids of human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase; pEYFP-ER encodes a fusion protein consisting of EYFP, the ER targeting sequence of calreticulin, and the ER retrieval sequence KDEL. Cells were grown on four-well glass microscope slides and were processed for enzyme localization studies 48 h after transfection. Photomicrographs shown in Fig. 10 were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope and captured with Openlab (Improvision). In an effort to identify protein-binding partners of the signaling protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B), we utilized a yeast two-hybrid analysis with an activated, but kinase-dead, form of Akt as bait. We identified two interactors, one of which remains uncharacterized. The other interactor, which we determined to be UGD, was identified six times in the two-hybrid screen. A rat brain cDNA library was screened utilizing the UGD yeast two-hybrid fragment as probe. Four interacting library fragments were recovered. A full-length cDNA sequence of UGD was assembled from two of the rat brain cDNA fragments, the yeast two-hybrid fragment (encompassing amino acids 32–420), and database analysis (Fig. 2). The starting methionine was assigned to the first in-frame AUG codon preceded by an upstream stop codon. The full-length open reading frame of UGD contains 1260 nucleotides coding for a protein of 420 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47 kDa (Fig. 2). Data base analysis revealed varying homology with putative and established UDP-glucuronate decarboxylases, nucleotide sugar epimerases, and nucleotide sugar dehydratases. Based on homology with UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, regions of UGD were identified that may be important in substrate and NAD+ binding. Specifically, UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and UGD contain a critical threonine or serine required for binding to the 4-hydroxyl group of the sugar substrates. Also, a conserved YXXXK motif for binding to NAD+ is present in both UGD and UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (29.Thoden J.B. Hegeman A.D. Wesenberg G. Chapeau M.C. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Data base analysis suggested that UGD is highly conserved across a wide evolutionary range from plants to mammals (Fig. 3). Hydropathy plot analysis (30.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar) of the UGD protein indicated a single putative transmembrane domain at residues 20–38. Consistent with a type II transmembrane protein topololgy, the analysis predicted a short NH2-terminal segment most likely protruding into cytoplasm and a longer luminal carboxyl-terminal domain. Such a topology also exists in the putative homologs of UGD in Mus musculus, C. elegans, andDrosophila melanogaster but not in Filobasidiella neoformans or Pisum sativum.Figure 3CLUSTAL-W alignment of UGD (top) and putative orthologs in M. musculus(GenBank™ accession number AAK85410), C. elegans (GenBank™ accession number T15892),D. melanogaster (GenBank™ accession number AAF50474), F. neoformans (GenBank™accession number AAK59981), and P. sativum(GenBank™ accession numberBAB40967).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on sequence similarities, we assayed our cloned, expressed protein for UDP-galactose-4-epimerase activity, dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase activity, and UGD activity. We assayed for epimerase activity by spectrophotometrically monitoring the production of UDP-glucose from UDP-galactose via coupling to NAD+ in the presence of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (22.Ng W.G. Donnell G.N. Hodgman J.E. Bergren W.R. Nature. 1967; 214: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our clone failed to demonstrate any epimerase activity in this assay (data not shown). We examined dehydratase activity (conversion of dTDP-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose) in two ways. First, we reduced the 4-keto product of the reaction with tritiated NaBH4 and separated the reaction mixture with silica TLC. With direct visualization, autoradiography, and scintillation counting, we were unable to detect production of any tritiated, 6-deoxy reaction products by our clone. We also spectrophotometrically assayed for the production of the 4-keto product (24.Ma Y. Stern R.J. Scherman M.S. Vissa V.D. Yan W. Jones V.C. Zhang F. Franzblau S.G. Lewis W.H. McNeil M.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31.Zarkowsky H. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4750-4756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but were unable to detect any product in the presence of our clone (data not shown). We monitored UGD activity in three ways. Employing uniformly labeled [glucuronyl-U-14C]UDP-glucuronate, we measured the evolution of 14CO2 (25.John K.V. Schutzbach J.S. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8013-8017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay we detected robust, dose-dependent activity of our GST-tagged clone in transiently transfected HEK293T cell lysates (Fig. 4). Glutathione precipitation and thorough washing confirmed that the activity resulted from our clone (data not shown). This activity obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics with aK m near 1 mm (data not shown). As the starting material was uniformly labeled on the glucuronyl moiety, we could not assert definitively that the evolved CO2originated from the decarboxylation of the 6-carbon. To further characterize the biosynthesis of UDP-xylose by our clone, we incubated GST-tagged clone with uniformly labeled [glucuronyl-U-14C] UDP-glucuronate and separated the reaction products by HPLC. In the presence of boiled GST-tagged enzyme (Fig. 5 C) or an unrelated GST-tagged protein (data not shown), only a single sharp peak appeared with an elution time corresponding to that of the starting material. However, incubation with our native, tagged clone resulted in the appearance of a second sharp peak (Fig. 5 A) with an elution time identical to that of authentic uniformly labeled [xylose-U-14C]UDP-xylose (Fig. 5 B). To obtain definitive evidence that UDP-xylose was the product of our assay, we performed electrospray mass spectrometry. Negative ion spectra of reaction mixtures in the presence of heat-inactivated enzyme (Fig. 6 B) only showed peaks corresponding to UDP-glucuronate ([M-H]− = 579.3), NAD+ ([M-H]− = 662.3), and a NAD+ degradation product ([M-H]− = 540; loss of niacinamide). In the presence of our putative UGD, an additional peak appeared corresponding to the mass of UDP-xylose ([M-H]− = 535.2) (Fig. 6 A). Minor peaks were evident corresponding to the masses of mono- and disodiated UDP-glucuronate and UDP-xylose.Figure 5HPLC analysis of UGD reaction products.

In HEK293T cells transfected with GST-UGD and HA-Akt or with HA-UGD and GST-Akt, pull-down of GST-Akt brought down HA-UGD (data not shown) and pull-down of GST-UGD brought down HA-Akt, while an unrelated protein did not co-precipitate with UGD (Fig. 7). We wondered whether there are any functional interactions between Akt and UGD. We have been unable to demonstrate alterations in Akt activity with UGD transfection in basal, serum-starved, or insulin-like growth factor-stimulated HEK293T cells (data not shown). Although UGD does not contain the canonical Akt phosphorylation motif (RXRXXS/TX) present in many known Akt substrates (32.Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility of Akt phosphorylation of UGD. We were unable to detect phosphorylation of GST-UGD by activated HA-Akt in an in vitro kinase reaction nor did we detect any influence of activated HA-Akt on UGD activity (data not shown). Northern analysis revealed the highest densities of UGD mRNA in heart, brain, and testes (Fig. 8 A). Substantial levels were also evident in kidney, liver, and lung with much lower densities in spleen and skeletal muscle. Northern analysis of transformed cell lines revealed substantial levels of UGD mRNA in 3T3, RBE7, and PC12 cell lines but little to no transcript in 293T, HeLa, COS-1, Jurkat, or 9L glioma cell lines (Fig. 8 B). In all of these tissues and cell lines we detected a single transcript of about 2.1 kb, suggesting that there is no significant alternative splicing. For immunochemical studies we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GST-UGD. The antibody recognized a band of 47 kDa in transiently transfected cells (data not shown) as well as in native rat tissues (Fig. 9). Additionally, in all tissues an additional band of about 70 kDa was evident (data not shown). Kidney samples contained a second 38-kDa cross-reactive band recognized by the antibody. Preabsorption of purified antibody with GST-UGD eliminated the 47-kDa band in all tissues. Preabsorption of purified antibody with GST alone or agarose beads did not alter the 47-kDa band (Fig. 9 A). UGD protein was most enriched in kidney, liver, and brain with negligible staining in Western blots of heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, lung, and testes (Fig. 9 B). This pattern differed from the distribution of UGD mRNA, which was highly concentrated in testes and heart (Fig. 8 A). Within the central nervous system, UGD protein distribution varied with the highest amounts in the cerebellum, thalamus, and spinal cord and much lower levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, and olfactory bulb (Fig. 9 B). The addition of xylose in the biosynthesis of GAGs begins in the late endoplasmic reticulum and/or at the ER-to-Golgi interface and continues in the Golgi (33.Nuwayhid N. Glaser J.H. Johnson J.C.

Furthermore, UGD activity has been found in chick chondrocytes to co-localize with xylosyltransferase activity in subcellular fractions (35.Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the intracellular localization of UGD, we conducted subcellular fractionations (Fig. 9 C). UGD protein was predominantly particulate with highest densities in the crude microsomal fraction of whole brain (P3). To assess localization to synaptic vesicle fractions and other membranes within nerve terminals, we lysed the synaptosome-nerve terminal containing P2 fraction, which provides the LP1 (lysate) and LS1 (lysate supernatant fractions). Centrifugation of LS1 yielded a supernatant LS2 fraction and a crude synaptic vesicle fraction, LP2. UGD was detected in LP2 and LS2 but not in LP1 fractions. To assess the intracellular localization of UGD in intact cells, we conducted histochemistry. Because of the low levels of endogenous UGD, we were unable to conduct immunohistochemistry for native UGD. Accordingly, we transfected HEK293 cells with DsRed2-labeled UGD and compared its localization with co-transfected EYFP-ER and EYFP-Golgi, fusion protein markers for the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, respectively. We observed intense staining for UGD in the perinuclear Golgi (Fig. 10). In the present study, we present the molecular cloning and characterization of mammalian UGD. UGD is evolutionarily highly conserved with 75–80% amino acid sequence identity and 90% similarity between plants and mammals. Although we discovered UGD based on its binding to Akt, we have failed to thus far identify any major regulatory interactions between the two proteins. Data base analysis revealed similarity of UGD to UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and TDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase. These similarities may be based on properties shared by UGD and these other enzymes. These enzymes all employ NAD+ as a co-factor and bind UDP or TDP sugars. All of them are hypothesized to share an initial catalytic step involving oxidation of the 4-carbon of the sugar to a ketone. This is the sole function of the sugar dehydratase. The epimerase asymmetrically reduces the 4-ketone to stereospecifically produce the C-4 epimer, while UGD is thought to proceed through β-decarboxylation of the 6-carbon followed by sterospecific reduction of the 4-carbon (28.Bar-Peled M. Raikhel N.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29.Thoden J.B. Hegeman A.D. Wesenberg G. Chapeau M.C. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation and histochemical studies localized UGD primarily to the Golgi. Consistent with this, hydropathy plot analysis of the protein sequence indicated a putative type II transmembrane topology common to Golgi-localized proteins (36.Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Previous studies of UGD activity in cultured chick chondrocytes as well as mouse mast cell tumors have localized the activity to the particulate cell fractions (35.Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M.

Studies of xylose biosynthesis and xylosylation in intact cells, which monitor transformation of UDP-glucuronate to UDP-xylose in permeabilized chick chondrocytes, indicate predominant localizations to the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (34.Vertel B.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our hydropathy analysis, these studies evaluated the possible luminal or cytosolic orientation of membrane-associated enzyme activity by monitoring trypsin sensitivity and found UGD activity was lost in the presence of trypsin only when organelle membranes were disrupted (35.Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While UDP-xylose transport into the Golgi has been described (33.Nuwayhid N. Glaser J.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested to be the result of nonspecific nucleotide sugar transport associated with other nucleotide sugar transporters (35.Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to our cloned sequence and its mammalian, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster homologs, hydropathy plot analysis of homologous sequences of plant and fungal origin showed no predicted membrane spanning domains; consistent with this, previous studies of plant and fungal UGD activity have found them to be associated with soluble cell fractions (39.Ankel H. Feingold D.S. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2468-2475Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40.Ankel H. Feingold D.S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, the recent cloning of UGD from the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans found the expressed enzyme to localize primarily to soluble cell fractions (17.Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The enzymes crucial for GAG biosynthesis and their importance for proper growth and differentiation have been well characterized inC. elegans (13.Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Screening for mutations that interfere with this process led to the identification of eight specific “squashed vulva” (SQV) genes (14.Herman T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Seven of these eight genes have been cloned. Notably, all are involved in GAG biosynthesis or transport (13.Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15.Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc.

C. elegans genetic map data base analysis reveals a close proximity of a UGD ortholog to SQV-1 on chromosome IV. It is likely that UGD and SQV-1 are identical. If so, this would imply a critical role for UGD in embryonic development.

https://openalex.org/W1980837534,"Like most RNA polymerases, the polymerase of double-strand RNA bacteriophage φ6 (φ6pol) is capable of primer-independent initiation. Based on the recently solved φ6pol initiation complex structure, a four-amino acid-long loop (amino acids 630–633) has been suggested to stabilize the first two incoming NTPs through stacking interactions with tyrosine, Tyr630. A similar loop is also present in the hepatitis C virus polymerase, another enzyme capable of de novo initiation. Here, we use a series of φ6pol mutants to address the role of this element. As predicted, mutants at the Tyr630 position are inefficient in initiation de novo. Unexpectedly, when the loop is disordered by changing Tyr630-Lys631-Trp632 to GSG, φ6pol becomes a primer-dependent enzyme, either extending complementary oligonucleotide or, when the template 3′ terminus can adopt a hairpin-like conformation, utilizing a “copy-back” initiation mechanism. In contrast to the wild-type φ6pol, the GSG mutant does not require high GTP concentration for its optimal activity. These findings suggest a general model for the initiation ofde novo RNA synthesis.

In contrast to the wild-type φ6pol, the GSG mutant does not require high GTP concentration for its optimal activity. These findings suggest a general model for the initiation ofde novo RNA synthesis. Enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids can be initiated using two distinct mechanisms. All DNA and some RNA polymerases are strictly primer-dependent. These enzymes add nucleotides to the free hydroxyl group of an appropriate polynucleotide or protein primer. In contrast, most RNA polymerases initiate RNA synthesis de novo, that is without a primer (1.Buck K.W. Adv. Virus. Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kao C.C. Singh P. Ecker D.J. Virology. 2001; 287: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this case, the 3′-OH group of the first NTP molecule acts as an acceptor for the second nucleotide. Nucleotidyl transfer is then repeated with the subsequent NTPs giving rise to an extensive RNA product. The de novoinitiation may thus require specific molecular interactions to stabilize the initiation complex, because Watson-Crick interactions between the template and individual NTPs may be insufficient to keep them correctly positioned.

As documented for φ6pol, cystoviral polymerases initiate RNA synthesis at the very 3′-end of the template employing a primer-independent initiation mechanism (3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCVpol as well as the related bovine viral diarrhea virus polymerase are also capable of initiation de novo (10.Oh J.W. Ito T. Lai M.M. J.

However, under in vitro conditions, these enzymes preferentially utilize a “back-priming” or “copy-back” initiation mode. In this case, the 3′-end of the template loops back to form a hairpin structure, which is subsequently extended with the polymerase (5.Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 8.Zhong W. Gutshall L.L. Del Vecchio A.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9365-9369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Luo G. Hamatake R.K.

Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This type of initiation is obviously deleterious for the virus replicationin vivo, because the newly produced daughter strand remains covalently bound to the template strand (2.Kao C.C. Singh P. Ecker D.J. Virology. 2001; 287: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). High resolution structures of HCVpol and φ6pol have been recently determined (19.Ago H. Adachi T. Yoshida A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The structures of the two enzymes are considerably similar (418 of the Cα atoms of φ6pol (665 aa total) can be superimposed on HCVpol with a root mean squared deviation of 3.5 Å). The structural similarity is not expected from the amino acid sequence comparison. This suggests an evolutionary link between the polymerases of the dsRNA viruses infecting bacteria and the positive-sense ssRNA viruses of animals (22.Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In contrast to many polymerases that have the “open right hand” architecture, with fingers, thumb, and palm subdomains (23.Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 24.Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Overall, both enzymes appear as compact spherical molecules with internally located active sites, and two positively charged tunnels allowing the access of the RNA template and NTP substrates to the polymerase interior (Refs. 19.Ago H.

Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). In addition to the apoenzyme, the φ6pol initiation complex structure has been solved. This provides a detailed view of the enzyme associated with an oligonucleotide template and two NTPs complementary to the template 3′-end (22.Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This information is not available for the HCVpol. One intriguing feature of the φ6pol initiation complex is a chain of stacking interactions encompassing the bases of the two initiatory NTPs, Tyr630 and perhaps Trp632. Both residues are located in the C-terminal loop 630–633 that has been referred to as the “initiation platform” (Ref. 22.Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B). This type of stacking is likely to be preserved in the φ8 and φ13 polymerases, because both proteins have aromatic residues at the equivalent positions (4.Yang H. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11088-11095Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27.Hoogstraten D. Qiao X. Sun Y. Hu A. Onodera S. Mindich L.

It has been suggested that Tyr630 of φ6pol could stabilize the NTPs in the process of initiation. Following the initiation step, the C-terminal domain containing this loop is believed to move, allowing the exit of the newly synthesized dsRNA product. Interestingly, an analogous structural element containing a tyrosine residue is also present in HCVpol (19.Ago H. Adachi T. Yoshida A. Yamamoto M. Habuka N. Yatsunami K. Miyano M. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1417-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 20.Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A.

Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) but not in the RdRp subunit of poliovirus (26.Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme is known to utilize a protein primer to initiate RNA synthesis (29.Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been observed (2.Kao C.C. Singh P. Ecker D.J. Virology. 2001; 287: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) that the critical tyrosine is conserved at least across flaviviral and pestiviral polymerases. The proposed initiation platform (β-hairpin aa 443–454) of HCVpol has been shortened from LDCQIYGACYSI to LGGI (30.Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), leading to an increased propensity of the polymerase to initiate from an internally annealed primer, as compared with the wild-type enzyme that could only utilize short primers complementary to the template 3′-end. It was concluded that the β-hairpin acts as a gate preventing the 3′ terminus of the template RNA from slipping through the polymerase active site and ensuring terminal initiation of replication. However, the primer-independent initiation mode, crucial for the in vivo initiation, has not been studied in the HCVpol using mutated polymerases. Here, we use a series of φ6pol mutants to address the role of the 630–633 loop (the tentative initiation platform) in the de novo initiation of RNA replication. Mutations affecting conserved aromatic residues implicated in stacking interactions significantly decrease de novo initiation on φ6-specific (+) sense ssRNAs. Nevertheless, the mutants replicate rather efficiently some 3′-modified (+) sense RNAs using “back-priming” initiation mechanism, reported earlier for other viral RdRps (5.Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 8.Zhong W. Gutshall L.L. Del Vecchio A.M. J.

Parra F. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When the initiation platform of φ6pol is disordered by the mutation YKW (630–632) to GSG, back-priming becomes the major mode of initiation. Overall, our results extend the HCVpol data and suggest a model where the de novo initiation is assured by a specialized element of the polymerase polypeptide chain and is further controlled by the secondary structure on the 3′-end of viral RNA. Plasmid pLM659 (34.Gottlieb P. Strassman J. Qiao X. Frilander M. Frucht A. Mindich L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce (+) sense ssRNA copies of the small φ6 genomic segment (s+). Plasmid pEM15 containing the φ6 s+ segment with an internal deletion (13.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6275-6284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to prepare sΔ+ RNA and its 3′-terminally modified variants (sΔ+13and sΔ+HP). Plasmid pEM19 was derived from pEM15 by inserting two duplexes of annealed phosphorylated oligonucleotides TL1/TL2 and TL3/TL4 at theXbaI-SacI sites (see Table I for oligonucleotide sequences). The plasmids encoding for the φ6pol mutants were derived from the wild-type φ6pol expression plasmid pEM2 (3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, a short fragment of φ6pol gene was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonucleotide seq3_p2 as an upstream primer. The downstream primers p2_Y630F, p2_Y630A, and p2_GSG were designed to introduce corresponding mutations into the initiation platform loop. The PCR products were digested with NruI-NsiI and ligated with the large fragment of the similarly cut pEM2. The resultant plasmids pSJ4 (encoding for the Y630F mutant), pSJ5 (Y630A mutant), and pEM28 (YKW (630–632) to GSG mutant) were partially sequenced to verify the mutations.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequenceTL15′-CTAGGGGTTCGCTL25′-CGAACCCTL35′-CCCGGGTACCGAGCTTL45′-CGGTACCCGGGGT7_15′-CGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAG3′end5′-AGAGAGAGAGCCCCCGAseq3_P25′-CCAGTTCAGCCCTGAGTACGGTGTP2_GSG5′-GCCATGCATCAGTACCTCGTGGATATTCGCCGAGACATCGGCCTCGGTACCGGATCCCTGGAGTTP2_Y630A5′-GCCATGCATCAGTACCTCGTGGATATTCGCCGAGACATCGGCCTCGGTCCACTTAGCCTGGAGTTP2_Y630F5′-GCCATGCATCAGTACCTCGTGGATATTCGCCGAGACATCGGCCTCGGTCCATTTAAACTGGAGTT Open table in a new tab Synthetic ssRNAs were produced by run-off transcription in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Templates for the T7 transcription were prepared by either cutting plasmid DNA with restriction endonucleases or by PCR amplification. RNAs sΔ+13 and sΔ+HP were transcribed from theSmaI cut plasmids pEM15 and pEM19, respectively. The sΔ+ fragment was PCR-amplified from pEM15 usingPfu DNA polymerase and oligonucleotides T7_1 and 3′-end, as upstream and downstream primers, respectively. RNA s+ was produced as described by Ref. 3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. All ssRNAs were dissolved in sterile water, and the RNA concentration was measured (A 260). The quality of each preparation was checked by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Both wild-type and mutated φ6 polymerases were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing the appropriate expression plasmid at 20 °C for 15 h and purified to homogeneity as described previously (3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replication activity of wild-type φ6pol and φ6pol mutants were typically assayed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 20 mm ammonium acetate, 6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm each NTP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and 0.8 unit/μl RNasin. The final concentration of the RNA substrates was 50 μg/ml. Unless indicated otherwise, the mixture was supplemented with 0.1 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., 3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were initiated by adding φ6pol protein to a final concentration of 27–270 nm. In the control reactions, a corresponding volume of φ6pol control buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) was used instead of polymerase. The mixtures were usually incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and treated for further analysis as described below. Standard agarose gel electrophoresis was used to achieve separation of the positive-sense ssRNA and the corresponding dsRNA segments (3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Pagratis N. Revel H.R. Virology. 1990; 177: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was carried out in 1.2% agarose or 3% MetaPhor-agarose gels containing 0.25 μg/ml ethidium bromide and buffered with 1 × TBE (50 mmTris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 μg/ml ethidium bromide). The φ6pol replication reaction was stopped with an equal volume of U2 buffer (10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, 6% (v/v) glycerol, and 7–8m urea). For strand-separation gels, the samples were boiled for 2 min and then incubated on ice for 3 min before loading into the gel. After RNA separation (5 V/cm), gels were photographed under UV light exposure, dried on Whatman 3 filter paper or Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) followed by autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS1500) analysis of the product bands. φ6pol replication reactions were assayed as described above but in a 20-μl reaction volume. The reactions were stopped after 1 h at +30 °C by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. NH4Ac was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m, and the RNase digestion of the reaction products was initiated by adding 0.2 unit of RNase I (RNase ONE reaction buffer, Promega). An equivalent volume of 1× reaction buffer (RNase ONE) instead of the RNase I was added to the reactions without RNase digestion. After incubation of 1 h at 30 °C, the RNase I reactions were stopped with 0.1% SDS and purified by phenol extraction and gel filtration (Amersham G-50) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction products were processed further as described above for strand separation gel electrophoresis. The oligonucleotide anti s-117 used in primer extension assays was designed to be complementary (in the 3′→5′ direction) to nt 117–136 of the s+ segment (36.Pirttimaa M.J. Bamford D.H. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions were done according to a previous study (37.Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) with some modifications: 2 μl of s+ or sΔ+RNA (1.4 μg) was combined with 2 μl of the hybridization buffer (0.25 m K-HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 m KCl), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 pmol of γ-32P-labeled primer (T4 polynucleotide kinase, Promega, [γ-32P]ATP, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., 3000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 9 μl. Tubes were incubated at 65 °C for 1 min and slowly cooled to 30 °C over a period of 30 min. The primed RNA templates were mixed with the rest of the φ6 polymerase assay components (total volume 20 μl) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. For the control reaction φ6pol control buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) was added instead of polymerase. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm, purified with gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., G-50), vacuum-dried, and dissolved into the sample buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). Sequencing lanes (A, C, G, and T) were produced with T7 Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) from cloned cDNA of the s+ segment using the same primer, anti s-117, as in the primer-extension reactions. The primer extension mixtures were incubated at 100 °C and sequencing reactions at 80 °C for 2 min and analyzed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 m urea. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to phosphorimaging and autoradiography analysis. If the primer anti s-117 was not labeled, [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., 3000 Ci/mmol) was added to the reaction in a final concentration of 0.1 mCi/ml. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm, purified with gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., G-50), and U2 buffer was added for analysis in standard or strand separation agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. To examine the role of the C-terminal loop 630–633, three φ6pol mutants were constructed and purified (Fig. 2 A). In two of the mutants, Tyr630 was substituted with either alanine (Y630A) or phenylalanine (Y630F). In the third case, three bulky amino acids YKW (aa 630–632) were changed to considerably smaller residues GSG (φ6pol(GSG)). All mutants were expressed and purified according to the protocol described for the wild-type φ6pol (3.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA-synthesizing activities of the purified enzymes were initially assayed using the 710 nucleotide (nt)-long ssRNA template sΔ+, which is a plus (+) sense copy of the φ6 small genomic segment (s+) containing an extensive internal deletion (38.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out as specified under “Experimental Procedures” and subsequently analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The results revealed significant differences between the wild-type and the mutated φ6 polymerases (Fig. 2 B). None of the tested mutants could utilize the sΔ+ substrate efficiently, whereas the wild-type φ6pol control contained a readily detectable amount of the full-length dsRNA product. The platform mutants were also assayed using chimeric ssRNAs templates. One of these templates, sΔ+13, was similar to sΔ+ RNA but contained a 13-nt extension … CUAGAGGAUCCCC-3′ originating from the plasmid polylinker. Both the wild-type and mutated polymerases accepted this template producing a full-length dsRNA product (Fig. 2 B). Mutants Y630F and Y630A demonstrated relatively low activity, but φ6pol(GSG) mutant replicated sΔ+13 more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. There are two principal explanations for this difference: (i) The mutated polymerases might initiate de novo on the 3′ terminus of sΔ+13 but not sΔ+. Indeed, it has been shown that the addition of one or several cytosines to the template 3′ terminus stimulates initiation by the wild-type φ6pol (13.Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6275-6284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The φ6pol mutants might use an alternative initiation mechanism on sΔ+13, which differs from the de novo mechanism of the wild-type enzyme. The 3′ terminal regions of these two ssRNAs have been suggested to form a tRNA-like secondary structure. In sΔ+, this tRNA like element contains a 5-nt single-stranded 3′ tail, which apparently does not form any stable intramolecular base pairs (39.Mindich L. Qiao X. Onodera S. Gottlieb P. Frilander M. Virology. 1994; 202: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Conversely, the 13-nt longer tail of sΔ+13 has a potential to form a transient hairpin structure, which might be used by the polymerase mutants to prime RNA synthesis (Fig. 2 C). Because back-primed synthesis should result in the daughter strand covalently attached to the template, we analyzed heat-denatured RNA polymerization products by agarose gel-electrophoresis. In the case of the de novo initiation, the complementary strands of the duplex RNA molecule would migrate as single-stranded after denaturation. However, if RNA synthesis is initiated by the back-priming mechanism, the hairpin-like dsRNA product should re-anneal immediately after the denaturation step and appear in the gel at the position of dsRNA (Fig. 3 A). As expected, wild-type φ6pol produced daughter strands, which could be almost completely separated from the sΔ+13template upon heat denaturation (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 1 and 9). On the contrary, most replication products of φ6pol(GSG) mutant could not be converted to the single-stranded form (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). In the case of Y630A and Y630F mutants, approximately half of the RNA products appeared as double-stranded after denaturation (Fig. 3 C,lanes 25 and 27). This indicates that all three mutants have a substantially increased propensity to generate back-primed RNA products consisting of covalently linked template and daughter strands. To confirm that the dimer-sized RNA products observed after the denaturation were indeed hairpin-like species, we introduced an RNase digestion control. RNase I of E. coli readily hydrolyzes single-stranded and partially double-stranded RNA but not perfect RNA duplexes (40.Brewer G. Murray E. Staeben M. Promega Notes. 1992; 38: 1-7Google Scholar). The loop at the 3′-end of the hairpin product should not be base-paired and is, therefore, RNase-sensitive. As expected, RNase digestion had almost no effect on the wild-type φ6pol replication products (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1,5, 9, and 13). In the case of mutated polymerases, RNase digestion converted heat-resistant double-stranded products into the single-stranded form (Fig. 3, B andC, lanes 15, 29, and31). Thus, on the sΔ+13 ssRNA template, the GSG mutant utilizes predominantly back-priming initiation mechanism, whereas Y630A and Y630F mutants use de novo and back-priming"
https://openalex.org/W1665408633,"Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) plays an important role in innate immunity, where, together with IRF-3, it controls the expression of interferon A/B genes as well as chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). Previously, we characterized human IRF-7 promoter and showed that an interferon-stimulated response element site in the first intron binds interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and confers the response to interferon. Here we report the stimulation of IRF-7 expression by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in human peripheral blood monocytes. Using promoter analysis in combination with electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have demonstrated that an NFκB site located next to the TATA box, binds p50 and p65 heterodimer and is required for the induction of the IRF-7 gene by TPA and TNFα. In addition, we report stimulation of IRF-7 gene expression by topoisomerase II (TOPII) inhibitors. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that treatment with the TOPII inhibitor etoposide induces association of acetylated histone 3 with the promoter of IRF-7 gene, indicating that TOPII-mediated changes in chromatin structure could be responsible for the induction. This suggests that the IRF-7 gene is localized in the condensed area of the chromosome where it is inaccessible to transcription factors that would promote its constitutive expression. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) plays an important role in innate immunity, where, together with IRF-3, it controls the expression of interferon A/B genes as well as chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). Previously, we characterized human IRF-7 promoter and showed that an interferon-stimulated response element site in the first intron binds interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and confers the response to interferon. Here we report the stimulation of IRF-7 expression by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in human peripheral blood monocytes.

Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). IRFs bind, through their highly homologous N-terminal DNA binding domain, to an AANNGAAA consensus sequence on the DNA to mediate diverse biological events, including antiviral defense, cell growth regulation, and development and maturation of the immune system (2.Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). IRF-7 was originally cloned as a repressor associated with Epstein-Barr virus type III latency, where it binds the Qp promoter of the EBNA-1 gene (3.Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It has since been demonstrated, by us and other groups, that IRF-7 plays an important role in innate immunity where, together with IRF-3, it controls the expression of type I interferon (IFNα/β) as well as chemokines such as RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in virus-infected cells (4.Wathelet M.G.

Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The induction of IFNα/β by IRF-3 and IRF-7 is believed to consist of two phases (8.Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In the early phase, viral infection triggers the phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of IRF-3. Together with c-Jun and ATF-2, the IRF factors assemble with p300/CBP to form a transcription complex enhanceosome, on the promoter region of IFNβ gene. The newly synthesized IFNβ in turn stimulates expression of IRF-7 via an autocrine/paracrine pathway. In the late phase, the IRF-7 forms a heterodimer with IRF-3 and translocates into the nucleus, resulting in the induction of different IFNα subtype gene expressions. This biphasic induction model is supported by studies both in vitro and in vivo(10.Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

We have demonstrated that, upon virus infection, 2FTGH cells cannot synthesize IFNα unless expression of IRF-7 is reconstituted, supporting a critical role of IRF-7 in IFNα expression (10.Yeow W.S.

In addition, we have demonstrated a dramatic decrease in interferon production when IRF-3 expression is inhibited by a targeting ribozyme (11.Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Lowther W.J. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies in vivo demonstrated a dramatic reduction in IFNα/β synthesis in infected IRF-3−/− mice, and IFNα/β induction was completely abolished in IRF-3−/−and IRF-9−/− double knock-out mice, which do not express IRF-7 (or express very low levels) as a result of the defective interferon signaling pathway (12.Sato M. Suemorim H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T.

Previously, we have cloned and characterized the human IRF-7 promoter and demonstrated that an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), located in the first intron of IRF-7 gene, binds the ISGF3 complex and is responsible for the stimulation of the IRF-7 gene by interferon (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the induction of IRF-7 gene expression by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in promonocytic U937 cells and further demonstrated the importance of IRF-7 induction in TPA-induced monocyte differentiation (14.Lu R. Pitha-Rowe P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45491-45496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this paper, the mechanism by which TPA induces IRF-7 expression is further characterized. Here, we show that an NFκB site located next to the TATA box on the IRF-7 promoter is responsible for induction by TPA. In addition, we report for the first time that a proinflammatory cytokine TNFα also induces IRF-7 expression and that the induction requires the same NFκB site. Finally, we provide evidence that the expression of endogenous IRF-7 gene is induced upon modulation of the chromatin structure by TOPII inhibitors, indicating that the IRF-7 gene (ID 3665), which is localized in a GC-rich area of chromosome 11p15.5 (15.Paris M.J. Williams B.R.G. Genomics. 2000; 69: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), is probably inaccessible to transcription factors that are already present in uninduced cells. Thus our study reveals multiple levels of regulation of IRF-7 gene expression. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors by a density gradient centrifugation method and cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. U937 and Namalwa cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS. The generation of luciferase reporter vectors containing a 1.6-kb fragment of human IRF-7 promoter region wild type (WT) and the version with mutated ISRE site (ISREM) were described previously (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). The vector containing wild type IRF-7 was used as a parent copy to generate a new vector with a mutated NF-κB site (NF-κBM). PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was utilized as described (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to mutate the NF-κB site on the IRF-7 promoter. The sequence of sense primer used to mutate NFκB site is: TTCCCGGAAACCAACGCCTGGCC. The underlined bases indicate the introduced change from the TCC present in WT NFκB. Total cell RNA was isolated using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) and Northern blot analysis was carried out as described (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16.Lu R. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel. The gel was blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridization was carried out with 32P-random-labeled IRF-7 cDNA as a probe. Cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. One microgram of the reporter plasmid DNA and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid (internal control) were used for each transfection. In co-transfection experiments, 1:1 ratios of the reporter and expression plasmids (1 μg of each) were used. The final concentration of transfected DNA was kept constant in all co-transfection assays. Transfected cells were split 12 h after transfection into 35-mm 6-well plates and incubated for another 6 h, after which fresh medium was added and different treatments, as indicated in the legends, were carried out. Twelve hours later, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) from TPA- or TNFα-treated cells and from untreated control cells. After treatment, the cells were incubated with lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma) for 5 min on ice. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in extraction buffer (500 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min with constant shaking. After centrifugation, the supernatants were stored at −70 °C until use. Aliquots of 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in 25 μl of total reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 40 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 50 mm KCl) with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 20 min at room temperature. In the supershift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies for 15 min at room temperature before addition of the labeled probe. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p50, p65, and c-Rel were purchased from Santa Cruz. Competition studies were performed by addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides to the binding reaction. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% native acrylamide gel. The sequence of the DNA probe used for the EMSA was: 5′ GCGCCTTCCCGGAAACTCCCGCCTGGCC 3′. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (17.Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar,18.Au W.-C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41629-41637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 108 Namalwa cells were treated with etoposide or trichostatin A for 12 h, and the proteins bound to DNA were subsequently cross-linked by addition of 11% formaldehyde to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1%. Cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125m. The fixed cells were washed and resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) on ice and lysed by sonication twice for 10 s each. Samples were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl). For each immunoprecipitation, 700 μl of diluted lysate was precleared by addition of 30 μl of blocked protein A beads (50% slurry protein A-Sepharose, 0.5% mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Samples were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with 1 μg of antiacetylated histone 3 (H3) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) for 12 h. The immunocomplexes were extensively washed and treated with RNase, 05% SDS, and proteinase K. The cross-linked DNA and protein complexes were reverted by heating at 65 °C for 6 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and immunoprecipitated with ethanol. PCR amplification was performed using specific primers for human IRF-7 promoter: sense, 5′ GCGCCTTCCCGGAAACTCCCGCCTGGCC 3′; antisense, 5′ GGGCGGGTCAGGCTCCCGGGAAAGCGAAACCTAAACAGTGGCGCTTCGG 3′. The condition for the PCR amplification is: 94 °C 1 min, 57 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min, for 30 cycles. IRF-7 is predominantly expressed in lymphoid tissues, and its expression can be further up-regulated in multiple cell types upon virus infection and interferon treatment. Here, we report the induction of IRF-7 gene expression by two novel stimulants, TPA and TNFα. As shown in Fig. 1, both TPA and TNFα induced IRF-7 mRNA expression in a time-dependent fashion. The mechanism by which TPA and TNFα stimulate IRF-7 gene expression was further examined. We previously have cloned the promoter region of the human IRF-7 gene, and a 1.6-kb promoter region was analyzed in detail (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our studies revealed that an ISRE site located in the first intron is responsible for induction of the IRF-7 gene by interferon. It is well documented that both TPA and TNFα activate the NFκB signaling pathway (19.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 18: 621-663Crossref Scopus (4024) Google Scholar), and interestingly, there is a potential NFκB binding site located at 10 bp upstream of the TATA box. We mutated this NFκB site and inserted this mutant into a luciferase reporter vector. This new constuct, designated as NFκBM, was transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and its promoter activity was compared with the wild type promoter construct (WT) and ISRE site mutant (ISREM). First, we wanted to determine whether this potential NFκB site could confer the transcription activation mediated by NFκB family transcription factors. WT and NFκBM reporter vectors were transfected into HeLa cells together with p50, p65, or both, and the activity of the promoter was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 A, co-transfection of WT with either p50 or p65 increased transcription activity of the IRF-7 promoter and co-transfection of both further stimulated the activity of the promoter. However, the response to p50 and p65 decreased dramatically when the NFκB site was mutated. This result suggests that the NFκB binding site present in the IRF-7 promoter is functional. Next, we sought out to determine whether this NFκB binding site is responsible for activation of the IRF-7 promoter by TPA and TNFα. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both TPA and TNFα stimulated activity of the IRF-7 promoter. Activation by TPA was about 3-fold, and stimulation by TNFα was about 2.5-fold. Activation of the IRF-7 promoter by IFNα was used as a positive control. When the ISRE site was mutated, the IRF-7 promoter (ISREM) lost the response to IFN, but maintained the response to both TPA and TNFα, suggesting the involvement of different transcription factors in activation of the IRF-7 promoter by TPA and TNFα. Interestingly, the response to TPA and TNFα disappeared after the NFκB binding site on the IRF-7 promoter was mutated (NFκBM), even though the response to IFN remained. This result suggests that activation of IRF-7 promoter by IFN requires the ISRE site, whereas activation by TPA and TNFα requires the presence of the NFκB binding site. The interaction of NFκB family members with the NFκB binding site was assessed by EMSA. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells before or after treatment with TPA or TNFα were collected, and EMSA was carried out using a DNA probe containing the NFκB binding site of the IRF-7 promoter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3 A, a distinct DNA-protein complex was detected using the nuclear extract from TPA- treated cells. This complex was not detected when the nuclear lysates from untreated HeLa cells were used. Formation of the complex was completely abolished in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled cold probe, but it was not competed out by the oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to the unlabeled NFκB mutant probe. This result indicates that the formation of this DNA-protein complex requires a functional NFκB site. The identity of the proteins bound to DNA in this complex was further characterized by supershift analysis with the anti-p65, -p50, and -c-Rel antibodies. Fig. 3 A shows complete or partial disappearance of the complex in the presence of p50 and p65 antibodies and simultaneous emergence of several supershifted bands. However, the c-Rel antibody had no effect on the formation of this complex, indicating that the DNA protein complex, formed after TPA treatment, requires the NFκB binding site and consists of p65 and p50 of NFκB family members. The same experiment was repeated with a nuclear extract of TNFα-treated cells. As seen with TPA treatment, the DNA binding complex detected after TNFα treatment also contained p65 and p50 (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, our data indicate that treatment with TPA or TNFα stimulates binding of the p50 and p65 heterodimer to the NFκB site present on the IRF-7 promoter. During the course of our study aimed at identifying the signaling pathways involved in the TPA-induced IRF-7 gene expression, we noticed that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, induced IRF-7 expression (Fig. 4 A). Genistein is commonly used as a nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but it is also an estrogen receptor agonist and a TOPII inhibitor (20.Peterson G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 784S-789SPubMed Google Scholar). Further study revealed that other TOPII inhibitors were able to induce IRF-7 expression (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). The results in Fig. 4 A show that treatment of HeLa cells with several TOPII inhibitors such as genistein, daidzein, doxirubicin, mitoxantrone, and etoposide induced IRF-7 gene expression; the maximal increase in the relative levels of IRF-7 mRNA (4-fold) was obtained with etoposide. However, a DNA synthesis inhibitor mitomycin C and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin had no effect on IRF-7 gene expression. Furthermore, the induction of IRF-7 expression by etoposide was abolished in the presence of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D, suggesting that the TOPII inhibitors induce transcription of IRF-7. In contrast, a significant increase in the relative levels of IRF-7 mRNA (12.9-fold) was observed when etoposide was used in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Whether the cycloheximide enhancement occurs at the level of transcription or is due to the increased stability of IRF-7 mRNA is unclear. In an attempt to investigate the mechanism by which TOPII inhibitors stimulate IRF-7 gene expression, we studied the combined effect of TPA, etoposide, and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A on IRF-7 gene expression. Treatment with genistein was included as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 4 B, etoposide, TPA, and trichostatin A were each able to induce expression of IRF-7 gene in Namalwa cells. Interestingly, when the cells were treated with the combination of either etoposide and trichostatin A or TPA and etoposide, an additive effect on IRF-7 expression was observed. However, no such effect was observed when the cells were treated with TPA and trichostatin A. Similar findings were observed in monocyte cell line U937 cells (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that the observed enhancement by trichostatin A is not limited to Namalwa cells. To further examine the mechanism by which TOPII inhibitors induce IRF-7 gene expression we studied the effect of etoposide as well as TPA and trichostatin A on the activity of the IRF-7 promoter. In HeLa cells transiently transfected with the reporter plasmid containing the IRF-7 promoter in front of the luciferase gene, treatment with TPA and trichostatin A resulted in a 3- and 9-fold stimulation, respectively. However, treatment with etoposide did not stimulate the IRF-7 promoter. Furthermore, no additional effect was seen when the cells were treated with combinations of TPA and etoposide, TPA and trichostatin A, or trichostatin A and etoposide. Since it is well known that in transiently transfected cells the plasmid DNA does not form a proper chromatin structure, we used a stable line in which the IRF-7 reporter construct was stably integrated into the chromosome (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this cell line, TPA and trichostatin A treatment stimulated the activity of the IRF-7 promoter to a level similar to that seen in a transient transfection. Surprisingly, however, in these cells activation of the IRF-7 promoter (about 2-fold increase) was consistently observed upon treatment with etoposide. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with the combination of TPA and etoposide showed an additive effect, while trichostatin A and etoposide gave a synergistic effect (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the response of integrated IRF-7 promoter was distinct from that of the transiently transfected reporter plasmid where the integrated IRF-7 reporter plasmid responded very much like the endogenous IRF-7 gene. These results indicate that the induction of IRF-7 gene expression by TOPII inhibitors occurs only in the context of an intact chromatin structure. The status of histone acetylation is often associated with active gene transcription (21.Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2991-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The current concept is that the core histones are acetylated around the actively transcribed genes, whereas around silenced genes the core histones are in a hypoacetylated state. We therefore examined the status of histone acetylation in the IRF-7 gene locus before and after etoposide treatment by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. To this end, Namalwa cells were treated with etoposide or trichostatin A for 12 h, fixed with formaldehyde solution, and immunoprecipitated with antiacetylated H3 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNAs present in the immunoprecipitates were then purified and amplified by using a specific primer set corresponding to the promoter region of the IRF-7 gene. As shown in Fig. 6, the fragment corresponding to the IRF-7 promoter was amplified from the nuclear DNA used for immunoprecipitation. The fragment corresponding to the IRF-7 promoter was also amplified from DNA immunoprecipitated with antiacetylated H3 antibodies both from etoposide and trichostatin A-treated cells that were used as a positive control. To show the specificity of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, anti-FLAG antibody was used for immunoprecipitation of the protein cross-linked to DNA. No amplification of the IRF-7 promoter was detected from anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates. As described in our previous paper (13.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we characterized the IRF-7 promoter and showed that an ISRE site located in the first intron is required for the response to interferon. Here, we report the identification of two novel stimulators of IRF-7 gene expression, namely TPA and TNFα. Further analysis of the IRF-7 promoter revealed that an NFκB site next to the TATA box was responsible for the induction by both TPA and TNFα and that the response to TPA or TNFα treatment was lost after the NFκB site was mutated. NFκB family transcription factors participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses (19.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

NFκB is composed of a homodimer or heterodimer of Rel, family proteins including p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB. Among them, only p65, c-Rel, and RelB contain transcription activation domains. p50 and p65 heterodimer is the most common form of dimerization (19.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

In cells treated with TPA or TNFα, we detected binding of a specific DNA binding complex to the NFκB site that was composed of p50 and p65 heterodimer. The identification of the NFκB site that is sufficient to induce the IRF-7 expression provides new information on the regulation of the IRF-7 gene. Previously, we had shown that an ISRE site located in the first intron binds ISGF3 and is responsible for IRF-7 induction by interferon. The present finding that the NFκB site is also sufficient to trigger IRF-7 expression indicates that IRF-7 expression could be regulated by stimuli that activate NFκB, such as proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, LMP-1 and LPS have been shown to induce IRF-7 expression (5.Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-292"
https://openalex.org/W1995696716,"OccR is a LysR-type transcriptional regulator ofAgrobacterium tumefaciens that positively regulates the octopine catabolism operon of the Ti plasmid. Positive control of theocc genes occurs in response to octopine, a metabolite released from plant tumors. Octopine causes DNA-bound OccR to undergo a conformational change from an inactive to an active state; this change is marked by a decrease in footprint length from 55 to 45 nucleotides as well as a relaxation of a high angle DNA bend. In this study, we first used gel filtration chromatography to show that OccR is dimeric in solution, and we used gel shift assays to show that OccR is tetrameric when bound to DNA. We then created a series of site-directed mutations in the OccR-binding site. Some mutations were designed to lock OccR-DNA complexes into a conformation resembling the inactive conformation, whereas other mutations were designed to lock complexes into the active conformation. These mutations altered the conformation of OccR-DNA complexes and their responses to octopine in ways that we had predicted. As expected, operator mutations that locked complexes into a conformation having a long footprint and a high angle DNA bend blocked activation by octopine in vivo. Surprisingly, however, mutations that lock OccR into a short footprint and low angle DNA bend failed to cause the protein to function constitutively. Furthermore, some of the latter mutations interfered with activation by octopine. We conclude that locking OccR into a conformation having a short footprint is not sufficient to cause constitutive activation, and octopine must cause at least one additional conformational change in the protein.

Wang L. Winans S.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 279-385Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This operon encodes proteins required for the uptake and catabolism of octopine (2Dessaux Y. Petit A. Tempe J. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 109-136Google Scholar), which serves as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for tumor-colonizing bacteria. The occoperon also encodes the TraR protein, which is a quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator of the Ti plasmid tra regulon (3Fuqua C. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). OccR has a molecular mass of 32.7 kDa and is a member of the LysR family of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (4Henikoff S.G. Haughn J.M. Calvo J.M. Wallace J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), the largest known family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins in Proteobacteria (5Perez-Rueda E. Collado-Vides J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons among LysR proteins indicate that they share a highly conserved amino-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a far less conserved carboxyl-terminal domain that generally binds low molecular weight inducing ligands. LysR proteins are often encoded by genes that are transcribed divergently from their target genes, and these proteins often activate a target operon and simultaneously repress their own expression by binding to a single intergenic region (6Schell M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar).OccR binds specific DNA sequences that lie upstream of the promoter it activates, PoccQ. In the absence of octopine, OccR protects a region from −80 to −28 nucleotides upstream of its target promoter. Octopine has little effect on binding affinity and does not alter the oligomeric state of bound OccR. However, octopine shortens the DNase I footprint by one helical turn such that only the region from −80 to −38 is protected. Furthermore, apo-OccR incites a high angle DNA bend at this binding site, and this bend angle is relaxed by the addition of octopine (7Wang L. Helmann J.D. Winans S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both OccR conformations repress the divergentoccR promoter, but activation of the occ operon occurs only when OccR is in the latter conformation.DNA bending has been suggested to be an important event in transcriptional activation for a number of LysR family proteins (8Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 10Parsek M.R. Kivisaar M. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several have been shown to incite bends in their target promoters. For example, CysB of Salmonella typhimuriuminduces a bend at two promoters, and these bends are partially relieved by the inducer, N-acetyl-l-serine (8Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the OxyR protein of Escherichia coli causes a high angle bend at the oxyR-oxyS intergenic region that is relieved by reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). CatR of Pseudomonas putida also causes a high angle DNA bend at the catBC promoter, whereas the addition of the inducercis,cis-muconate relaxes this bend (10Parsek M.R. Kivisaar M. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although in the case of OccR and the above proteins, the inducing ligands cause a relaxation of the DNA bend, this is not a general rule, and DNA bending patterns are dependent on the specific regulator. For instance, apo-CatR causes little if any bend at another promoter (thepheBA promoter), but actually introduces a bend in the presence of the inducer, due to the binding of additional CatR protomers (10Parsek M.R. Kivisaar M. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Many LysR proteins bind unusually long regions of DNA upstream of their target genes. Such long binding sites suggest that LysR proteins are functionally multimeric, and several members have been reported to be either dimers or tetramers in solution, yet few data are available about their oligomeric state when DNA bound (see below). Based on mutational studies of several LysR proteins, oligomerization appears to be mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (11Lochowska A. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Plochocka D. Hryniewicz M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2098-2107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Schell M.A. Brown P.H. Raju S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3844-3850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kullik I. Stevens J. Toledano M.B. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although binding to DNA is independent of the presence of an inducer, inducing ligands often cause a conformational change in these complexes. For some proteins, such as CatR (14Parsek M.R. Shinabarger D. Rothmel R.K. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7798-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TrpI (15Gao J. Gussin G.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and NahR (16Schell M. Poser E.F. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 837-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inducing ligand appears to increase the number of bound protein monomers, whereas in other LysR proteins, such as OccR (7Wang L. Helmann J.D. Winans S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and OxyR (9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), the inducer does not alter the number of bound monomers but alters the sites of DNA contact.OccR contacts the major groove of its operator at five sites, designated sites 1–5 (Fig. 1, see Refs.17Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 18Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of these, sites 4 and 5 are sufficient and essential for high affinity DNA binding, as long as additional nonspecific sequences are provided to the left. Sites 4 and 5 together are therefore designated the “high affinity subsite.” Sites 1–3 make little if any contribution to binding affinity but are required for ligand-responsive DNA bending (17Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding site contains a dyad symmetrical sequence (ATAAN7TTAT) that resembles the TN11A motif to which many LysR family members bind (19Goethals K. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This sequence lies in the major groove of the region contacted by OccR and is similar to the 2-fold dyad symmetrical sequence (ATAGN7CTATN7ATAGN7CTAT) recognized by the homologous OxyR protein (9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).Subsites 1 and 2 (ATTCN7TTCA) share some sequence similarity to the high affinity subsite (ATAAN7TTAT), whereas subsite 3 (CCGG) shares no apparent similarity. It is thought that apo-OccR makes sequence-specific contacts with sites 1, 2, 4, and 5. OccR-octopine complexes do not contact site 1 and instead contact the remaining four contiguous sites. We postulate that OccR-octopine complexes binding at site 2 might recognize the sequence ATTC rather than the overlapping site TTCA (Fig. 1). The sequence ATTC is therefore designated site 2′. Mutations disrupting site 1 locked OccR into a conformation with a low angle DNA bend, whereas mutations disrupting sites 2 and 2′ prevented the relaxation of the DNA bend in the presence of octopine (17Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although the effect of octopine was tested at only one concentration.In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA-binding site to identify the requirements for transcriptional activation at the DNA sequence level. Nucleotides were targeted based on previous footprinting studies and sequence similarity with the high affinity binding site found at sites 4 and 5. We determined the effects of altering sequences in the DNA-binding site on DNA binding, bending, and promoter activity in A. tumefaciens. On the basis of the effects of these mutations, we discuss the role of ligand-induced DNA bending in transcriptional activation at the occQpromoter.DISCUSSIONIn an effort to understand how OccR specifically binds its operator DNA, we first attempted to determine the stoichiometry of these complexes. Our finding that OccR is dimeric in solution and tetrameric when DNA-bound is consistent with the extended footprints at the occQ operator and with earlier studies that OccR binds DNA cooperatively (with a Hill coefficient of 2.0). Several other LysR family proteins were previously shown to be either dimers or tetramers in solution. For example, NodD3 of Sinorhizobium meliloti, MetR of E. coli, CatR of P. putida, and ClcR of P. putida have been reported to be dimers in solution (32Fisher R.F. Long S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Maxon M.E. Wigboldus N.B. Weissbach H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7076-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Coco W.M. Parsek M.R. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5530-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas OxyR of E. coli, CysB of S. typhimurium, TrpI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and NahR of P. putida have been shown to be tetramers in solution (12Schell M.A. Brown P.H. Raju S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3844-3850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kullik I. Stevens J. Toledano M.B. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miller B. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6006-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chang M. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, gel filtration was carried out at high protein concentration, which might force the protein into a higher oligomeric state than found in vivo.To our knowledge, the only protein whose stoichiometry has been determined when bound to DNA is CysB, which binds as a tetramer (36Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3673-3682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other LysR proteins have been hypothesized to bind as tetramers on the basis of the lengths of their DNase I footprints.We found previously (7Wang L. Helmann J.D. Winans S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that sites 4 and 5 contain a high affinity OccR-binding site, probably for one OccR dimer, and that the sequences ATAAN7TTAT, which span this site, are essential for high affinity binding. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that placing similar sequences at sites 1 and 2 (whose native sequences are ATTC and TTCA, respectively) would reduce the ability of OccR to alter its conformation in response to octopine. This hypothesis was largely confirmed in that complexes containing this mutant sequence (mutant A1) required very high levels of octopine to cause a limited conformational change. Changing just site 1 (from ATTC to ATAA, mutant A2) or changing just site 2 (from TTCA to TTAT, mutant A3) had similar but more subtle effects. These data support the hypothesis that the sequence ATAAN7TTAT plays a fundamental role in the affinity of OccR for its operator and that placing these sequences at sites 1 and 2 can cause OccR to bind at these positions more strongly than it binds the wild-type sequence.The same hypothesis was further tested by altering sites 2′ and 3 (ATTC and CCGG, respectively) to ATAA and TTAT. This alteration had no effect on conformation in the absence of octopine. However, very low levels of octopine were sufficient to induce a drastic conformational change, supporting our hypothesis. Changing both sites 2′ and 3 caused a slight change in bend angle in the absence of octopine and caused a full shift with as little as 10 μm octopine. Altering just site 3 (from CCGG to TTAT, mutant B3) gave a somewhat unexpected result, in that this mutant was similar to mutant B1 in the absence of octopine, but showed a lower bend angle than mutant B1 (and even lower than wild type) in the presence of higher concentrations of octopine. We conclude that the native site 3 may not be recognized specifically by OccR, but that when a high affinity site is created at this position, it can readily be decoded by OccR.Sites 1 and 2 were further studied using mutations that abolish all or part of each sequence. Disruption of site 1 (mutant C1) caused complexes to have a low angle DNA bend at all octopine concentrations and to be little affected by octopine. This indicates that site 1 is essential for the OccR conformation that causes a high angle DNA bend and a long footprint. Disruption of site 2 and 2′ (mutant C2) caused a high angle DNA bend at all octopine concentrations. We interpret this to mean, first, that site 2 is not essential for the high angle bend and long footprint and, second, that site 2′ is essential for the low angle DNA bend and short footprint.We had anticipated that operator mutations that caused OccR to favor the conformation having a low angle bend in vitro would cause it to transcribe the occQ promoter constitutivelyin vivo. However, this was not the case, as such mutants either were impaired for induction or had properties similar to wild type in vivo. This is most clearly shown with mutant C1, whose conformation in vitro drastically favors the low angle DNA bend, but whose activity in vivo is still dependent on the presence of octopine and is only slightly more sensitive to the inducer than the wild type. Octopine must therefore cause a conformational change in OccR that cannot be mimicked by this operator mutation.Mutation C1 caused a reproducible but very slight (2–10-fold) increase in responsiveness to octopine concentrations between 1 and 8 nm. However, at octopine concentrations 16 nmor higher, the promoter was slightly impaired in activity. The most straightforward interpretation is that this mutation caused a slight increase in responsiveness to octopine, in accord with our original predictions, but failed to reach wild-type expression levels at high octopine concentrations because of impaired contacts with RNA polymerase.It remains somewhat puzzling that mutants B1, B2, and B3 are strongly impaired for activity even in the presence of octopine. Because each of these mutations cause OccR to favor the conformation having a low angle bend, we anticipated that these mutants would also cause OccR to act constitutively or to need only low concentrations of octopine. One possibility is that these mutants affect RNA polymerase contact sites, although it is surprising that sequences at both sites would be so critical. An alternative possibility is that this mutant traps OccR in a conformation that resembles the active conformation but actually differs from it in some way that is critical for activation. The Agrobacterium tumefaciens OccR protein is a transcriptional regulator that activates the occQ operon of the Ti plasmid in response to octopine, a plant tumor-released arginine derivative (1Habeeb L.F. Wang L. Winans S.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 279-385Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This operon encodes proteins required for the uptake and catabolism of octopine (2Dessaux Y. Petit A. Tempe J. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 109-136Google Scholar), which serves as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for tumor-colonizing bacteria. The occoperon also encodes the TraR protein, which is a quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator of the Ti plasmid tra regulon (3Fuqua C. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). OccR has a molecular mass of 32.7 kDa and is a member of the LysR family of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (4Henikoff S.G. Haughn J.M. Calvo J.M. Wallace J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the absence of octopine, OccR protects a region from −80 to −28 nucleotides upstream of its target promoter. Octopine has little effect on binding affinity and does not alter the oligomeric state of bound OccR. However, octopine shortens the DNase I footprint by one helical turn such that only the region from −80 to −38 is protected. Furthermore, apo-OccR incites a high angle DNA bend at this binding site, and this bend angle is relaxed by the addition of octopine (7Wang L. Helmann J.D. Winans S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both OccR conformations repress the divergentoccR promoter, but activation of the occ operon occurs only when OccR is in the latter conformation. DNA bending has been suggested to be an important event in transcriptional activation for a number of LysR family proteins (8Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G.

For example, CysB of Salmonella typhimuriuminduces a bend at two promoters, and these bends are partially relieved by the inducer, N-acetyl-l-serine (8Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J.

Similarly, the OxyR protein of Escherichia coli causes a high angle bend at the oxyR-oxyS intergenic region that is relieved by reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). CatR of Pseudomonas putida also causes a high angle DNA bend at the catBC promoter, whereas the addition of the inducercis,cis-muconate relaxes this bend (10Parsek M.R. Kivisaar M. Chakrabarty A.M.

Although in the case of OccR and the above proteins, the inducing ligands cause a relaxation of the DNA bend, this is not a general rule, and DNA bending patterns are dependent on the specific regulator. For instance, apo-CatR causes little if any bend at another promoter (thepheBA promoter), but actually introduces a bend in the presence of the inducer, due to the binding of additional CatR protomers (10Parsek M.R.

Although binding to DNA is independent of the presence of an inducer, inducing ligands often cause a conformational change in these complexes. For some proteins, such as CatR (14Parsek M.R. Shinabarger D. Rothmel R.K. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7798-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TrpI (15Gao J. Gussin G.N.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 837-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inducing ligand appears to increase the number of bound protein monomers, whereas in other LysR proteins, such as OccR (7Wang L. Helmann J.D. Winans S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and OxyR (9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), the inducer does not alter the number of bound monomers but alters the sites of DNA contact. OccR contacts the major groove of its operator at five sites, designated sites 1–5 (Fig. 1, see Refs.17Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 18Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of these, sites 4 and 5 are sufficient and essential for high affinity DNA binding, as long as additional nonspecific sequences are provided to the left. Sites 4 and 5 together are therefore designated the “high affinity subsite.” Sites 1–3 make little if any contribution to binding affinity but are required for ligand-responsive DNA bending (17Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding site contains a dyad symmetrical sequence (ATAAN7TTAT) that resembles the TN11A motif to which many LysR family members bind (19Goethals K. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This sequence lies in the major groove of the region contacted by OccR and is similar to the 2-fold dyad symmetrical sequence (ATAGN7CTATN7ATAGN7CTAT) recognized by the homologous OxyR protein (9Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Subsites 1 and 2 (ATTCN7TTCA) share some sequence similarity to the high affinity subsite (ATAAN7TTAT), whereas subsite 3 (CCGG) shares no apparent similarity. It is thought that apo-OccR makes sequence-specific contacts with sites 1, 2, 4, and 5. OccR-octopine complexes do not contact site 1 and instead contact the remaining four contiguous sites. We postulate that OccR-octopine complexes binding at site 2 might recognize the sequence ATTC rather than the overlapping site TTCA (Fig. 1). The sequence ATTC is therefore designated site 2′. Mutations disrupting site 1 locked OccR into a conformation with a low angle DNA bend, whereas mutations disrupting sites 2 and 2′ prevented the relaxation of the DNA bend in the presence of octopine (17Wang L. Winans S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although the effect of octopine was tested at only one concentration. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA-binding site to identify the requirements for transcriptional activation at the DNA sequence level. Nucleotides were targeted based on previous footprinting studies and sequence similarity with the high affinity binding site found at sites 4 and 5. We determined the effects of altering sequences in the DNA-binding site on DNA binding, bending, and promoter activity in A. tumefaciens. On the basis of the effects of these mutations, we discuss the role of ligand-induced DNA bending in transcriptional activation at the occQpromoter. DISCUSSIONIn an effort to understand how OccR specifically binds its operator DNA, we first attempted to determine the stoichiometry of these complexes. Our finding that OccR is dimeric in solution and tetrameric when DNA-bound is consistent with the extended footprints at the occQ operator and with earlier studies that OccR binds DNA cooperatively (with a Hill coefficient of 2.0). Several other LysR family proteins were previously shown to be either dimers or tetramers in solution. For example, NodD3 of Sinorhizobium meliloti, MetR of E. coli, CatR of P. putida, and ClcR of P. putida have been reported to be dimers in solution (32Fisher R.F. Long S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Maxon M.E. Wigboldus N.B. Weissbach H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5530-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas OxyR of E. coli, CysB of S. typhimurium, TrpI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and NahR of P. putida have been shown to be tetramers in solution (12Schell M.A. Brown P.H. Raju S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3844-3850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kullik I. Stevens J. Toledano M.B. Storz G. J.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, gel filtration was carried out at high protein concentration, which might force the protein into a higher oligomeric state than found in vivo.To our knowledge, the only protein whose stoichiometry has been determined when bound to DNA is CysB, which binds as a tetramer (36Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3673-3682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other LysR proteins have been hypothesized to bind as tetramers on the basis of the lengths of their DNase I footprints.We found previously (7Wang L. Helmann J.D. Winans S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that sites 4 and 5 contain a high affinity OccR-binding site, probably for one OccR dimer, and that the sequences ATAAN7TTAT, which span this site, are essential for high affinity binding. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that placing similar sequences at sites 1 and 2 (whose native sequences are ATTC and TTCA, respectively) would reduce the ability of OccR to alter its conformation in response to octopine. This hypothesis was largely confirmed in that complexes containing this mutant sequence (mutant A1) required very high levels of octopine to cause a limited conformational change. Changing just site 1 (from ATTC to ATAA, mutant A2) or changing just site 2 (from TTCA to TTAT, mutant A3) had similar but more subtle effects. These data support the hypothesis that the sequence ATAAN7TTAT plays a fundamental role in the affinity of OccR for its operator and that placing these sequences at sites 1 and 2 can cause OccR to bind at these positions more strongly than it binds the wild-type sequence.The same hypothesis was further tested by altering sites 2′ and 3 (ATTC and CCGG, respectively) to ATAA and TTAT. This alteration had no effect on conformation in the absence of octopine. However, very low levels of octopine were sufficient to induce a drastic conformational change, supporting our hypothesis. Changing both sites 2′ and 3 caused a slight change in bend angle in the absence of octopine and caused a full shift with as little as 10 μm octopine. Altering just site 3 (from CCGG to TTAT, mutant B3) gave a somewhat unexpected result, in that this mutant was similar to mutant B1 in the absence of octopine, but showed a lower bend angle than mutant B1 (and even lower than wild type) in the presence of higher concentrations of octopine. We conclude that the native site 3 may not be recognized specifically by OccR, but that when a high affinity site is created at this position, it can readily be decoded by OccR.Sites 1 and 2 were further studied using mutations that abolish all or part of each sequence. Disruption of site 1 (mutant C1) caused complexes to have a low angle DNA bend at all octopine concentrations and to be little affected by octopine. This indicates that site 1 is essential for the OccR conformation that causes a high angle DNA bend and a long footprint. Disruption of site 2 and 2′ (mutant C2) caused a high angle DNA bend at all octopine concentrations. We interpret this to mean, first, that site 2 is not essential for the high angle bend and long footprint and, second, that site 2′ is essential for the low angle DNA bend and short footprint.We had anticipated that operator mutations that caused OccR to favor the conformation having a low angle bend in vitro would cause it to transcribe the occQ promoter constitutivelyin vivo. However, this was not the case, as such mutants either were impaired for induction or had properties similar to wild type in vivo. This is most clearly shown with mutant C1, whose conformation in vitro drastically favors the low angle DNA bend, but whose activity in vivo is still dependent on the presence of octopine and is only slightly more sensitive to the inducer than the wild type. Octopine must therefore cause a conformational change in OccR that cannot be mimicked by this operator mutation.Mutation C1 caused a reproducible but very slight (2–10-fold) increase in responsiveness to octopine concentrations between 1 and 8 nm. However, at octopine concentrations 16 nmor higher, the promoter was slightly impaired in activity. The most straightforward interpretation is that this mutation caused a slight increase in responsiveness to octopine, in accord with our original predictions, but failed to reach wild-type expression levels at high octopine concentrations because of impaired contacts with RNA polymerase.It remains somewhat puzzling that mutants B1, B2, and B3 are strongly impaired for activity even in the presence of octopine. Because each of these mutations cause OccR to favor the conformation having a low angle bend, we anticipated that these mutants would also cause OccR to act constitutively or to need only low concentrations of octopine. One possibility is that these mutants affect RNA polymerase contact sites, although it is surprising that sequences at both sites would be so critical. An alternative possibility is that this mutant traps OccR in a conformation that resembles the active conformation but actually differs from it in some way that is critical for activation. In an effort to understand how OccR specifically binds its operator DNA, we first attempted to determine the stoichiometry of these complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2125821523,"In the present study, we demonstrate the thermal induced amyloid formation in a β-barrel protein, such as the acidic fibroblast growth factor from Notopthalmus viridescens (nFGF-1). Fibril formation in nFGF-1 is observed to occur maximally at 65 °C. Electron microscope analysis of the thermal induced fibrils of nFGF-1 shows that they are filamentous with an average diameter of about 20 nm. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the thermal induced fibrils of nFGF-1 have a typical “cross-β” structure with the β-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis. By using a variety of biophysical techniques including multidimensional NMR, we demonstrate that fibril formation involves the formation of a partially structured intermediate(s) in the thermal unfolding pathway of the protein (nFGF-1). Results of the anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate binding experiments indicate that fibril formation occurs due to the coalescence of the protein (in the intermediate state(s)) through the solvent-exposed non-polar surface(s). In this study, we also demonstrate that organic osmolytes, such as proline, can efficiently prevent the thermal induced amyloid formation in nFGF-1. Proline is found to stabilize the native conformation of the protein. The addition, proline is observed to increase the cooperativity of the unfolding (native ↔ denatured) reaction and consequently decrease the population of the “sticky” thermal equilibrium intermediate(s) responsible for the fibril formation.

Amyloid fibril formation is associated with a number of human pathologies including Alzheimer's disease, light chain amyloidosis, and familial amyloidosis (10Sunde M. Blake C.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The morphology of the amyloid fibrils is similar despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology among the amyloidogenic proteins (12Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Kocisko D.A. Lansbury P.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4107-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, a variety of proteins with no apparent relation to any human disease has been shown to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro (14Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M.

In this context, there is an increasing belief that the ability to form amyloid fibrils is a generic property of the polypeptide chains (18Dobson C.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). However, this proposal has not mustered sufficient strength because proteins belonging to many important structural classes such as the β-barrel proteins have not been shown to form amyloid fibrils under any condition(s). Several organic osmolytes including betaine, proline, and trimethyl N- oxide accumulate in cells under stress conditions (19Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowolus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3042) Google Scholar). The osmolytes along with the heat shock proteins are known to aid in stabilizing proteins against heat and pH-induced denaturation (20Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In addition, the organic osmolytes have been shown to prevent protein aggregation (during refolding) in vitro (21Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Ganesh G. Jayaraman G. Yang P.W. Chang M.M. Trivedi V.D. Wang S.L. Hwang K.C. Chang D.K. Yu C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that osmolytes control protein folding through preferential hydration of the exposed backbone and side chains of proteins in their unfolded state(s) (22Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). However, the exact mode of action of the organic osmolytes is still not very clear.

Furthermore, by using a variety of biophysical techniques we show that amyloid-like fibril formation in nFGF-1 involves the formation of a partially structured intermediate state(s). In addition, we also demonstrate that organic osmolytes such as proline can effectively inhibit the formation of amyloid-like fibrils in nFGF-1. newt fibroblast growth factor thioflavin T Congo Red anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate Fourier-transformed infrared Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Labeled 15NH4Cl, D2O, and (2,2,2-trifluoro ethanol)-d3 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (magnesium salt), thioflavin T (ThT), and Congo Red (CR) were purchased from Sigma. Unless otherwise mentioned, all solutions were made in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm sodium chloride. Recombinant newt acidic fibroblast growth factor (nFGF-1) was prepared from transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The nFGF-1 DNA construct consisting of 486 bp was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The expressed protein was purified on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column over a NaCl gradient (0–1.5 m). Desalting of the purified protein was achieved by ultrafiltration using an Amicon set up. The purity of the protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE. The first 22 residues of the full form of nFGF-1 were digested by subjecting the expressed full form of nFGF-1 to the action of chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin digestion was carried out by incubating the column material (heparin-Sepharose containing the bound protein) with the enzyme (at an enzyme to protein ratio of 20:1) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.65 mNaCl. The incubated mixture was stirred mildly at room temperature for 3 h. The incubated material was repacked into a column and washed with 10 mm phosphate containing 0.85 m NaCl until the absorbance of the eluate plateaued to a steady base line. Truncated nFGF-1 was later eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1.5 m NaCl. The homogeneity of the truncated nFGF-1 sample was checked by SDS-PAGE. The authenticity of the truncated sample was verified by electron spray mass analysis. Protein concentration was estimated based on the extinction coefficient value of the protein at 280 nm. It should be stated that the truncated newt FGF-1, which we name nFGF-1, is used in all the experiments described in this work. 15N isotope labeling was achieved using M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl. To realize maximal expression yields, the composition of the M9 medium was modified by the addition of a mixture of vitamins. The expression host strain E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS is a vitamin B1-deficient host, and hence the medium was supplemented with thiamine (vitamin B1). Protein expression yields were in the range of 25–30 mg/liter of the isotope-enriched medium. Purification and chymotrypsin digestion methods to obtain truncated nFGF-1 were the same as described above. The extent of 15N labeling was verified by electron spray mass analysis. All turbidometric measurements were made on Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer equipped with a variable temperature circulator. Protein samples were heated at appropriate temperatures by placing in the sample compartment of the instrument. The aggregation of the protein was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 350 nm. All measurements were made after incubating protein samples for 5 min at the required temperature. The concentration of the protein used was 100 μg/ml. Steady state fluorescence measurements were made on a Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorimeter fitted with variable temperature Neslab water bath. All spectra were acquired using an excitation and emission slit width of 5 and 5 nm, respectively. For the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments, the protein sample was excited at 280 nm, and the emission was monitored in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm. nFGF-1 unfolding profiles were analyzed using standard procedure(s). The ANS binding experiments were performed at various temperatures by mixing 200 μm dye with the protein (at a concentration of 100 μg per ml). The emission spectra (in the range of 400–600 nm) of the dye was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm. Appropriate blank corrections were made in all the spectra. CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The data were acquired in the far-UV region (200–320 nm) using a water-jacketed quartz cell of 0.02 cm path length. The concentration of the protein used was 100 μg/ml. Necessary blank corrections were made in all the spectra. The thermal unfolding data of nFGF-1 were analyzed using standard procedures. The affinity of Congo Red (25 μm) to bind to nFGF-1 at various temperatures was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of the dye at 480 nm in the presence of the protein (at a concentration of 100 μg/ml) using a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer. All measurements were made after incubating the protein sample along with the dye (at appropriate temperature) for 5 min. ThT binding assay was performed on a Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorimeter. The emission spectra of the dye were acquired (in the wavelength range of 450–600 nm) at various temperatures using an excitation wavelength of 440 nm. All spectra were corrected for background noise. Colloidon-coated copper EM grids were placed coated side-down for 30 s onto sample drops containing the thermal induced amyloid fibrils of nFGF-1. The grids were then retrieved, excess solvent was removed by blotting with filter paper, and the sample was stained with 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 30 s. Grids were then blotted again and air-dried before analysis. The data were acquired on a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope. FTIR spectra were acquired on a BOMEM DA8 FT spectrometer. Lyophilized native nFGF-1 and the aggregates formed at 65 °C (and cooled to 20 °C for 48 h) were dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator, and the dry powder of the protein/protein aggregate was enclosed in a KBr tablet by the conventional high pressure method. Thermal denaturation (20–60 °C) of nFGF-1 was monitored by dissolving the protein in 99% D2O. All spectra were acquired with a wave number resolution of 2 cm−1. For each spectrum 64–200 interferograms were collected and averaged, and Happ-Genzel apodization function was applied before Fourier transformation. All processing procedures were carried out to optimize the quality of the spectra in the amide I region between 1600 and 1700 cm−1. Thermal induced amyloid fibrils generated at 65 °C (and cooled to 20 °C for 48 h) in 10 mmphosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The fibrils were then suspended between the ends of two wax-filled glass capillaries and were allowed to dry. The diffraction data were collected on a CuKα rotating anode equipped with a 180 or 345 nm Image plate. The fibril images were analyzed using the display program IPDISP run on a personal computer. All NMR experiments we carried out on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The temperature-dependent amide protein chemical shifts in nFGF-1 were monitored from 1H-15N HSQC over a temperature range of 20–60 °C at 5 °C intervals. The probe with a self-shielded gradient was used to obtain all gradient enhanced1H-15N HSQC spectra. 15N decoupling during acquisition was accomplished using the GARP sequence. A total of 2048 complex data points was collected in the 1H dimension of the 1H-15N HSQC experiments. In the15N dimension of the spectra, 512 complex date points were collected. The concentration of the protein sample was 1.5 mm. 15N chemical shifts were referenced using the consensus ratio of 0.010132918. All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station using the XWINNMR and AURELIA software. Fibroblast growth factors, including nFGF-1, lack disulfide bonds. The secondary structural elements in this class of proteins include 12 β-strands arranged into a β-barrel architecture (Fig. 1, see Refs. 23Arunkumar A.I. Srisailam S. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M.

The protein (nFGF-1) aggregates when heated beyond 50 °C, and the aggregation is maximum at 65 °C (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the 350 nm absorbance is observed to decrease beyond 65 °C implying that the extent of aggregation of the protein decreases at higher temperatures (>65 °C, Fig. 2). The aggregates formed by nFGF-1 are found to possess a fibrous texture. nFGF-1 is heated to 65 °C (for 5 min) and cooled to 20 °C for about 48 h and formed a semi-gel like material. Formation of such slimy viscous material is indicative of the formation of amyloid-like fibrils (9Chiti F., De Lorenzi E. Grossi S. Mangione P. Giorgetti S. Caccialanza G. Dobson C.M. Merlini G.

It should be mentioned that increasing the duration of heating (beyond 5 min) at 65 °C or increasing the incubation time (at 20 °C) beyond 48 h following heating at 65 °C (for 5 min) did not appreciably affect the physical morphology (as observed from the transmission electron microscope data and the infrared spectral characteristics of the amyloid-like fibrils).Figure 2Temperature-induced aggregation of nFGF-1 was monitored by the change in absorbance at 350 nm. Maximum aggregation of the protein occurs at 65 °C. The decrease in the absorbance beyond 65 °C probably reflects a decrease in the extent of aggregation of the protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Congo Red is a useful dye to detect the formation of amyloid fibril(s) (28Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Congo Red has been shown to bind preferentially to aggregated peptides/proteins of amyloid but not to the native, unassembled forms (28Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We performed the Congo Red binding experiments to examine if the aggregates of nFGF-1 formed at higher temperatures (>50 °C) have characteristics of the amyloid fibril. The absorption intensity of Congo Red at 490 nm increases progressively when the protein is heated beyond 50 °C (Fig. 3 A). The absorption intensity is observed to be maximum at 65 °C implying that maximum accumulation of the amyloid-like fibrils occurs at 65 °C. Significant red shift is observed in the absorption spectrum when the dye binds to the protein in the aggregated state (Fig. 3 A, inset). Such a prominent red shift in the absorbance maxima is attributed to the strong intercalation of the dye (Congo Red) into the ordered, intermolecular β-pleated sheet structure of the amyloid fibrils. The decrease in the absorbance intensity (at 490 nm) of the dye could be possibly attributed to a decrease in the population of the protein molecules forming the amyloid-like fibril(s) (Fig. 3 A). ThT is a fluorescent dye that is known to detect reliably the formation of amyloid fibrils (29Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.E. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehoole C. Terenius L. Thyberg J. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The emission intensity of the dye is known to increase significantly upon binding to the linear array of β-strands in the amyloid fibrils (24Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugan K. Lin W.Y. Chin D.H. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4134-4141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B depicts the changes in emission intensity of ThT (in the presence of nFGF-1) at various temperatures. A 7-fold increase in the emission intensity of the dye is observed at 65 °C. The steep increase in the emission intensity is accompanied by a prominent blue shift in the wavelength of emission maxima of the dye (Fig. 3 B, inset). The emission intensity of the dye is observed to decrease progressively when the temperature is increased beyond 65 °C. This trend is similar to that observed in the Congo Red binding experiments (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the results of the Congo Red and ThT binding assays unambiguously suggest that nFGF-1 forms amyloid-like fibrils at higher temperatures (>50 °C). Amyloid fibrils have a distinct morphology (30Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 31Kelly J.W.

Biol. 1995; 254: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of amyloid fibrils formed in vitro in a variety of proteins show that fibrils have a diameter between 5 and 20 nm and are straight, rigid, and unbranched (33Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai Z.H. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Transmission electron micrographs of the aggregates of nFGF-1 formed at 65 °C and analyzed immediately (upon cooling) at 20 °C show a mesh of beaded structures with an average diameter of about 10 nm. Such types of beaded fibrils have also been observed for the protofibrils formed by Aβ and α-synuclein (34Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Although no concrete explanation is yet available to account for the formation of beaded amyloid fibrils, it is believed that the shape and structure of the protofibril formed the initial stages of the fibrillization process and dictate the final morphology of the mature amyloid (34Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy studies monitoring the events in the fibrillization process in α-synuclein revealed the formation of spherical aggregates during the early stages of fibril formation (35Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fazoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

Neurol. 1999; 158: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The beaded fibrils formed at 65 °C upon incubation at 20 °C for about 48 h and transformed into long unbranched and filamentous fibrils with an average diameter of about 20 nm (Fig. 4). Thus, it appears that in nFGF-1, the protofibrils formed at higher temperatures (>60 °C) grow and reorganize to mature amyloid-like fibrils upon prolonged incubation (to about 48 h) at room temperature (∼20 °C). Such slow time-dependent protofibril to mature amyloid fibril transformation has been observed in several proteins (29Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.E. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehoole C. Terenius L. Thyberg J. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the physical basis for the ultrastructural changes in the amyloid fibril is still not clearly understood. Small angle x-ray has been successfully used as a reliable tool to probe the structure of amyloid fibrils (38Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils in general, exhibit a “cross-β” structure with β-strands, disposed perpendicular to and backbone hydrogen bonds parallel to the fibril axis (38Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, we used small angle x-ray as a probe to gain better structural insights on the fibrils formed by nFGF-1. Two strong reflections can be observed in the diffraction image (Fig. 5). The meridional reflection at about 4.8 Å which primarily arises from the spacing between the β-sheet structure is broad but still intense. The equatorial reflection, which is generally attributed to the intersheet spacing, is strong and diffused and occurs at 10.3 Å. The 4.8- and 10.3-Å reflections generally constitute the cross-β pattern that is typical of amyloid fibril(s) (38Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the results of the electron microscopy and small angle x-ray experiments authenticate that the aggregates formed during the thermal unfolding of nFGF-1 possess features resembling that of the amyloid fibrils. It is important to understand the mechanism underlying the thermal induced amyloid-like fibrils formed by nFGF-1. In this context, we monitored the thermal unfolding of nFGF-1 using fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. The amino acid sequence of nFGF-1 shows a single tryptophan located at position 121 (23Arunkumar A.I. Srisailam S. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Peng C.L. Chen C. Chiu I.M. Yu C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, fluorescence spectrum of nFGF-1 (in its native state) shows a single peak centered at 308 nm (Fig. 6 A, inset). The emission of the lone tryptophan is quenched due to the presence of proximal imidazole and pyrrole groups in the three-dimensional structure of nFGF-1 (23Arunkumar A.I. Srisailam S. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Peng C.L. Chen C. Chiu I.M. Yu C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 24Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugan K. Lin W.Y. Chin D.H. Yu C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39444-39450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, this quenching effect is relieved upon unfolding the protein and the 350 nm band characteristic of tryptophan emission could be discerned in the spectrum (Fig. 6 A, inset). Therefore, the ratio of the 308 nm to the 350 nm emission could be reliably used to monitor the conformational transitions occurring during the unfolding of the protein. nFGF-1 begins to unfold at around 45 °C, and the unfolding is complete at 60 °C (Fig. 6 A). Thermal unfolding profile of nFGF-1 obtained by monitoring the ellipticity changes in the far UV CD (at 228 nm) also shows a similar trend as that revealed using changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 6 B). However, the far-UV CD spectrum of nFGF-1 acquired at 65 °C shows an intense negative ellipticity band at around 215 nm implying the presence of residual β-sheet secondary structural elements under these conditions (Fig. 6 B). Prediction of the secondary structural elements in the protein at 65 °C using the Yang secondary structure prediction algorithm (39Chen Y, H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) revealed that more than 70% of the backbone (of the protein) is in a random coil conformation. The β-sheet content under these conditions only accounts for 20% of the structure. Comparison of the unfolding profile(s) of the protein (monitored by tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV CD), with the results of the turbidometric, Congo Red, and thioflavin T experiments, clearly suggests that the amyloid-like fibril formation in nFGF-1 occurs due to the coalescence of the protein in a partial structured state, wherein significant portion(s) of the native secondary and tertiary structural interactions are lost. 1-Anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate (ANS) is a hydrophobic dye that is routinely used to detect solvent-exposed non-polar surface(s) in proteins (40Mathews C.R.

Through a yeast two-hybrid screening for the effectors of Etk, a new gene family designated as RUFY was identified. The RUFY gene family (RUFY1 and RUFY2) contains an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal FYVE domain with two coiled-coil domains in-between. They appear to be homologues of a recently identified mouse Rabip4 (Cormant, M., Mari, M., Galmiche, A., Hofman, P., and Le Marchand-Brustel, Y. (2001)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 1637–1642). RUFY proteins are localized predominantly to endosomes as evidenced by their co-localization with early endosome antigen marker (EEA1). Etk interacts with RUFY1 through its SH3 and SH2 domains. RUFY1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and appears to be a substrate of Etk. The RUFY1 mutant lacking the phosphorylation sites failed to go to the endosomes. Furthermore, overexpression of Etk in COS-1 and B82L cells resulted in increased plasma membrane localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor and delayed its induced endocytosis in COS-1 cells. The effects of Etk were blocked by the FYVE domain of RUFY1. Interestingly, the FYVE domain of RUFY1 is targeted to the plasma membrane through an interaction between its proline-rich motif and the SH3 domain of Etk or possibly some other membrane-associated SH3 domain-containing protein(s), whereas the lipid binding activity of the FYVE domain is not required.

Etk was identified previously from a human prostate tumor xenograft (3Robinson D., He, F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As with other members of the Btk kinase family, Etk has multiple signaling modules including a PH domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Over the past decade it has been very well established that these protein modules involved in protein-protein interaction play a critical role in signal transduction (see Refs. 9Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholarand 10Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). The PH domain is shown to bind PI3-kinase products such as PIP3 and some protein partners. The SH3 domain is involved in binding to proline-rich motifs and the SH2 domain interacts with phosphotyrosine residues in a sequence-specific context. To date, many protein-interacting partners for each module of BTK family kinases have been identified through various biochemical approaches or functional screenings such as the yeast two-hybrid system (see Ref.11Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of Etk requires two steps: 1) translocation of Etk to plasma membrane induced by the interaction between the PH domain of Etk and one of its ligands such as the PI3-kinase product PIP3, βγ subunits of the trimeric G protein, or the FERM domain of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK); and 2) subsequent phosphorylation of Tyr-565 in the catalytic domain by Src family kinases, which allows the kinase to be activated. Some of the downstream effectors that are required for Etk to exert its biological functions (such as Stat3) have been identified (5Tsai Y.T., Su, Y.H. Fang S.S. Huang T.N. Qiu Y. Jou Y.S. Shih H.M.

In the present study we report that a novel gene family designated as theRUN and FYVE domain-containing (RUFY) protein family has been identified as the downstream effector of Etk. Previous studies demonstrated that the downstream effects of PI3-kinase signaling are in many cases mediated by proteins containing a PIP3 binding moduledenoted FYVE finger domain. The signature of the FYVE finger domain is the sequence CX2CX8(R/K)(R/K)HHCRXCX4CX2CX16CX2C, which comprises two zinc binding sites. Many FYVE domain-containing proteins are localized at endosomes and play an important role in endocytosis (13Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol.

Here we present evidence that Etk interacts with RUFY1 through the SH3 and SH2 domains and that tyrosine phosphorylation of RUFY1 by Etk appears to be important for its endosomal localization. Our study suggests that Etk may play a role in the regulation of endocytosis as a downstream effector of PI3-kinase.RESULTSTo better understand the function of Etk a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to search potential effectors of Etk. More than 20 positive preys were identified. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed one of the preys to be approximately 1.2 kb and to contain a characteristic poly(A) signal. It did not have homology with any known human genes but had many matched sequences in the EST data base. It appeared to be the 3′ part of a novel gene. The full-length cDNA of this gene was then cloned by 5′-RACE. Fig.1A shows the predicted amino acid sequence of this gene and its alignments with the related proteins, which together form a gene family. The alignments reveal several conserved functional domains in this gene family including an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal FYVE domain with two coiled-coil domains in-between (Fig. 1B). Therefore, this gene is designated as RUFY1. RUFY2, a homologue of RUFY1, also has been identified by searching the human EST data base and was subsequently cloned from human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Northern analysis of the human multiple tissue blot using a probe specific for RUFY1/2 indicated that RUFY1 is quite abundant in many tissues examined including brain, kidney, liver, lung, placenta, and testis (Fig. 1C). Expression of RUFY2 seems to be relatively restricted and can only be detected in brain, lung, and testis. RUFY1 appears to be the human ortholog of the recently identified mouse Rabip4 gene, a Rab4 effector involved in early endosomal trafficking (17Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the tissue distribution of RUFY1 is quite different from Rabip4. For example, Rabip4 is highly expressed in mouse heart but not in testis (17Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas neither RUFY1 nor RUFY2 could be detected in human heart, but both were highly expressed in testis (Fig. 1C). These data imply that mouse Rabip4 and human RUFY1/2 are regulated by different mechanisms and that one or more new RUFY family member(s) may remain to be uncovered.Localization of RUFY1Many FYVE domain-containing proteins have been shown to localize at endosomes (13Stenmark H.

A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We examined whether RUFY1 is also targeted to endosomes. Full-length RUFY1 was fused with GFP and overexpressed in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig.2A, RUFY1 was primarily localized to the punctate structures that were EEA1-positive (indicated by arrows), suggesting that RUFY1-GFP goes to endosomes. It is noteworthy that the endosomes (indicated by arrows) in the cells overexpressing RUFY1 appear to be much larger than their counterparts (indicated by arrowheads) in untransfected cells. To define the sequence element responsible for endosomal targeting of RUFY1 we generated a series of deletion mutants (Fig.2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the mutants RUFY1(1–473) and RUFY1(1–418), lacking the FYVE domain, still went to endosomes, although the sizes of these endosomes were smaller in comparison to those in wild-type RUFY1-expressing cells. Two N-terminal deletion mutants, RUFY1(216–473) and RUFY1(216–418), also localized to endosomes. These observations suggest that neither the RUN domain nor the FYVE domain seems to be involved in endosome targeting of RUFY1. On the other hand, the deletion of the second coiled-coil domain (RUFY1Δcc) completely abolished endosomal localization of RUFY1. In addition, the mutant RUFY1(216–418) containing the two coiled-coil domains efficiently targeted to endosomes. Taken together, these data indicate that the two coiled-coil domains are the determinate factors for targeting RUFY1 to the endosomes.FIG. 2Localization of RUFY1 and its mutants. A, co-localization of RUFY1 and EEA1. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-RUFY1-GFP for 24 h. The cells were then fixed and incubated with anti-EEA1 antibody followed by staining with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Images were obtained using a confocal microscope. The transfected cells are indicated by arrows, and the non-transfected cells are indicated by arrowheads. The yellow color in the merged image represents the extent of the localization of EEA1 (red) and RUFY1-GFP (green). B, schematic representations of the GFP-tagged deletion constructs of RUFY1 for expression in COS-1 cells. C, targeting of RUFY1 to endosomes by the coiled-coil domains. COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated construct for 24 h. Confocal images of the transfected live cells were obtained using a water immersion objective.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interaction between RUFY1 and EtkTo verify that RUFY1 indeed interacts with Etk as observed in the yeast two-hybrid system we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the coiled-coil domains of RUFY1. As indicated in Fig. 3A, endogenous Etk was co-immunoprecipitated with RUFY1 by anti-RUFY1 antibody from C2C12 cell lysates when the cells were cultured in medium containing serum. The interaction between Etk and RUFY1 was diminished when the serum was withdrawn from the medium, suggesting that this interaction is regulated by some extracellular stimulus present in the serum. The interaction between Etk and RUFY1 or RUFY2 also occurred when we co-expressed T7-tagged Etk and FLAG-tagged RUFY1 or RUFY2 together in COS-1 cells (Fig. 3B).FIG. 3Both SH3 and SH2 domains of Etk are involved in interaction with RUFY1. A, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Etk with RUFY1 in C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were cultured in Complete growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (+S) or subjected to serum starvation (−S) for 24 h prior to harvest. The cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-RUFY1 antibody followed by immunoblotting (IB) using the antibodies as indicated.B, interaction of T7-tagged Etk with FLAG-tagged RUFY1 and RUFY2. COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-Etk antibody, which was followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (top) or anti-T7 antibody (middle). The bottom panel shows a Western blot of the total cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody to monitor the expression level of RUFY1 or RUFY2 in the samples. C, both SH3 and SH2 domains of Etk are involved in interaction with RUFY1. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged RUFY1 and T7-tagged Etk or its mutants for 24 h. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described inB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To understand how this interaction is regulated we set out to define the domain(s) of Etk involved in binding RUFY1. As shown in Fig.3C, deletion of the PH, SH3, or SH2 domain individually had little effect on Etk binding to RUFY1. However, deletion of both the SH3 and SH2 domains together (ΔSH) dramatically disrupted the interaction. On the other hand, SH domain (SH3 and SH2 domain) alone is sufficient to bring down RUFY1. These data suggest that both SH3 and SH2 domains of Etk are involved in interaction with RUFY1.Because the SH2 domain of Etk is involved in interaction with RUFY1, and this interaction is stimulated by serum, we reasoned that RUFY1 may be tyrosine-phosphorylated and that phosphorylation may mediate its interaction with the SH2 domain of Etk. Therefore, we examined the effect of Etk on RUFY1 in the absence of serum. Fig.4A shows that co-expression of RUFY1 with the wild-type Etk but not with the kinase-inactive mutant EtkKQ results in elevated phosphotyrosine content of RUFY1. Mutation of the conserved Tyr-281 and Tyr-292, which are located in the linker region of the two coiled-coil domains, respectively, has a limited effect on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, mutation of both tyrosine residues completely abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation of RUFY1 induced by Etk. Interestingly, the localization of the RUFY1 mutant Y281F/Y292F was no longer localized at endosomes (Fig. 4B), suggesting that localization of RUFY1 is dynamically regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. This is consistent with a recent report that the endosomal localization of Rabip4, the mouse homologue of RUFY1, is disrupted by the PI3-Kinase inhibitor Wortmannin (20Mari M. Macia E., Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42501-42508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because PI3-kinase is one of the upstream kinases of Etk, and Wortmannin has been shown to block IL6-induced activation of Etk (4Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), Etk very likely may be one of the downstream effectors of PI3-kinase regulating vesicle trafficking by phosphorylating the endosomal protein RUFY1. To demonstrate further that tyrosine phosphorylation of these two residues is involved in its interaction with Etk, we tested the binding activity of RUFY1(216–418) and its mutants lacking the phosphorylation sites (Tyr-281 or Tyr-292) with Etk and its mutants lacking the SH2 domain. As shown in Fig. 4C, either deletion of the SH2 domain of Etk or mutation of the phosphorylation site(s) led to the loss of interaction between the two proteins. These data suggest that the SH2 domain of Etk interacts with the tyrosine-phosphorylated RUFY1 and that both phosphorylation sites (Tyr-281 and Tyr-292) appear to be required for efficient interaction with Etk.FIG. 4Tyrosine phosphorylation of RUFY1. A, Etk induces tyrosine phosphorylation of RUFY1. COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Tyrosine phosphorylation of RUFY1 was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot of the anti-RUFY1 immunoprecipitates (top). T7 antibody was used to detect the expression of T7-tagged Etk and its mutants (middle), and anti-FLAG antibody was used to detect the expression of the FLAG-tagged RUFY1 and its mutants (bottom). B, cellular localization of Rufy1 mutant lacking tyrosine phosphorylation. COS-1 cells were transfected with RUFY1-GFP (left) or RUFY1Y281F/Y292F-GFP (right) for 24 h. The images were captured as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. C, interaction between the SH2 domain of Etk with tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr-281 and Tyr-292. COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs for 24 h. The association between Etk and the coiled-coil domains of RUFY1 (RUFY1(216–418)) or its mutants with Y281F or Y294F substitution was determined by immunoprecipitation using anti-Etk antibody followed by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody (top). The expression of FLAG-tagged RUFY1 mutants and T7-tagged Etk was monitored by Western blot using either anti-FLAG (middle) or anti-T7 (bottom), respectively.D, interaction between the SH3 domain of Etk with the proline-rich motif of RUFY1. Experiments were performed as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To understand the mechanisms by which the SH3 domain of Etk binds to RUFY1 we examined the amino acid sequences of both RUFY1 and RUFY2 and identified a conserved SH3 domain recognition motif PXXPXP located in the FYVE domains of the RUFY family proteins. The substitution of two proline residues (Pro-578 and Pro-590) to alanines abolishes its binding to the Etk mutant lacking the SH2 domain (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that there are two possible interfaces between Etk and RUFY1. One is the interaction between the SH2 domain of Etk with phosphorylated Tyr-281 or Tyr-292, and another is the interaction between the SH3 domain of Etk with the proline-rich motif in the FYVE domain. Thus, both SH3 and SH2 domains of Etk are involved in interaction with RUFY1.Modulation of EGFR Localization by Etk and the FYVE Domain of RUFY1To examine whether the interaction between Etk and RUFY1 plays a role in regulation of endocytosis of the membrane proteins, we cotransfected the EGFR-GFP fusion construct with Etk and the FYVE domain of RUFY1 into the B82L cell line that lacks endogenous EGFR. As shown in Fig. 5A, when EGFR-GFP was co-expressed with a vector control, EGFR-GFP was primarily localized in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and a small fraction of EGFR-GFP was present diffusely on the plasma membrane. While co-expressed with Etk the amount of plasma membrane localized EGFR-GFP was dramatically increased. Interestingly, the Etk-induced plasma membrane localization of EFGR-GFP was significantly inhibited by expression of the FYVE domain of RUFY1 but not the FYVE domain mutant FYVE(PP/AA) that lacks the proline-rich motif recognized by the Etk SH3 domain. In parallel, we also examined the effects of Etk and the FYVE domain of RUFY1 on EGF-induced MAPK activation in these cells. Fig. 5B shows that Etk enhanced EGF-induced MAPK activation in B82L cells, presumably by increasing the level of EGF receptor on the plasma membrane because expression of Etk alone in B82L cells has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation (data not shown). Overexpression of the FYVE domain dramatically diminished EGF-induced MAPK activation, whereas the mutant FVYE(PP/AA) did not. Thus, there is a correlation between the amounts of plasma membrane-localized EGFR and the efficiency of EGF-induced MAPK activation in B82L cells. These data suggest that Etk might be able to modulate the basal endocytosis rate of EGFR in B82L cells either by preventing early endosome formation or by promoting the EGFR-GFP-containing endosome recycling back to the membrane. To address this issue we examined the effects of Etk and the FYVE domain of RUFY1 on endocytosis of the endogenous EGFR in EGF-treated COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, in the control-transfected cells EGFRs underwent extensive internalization after 15 min of EGF-treatment, which is evidenced by the dramatic increase of EGFR in the punctate endosomes. While in the Etk-transfected cells a large fraction of EGFR remained on the plasma membrane, and greatly reduced internalization could be detected in comparison with its counterpart in the untransfected cells. Co-expression of the FYVE domain of RUFY1 but not the FYVE(PP/AA) mutant can reverse Etk effects. Our data suggest that Etk may enhance plasma membrane localization of EGFR and delay its ligand-induced endocytosis. The interaction between Etk and the FYVE domain of RUFY1 seems to be a negative regulator in this process.FIG. 5Modulation of the localization of EGFR by Etk and the FYVE domain of RUFY1. A, localization of EGFR in B82L cells. B82L cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-EGFR-GFP-FLAG with the indicated constructs for 24 h. HA-tagged FYVE domain constructs (encoding amino acids 529–600 of RUFY1) were used in this study. The images were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. B, correlation between EGF-induced MAPK activation and the efficiency of membrane localization of EGFR. Transfections were performed as above. Activation of MAPK by EGF was determined by Western blot using anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. Expression of MAPK, EGFR, and FYVE domain was monitored by Western blot using the indicated antibody. C, regulation of ligand-induced endocytosis of the endogenous EGFR by Etk. Expression vectors containing the indicated genes were cotransfected with GFP marker into COS-1 cells. The cells were serum-starved for 6 h before they were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed immediately. EGFR was detected by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-EGFR antibody. Transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP marker.D, cellular localization of the FYVE domain of RUFY1 and its mutants. HA-tagged FYVE domain (FYVE) and its mutants FYVE(PP/AA), FYVE(HH/SS), or FYVE(R/A) were detected by staining with anti-HA antibodies and visualized by a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody as described in the legend to Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To understand how the FYVE domain of RUFY1 exerts its effects on localization of EGFR, we examined the localization of the FYVE domain of RUFY1. To our surprise the FYVE domain was primarily localized on plasma membrane, whereas the FYVE(PP/AA) mutant was in cytosol (Fig.5D). Membrane localization of the FYVE domain did not require lipid binding activity because the mutation of several critical residues (H554H555 and R557) in the lipid binding pocket of the FYVE domain had little effect on membrane targeting, although the corresponding mutations in Rabip4 and EEA1 have been shown to abolish the lipid binding activity of their FYVE domains (20Mari M. Macia E., Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42501-42508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Gaullier J.M. Ronning E. Gillooly D.J. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24595-24600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the plasma membrane targeting of the FYVE domain of RUFY1 depends on the interaction between its proline-rich motif and the SH3 domain of Etk, and this seems to be correlated with its ability to inhibit the membrane localization of EGFR.DISCUSSIONIn this report we demonstrated that RUFY1 is a downstream effector of Etk. Similar to many FYVE domain-containing proteins, RUFY1 is localized predominantly to endosomes. However, the FYVE domain is dispensable for its endosomal targeting, which is similar to the case of Hrs (22Hayakawa A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29636-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two coiled-coil domains appear to be the determinate factor for endosomal localization of RUFY1. Phosphorylation of the two tyrosine residues, Tyr-281 and Tyr-292, located in the linker region of the two coiled-coil domains by Etk seems to be critical for RUFY1 targeting to the endosomes. Phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues may have an impact on the conformation of the coiled-coil domains and their interactions with some endosomal proteins that are essential for localizing RUFY1 to endosomes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of RUFY1 is required for its endosomal targeting, which coincides with the PI3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin and blocks the endosomal localization of Rabip4 (20Mari M. Macia E., Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42501-42508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a mouse homologue of RUFY1. These observations strongly suggest a role of Etk in the regulation of vesicle trafficking as a downstream effector of PI3-kinase. This theory is corroborated further by our observation that Etk can modulate the membrane localization of EGFR in B82L cells. Our preliminary data suggest that Etk may also regulate the membrane presentation of some other cell surface molecules such as integrins and adhesion proteins. 2Y. Qiu, unpublished data. This is in agreement with the observation that the XID (x-linked immune deficiency) cells lacking functional Btk have a tendency to form aggregates (1Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which likely is caused by the deregulation of some plasma membrane proteins in these cells. It is possible that Etk and its homologues may exert their influence through phosphorylation of and/or interaction with some vesicle-associated molecules such as RUFY family proteins.We also showed that two interfaces between Etk and RUFY1 possibly exist; one is the"

Aβ peptide is generated by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is the product of a gene located on human chromosome 21 and on mouse chromosome 16. APP is expressed in most mammalian tissues (2Goldgaber D. Lerman M.I. McBride O.W. Saffiotti U. Gajdusek D.C. Science. 1987; 235: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 3Cheng S.V.

Although the physiological role of APP is still unclear, several studies have suggested that it is implicated in important physiological functions of neurons, such as neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, cell substrate adhesion and neuronal survival (for review see Ref. 6Mattson M.P.

Aging. 1992; 13: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that mice overproducing Aβ1–42 extracellularly showed no neuronal loss (10LaFerla F.M. Tinkle B.T. Bieberich C. Haudenschild C. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that Aβ peptide seems not to be the only constituent in neurotoxicity associated to AD. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of full-length APP induced degeneration of postmitotic neurons derived from embryonal carcinoma cells (11Yoshikawa K. Aizawa T. Hayashi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Moreover, intracellular accumulation of wild-type APP in the rat hippocampus caused a specific type of neuronal degeneration in vivo in the absence of extracellular Aβ deposition (12Nishimura I.

Furthermore, it has been found that the familial AD-associated mutant Val-642 of APP caused neuronal DNA fragmentation independently of Aβ1–42 production (16Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T.

It has been demonstrated that APP possesses a cytoplasmic Go-stimulating domain that associates with GTP-binding proteins, supporting the idea that APP may act as a cell surface receptor (16Yamatsuji T.

Because the nature of the endogenous ligand that binds APP remains unknown, several studies have used antibodies against different extracellular domains of APP to mimic a ligand-receptor interaction. In this study, we analyzed APP signaling mechanisms activated by antibody binding. It is largely documented that cysteine proteases are crucial executors of apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 22Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Among the protease activated during the neuropathological process such as AD, there are cysteinyl proteases-like caspases and calpains (23Gervais F.G., Xu, D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W.

A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are proteolytically processed to generate active subunits by cleavage at specific aspartic acid residues. Their roles as mediators of apoptosis in a wide range of the cell types are reported (22Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Among the identified caspases, caspase-3 is of particular interest as it appears to be a common downstream apoptosis effector and promotes neuronal death during brain development (25Kuida K. Zheng T.S., Na, S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama h. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Calpain is an intracellular cysteine protease, constitutively expressed in all vertebrates in which they are highly conserved across species and have been characterized in a wide variety of cell types and tissues. Calpains are considered to participate in various signaling pathways mediated by Ca2+ through modulating the activities and/or functions of other proteins (26Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Two ubiquitous isozymes are known, μ- and m-calpains (also called calpains I and calpains II, respectively), which differ in their sensitivity to Ca2+. Calpains have been reported previously to be activated under oxidative stress conditions in P19, PC12 cells, and in cerebellar granule cells (27Ishihara I. Minami Y. Nishizaki T. Matsuoka T. Yamamura H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 279: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Ray S.K. Fidan M. Nowak M.W. Wilford G.G. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L.

We have previously reported that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) plays an anti-apoptotic role in cerebellar granule cells (30See V. Boutillier A.L. Bito H. Loeffler J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CaMKIV is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a large variety of substrates and is involved in the regulation of gene transcription (31Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,32Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Its major nuclear target protein is the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). Both CaMKIV activity and CREB phosphorylation on its serine 133 residue promote neuronal survival (30See V. Boutillier A.L. Bito H. Loeffler J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D.

In this study, we generated and used a chicken polyclonal antibody (APP-Ab) against the extracellular residues 66–81 localized in the cysteine-enriched, NH2-terminal domain of APP (5Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) to investigate the type of cell death and the intracellular signaling pathways induced by APP-Ab treatment of cortical neurons. We show here that APP-Ab induces neuronal death with neurite disorganization, nuclear condensation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both calpain and phosphatase inhibitors promoted cell survival and restored CaMKIV and CREB levels. Polyornithine, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342), pertussis toxin (PTX), staurosporine (SSP), and mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) were purchased from Sigma. Carbocyanine-3-coupled donkey anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The fluorescent dye 2′7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-APP A4 (22C11 Clone) and mouse anti-APP 643–695 (Jonas) were from Chemi-Con (Temecula, CA). The epitope peptide APP66–81(KEGILQYCQEVYPELQ) was synthesized by Covalab (Lyon, France), as well as the polyclonal antibody against this APP fragment (APP-Ab), which was purified from egg yolk (IgY). The calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO; ALLM CII), the caspase-3 inhibitor II (Z-DEVD-fmk) and the caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal antibody against the caspase-3 active fragment p20 was from R&D System (Minneapolis, MN), and the monoclonal antibody against CaMKIV was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p-CREB, N-CREB, and apopain/CPP32 (caspase-3) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal antibody against α-actin was a kind gift from Dr. D. Aunis (Centre de Neurochimie, Strasbourg, France). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, including goat anti-rabbit IgG and sheep anti-mouse IgG, were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from FVB mice embryos (day 18 of gestation). Briefly, after trypsin/DNase treatment and mechanical dissociation, dispersed cortical neurons were plated onto polyornithine-coated, 96-, 12-, or 6-well plates depending on the experimental protocol. For immunocytochemistry, Hoechst staining, ROS-labeling and transfection experiments, cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips treated likewise. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 μm insulin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. After 1 day in culture, neurons were switched to defined medium without serum (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5 μm insulin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 nm T3, 60 μm putrescine, 100 μm transferrin, and 30 nm sodium selenite), and experiments were performed on day 4. Concentrations of test substances and chemical compounds and the corresponding incubation times are indicated in the figure legends. Embryos were obtained from APP−/− mice or intercrosses of APP+/−APLP2−/− mice as described (35Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rülicke T. Kretzschmar H. Von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Peter H. Wolfer D.P. Müller U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7951-7963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each embryo was dissected and plated separately because of their different genotypes, and all the survival test were performed on cultures from individual embryos. Embryos were genotyped by PCR on DNA obtained from tail biopsies of each embryo as previously described (35Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rülicke T. Kretzschmar H. Von Koch C.

Mitochondrial activity was measured as an indicator of cell viability by a modified procedure of the original method described by Mossmann (37Mossmann T. J. Immuno. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar). After treatment with APP-Ab or SSP (in 96-well culture plates), defined medium was changed to a freshly prepared medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, MTT-containing medium was removed, and dark blue crystals formed during reaction in viable cells were dissolved by adding 0.04 n HCl in isopropanol. Plates were read on a Metertech S960 micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay platereader, using a test wavelength of 490 nm and a nonspecific wavelength of 650 nm for background absorbency. Results are presented as a percentage of survival taking control condition as 100% (defined medium without any treatment). Cell staining was performed using an indirect immunofluorescence technique. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 plus 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min. A monoclonal antibody against the neuronal cytoskeletal protein MAP2 was diluted 1/500 in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, cells were incubated with carbocyanine-3-coupled donkey anti-mouse-IgG diluted 1/200 in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were mounted with Fluoromount and stored at 4 °C until observation. Quantification of apoptotic cells was determined by direct visual counting after nuclear staining of 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cells with the fluorescent probe Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Hoechst fluorescence was visualized with an AMCA filter (excitation, 350 mm; emission, 450 mm), and only those neurons containing clearly fragmented nuclei or condensed chromatin were scored as being apoptotic. One hundred neurons are examined per field and five randomly selected fields per experimental condition were analyzed with a 20× objective. Caspase-3 activity was determined by measuring the release of AMC from the caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC as previously described by Przywara et al. (38Przywara D.A. Kulkarni J.S. Wakade T.D. Leontiev D.V. Wakade A.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in 6-well plates were washed with PBS and lysed on ice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% igepal NP-4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. 50 μl of lysate was added to a reaction mixture containing reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) plus 50 μm of Ac-DEVD-AMC. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10× ice-cold lysis buffer. Fluorescence of free AMC was determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7000 Bioassay reader (Foster City, CA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 465 nm, respectively. One part of the lysates was used for protein determination by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). A standard curve of known AMC concentrations allowed conversion of fluorescence values into picomoles of released AMC/min. All presented results were obtained after 1 h of enzymatic reaction, which is in the linear phase as determined by kinetics measurements (not shown). Cortical neurons cultured in 10-cm-diameter plates were treated either with 5 μg/ml APP-Ab or 10 μmSSP. After 24 h of treatment, neurons were washed with PBS and lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm EDTA and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. Centrifugation at 15,000 rpm eliminated cell debris. The supernatant was incubated with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 100 mg/ml proteinase K, 10 mm Tris–HCl, pH 8, 40 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS for 1 h at 45 °C. After a phenol/chloroform (v/v) treatment, the upper phase was precipitated with sodium acetate and washed with ethanol. Lysates were treated with 1 mg/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA samples were resuspended in TE and electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. ROS were detected with H2DCF-DA, which produces a green fluorescence when oxidized (39Schwarz M.A. Lazo J.S. Yalowich J.C. Reynolds I. Kagan V.E. Tyurin V. Kim Y.M. Watkins S.C. Pitt B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15238-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the indicated incubation times, cells were loaded with 10 μm H2DCF-DA for 30 min at 37 °C and immediately observed under a microscope with a 20× objective. The number of both fluorescent and total cells was determined in five randomly selected fields per experimental condition. Cells from six-well culture plates were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To standardize gel loading, protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay. Samples were then supplemented with β-2-mercaptoethanol and denatured for 3 min at 100 °C. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were separated with SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To ensure a correct protein transfer, membranes were colored with Ponceau Red. After washing, nonspecific labeling was blocked with 10% blotto (10% non-fat dry milk in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in 3% blotto. After washing, membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1/2000 for sheep anti-mouse IgG or 1/5000 for goat anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were performed at least three times, and representative blots are shown. The relative optical density of the immunoreactive bands was quantified using the Bio-Rad analysis software Multi-Analyst. The expression vector used was pSV2-CREB-VP16 (a generous gift from Dr. C. Bancroft, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), which encodes a chimera protein where CREB-(1–341) is fused to the transcription activator region of VP16, thus generating a constitutively active CREB protein (40Yan G. Chen X. Bancroft C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Neuronal gene transfer was performed as reported previously, using polyethyleneimine 25 kDa (PEI 25K, Sigma) as DNA carrier (41Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Sherman D. Demeinex B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). After 4 days in vitro, cell cultures on glass coverslips placed in 12-well plates, were transfected with 1.5 μg/ml plasmid. DNA plasmid containing the expression construct was mixed with the EGFP-expression vector (CLONTECH) in a ratio of 3/1 by weight and diluted in 150 mm NaCl. This mixture was then mixed with the PEI, and after 10 min of incubation, the DNA/PEI mixture was added to the cells for 30 min. One day after transfection and recovery in fresh medium, cells were treated with APP-Ab. After 24 h of APP-Ab treatment, cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), and Hoechst 33342 was added (1 μg/ml). The GFP-positive cells were inspected by an observer who was unaware of the treatment condition being evaluated. The “blind” observer scored each fluorescent cell as apoptotic or not based on nuclear morphology (visualized by Hoechst fluorescence). We estimate that ∼0.1–1% cortical cells were GFP-positive. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. values. Statistical significance was assessed by means of one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. In the present study, biological effects evoked by application of a chicken polyclonal anti-APP were investigated in primary cultures of cortical neurons. The APP-Ab was generated in chicken against residues 66–81 of APP localized in the cysteine-enriched, NH2-terminal domain (5Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). This antibody revealed an immunoreactive band migrating on SDS-PAGE at 120 kDa, which corresponds to APP, at the same position as recognized by the 22C11 antibody, a commercially available monoclonal anti-APP antibody (Fig. 1 a). Cell viability studies showed a toxic effect induced by this antibody in dissociated cortical neurons. Fig. 1 b illustrates a dose-dependent effect on cell death after 24 h of treatment, as determined by MTT assay. Five and 10 μg/ml provoked a significant increase in cell death (50 and 55%, respectively), whereas lower doses exhibited little effect. The 5 μg/ml dose induced a time-dependent cell death that was detected early at 12 h and became significant at 24 and 48 h of culture (50 and 81%, respectively) (Fig. 1 c). Based on these results, and unless otherwise indicated, neurons were treated with 5 μg/ml APP-Ab for 24 h in further experiments. To determine the specificity of APP-Ab-induced cell death, its effect was compared with different positive and negative controls (Fig. 1 d). Preincubation of APP-Ab with the synthetic peptide containing its antigenic epitope significantly attenuated neuronal damage. As positive control, we used the 22C11 monoclonal antibody. It provoked 52% of cell death under these experimental conditions. A negative control, the mouse monoclonal antibody Jonas, which reacts with the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal end of intact APP, had no effect on neuronal survival. These data suggest that the action of APP-Ab on APP triggers neuronal cell death through a specific interaction with its extracellular domain. SSP, a protein kinase inhibitor known to induce neuronal apoptosis (42Patel M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), caused 70% of cell death in our experimental conditions. This control is included in all further experiments. APP belongs to a multigene family that also includes two other homologs named amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2) (4Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Neurobiol.

The signaling receptors for PGN and LPS are now known to be the Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and -4, respectively). While a large body of literature indicates that the members of the TLR family activate nearly identical cytoplasmic signaling programs, several recent reports have suggested that the functional outcomes of signaling via TLR2 or TLR4 are not equivalent. In the current studies, we compared the responses of the secretory IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1Ra) gene to both LPS and PGN. Both LPS and PGN induced IL-1Ra gene expression; however, the combination of both stimuli synergistically increased sIL-1Ra mRNA expression and promoter activity, suggesting that the signals induced by PGN and LPS are not equivalent. While both LPS and PGN utilized the PU.1-binding sites in the proximal sIL-1Ra promoter region to generate a full response, additional distinct promoter elements were utilized by LPS or PGN. Activation of p38 stress-activated protein kinase was required for LPS- or PGN-induced IL-1Ra gene expression, but the p38-responsive promoter elements localized to distinct regions of the sIL-1Ra gene. Additionally, while the LPS-induced, p38-dependent response was dependent upon PU.1 binding, the PGN-induced, p38 response was not. Collectively, these data indicated that while some of the intracellular signaling events by TLR2 and TLR4 agonists are similar, there are clearly distinct differences in the responses elicited by these two bacterial products.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cytokine genes in macrophages and monocytes in response to stimulation with bacterial products has been a topic of intense interest. Treatment of monocytes and macrophages with lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria or peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria leads to the production of a vast array of cytokines and chemokines (1Wang Z.M.

Mackman N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Likewise, a large and diverse group of nuclear transcription factors are also activated, including NF-κB, AP-1, PU.1, and interferon regulatory factors (2Guha M. Mackman N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar).

PAMPs are generally unique, chemically diverse products with conserved motifs that are produced by microorganisms. PAMPs often have an essential role in the structure of bacteria and generally cannot be subtly modified as a result of mutation. Examples include LPS (specifically lipid A), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoproteins, bacterial DNA, and bacterial flagella. At least nine different TLRs have been identified. In some cases, the bacterial ligand has also been identified. For example, TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan (4Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol.

In general, the cascade of events occurring following ligation of the different TLRs involves the activation of a common set of adapter proteins and protein kinases, the best characterized of which leads to the activation of NF-κB (reviewed in (8Bowie A.

Whereas a large body of literature indicates that the members of the TLR family activate a nearly identical intracytoplasmic signaling program, several recent reports have begun to suggest that the functional outcomes of signaling via TLR2 or TLR4 are not equivalent. As early as 1996, Dziarski et al. (9Dziarski R. Jin Y.P. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with LPS or PGN resulted in similar, but not identical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. More recently, Hirschfeld et al. demonstrated that LPS derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (a TLR2 ligand) or E. coli (a TLR4 ligand) induced differential expression of a number of genes in murine macrophages (10Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V., V Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C. Qureshi N. Michalek S.M. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Likewise, Jones, et al. demonstrated that a secreted TLR2 agonist from culture filtrates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coliLPS induced distinct patterns of cytokine production by RAW 264.7 macrophages (11Jones B.W. Means T.K. Heldwein K.A. Keen M.A. Hill P.J. Belisle J.T. Fenton M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 1036-1044PubMed Google Scholar).Interleukin-1 is one of the most highly inflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes/macrophages in response to stimulation with LPS. The discovery of a naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has suggested a means of modulating the IL-1-induced inflammatory response (12Arend W.P. Adv.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The term IL-1Ra actually refers to three closely related proteins. The first form to be described, secretory or sIL-1Ra, was cloned from IgG-stimulated human monocytes and encodes a protein of 177 amino acids, including a 25-amino acid hydrophobic leader sequence, which is subsequently cleaved, resulting in a secreted 152-amino acid mature protein (14Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Verderber E. Brewer M.T. Hannum C.H. Thompson R.C. Nature. 1990; 343: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). An alternative form of IL-1Ra, intracellular or icIL-1Ra, was cloned from an adherent monocyte cDNA library (18Haskill S. Martin G. Van Le L. Morris J. Peace A. Bigler C.F. Jaffe G.J. Hammerberg C. Sporn S.A. Fong S. Arend W.P. Ralph P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3681-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This structural variant is created when an alternative first exon is spliced into an internal acceptor site in the first exon of the sIL-1Ra RNA within the region encoding for the secretory leader sequence. Thus icIL-1Ra is identical to the mature sIL-1Ra protein except for seven additional amino acids at the amino-terminal end, and icIL-1Ra lacks the hydrophobic leader sequence required for secretion. At the genomic level, distinct promoters separated by nearly 10 kb of DNA control the expression of sIL-1Ra and icIL-1Ra. Both forms of IL-1Ra are equally effective at inhibiting IL-1-induced cellular responses in vitro. However, given the strictly cell-associated nature of icIL-1Ra, its role in modulating extracellular inflammatory responses remains to be determined. A third, low molecular weight form of IL-1Ra, termed icIL-1RaII, is derived from an alternative translation initiation at the second ATG of either the sIL-1Ra or icIL-1Ra mRNA (19Malyak M. Guthridge J.M. Hance K.R. Dower S.K. Freed J.H. Arend W.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1997-2003PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role of this form is unknown.Previously, we have demonstrated that both isoforms of the human IL-1Ra genes are transcriptionally activated in macrophages in response to LPS. Our own studies on the regulation of the human secretory IL-1Ra promoter have demonstrated that NF-κB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, STAT6, and most recently PU.1 and GABP are involved in regulating gene expression in macrophages (20Smith M.F., Jr. Eidlen D. Arend W.P. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3584-3593PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smith M.F., Jr. Carl V.S. Lodie T.A. Fenton M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24272-24279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Of these, PU.1 appears to be the most critical for the response of the sIL-1Ra gene to LPS. The response of the sIL-1Ra gene to PGN has not previously been evaluated. In the current studies, we have compared the responses of the sIL-1Ra gene to both LPS and PGN. Here we report that both LPS and PGN can induce sIL-1Ra gene expression; however, the combination of both stimuli synergistically up-regulated sIL-1Ra gene expression and promoter activity, suggesting that the signals induced by PGN and LPS are not equivalent. Both LPS and PGN utilized the PU.1-binding sites in the proximal promoter region to generate a full response; however, additional distinct promoter elements were utilized by LPS or PGN. We determined that the activation of p38 SAPK was an important component of the response elicited by LPS and PGN but that the p38-responsive promoter elements localized to distinct regions of the sIL-1Ra gene. Additionally, while the LPS-induced p38-dependent response was dependent upon PU.1 binding, the PGN-induced, p38 response was not. Collectively, these data indicated that while some of the intracellular signaling events induced by TLR2 and TLR4 agonists are similar, there are clearly distinct differences in the responses elicited by these two TLR ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsLPS (E. coli serotype 055:B5) was obtained from Sigma. Prior to use, LPS was subjected to an additional purification procedure as described by Hirschfeld et al. (22Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in LPS that was free from contaminating endotoxin protein and is a specific TLR4 agonist. Peptidoglycan purified from Staphyloccous aureus was purchased from Fluka. The selective p38 inhibitor SB203580 was obtained from Alexis Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA).Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR AnalysisTotal RNA was purified using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, RT of 0.5 μg of total cellular RNA was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 1 mm concentration of each dNTP, 20 units of placental RNase inhibitor, 5 μm random hexamer, and 9 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the samples were heated for 5 min at 92 °C to end the reaction and stored at −20 °C until PCR use. 2 μl of cDNA was subjected to real time, quantitative PCR using the iCycler (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as a fluorescent reporter. sIL-1Ra and GAPDH cDNAs were amplified in separate reactions. Threshold cycle number was determined using the iCycler software, and levels of sIL-1Ra expression were normalized to GAPDH levels using the formula 2( Rt − Et ), where Rt represents the threshold cycle for the reference gene (GAPDH) and Et is the threshold cycle for the experimental gene (sIL-1Ra). Data are thus expressed as arbitrary units. Primer sequences were as follows: sIL-1Ra F, AAATCTGCTGGGGACCCTAC; sIL-1Ra R, TCCCAGATTCTGAAGGCTTG; GAPDH F, GTGTGAACGGATTTGGCCGT; GAPDH R, GAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCGT.DNA ConstructsHuman TLR2, TLR4, and MD-2 Expression PlasmidsHuman TLR2 and TLR4 cDNAs corresponding to the entire coding regions were generated by RT-PCR using primers corresponding to the published sequences and cloned into pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The human MD-2 expression construct was generated by RT-PCR and cloned into pEF6/myc-His (Invitrogen) to generate a molecule containing amino-terminal c-Myc and His6 tags. Sequences of all clones were confirmed by automated sequencing.IL-1Ra Genomic Clone IsolationA gridded array of P1 clones that was approximately 2 times representative of the human genome was a kind gift of Drs. Fiona Watt and Hans Lehrach (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). The library was screened by hybridization with a cDNA probe for exon 2 of human IL1RN, and clone ICRF700G13105 was identified. The clone contained ∼80 kb of genomic DNA. DNA was isolated and digested with various rare cutters. BstZI was used to generate a fragment that contained the entire ILRN gene, as determined by hybridization with oligonucleotides derived from exon 1 and the 3′-end of exon 4. A 23-kb BstZI fragment was subcloned into a pUC9 derivative that had been modified to replace its linker with a NotI site containing a stuffer sequence. 2M. Nicklin, unpublished observations. The stuffer sequence was removed with NotI, and the cohesive BstZI fragments from the P1 clone were ligated. Recombinant plasmids were screened by hybridization. Sequencing of the 5′-end of the insert indicated that the entire IL1RN gene was present. This construct was termed pRNZ1.IL-1Ra Promoter/Luciferase Reporter ConstructsA 7.1-kb sIL-1Ra promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed by cloning a 6.8-kb KpnI genomic fragment derived from pRNZ1 into the unique KpnI site at −294 of the human sIL-1Ra promoter in pA3Luc (20Smith M.F., Jr. Eidlen D. Arend W.P. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3584-3593PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter deletions from the 5′-end were created by standard subcloning techniques using convenient restriction enzyme sites or PCR. Site-directed mutants were initially generated in the 294-bp proximal promoter construct by recombinant PCR and verified by sequencing. A 3.1-kb genomic fragment, corresponding to sequences from approximately −3400 to −294, was subcloned into pBS-SK and then inserted into the KpnI site as above to generate mutants in the context of the full-length 3.4-kb sIL-1Ra promoter.The human CD14 expression vector was a gift of R. Ulevitch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), and dominant negative MKK3 and MKK6 plasmids were gifts of R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). NF-κBLuc was from CLONTECH. All plasmid DNAs were isolated by using endotoxin-free preparation kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) or Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).Cell Culture and TransfectionThe RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured and transfected, and luciferase activities were measured as previously described (21Smith M.F., Jr. Carl V.S. Lodie T.A. Fenton M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24272-24279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Each transfection contained 500 ng of NF-κBLuc, 50 ng of TLR2 or TLR4, 50 ng of pEF6-MD2, 100 ng of pRc/RSVCD14, 200 ng of pTK-renilla (Promega), and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE. Transfections were performed in triplicate, cultured for 40 h, and then stimulated as indicated for an additional 8 h. Luciferase activities were determined using the dual luciferase kit from Promega, and all activities were normalized to the activity of the cotransfected TK-renilla plasmid.Western Blot AnalysisAntibodies were obtained as follows: p38 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-p38 from New England Biolabs; and anti-FLAG (M2) from Sigma. For analysis of p38 phosphorylation, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were stimulated for the indicated time with LPS or peptidoglycan, washed one time with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in situ with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. DNA was sheared by passage through a 25-gauge needle; lysates were boiled for 5 min and iced; and 10 μl was loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were electroblotted unto nitrocellulose, and phosphorylated p38 was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of the antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Detection was carried out using the ECL reagent fromAmersham Biosciences. Blots were stripped of antibodies by washing in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 50 min at 50 °C. The filters were then washed in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 and reprobed for total p38.For detection of FLAG-tagged dominant negative MKK3 or MKK6, equal amounts of protein from cell lysates of RAW 264.7 cells transfected with expression vectors for the dominant negatives or control empty vector were immunoprecipitated using the M2 antibody, electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and detected using the anti-FLAG antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendations.DISCUSSIONOver the past few years, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of cells of the innate immune system to microbial products has increased dramatically. The identification of mammalian Toll-like receptors as the cell surface proteins that distinguish between different bacterial products and transduce signals to the responding cell was a highly significant finding. Interestingly, although the different TLRs recognize a wide variety of chemically diverse bacterial products, most studies have indicated that they activate a similar series of intracellular signaling molecules (reviewed in Ref. 30Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Several recent papers have suggested that the signals generated by TLR2 and TLR4 are not equivalent. Hirschfeld et al. (10Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V., V Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C. Qureshi N. Michalek S.M. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) compared the responses of 11 different genes in macrophages to LPS derived from E. coli or P. gingivalis (TLR4 and TLR2 ligands, respectively). While the induction of mRNA for genes such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and IL-1β was equivalent for E. coli or P. gingivalis LPS, other genes such a IL-6 and IL-12p40 were at best only weakly induced by the TLR2-specific LPS. Likewise, Jones et al. (11Jones B.W. Means T.K. Heldwein K.A. Keen M.A. Hill P.J. Belisle J.T. Fenton M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 1036-1044PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that whereas both LPS and a soluble TLR2 agonist from culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis (mannosylated phophatidylinositol) could induce tumor necrosis factor-α production, only LPS was capable of inducing IL-1β and nitric oxide secretion. One possible molecular mechanism for the differential signaling downstream of TLR2 and TLR4 has been provided by the recent identification of a second, receptor-proximal adapter protein (in addition to MyD88) that participates in TLR4 but not TLR2 signaling (31Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 32Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar).In this report, we have provided evidence that different Toll-like receptor ligands can activate the same gene through different mechanisms. We studied the regulation of the gene for the secreted IL-1 receptor antagonist in response to the TLR2 agonist PGN and the TLR4 agonist E. coli LPS. While both PGN and LPS could induce sIL-1Ra gene expression and promoter activity to approximately equal levels, the combination of the two stimuli resulted in a synergistic increase in both mRNA accumulation and promoter activity. This result suggested that stimulation of macrophages with PGN or LPS did not generate equivalent intracellular signals. These findings were confirmed when we determined that different regions of the human sIL-1Ra promoter were required for full responsiveness to LPS or PGN. Whereas the responses to both LPS and PGN required the previously identified PU.1-binding sites in the proximal promoter region, the response to LPS also utilized at least two more distally located promoter elements. The response to PGN required an additional element within the proximal 300-bp and an additional region located between 3400 and 2800 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The most distal response element for PGN co-localized with a region required for full LPS-responsiveness. Although we have not yet identified the transcription factors that are differentially activated by LPS and PGN, these are the first studies that we know of that clearly indicate that activation of macrophages via LPS and PGN can result in the activation of different DNA-binding proteins. Studies are currently in progress to definitively identify the transcription factors that are differentially activated in response to LPS and PGN.In these studies, we also examined the role of p38 SAPK in the regulation of IL-1Ra gene expression induced by PGN and LPS. Treatment of macrophages with either LPS or PGN resulted in the activation of p38 SAPK, albeit with somewhat different kinetics (Fig. 4). Our results are generally consistent with those previously published by Dziarski et al. (9Dziarski R. Jin Y.P. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that LPS was a more potent inducer of p38 activity than PGN. The reason for the delayed activation of p38 in response to PGN is unclear but could relate to receptor density or the requirement for other TLRs, such as TLR6, to be recruited into the complex (33Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar).Northern blot analysis of LPS and/or PGN treated RAW 264.7 cells demonstrated that pretreatment with the p38-inhibitory pyridinyl imidazole compound SB203580 resulted in a decrease in IL-1Ra mRNA expression. The mode of action of p38 in the regulation of LPS-induced gene expression is very much gene-dependent. In some instances (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α), inhibition of p38 activity was demonstrated to result in accelerated mRNA decay (34Wang S.W. Pawlowski J. Wathen S.T. Kinney S.D. Lichenstein H.S. Manthey C.L. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of p38 activity blocked LPS-induced neuroleukin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 gene expressions without affecting mRNA stability, suggesting a role for p38 in the transcriptional regulation of those genes (35Manthey C.L. Wang S.W. Kinney S.D. Yao Z. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The ability of p38 to regulate mRNA stability is likely to relate to the presence of AU-rich elements found within the 3′-untranslated regions of many cytokine genes (34Wang S.W. Pawlowski J. Wathen S.T. Kinney S.D. Lichenstein H.S. Manthey C.L. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. ller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 37Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The sequence of the IL-1Ra 3′-untranslated region does not contain the typical AUUUA sequences found in other labile cytokine mRNAs that are regulated by p38 and is unlikely to be regulated by p38-dependent post-transcriptional mechanisms. This hypothesis was confirmed in transient transfection assays with IL-1Ra promoter constructs. Similar to the mRNA analysis, pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with SB203580 prior to LPS and/or PGN stimulation significantly inhibited promoter activity. Thus, both TLR2-induced and TLR4-induced IL-1Ra expression have as a requirement the activation of p38 SAPK. Surprisingly, the LPS- and PGN-induced p38 responses mapped to different regions of the IL-1Ra promoter and displayed differing requirements for the previously identified PU.1-binding sites.The mechanism through which PU.1 regulates LPS-inducible gene expression is unclear. Earlier studies determined that PU.1 can be inducibly phosphorylated by casein kinase II in response to LPS stimulation of macrophages, and this phosphorylation appears to be required for the transactivation function of PU.1 (38Lodie T"

Although we have defined a role for Rit-mediated signal transduction in the regulation of cell proliferation and transformation, the function of Rin remains largely unknown. Because we demonstrate that Rin is developmentally regulated and expressed in adult neurons, we examined its role in neuronal signaling. In this study, we show that stimulation of PC6 cells with either epidermal growth factor or nerve growth factor (NGF) results in rapid activation of Rin. This activation correlates with the onset of Ras activation, and dominant-negative Ras completely inhibits Rin activation induced by NGF. Further examination of Ras-mediated Rin activation suggests that this process is dependent upon neuronally expressed regulatory factors. Expression of mutationally activated H-Ras fails to activate Rin in non-neuronal cells, but results in potent stimulation of Rin-GTP levels in a variety of neuronal cell lines. Furthermore, although constitutively activated Rin does not induce neurite outgrowth on its own, both NGF-induced and oncogenic Ras-induced neurite outgrowth were inhibited by the expression of dominant-negative Rin. Together, these studies indicate that Rin activation is a direct downstream effect of growth factor-dependent signaling in neuronal cells and suggest that Rin may function to transduce signals within the mature nervous system.

Ras proteins function as GTP/GDP-regulated switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound conformational state to regulate a wide variety of cell functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Ras proteins respond to extracellular stimuli by exchanging GTP for bound GDP, thereby triggering intracellular signaling cascades through their interaction with a variety of target proteins (2Campbell S.L.

The NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line has been used extensively as a model system to study this signal transduction process (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 6Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Kaplan D.R.

Ras activates additional downstream effectors, including Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which play important roles in the process of neuritogenesis (10Datta S.R. Brunet A.

Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of Ras signaling via the expression of dominant-negative mutant protein or microinjection of anti-Ras inhibitory antibodies represses differentiation induced by NGF (14Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Hagag N. Halegoua S. Viola M. Nature. 1986; 319: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Recently, the Rin/Rit/dRIC branch of the Ras subfamily has been described (16Lee C.H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem.

These Ras-related proteins lack a known recognition signal for C-terminal lipidation, a modification that is generally necessary for the subcellular localization and biological function of the majority of Ras-like GTPases. Additional unique features of this Ras subfamily include a distinct but conserved G2 core effector domain and a C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain for Rin and RIC (16Lee C.H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As an initial step in the biological characterization of Rit and Rin, we investigated their ability to regulate signaling pathways used by other Ras family proteins to control cell growth and transformation. These studies demonstrated that Rit signaled to Ras-responsive elements and transformed NIH3T3 cells to tumorigenicity (19Rusyn E.V. Reynolds E.R. Shao H. Grana T.M. Chan T.O. Andres D.A. Cox A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, Rin had little or no activity in these assays; thus, no characterization of its cellular function has yet been performed. In this study, we investigated the involvement of Rin in NGF-induced signaling cascades in pheochromocytoma cells. Using an affinity activation assay, we demonstrate that growth factor stimulation of neuronal cell lines results in the rapid activation of Rin. Experiments characterizing this signaling cascade reveal that Rin activation appears to rely upon Ras and additional, perhaps neuronal-specific, regulatory factors. The role of Rin in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was also examined. Although the expression of wild type or constitutively active Rin had no effect on neurite extension in PC6 cells, dominant-negative Rin suppressed NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, constitutively active H-Ras-induced neurite outgrowth was also suppressed by dominant-negative Rin. These studies suggest that Rin may play a critical role in transducing growth factor-dependent signals that are involved in maintaining normal nervous system function. PC6 is a subline of PC-12 cells that produces neurites in response to NGF but grows as well isolated cells rather than in clumps. The PC6 line used in these studies was the parental line described by Pittman et al.(20Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was the generous gift of Dr. Thomas Vanaman (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). PC6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, whereas Vero and MCIXC cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. These lines were also maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. NGF (Becton Dickinson) and epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma) were administered at a dose of 100 ng/ml. Transfection of PC6, Vero, and MCIXC cells was performed using Effectene (Qiagen). For Rin and H-Ras activation assays, PC6 cells (7.5 × 104 cells/60-mm plate) were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the indicated mammalian expression plasmid mixed with 8 μl of enhancer and 10 μl of Effectene according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (21Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for wild type and mutant H-Ras and Rin have been described previously (17Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pCGN-HA-RasWT and pDCR-Ras(V12) effector domain mutant vectors were the kind gift of Dr. Adrienne Cox (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), whereas pCDNA-Sos1-C AAX and pCDNA-GRF1-C AAX were the gift of Dr. Lawrence Quilliam (University of Indiana School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). 5′-EcoRI and 3′-BamHI sites were introduced to wild type H-Ras by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated DNA amplification. The PCR product was subcloned to the corresponding sites in pEGFP-C1 to generate the GFP-tagged wild type H-Ras mammalian expression vector. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate dominant-negative H-Ras (Ras(N17)) using pEGFP-RasWT as described previously (17Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All PCR products were verified by DNA sequence analysis. HA epitope-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). GFP fusion proteins were detected using anti-GFP Living Colors antibody (CLONTECH) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as described (22Finlin B.S. Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Guo N. Andres D.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Andres D.A. Shao H. Crick D.C. Finlin B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using a STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test B, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A riboprobe plasmid for mouse Rin was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 228-bp fragment from the N terminus of Rin (amino acids 1–76) and subcloned into pZero-2™ (Invitrogen). The plasmid containing an 89-bp fragment of the mouse ribosomal protein L32 (19Rusyn E.V. Reynolds E.R. Shao H. Grana T.M. Chan T.O. Andres D.A. Cox A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Daniel Noonan (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Antisense radiolabeled riboprobes were prepared using linearized templates and a Maxiscript™ (Ambion) kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNase protection assays were performed as described (24Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protected fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% acrylamide, 8 murea sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for the indicated time. The gel was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SF (model 455A). Simultaneous measurement of the rpL32 transcripts, which encode the L32 ribosomal protein (24Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), served as an internal control for housekeeping gene levels. Primary dissociated cultures of sympathetic neurons were prepared from the superior cervical ganglia of embryonic day 21 rats as described previously (25Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), except that the non-neuronal cells were minimized by incubating the dissociated ganglia for 3 h on plastic culture dishes prior to plating onto laminin-coated 35-mm dishes (∼5,000 cells/dish). Cultures were maintained in culture medium containing 90% minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 μm uridine, and 20 μm fluorodeoxyuridine in the presence of 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF for either 1 (young) or 4 weeks (old). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from the cultured neurons and converted to cDNA, and specific cDNAs were amplified by subjecting 2% of the cDNA to 25 PCR cycles, which is well within the linear range of PCR amplification for these specific genes and primer pairs as described previously (25Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 26Furukawa K. Estus S., Fu, W. Mark R.J. Mattson M.P. J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7736-7745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After amplification, cDNAs were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels, stained with SYBR® Gold (Molecular Probes) and visualized by phosphorimaging technology (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). Primer sequences were Rin sense primer, 5′-CTCTTGCTCGAGACTACAAC-3′, and Rin antisense primer, 5′-CCTTCCTGCGTATTTCTCTC-3′ (105-bp product); neurofilament M sense primer, 5′-ACGCTGGACTCGCTGGGCAA-3′, and neurofilament M antisense primer, 5′-GCGAGCGCGCTGCGCTTGTA-3′ (156-bp product). The identity of the amplified cDNAs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A similar approach was used to examine Rin expression from a series of neuronal cell lines. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA, and specific cDNAs were amplified by subjecting 3% of the cDNA to 20–25 PCR cycles in reactions containing 0.5 ml of [α-32P]dCTP. Reaction conditions were well within the linear range of PCR amplification for these gene/primer combinations. Following amplification, PCR products were separated on 12.5% gels and exposed to film for 24 h. Autoradiograms were used to excise the amplified products and the radioactivity in each band determined by scintillation counting. Measurement of the RPS16 transcripts, which encode the ribosomal protein S16, served as an internal control for housekeeping gene levels. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the Rin and Ras binding domain (BD) of Raf (residues 1–140) was expressed and purified as described (17Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rin and Ras activation was assessed essentially as described previously (28Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Rin activation was monitored in cells transiently transfected with the mammalian expression vector pKH3-RinWT alone or in combination with pKH3-Ras(L61), pDCR-Ras(V12), and the indicated pDCR-Ras(V12) effector mutants, pCDNA-Sos1, pCDNA-GRF1, or pEGFP-Ras(N17), and incubated for an additional 36 h to allow maximal gene expression. Cells were then starved in serum-free DMEM for an additional 12 h and, where indicated, stimulated with growth factors for the indicated times. Cell monolayers were washed once in ice-cold PBS and lysed for 1 min on the plate with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Calbiochem)). Lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and clarified for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. GST-RafBD precoupled to glutathione beads (10 μg of protein/30 μl of resin beads) were added to 200 μg of total cell lysate in a final volume of 400 μl and incubated with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C to initiate the pull-down assay. Following three washes in ice-cold lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Bound proteins and 20 μg of total cell lysate from each sample were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-HA or anti-GFP antibodies. To analyze the role of MEK/ERK signaling in Ras-mediated Rin stimulation, PC6 cells were transfected with pKH3-RinWT, pKH3-Ras(L61), or co-transfected with both expression vectors and incubated for an additional 36 h to allow for maximal gene expression. 24 h after transfection, cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM (± 10 μm PD-98059 as indicated) for 24 h. Fresh serum-free DMEM (± 50 μm PD-98059) was added 2 h prior to the preparation of total cell lysates in ice-cold lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 50 mm KF, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Calbiochem)). HA-Rin-GTP was pulled down using GST-RafBD and analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described above. In vivo guanine nucleotide binding assays were performed essentially as described (29Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Zong H. Castro A.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC6 cells were transiently transfected with pKH3-RinWT or pKH3-Rin(N34) in 60-mm dishes. After 36 h, cells were incubated in serum- and phosphate-free media for 30 min followed by similar medium supplemented with 150 μCi of 32P-labeled orthophosphate for an additional 4 h. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, lysed on the plate for 1 min using ice-cold lysis buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Calbiochem)), clarified by microcentrifugation (10 min at 14,000 rpm), and added to a fresh tube containing 30 μl of glutathione beads precoupled with 10 μg of GST-RafBD. This mixture was incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, after which the beads were collected and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Bound protein was released by the addition of 20 μl of denaturation buffer (0.2% SDS and 2 mm EDTA), the beads incubated at 68 °C for 15 min, and 1 mm GTP and 1 mm GDP added to serve as nucleotide standards. An aliquot of the sample (10 μl) was spotted to 20-cm poly(ethylene)imine-cellulose TLC plates (EM Separations) for nucleotide separation. The chromatogram was developed using 1 m LiCl2, 1 m formic acid and analyzed as described (22Finlin B.S. Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Guo N. Andres D.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PC6 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells on coverslips placed in six-well dishes. Coverslips were precoated with 5 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h. PC6 cells were transiently transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) with one of the following plasmids: pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-Rin, pEGFP-Rin(L78), pEGFP-H-Ras(L61), pEGFP-Ras(N17), or pEGFP-Rin(N34), and examined by epifluorescence microscopy. Counting the day of transfection as day 0, cells were either not subject to growth factor stimulation or were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) on day 2 and then fixed on day 5. Cells were then washed three times in CM-PBS (1.26 mmCaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.91 mm MgSO4) and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in CM-PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in CM-PBS for 5 min, blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in CM-PBS, incubated with Texas Red-X-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 20 min, and washed extensively prior to mounting. For studies using HA-tagged H-Ras(L61), slips were fixed and blocked as above, incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibody for 20 min, washed with CM-PBS, and incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse (1:1000 dilution, Vector Laboratories). Fixed and stained slips were mounted on glass slides with 12 μl of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined under the appropriate illumination with a 40× objective lens on an E600 microscope (Nikon). Cells were scored positive for neurite outgrowth if one or more neurites exceeded 1 cell body diameter in length. At least 200 cells were counted per experiment with each experiment performed in triplicate. PC6 cells were transiently transfected as described above with the empty pKH3 vector control, pKH3-Rin(V29), or pKH3-Ras(L61). Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h to allow maximal gene expression and serum-starved overnight in DMEM. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on the plate with phospholysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 3 mmEGTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmvanadate, 50 mm KF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, equal amounts of protein as determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, using a standard SDS-PAGE protocol. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with either polyclonal anti-ERK (New England Biolabs) or a phosphospecific ERK antibody (Promega) and developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences). ERK activity was also monitored by immunoblot analysis following immunoprecipitation. PC6 cells were transfected as above with an expression vector encoding HA epitope-tagged ERK (the kind gift of Dr. Ginell Post, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) in combination with GFP-tagged Rin(L78), GFP-Ras(L61), or control plasmids. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h to allow maximal gene expression, serum-starved overnight in DMEM, and lysates prepared in phospholysis buffer. HA-ERK was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of whole cell lysate using anti-HA antibody (5 μg) prebound to a slurry of protein G-Sepharose/protein A-Sepharose (80:20 mix). Bound proteins were eluted by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C in 20 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated protein and 50 μg of total cell lysate were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-ERK (New England Biolabs), phosphospecific mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK antibody (Promega), or polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH). To address the tissue distribution of Rin, an exhaustive ribonuclease protection assay was performed (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression pattern seen with the closely related Rit GTPase and majority of Ras family proteins (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 16Lee C.H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the mouse Rin gene was expressed exclusively in neuronal tissues. Rin mRNA was most abundant in brain and spinal cord, with detectable levels found in the eye, but not in an extensive series of additional tissues. In the adult mouse brain, Rin was expressed in all of the subregions examined, with highest expression in the mid-hind region of the brain. Ribonuclease protection analysis was also used to examine Rin expression during murine development. As seen in Fig. 1 B, Rin expression was initially detected in total RNA prepared from the heads of 14-day mouse embryos, and expression levels continued to steadily increase within the brain until ∼20–25 days after birth, at which time Rin expression reached a plateau (Fig. 1 B). This high level of expression continued in adult neuronal tissues. Although the restricted and developmentally controlled expression of Rin in neural tissues suggested that Rin was expressed in neurons, it is possible that Rin is expressed in other cell types, such as supporting cells or fibroblasts. To determine whether Rin is expressed in neurons, primary cultures of superior cervical ganglia were prepared from embryonic day 21 rats and incubated in the presence of NGF for 6 days (immature sympathetic neurons) or 30 days (mature neurons) and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A (upper panel), Rin mRNA was not detected in immature neuronal cultures, but in mature superior cervical ganglia robust Rin expression was observed. No significant changes were seen in the mRNA level of the constitutively expressed gene neurofilament M under these same conditions (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). To extend these results, and to identify a cultured cell system in which to examine the biological function of Rin, we examined Rin expression in a series of neuronal cell lines. RT-PCR analysis found Rin to be expressed in all of neuronal cell lines tested (Fig. 2 B); Northern blot analysis was used to confirm Rin expression in PC6 cells (data not shown). Because the biological function of Rin is largely unknown, we wished to investigate the signaling pathways that lead to Rin activation in neuronal cells. To this end we developed a pull-down assay system to detect the levels of GTP-bound Rin in cells. This assay is based on the proven ability of Ras family effector proteins to interact specifically with the activated, GTP-bound form of their target GTPase. This type of assay has been used previously to assay for activation of a variety of Ras GTPases including Ras, Rap, Ral, and Rho family members (21Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have tracked the biogenesis of Pma1-G381A, a misfolded mutant form of the H+-ATPase. Although this mutant ATPase is arrested transiently in the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum, it does not become a substrate for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation nor does it appear to stimulate an unfolded protein response. Instead, Pma1-G381A accumulates in Kar2p-containing vesicular-tubular clusters that resemble those previously described in mammalian cells. Like their mammalian counterparts, the yeast vesicular-tubular clusters may correspond to specific exit ports from the endoplasmic reticulum, since Pma1-G381A eventually escapes from them (still in a misfolded, trypsin-sensitive form) to reach the plasma membrane. By comparison with wild-type ATPase, Pma1-G381A spends a short half-life at the plasma membrane before being removed and sent to the vacuole for degradation in a process that requires both End4p and Pep4p. Finally, in a separate set of experiments, Pma1-G381A was found to impose its phenotype on co-expressed wild-type ATPase, transiently retarding the wild-type protein in the ER and later stimulating its degradation in the vacuole. Both effects serve to lower the steady-state amount of wild-type ATPase in the plasma membrane and, thus, can explain the co-dominant genetic behavior of the G381A mutation. Taken together, the results of this study establish Pma1-G381A as a useful new probe for the yeast secretory system.

Many proteins that fail to fold properly in the ER are eliminated by a process known as ERAD (ER-associated degradation), which transports them back into the cytoplasm to be degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner by the proteasome (1Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev.

In the event of excessive ER stress, the ER-associated degradation pathway is complemented by the unfolded protein response, a stress response that involves transcriptional induction of a set of target genes encoding ER chaperones and other products involved in ER function (4Friedlander R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 5Mori K.

Misfolded proteins that escape the ER may encounter a second, Golgi-based quality control mechanism, recently detected in yeast, which sends them to the vacuole for degradation (7Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Hong E. Davidson A.R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Luo W.-J.

Finally, recognition mechanisms exist at the plasma membrane to down-regulate many transporters and receptors by endocytosis in response to specific physiological signals (reviewed by Hicke (11Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 12Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)); at least in principle, these or related mechanisms could function to remove misfolded proteins that manage to reach the cell surface (e.g. Ref. 13Wilson M.H. Limbird L.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum wild type fluorescein isothiocyanate hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline vesicular-tubular cluster endoplasmic reticulum wild type fluorescein isothiocyanate hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline vesicular-tubular cluster The present study has focused on the yeast plasma-membrane H+-ATPase as a model to investigate quality control during biogenesis. The H+-ATPase belongs to a large, widely distributed family of transporters known as the P-type cation pumps (14Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar); it is encoded by the PMA1 gene (15Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and is the most abundant protein in the yeast plasma membrane. Work in many laboratories has established that the physiological function of the H+-ATPase is to pump protons out of the cell, setting up the driving force for nutrient uptake by H+-dependent cotransporters (reviewed by Rao et al. (16Rao R. Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Slayman C.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Consistent with predictions from hydropathy analysis (15Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), there is now good evidence from cryo-electron microscopy that the 100-kDa H+-ATPase is embedded in the lipid bilayer by 10 membrane-spanning α-helices, four at the N-terminal end of the molecule and six at the C-terminal end (17Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Its central portion protrudes into the cytoplasm and contains ligand-binding sites needed for catalysis. These structural characteristics are supported by comparison with the 2.6-Å crystal structure of the P-type Ca2+-ATPase from rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum (18Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). The yeast H+-ATPase is known to be delivered to the cell surface via the secretory pathway, since it can be trapped in the ER, Golgi, or secretory vesicles by temperature-sensitive mutations of SEC18, SEC7, or SEC6 (19Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Brada D. Schekman R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2775-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Holcomb C.L.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). More than 300 point mutations have been introduced into the PMA1 gene by site-directed mutagenesis; others have been selected by resistance to hygromycin B (reviewed by Morsomme et al.(23Morsomme P. Slayman C.W. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Taken together, these mutants provide a wealth of material for exploring the relationship between H+-ATPase structure and the components of various quality control mechanisms. A particularly striking example comes from recent work on mutations of Asp-378, a key residue that is conserved in all P-type ATPases and forms a transient β-aspartyl phospho-intermediate during ATP hydrolysis. Unexpectedly, Pma1 H+-ATPases carrying point mutations of Asp-378 are retained in the ER and, when co-expressed with the wild-type ATPase, display a dominant lethal phenotype (16Rao R. Nakamoto R.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ER arrest of Asp-378 mutants has been traced to gross misfolding, as evidenced by the extreme sensitivity of Pma1-D378N, Pma1-D378S, and Pma1-D378A to low concentrations of trypsin (25DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, Wang and Chang (28Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that Pma1-D378N is ultimately ubiquitinated and degraded, presumably by the proteasome. To identify components of the ER quality control machinery, they exploited the dominant lethal phenotype of the D378N mutant to select suppressors from a mutagenized genomic library carrying random insertions of lacZ and LEU2. Indeed, one such suppressor (eps1Δ) allowed Pma1-D378N to move from the ER to the plasma membrane; the corresponding gene (EPS1) proved to encode a novel member of the protein disulfide isomerase-related family, which may function as a quality control chaperone to retain Pma1-D378N in the ER. Chang and co-workers (7Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Luo W.-J. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Luo W.-J. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have also used a temperature-sensitive mutant of the yeast H+-ATPase,pma1–7, to probe the organization of the secretory pathway. At the restrictive temperature, this mutant protein exits the ER but is then shunted from the Golgi to the vacuole for degradation (7Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Screening with a high copy genomic library has yielded two suppressors (AST1 and AST2) whose products, when over-expressed, can re-route Pma1–7 to the plasma membrane (7Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In parallel, 16 different insertional suppressors of pma1–7 have been isolated (9Luo W.-J. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and are being used to define the components of two distinct pathways by which Pma1–7 is diverted to the cell surface (10Luo W.-J. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although there is not yet any direct information on the structure of the Pma1–7 mutant protein, it must be capable of folding relatively well even at 37 °C, since in the presence of an appropriate suppressor mutation, it reaches the plasma membrane, hydrolyzes ATP at a measurable rate, and supports growth (7Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Luo W.-J. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Luo W.-J. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to see whether new information about the yeast secretory pathway could be obtained with the help of a different mutant form of the H+-ATPase, Pma1-G381A, which is moderately sensitive to trypsin and, thus, appears to be intermediate in structure between Pma1-D378N and Pma1–7 (25DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although immunofluorescence studies have shown that Pma1-G381A can reach the plasma membrane, it lacks detectable enzymatic activity and displays a co-dominant phenotype when co-expressed with the wild-type H+-ATPase, suggesting that it may interact in an informative way with one or more components of the quality control machinery. We have carefully tracked the expression of epitope-tagged Pma1-G381A as a function of time. Initially, the mutant protein induces dramatic proliferation of a morphologically well defined compartment derived from the peripheral ER, in which it transiently accumulates along with the ER-resident chaperone Kar2p (BiP). Pma1-G381A then escapes this compartment and reaches the secretory vesicles, still in a misfolded form. As a consequence, it is relatively unstable at the plasma membrane, being removed rapidly by endocytosis for degradation in the vacuole. Significantly, the mutant form is able to impose its phenotype on co-expressed wild-type ATPase, which likewise becomes retarded in the ER and then quickly degraded upon arrival at the plasma membrane. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described by Sherman et al. (35Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (36Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains TFY25 and TFY54 were derived from a cross between NY605 and NY1174; strain TFY1 was derived from a cross between TFY25 and RH268–1; and strains TFY15 and TFY32 were derived from a cross between TFY54 and SY2. For expression studies, derivatives of strains TFY1, TFY15, TFY32, WG4a, and W303 were constructed in which the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene was placed under control of the GAL1 promoter (37Goff C.G. Moir D.T. Kohno T. Gravius T.C. Smith R.A. Yamasaki E. Taunton-Rigby A. Gene. 1984; 27: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by transforming yeast with the integrative plasmid YIpGAL-PMA1 (32Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) linearized with BstEII;URA3 served as the selectable marker in these transformations. The pma1 allele to be expressed was tagged after codon 2 with either a sequence corresponding to a 10-amino acid cMyc epitope plus linking sequences (MTASEQKLISEEDLNDTS) or a 9-amino acid HA epitope (MTYPYDVPDYADTS) (25DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To generate a tagged version of LST1, the cMyc epitope was inserted after codon 13, and this construct was introduced at the LST1 genomic locus using integrative plasmid YIplac128 linearized with StuI. As shown in Table I, tagged versions of pma1 were placed under control of a heat-shock promoter (27Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in integrative plasmid pRS303 (HIS3), YIplac128 (LEU2), or YIplac204 (TRP1) or centromeric plasmid Ycplac22 (LEU2). Integrative plasmids were linearized with NheI (pRS303), AflII (YIplac128), or BsgI (YIplac204) and integrated at the genomic locus corresponding to the selectable marker. The transformants were grown at 23 °C in synthetic complete medium (38Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) lacking uracil and the relevant auxotrophic amino acids and containing 2% galactose. As desired, expression of the GAL1-PMA1 copy was turned off by incubating the cells for 3 h in medium containing 2% glucose instead of galactose, and expression of the tagged PMA1 gene was induced by incubation of the cells at 39 °C.Table IYeast strains and plasmids used in this studyYeast strainsGenotypeOrigin NY605a, leu2–3,112; ura3–52Novick, P.

Cells were fixed, treated with zymolyase T-100, permeabilized by Triton X-100, and stained for immunofluorescence essentially as described by Redding et al. (39Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J.

Primary antibodies that were used included: HA polyclonal (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), diluted 1:100; HA.11 monoclonal 16B12 and cMyc monoclonal 9E10 from raw ascites fluid (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA), diluted 1:150; V-ATPase 60-kDa subunit monoclonal 13D11-B2 from raw ascites fluid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), diluted 1:150; Sec7 (large domain) and Sec12 polyclonal antibodies (provided by R. Schekman (40Franzusoff A. Redding K. Crosby J. Fuller R.S. Schekman R. J.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar)), diluted 1:2500. Goat anti-rabbit FITC and goat anti-mouse Texas Red IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) served as fluorescent secondary antibodies and were diluted 1:100. For double-labeling experiments, both primary antibodies were present during the initial incubation, and both secondary antibodies were present during the subsequent incubation. To control for spurious cross-reactivity of the cMyc and HA antibodies, uninduced cells were simultaneously fixed and stained with each set of antibodies. Cells were then mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Reading, PA). Cells were observed on a Zeiss L510 scanning confocal microscope using dual channel filters for simultaneous visualization of Texas Red and FITC fluorochromes. All images were taken with a 63 × 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat III DIC objective (Zeiss). In time-course experiments, the exact same settings were used throughout the experiment to obtain a semi-quantitative signal. Cross-talk between FITC and Texas Red was avoided through the use of the Zeiss L510 digital signal processor. The absence of bleed-through was confirmed by checking that the signal disappeared when viewed with single-wavelength filter blocks. Images were collected with LSM5 software (Zeiss) and modified by contrast stretching, application of pseudocolor, and merging using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Early logarithmic-phase cells were collected on a 0.22-μm filter and transferred without washing to 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), 0.04 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, 0.8 msorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2. After fixation for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C, the cells were embedded in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) as described by Mulholland et al. (42Mulholland J. Preuss D. Moon A. Wong A. Drubin D. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were cut using a Reichert FC4E ultramicrotome and collected on Formvar/carbon-coated grids. Nonspecific binding sites were quenched using 1% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The grids were incubated with anti-HA antibody (HA.11 monoclonal 16B12; Berkeley Antibody Co.) at a dilution of 1:40 in PBS, 1% fish skin gelatin, then washed in PBS and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceutical, Aurora, OH) at a dilution of 1:50. Finally, they were incubated with protein A-5-nm gold complex (purchased from J. Slot, Utrecht, Netherlands) at a dilution of 1:70. After final washes in PBS, the sections were fixed for 5 min in 1% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS. The sections were contrasted with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips 410 electron microscope. Secretory vesicles were isolated from cells carrying the temperature-sensitive sec6-4 mutation as described previously (43Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the substitution of a multistep discontinuous gradient for the two-step gradient used in the original method. Cells grown to early logarithmic phase in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and tryptophan and containing 2% galactose were shifted for 3 h to medium lacking galactose but containing 2% glucose. The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 39 °C to induce the expression of HA-tagged ATPase and the accumulation of secretory vesicles. After conversion to spheroplasts (32Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubation with concanavalin A (0.8 mg/ml), the cells were broken by Dounce homogenization and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,500 ×g to remove concanavalin A-coated plasma-membranes, mitochondria, and unbroken cells. The supernatant fraction (cell lysate) was centrifuged for 35 min at 160,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was suspended in 3 ml of 12.5% sucrose (w/v), 20 mm triethanolamine/acetic acid, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA containing 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and chymostatin (2 μg/ml). This fraction has been shown in control experiments to contain little, if any, plasma-membrane-associated ATPase. It was further fractionated by loading 2 ml onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (15–60%, consisting of 2.7 ml of 15, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 60% (w/v) sucrose, each in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuging at 100,000 g for 90 min. Fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting or enzyme assays. Trypsinolysis experiments were carried out as described by Nakamoto et al. (27Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E.

Logarithmic-phase cells (A600 nm = 0.5) were suspended in 500 μl of water and broken by the addition of 50 μl of 1.85 m NaOH, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of 50% (m/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of 1 m Trizma (Tris base) and 20 μl of Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), resolved on 10% polyacrylam"

These kinases play versatile roles in numerous cellular events; thus, the activation state of PDK-1 toward these substrates may play an important physiological role in the regulation of a variety of biological activities including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 mouse PDK-1 human PDK-1 Chinese hamster ovary insulin receptor pleckstrin homology, PI, phosphatidylinositol Although the activation of several PDK-1 substrates has been characterized, the mechanism by which PDK-1 activity is regulated in cells is largely unknown. Phosphorylation of protein kinase Cζ and protein kinase Cδ by PDK-1 in vivo has been shown to be inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (6.Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), suggesting that PDK-1 activity is mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Consistent with this finding, it has recently been found that insulin stimulates the activity of PDK-1 toward Akt and that this activation is blocked by wortmannin, another inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, others have found PDK-1 to be constitutively activated (4.Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr.

Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Although activation of PI 3-kinase may be important for the activity of PDK-1 toward some of its downstream substrates, differential phosphorylation of PDK-1 itself may also play an important role in regulating the kinase activity of the enzyme. A recent study identified Ser25, Ser241, Ser393, Ser396, and Ser410 on human PDK-1 (hPDK-1) as phosphorylated sites in cells (17.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Of these sites, phosphorylation at Ser241 was found to be essential for hPDK-1 activityin vitro (17.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, the functional role(s) of PDK-1 phosphorylation at the other sites is unknown. Recently, we found that purified mPDK-1 underwent significant autophosphorylation in vitro (8.Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18.Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the identity of these sites and the extent to which phosphorylation of these residues played a role in PDK-1 function remained unclear. In the present study, we report the identification of two major in vitro autophosphorylation sites on mPDK-1: Thr516 and Ser399. Interestingly, we found that Ser244 in the activation loop of mPDK-1 is only marginally phosphorylatedin vitro. On the other hand, we demonstrate that Ser244, Ser399, and Thr516 of mPDK-1 are phosphorylated in cells and that Ser244 is a major in vivo phosphorylation site. Overexpression of mPDK-1T516E, but not mPDK-1S244E, mPDK-1S399D, or mPDK-1T516A, resulted in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation to a level similar to that of insulin stimulation. Furthermore, this increase in phosphorylation is independent of the PH domain of Akt. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of PDK-1 at multiple sites plays distinct and important roles in the regulation of PDK-1 function in vivo under various cellular conditions.

All mPDK-1 mutants were generated using single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis according to the protocol described by Kunkel et al. (19.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using customized primers. All constructs were verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO/IR), and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were used in all experiments. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were lysed in Buffer B. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was used for either immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. The proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the primary antibody conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads for 6–18 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold Buffer A. For immunoblot analysis, the cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the bound proteins were detected by blotting with primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI). CHO/IR cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged wild type or mutant PDK-1 were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline followed by serum starvation for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in Buffer B, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibody to the tag as described above. The bound protein was washed twice with ice-cold Buffer A and once with Buffer C. Phosphorylation was initiated with the addition of 30 μl of Buffer C plus 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The bound protein was eluted by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylation of PDK-1 was visualized by autoradiography, and the bands corresponding to PDK-1 were excised and used in various assays. CHO/IR cells overexpressing wild type or mutant mPDK-1 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and serum starved for 1 h. The cells were lysed in Buffer B, and Myc-tagged PDK-1 was immunoprecipitated using antibody to the tag. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold Buffer A and once with Buffer C. The activity of mPDK-1 was determined by incubation of the immunoprecipitates with 40 μl of Buffer C containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and PDK1 substrate peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Thr308 of Akt-1 (KTFCGTPEYLAPEVRR) for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated peptide substrate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, spotted on p81 Whatman paper, and washed three times in 1% H3PO4. Peptide phosphorylation by PDK-1 was determined by scintillation counting. CHO/IR cells overexpressing Myc-tagged wild type or mutant PDK-1 were washed once and incubated with warmed Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were labeled with 400–800 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h and then left untreated or treated with 10 nminsulin for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in Buffer B and immunoprecipitated as described above. The bound protein was washed two times with high and low salt wash buffers (20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% NaN3, and either 1 or 0.15 m NaCl) and eluted by heating at 95 °C for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and utilized as described above. In vitro or metabolically 32P-labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (phosphopeptide mapping) or polyvinylidene difluoride (phosphoamino acid analysis) membranes, and excised as described above. The bound protein was blocked with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-360 (Sigma) in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The protein was washed twice with double distilled H2O, washed once with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and subjected to trypsin digest for 18 h at 37 °C. The digests were collected and lyophilized, and the samples were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to a modified protocol by the manufacturer. The samples were loaded on TLC cellulose plates and subjected to electrophoresis and liquid chromatography as described previously (20.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T.

Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that PDK-1 undergoes significant autophosphorylationin vitro. In an attempt to identify PDK-1 autophosphorylation sites, we carried out phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies on in vitro phosphorylated wild type mPDK-1. Our results showed that mPDK-1 autophosphorylated in vitro on both serine and threonine residues at approximately a 1:1 ratio (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Noin vitro phosphorylation was observed for a kinase-inactive mutant of mPDK-1 (mPDK-1K114G) (data not shown). Phosphopeptide analysis of wild type mPDK-1 revealed three major (Fig. 1 A, right panel, 1–3) and nine minor (Fig. 1 A, right panel, a–i) phosphopeptides, suggesting that PDK-1 autophosphorylates multiple sites in vitro. Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphopeptides 1–3 revealed that phosphopeptides 1 and 2 contained exclusively phosphothreonine, whereas phosphopeptide 3 contained only phosphoserine (data not shown). We have recently shown that Ser244 of mPDK-1 is important for PDK-1 function in cells (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ser244 is an in vitro autophosphorylation site, we examined the phosphorylation of wild type and Ser244mutants of mPDK-1 (Fig. 1 B). We found that wild type mPDK-1 underwent significant autophosphorylation in vitro.Replacing Ser244 of mPDK-1 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in the in vitro phosphorylation of the protein. This decrease in phosphorylation was partially recovered by replacing Ser244 with a negatively charged glutamate. Interestingly, substitution of Ser244 with a phosphorylatable threonine residue resulted in an overall increase in autophosphorylation compared with wild type. Replacing Ser244 of mPDK-1 with alanine also led to a significant decrease of the in vitro kinase activity of the enzyme, which was partially recovered by substitution of this residue with either glutamate or threonine (Fig. 1 C). These findings further support Ser244 as an autophosphorylation site and demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site is important for mPDK-1 autokinase activity. To further characterize the role of Ser244 in mPDK-1in vitro autophosphorylation, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies on in vitro autophosphorylated mPDK-1S244A. Our results showed that although overall autophosphorylation of the mutant PDK-1 was significantly decreased compared with wild type (Fig. 1 B), there was no significant change in the overall serine:threonine ratio (Fig. 1, D, left panel versus A, left panel), suggesting that Ser244 is not a major autophosphorylation site in vitro. Consistent with this, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies revealed that despite the significant decrease in overall phosphorylation of this mutant (Fig. 1 B), mutating Ser244 to alanine did not abolish the in vitroautophosphorylation of the three major peptides (peptides1–3) (Fig. 1, D, right panel versus A, right panel). On the other hand, replacing Ser244 of mPDK-1 with threonine led to a notable increase in threonine:serine autophosphorylation compared with the wild type enzyme (Fig. 1, E, left panel versus A, left panel). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies of the mPDK-1S244T mutant showed a significant increase in autophosphorylation of phosphopeptidee compared with wild type protein (Fig. 1, E,right panel versus A, right panel). Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphopeptide e revealed that this peptide contained only phosphoserine for the wild type and exclusively phosphothreonine for the S244T mutant of mPDK-1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results identified phosphopeptidee of wild type mPDK-1 as a Ser244-containing peptide. Because Ser244 of mPDK-1 was found to be only marginally phosphorylated in vitro, we attempted to identify the major mPDK-1 in vitroautophosphorylation sites. At least five serine residues in hPDK-1, including Ser25, Ser241, Ser393, Ser396, and Ser410 were found phosphorylated in cells (17.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To test whether the corresponding sites in mPDK-1 are phosphorylated in vitro, we generated mutants of mPDK-1 in which the corresponding sites, Ser25, Ser244, Ser396, Ser 399, and Ser413, were replaced with either alanine or glycine. Mutant mPDK-1 proteins were expressed in CHO/IR cells, purified by immunoprecipitation, and autophosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the in vitro phosphorylated mPDK-1 mutants revealed that mutations at Ser25, Ser244, Ser396, and Ser413 had no significant effect on mPDK-1 in vitro autophosphorylation (data not shown). On the other hand, replacing Ser399 with glycine (mPDK-1S399G) significantly decreased phosphoserine content compared with that of wild type (Fig. 2, left panel versus Fig. 1 A, left panel). Phosphopeptide mapping studies revealed that mutation at this site resulted in the loss of phosphopeptide 3 (Fig. 2, right panel), implicating Ser399 of mPDK-1 as a major in vitroautophosphorylation site. In an attempt to localize potential threonine autophosphorylation site(s), we examined autophosphorylation of a mPDK-1 mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal PH domain (mPDK-1ΔPH, residues 1–459). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that deletion of the PH domain resulted in a complete abolishment of threonine autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Phosphopeptide mapping studies of mPDK-1ΔPH revealed a loss of both phosphopeptides 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 A, right panel), suggesting that the major mPDK-1 threonine autophosphorylation site(s) might be localized in the PH domain. Sequence analysis of mPDK-1 revealed the presence of four threonine residues in the PH domain: Thr482, Thr516, Thr521, and Thr525 (Fig. 3 B). To identify potential mPDK-1 threonine autophosphorylation sites, we mutated these threonine residues individually to alanine. The mPDK-1 threonine mutants were then expressed in CHO/IR cells, purified by immunoprecipitation, and autophosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. We found that mutations at Thr482, Thr521, and Thr525 had no significant effect on mPDK-1 autophosphorylation in vitro(data not shown). On the other hand, replacing Thr516 with alanine significantly decreased phosphothreonine content compared with that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3 C, left panel versus Fig. 1 A, left panel). Interestingly, mutating Thr516 to alanine resulted in the loss of both phosphothreonine-containing peptides 1 and 2 in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of this mutant (Fig. 3 C, right panel). One possible explanation for this observation may be that two phosphopeptides were generated because of incomplete digestion of the Thr516-containing tryptic peptide. Consistent with this idea, Thr516 is immediately flanked on the amino terminus by a lysine residue (Lys515). Phosphorylation at Thr516 could potentially impair the ability of trypsin to cleave the peptide bond between Lys515 and Thr516, resulting in two Thr516-containing phosphopeptides. To confirm this, we mutated Thr516 of mPDK-1 to serine. mPDK-1T516S was expressed in CHO/IR cells, immunoprecipitated, autophosphorylated in vitro, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis. Phosphopeptide mapping showed a significant decrease in phosphorylation at phosphopeptides 1 and 2. Subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that both phosphopeptides 1 and 2 contained exclusively phosphoserine (data not shown). These results provide further evidence that phosphopeptides 1 and 2 are due to incomplete tryptic digestion of the Thr516-containing peptide. To determine whether Ser244 , Ser399, and Thr516 are phosphorylated in cells, phosphopeptide mapping studies were performed on wild type and point-mutated mPDK-1 overexpressed and metabolically labeled in CHO/IR cells. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the metabolically labeled wild type mPDK-1 revealed the presence of phosphopeptides 1–3 (Fig. 4, panel a), indicating that both Ser399 and Thr516 are phosphorylated in intact cells. Consistent with the results from in vitroautophosphorylation and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies, mutation of Thr516 to alanine resulted in a loss of both phosphopeptides 1 and 2 for the metabolically labeled mPDK-1 (Fig. 4,panel b). Similarly, mutating Ser399 to glycine resulted in the loss of phosphopeptide 3 (Fig. 4, panel c). Our results also showed phosphopeptide e to be heavily phosphorylated in vivo, indicating that Ser244is one of the major phosphorylation sites in cells (Fig. 4). Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphopeptide e recovered from the maps of metabolically labeled wild type or the S244T mutant of mPDK-1 indicated that this peptide contained solely phosphoserine or phosphothreonine, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly, phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphopeptides f andi recovered from the maps of metabolically labeled wild type or mPDK-1S244T indicated that these two peptides also contained only phosphoserine or phosphothreonine, respectively (data not shown). These findings implicate Ser244 as a major phosphorylation site of mPDK-1 in cells and suggest that phosphopeptides e, f, and i are most likely due to incomplete digestion of Ser244-containing peptide. Interestingly, we found that the in vivophosphorylation pattern of kinase-inactive PDK-1K114G is similar to that of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that PDK-1 may undergo transphosphorylation in vivo. 2Wick, M. J., and Liu, F., manuscript in preparation. We have recently found that insulin stimulates mPDK-1 phosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells and rat adipocytes (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test whether a mutation at Ser399 or Thr516 affects the overall phosphorylation of mPDK-1 in vivo, we examined basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of wild type and mPDK-1 phosphorylation site mutants in CHO/IR cells. Consistent with our recent findings (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), insulin treatment resulted in a significant increase in mPDK-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Interestingly, we found that despite an overall decrease in phosphorylation, the mPDK-1S244A mutant was still phosphorylated in cells, and the phosphorylation was enhanced in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3and 4 versus lanes 1 and2). These findings suggest that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation at a site(s) in addition to or other than Ser244 in CHO/IR cells. Although mutating Ser399 to glycine or aspartate had no significant effect on mPDK-1 phosphorylation in vivo (data not shown), replacing Thr516 of mPDK-1 with glutamate (Fig. 5 A,lane 7 versus lane 2), but not alanine (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 versus lane 2), resulted in an increase in the basal phosphorylation of mPDK-1 to the same level as that of the insulin-stimulated wild type protein. Furthermore, this phosphorylation was not further increased following insulin treatment (Fig. 5 A, lane 8 versus lane 7). Interestingly, the recently identified constitutively active mutant of mPDK-1, mPDK-1A280V (18.Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), also showed an enhanced and insulin-independent increase in basal phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 1 and 2). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Thr516 may result in a similar conformational change induced by the alanine to valine mutation at position 280, which subsequently leads to enhanced phosphorylation of mPDK-1. To determine whether autophosphorylation plays a role in the function of mPDK-1, we examined the kinase activity of mPDK-1, both in vitro and in cells.In vitro, we found that mutation of Ser399 of mPDK-1 to glycine or aspartate, or Thr516 to alanine or glutamate, had no significant effect of mPDK-1 kinase activity (data not shown). To examine the effect of PDK-1 autophosphorylation on its kinase activity in cells, phosphorylation of the PDK-1 substrate Akt by wild type and autophosphorylation mutants was examined. As expected, insulin treatment resulted in a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 5 B, lane 7 versus lane 1). Although co-expression of mPDK-1S244Eor mPDK-1S399D mutants had no effect on Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 under basal conditions (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1), co-expression of mPDK-1T516E resulted in a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation to a level similar to that induced by insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 B, lane 5 versus lane 7). Under this condition, only a small increase in Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 was observed in cells co-expressing mPDK-1T516A (Fig. 5 B, lane 4 versus lane 1), suggesting that a negatively charged residue at this site plays a critical role in promoting PDK-1 to phosphorylate Akt in cells. Furthermore, insulin stimulation did not increase the elevated Akt Thr308phosphorylation in cells co-expressing mPDK-1T516E (Fig. 5 B, lane 11 versus lane 5). Similar results were obtained for mPDK-1T516E co-expressed with Akt in CHO and HEK-293 cells (data not shown). In agreement with our recent study (18.Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), co-expression of mPDK-1A280V with Akt also resulted in a similar increase in basal Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). Previous studies have suggested that translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane is required for full phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme (23.Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 24.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that this translocation requires an intact PH domain (25.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism by which autophosphorylation of PDK-1 regulates its activation of downstream substrates, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged wild type Akt-1 or the PH domain deletion mutant (Akt-1ΔPH) with either wild type or mutant mPDK-1 in CHO/IR cells. Insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 C, lane 2 versus lane 1) or co-expression of either mPDK-1T516E (Fig. 5C, lane 3 versus lane 1) or mPDK-1A280V (Fig. 5 C, lane 4 versus lane 1) resulted in significant Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. The PH domain-deleted mutant of Akt was not phosphorylated on Thr308 in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 C, lane 6). However, co-expression of PDK-1T516E was sufficient to restore Akt-1ΔPHphosphorylation at Thr308 to the same level as that of insulin-stimulated, full-length Akt (Fig. 5 C, lane 7 versus lane 2). It is of interest to note that the insulin-independent and Akt PH domain-independent phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 can be mediated by both PDK-1T516E and PDK-1A280V mutants (Fig. 5,B, lanes 5 and 6 and C,lanes 7 and 8). These data suggest that substituting Val280 with alanine or Thr516 with glutamate may lead to a similar conformational change of mPDK-1, which is essential for interaction and phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as Akt in cells. The mechanism(s) by which PDK-1 activity is regulated has remained, for a large part, unclear. Subcellular localization and substrate conformation have been hypothesized as the primary means for regulating PDK-1 activity enzyme (22.Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A.

Current Drug Targets Immune, Endocrine Metabolic Disorders. 2001; 1: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, some studies have indicated that phosphorylation of PDK-1 may also play a role (8.Dong L.Q.

Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PDK-1 is phosphorylated both in vitro and in cells (2.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P.

J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and treatment of PDK-1-expressing cells with insulin or hydrogen peroxide has been shown to increase phosphorylation of PDK-1 on specific residues (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28.Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 31: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on Ser244 (mPDK-1) or Ser241 (hPDK-1) in the activation loop as a critical phosphorylation site, because phosphorylation upon this residue is essential for PDK-1 kinase activity (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Some studies have indicated that phosphorylation at Ser241 is not regulated by growth factor stimulation (17.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have found that in certain cell types, mPDK-1 phosphorylation and activity increase following insulin stimulation in a Ser244-dependent manner (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in CHO/IR cells, we found that the mPDK-1S244A mutant still underwent insulin-stimulated phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). These findings suggest that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mPDK-1 occurs at sites other than or in addition to Ser244, and this phosphorylation may function in conjunction with Ser244 to regulate mPDK-1 activity in cells. In the present study, we identify Ser399 and Thr516 on mPDK-1 as two major in vitroautophosphorylation sites, which can also be phosphorylated in cells. This finding is in agreement with a recent study by Park et al. (28.Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 31: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar), who showed the Thr516-corresponding site in hPDK-1 to be phosphorylated in vitro. However, our results also show that phosphorylation at these sites may play different roles in PDK-1 function in cells. Indeed, substitution of Thr516with glutamate increases basal PDK-1 phosphorylation in cells to that seen with insulin stimulation, whereas replacing Ser399with aspartate does not significantly affect either basal or insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the enzyme. In addition, overexpression of mPDK-1T516E, but not mPDK-1S399D, led to Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 to the same level as that induced by insulin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that autophosphorylation at Thr516, but not Ser399, regulates PDK-1 phosphorylation upon additional residues in cells and subsequently functions to regulate the activity of PDK-1 toward its substrates. Previous studies have shown that hPDK-1 isolated from cells is constitutively active in vitro, presumably as a result of autophosphorylation upon Ser241 (4.Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 8.Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22.Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we have found that a mutation of the corresponding Ser244 on mPDK-1 renders the kinase inactive in vitro (Fig. 1 C) and in cells (Ref. 15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and data not shown). Interestingly, although we found the kinase activity of mPDK-1 to be significantly reduced by a mutation at Ser244, we found the ratio of serine:threonine autophosphorylation unchanged in its absence. This suggests that Ser244 is not a major site for in vitro autophosphorylation. Low autophosphorylation at Ser244 may result from phosphorylation at this site in cells that remains stable in vitro. In support of this, phosphorylation at Ser244 is less stable if the residue is replaced with threonine, resulting in an increase in autophosphorylation at this site in vitro (Fig. 1 B). Although Ser244 is a minor phosphorylation site, phosphopeptide maps of metabolically labeled wild type and S244T mutant of mPDK-1 indicated that Ser244 is highly phosphorylated in CHO/IR cells, which is in agreement with our recent studies showing that Ser244 is a major phosphorylation site in NIH-3T3 cells (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, autophosphorylation upon the majorin vitro sites, Ser399 and Thr516, is less stable in cells, which indicates that phosphorylation upon these residues is reversible and may be tightly regulated in cells. Insulin stimulation has been shown to increase PDK-1 phosphorylation in both NIH-3T3 and rat adipose cells (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observed insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mPDK-1 when overexpressed in CHO/IR cells (Fig. 5 A); however, we found that this insulin-stimulated increase could occur in the absence of Ser244 phosphorylation. Mutations at Ser399 and Thr516 did not significantly affect insulin-stimulated mPDK-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A and data not shown), suggesting the presence of other insulin-stimulated phosphorylation site(s). On the other hand, replacement of Thr516 with a negatively charged glutamate residue resulted in a significant increase in basal phosphorylation. The increase in basal mPDK-1T516Ephosphorylation also correlates with an increase in mPDK-1T516E-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 (Fig. 5 B), which is in agreement with our recent finding that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mPDK-1 correlates with an increase in activity (15.Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11851-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that growth factor-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Akt requires a translocation event via an intact PH domain (23.Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and others (22.Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,30.Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation at Thr308 of Akt by PDK-1 is facilitated by an intact PDK-1-PH domain, whereas others have suggested that translocation of PDK-1 to the membrane may play a role in the phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme (31.Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that mutating Thr516 to glutamate allows PDK-1 to phosphorylate Thr308 not only in a growth factor-independent fashion but also without the requirement for the PH domain of Akt (Fig. 5 C). These data suggest that the T516E mutation of mPDK-1 bypasses the normal requirement for translocation and allows it to interact with and subsequently phosphorylate Akt at Thr308. One possible explanation for this observation may be that the introduction of a negatively charged residue at Thr516 results in a conformational change in mPDK-1, which normally occurs after growth factor-mediated translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. This resulting conformation may result in an increase in autophosphorylation at Ser244 and a subsequent increase in mPDK-1 activity. Consistent with this, a mPDK-1S244A/T516E mutant was unable to increase phosphorylation of mPDK-1 or Thr308 of Akt in cells (data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr516 modifies activity of mPDK-1 through a Ser244 phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a natural point mutation (A277V) allows the mammalian PDK-1 homolog to bypass the need for PI 3-kinase for its activation (16.Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We recently reported that a corresponding mutation in mPDK1 (A280V) resulted in an increase in the in vitro autophosphorylation of mPDK-1 and constitutive activation of the kinase toward Akt in cells (18.Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whereas this mutation has not been found to occur naturally in higher species, it is interesting to note the similarity between mPDK-1A280V and mPDK-1T516E. We found that although neither had any significant effect on mPDK-1 activity in vitro (data not shown), both elevated mPDK-1 basal phosphorylation in cells (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, overexpression of either mPDK-1A280V or mPDK-1T516E was sufficient to elevate Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in a growth factor- and Akt PH domain-independent manner (Fig. 5, B and Fig.C). These findings suggest that each mutation may result in a conformational change and/or cellular relocalization of mPDK1, which allows the enzyme to interact with and phosphorylate its downstream substrates such as Akt. In conclusion, our results suggest that phosphorylation at Thr516 plays an important role in the regulation of mPDK-1in vivo activity toward its substrates. Although it remains to be established whether phosphorylation upon Thr516 is directly regulated by insulin stimulation, autophosphorylation at this site may specifically direct the extent of phosphorylation at other site(s) and subsequently the activity of mPDK-1 in response to insulin or other growth factors. Autophosphorylation at Thr516 may be specifically regulated in cells by various cellular events, such as conformational changes of the kinase following growth factor stimulation. Alternatively, Thr516 may be constitutively autophosphorylated in cells, and this phosphorylation may be tightly controlled by a serine/threonine phosphatase, allowing dynamic regulation of this pivotal kinase in response to growth factor stimulation. Further studies will be needed to test these possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2049979753,"We previously showed that phosphorylation of Ser10 of the N terminus domain of the type VI adenylyl cyclase (ACVI) partly mediated protein kinase C (PKC)-induced inhibition of ACVI. We now report that phosphorylation of the other two cytosolic domains (C1 and C2), which form the catalytic core complex of ACVI, also contributes to PKC-mediated inhibition. In vitrophosphorylation by PKC of the recombinant C1a and C2 domains, and of the synthetic peptides representing potential PKC phosphorylation sites, suggests that Ser568 and Ser674 of the C1 domain and Thr931 of the C2 domain might act as substrates for PKC. We next created several full-length ACVI mutants in which one or more of the four likely PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser10, Ser568, Ser674, and Thr931) were mutated to alanine. Simultaneous mutation of at least two of the three likely residues located in the N and C1 domains (Ser10, Ser568, and Ser674) was required to render ACVI variants completely insensitive to PKC treatment. In contrast, a single mutation of Thr931 was sufficient to create a functional ACVI mutant that exhibited no detectable PKC-mediated inhibition, demonstrating the essentiality of Thr931 to PKC-mediated regulation. Based on these results, we propose that the three cytosolic domains of ACVI might form a regulatory complex. Phosphorylation of this regulatory complex at different sites might induce a fine-tuning of the catalytic core complex and subsequently lead to alternation in the catalytic activity of ACVI.

Phosphorylation of this regulatory complex at different sites might induce a fine-tuning of the catalytic core complex and subsequently lead to alternation in the catalytic activity of ACVI. adenylyl cyclase(s) type VI adenylyl cyclase A2A-R protein kinase A protein kinase C phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate wild-type Genes of nine mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (ACs)1 have been isolated and characterized (1Taussig R.

All of these ACs contain two hydrophobic spans, composed of six transmembrane helices, and three large cytoplasmic domains (N, C1a/b, and C2, see Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of the catalytic domains of AC has been resolved and analyzed in detail (4Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). It was clearly demonstrated that two cytoplasmic domains (C1a and C2) of ACs form the catalytic core. In addition, Gαs and/or forskolin increase the affinity between C1a and C2 and activate cyclase by changing the relative orientation of the C1 and C2 domains to an active conformation (4Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The functional roles of the C1b domain of ACs are relatively more variable. For ACII and ACVII, the C1b domain suppresses the catalytic activity by holding ACs in their basal non-stimulated state (6Yan S.-Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C1b domain modulates calmodulin-elicited activation of ACI- and PKA-evoked inhibition of ACVI (7Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y. Li A. Harry J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The N terminus domains of ACs are highly variable among ACs and have been demonstrated to play a regulatory role (9Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The twelve transmembrane segments are responsible for linking together the two catalytic domains (C1a and C2) to achieve a proper functional conformation and are important for membrane targeting of ACs (4Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Gu C. Sorkin A. Cooper D.M.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 185-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that prolonged activation of the A2A adenosine receptor (A2A-R) in PC12 cells significantly inhibits the activity of type VI adenylyl cyclase (ACVI), which in turn causes a lower response to subsequent stimulation by A2A-R (12Chern Y. Lai H.-L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chern Y. Chiou J.-Y. Lai H.-L. Tsai M.-H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation by A2A-R activates the calcium-independent protein kinase C (PKC) that phosphorylates and inhibits ACVI. Suppression of ACVI by protein phosphorylation thus produces a lower response of ACVI to subsequent stimulation by A2A-R in PC12 cells (14Lai H.L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further biochemical analyses reveal that the apparent maximal forskolin- and Gαs-stimulated activities of PKC-treated ACVI are significantly lower than those of the non-treated enzyme. However, treatment with PKC does not alter the Km of the substrate, nor does it markedly affect the EC50 values of forskolin or Gαs (10Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the glycosylation state of ACVI affects the ability of ACVI to be inhibited by PKC (15Wu G.-C. Lai H.-L. Lin Y.-W. Chu Y.-T. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35450-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), further suggesting that post-translational modification of ACVI is important for its activity. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of rat ACVI (16Premont R.T. Ma J. Chen H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using the Genetics Computer Group program (Madison, WI) reveals that there are 11 potential PKC phosphorylation sites that lie within the three predicted large intracellular cytoplasmic domains (N, C1a/b, and C2; see Fig. 1A). We earlier reported that PKC phosphorylates the highly variable N terminus domain of ACVI at Ser10. The N terminus domain therefore appears to mediate, at least partly, the inhibition and phosphorylation of ACVI by PKC (10Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Notably, the ACVI mutant lacking amino acids 1–86 or Ser10 can still be phosphorylated by PKC (10Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC also phosphorylates residues located in the C1 or C2 domain of ACVI. In the present study, we have sought to further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of PKC on ACVI. Detailed mutational characterization suggests that PKC phosphorylates at least four residues (Ser10, Ser568, Ser674, and Thr931) located in the three large cytosolic domains (N, C1, and C2) of ACVI and subsequently exerts an inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of ACVI. Moreover, phosphorylation of ACVI at multiple sites located in different cytosolic domains is required to achieve the maximal inhibitory effect of PKC, indicating that the three large cytosolic domains might interact with each other to acquire an active conformation, which is subject to phosphorylation-driven regulation by PKC. The cDNA of rat ACVI was kindly provided by Dr. Iyengar (Department of Pharmacology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY) (16Premont R.T. Ma J. Chen H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Expressions of wild-type and mutant ACVI were carried out in a recombinant baculovirus-driven Sf21 cell system following the manufacturer’s protocol (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Membrane fractions were collected from Sf21 cells infected with the indicated virus carrying the desired ACVI variant 68–72 h after infection. AC activity was assayed as described previously (13Chern Y. Chiou J.-Y. Lai H.-L. Tsai M.-H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 40 μm PMSF, pH 7.4), and sonicated using a W-380 sonicator (Ultrasonics, Farmingdale, NY) at a setting of 20% output power for a total of 45 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 30 min to collect the P1 membrane fractions. The AC activity assay was performed at 37 °C for 10 min in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mm ATP, 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GTP, and 20 μg of membrane protein. Reactions were stopped by addition of 0.6 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cAMP formed was isolated by Dowex chromatography (Sigma) and assayed as described previously (13Chern Y. Chiou J.-Y. Lai H.-L. Tsai M.-H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). The ACVI activity was determined as the difference between cyclase activities measured in membrane fractions collected from Sf21 cells infected with the ACVI virus and with the control Autographa californica multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Endogenous cyclase activities in Sf21 cells represented ∼20% of the total activity. The enzyme activity was linear for up to 30 min with up to 40 μg of membrane proteins. Potential PKC phosphorylation sites of rat ACVI were identified using the Genetics Computer Group program (Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser10, Ser325, Ser568, Ser674, and Thr931 of ACVI was carried out using the Altered Sites IIin vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant cDNAs were cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector (pVL1392) and expressed in Sf21 cells as described above. The expression construct (pQE60/H6-Gαs) of Gαs protein was a generous gift from Dr. W.-J. Tang (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). The hexahistidine-tagged Gαs protein was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified using the His·Bind metal chelation resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described elsewhere (17Yan S.-Z. Huang Z.-H. Andrews R.K. Tang W.-J. Mol Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To stimulate AC activity, the indicated concentration of Gαs protein was activated by GTPγS (20 μm) in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 20 °C. DNA fragments encoding the C1a, C2S, and C2L domains of ACVI were produced using the PCR technique. DNA amplification was carried out in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 0.2 mg of the desired primers, 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), a DNA template, and 2 units of DynaZyme thermostable DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) per 50 μl of reaction solution. Primers for ACVI (16Premont R.T. Ma J. Chen H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were as follows: for the C1a domain (amino acids 356–599), 5′-GCATATGTCGGTGTTGCCCCAGCAT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCGTCAGGAACCCAGCGGGG-3′; and for the C2S domain (amino acids 946–1173), 5′-CATATGAAGGAGGAGATGGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGATGACCACCTACTTCTAGGGATCCTAT-3′. The reactions proceeded for 40 PCR cycles (95 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 4 min). Primers for the C2L domain (amino acids 925–1180) were 5′-CATATGCAACAGGTGGAATCT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTAACTGCTGGGGCCCCCATT-3′. The reactions proceeded for 40 PCR cycles (95 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 4 min). The amplified DNA fragments were ligated to the C terminus of a hexahistidine tag, confirmed by DNA sequencing, and subcloned into pET11d (Novagen) for expression in E. coli. Because the expression levels of the recombinant C1a and C2S domains were very low in E. coli, the DNA fragment encoding C1a or C2S was subcloned into pVL1393 for expression in Sf21 cells. Expressions of these domain proteins were carried out in a recombinant baculovirus-driven Sf21 cell system following the manufacturer’s protocol (BD PharMingen). We determined protein concentrations by a simple colorimetric assay based on the Bradford dye-binding procedure (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad). For SDS-PAGE, membrane fractions were combined with 2× sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 1% SDS, 15% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged to remove the insoluble material, and then separated on 8% separating gels according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS, then incubated with an anti-ACVI antibody (AC6D, 1:5000 dilution (14Lai H.L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) at 4 °C overnight. After three washes of 5 min each in PBS, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK) at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with PBS, and the immunoreactive bands were stained using a light-emitting non-radioactive method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The polyclonal AC6D was raised against the recombinant C2 domain (amino acids 987∼1180) of ACVI (14Lai H.L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because the C1a and C2 domains of ACVI are highly homologous (44% similarity), AC6D recognized both the C1a and C2 domains of ACVI. To carry out the protein phosphorylation study, ACVI variants expressed in Sf21 cells were purified by immunoprecipitation using AC6D. In brief, 0.25 mg of P1 membrane fractions collected from Sf21 cells infected with the indicated virus were solubilized in 0.25 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 40 μm PMSF, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8) at 4 °C for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was initiated by addition of AC6D (1:50 dilution). The reaction mixture was incubated with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 90 min. Immunocomplexes were purified using Sephadex-conjugated protein A (Sigma) and then washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer. Phosphorylation by PKC was carried out in a final volume of 0.1 ml of a reaction mixture containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 12 μmN-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (H89), 12 μm ATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 GBq, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), 0.1 mm leupeptin, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 30 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by addition of PKC (0.1 milliunit (mU)) purified from rat brain (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C and was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample treatment buffer. Samples were then boiled for 5 min then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8%) and Western blotting using AC6D. To visualize the phosphorylation of ACVI by PKC, immunoblots were rinsed twice with PBS, air-dried, and autoradiographed. Peptides were synthesized and purchased from Genosys (Woodlands, TX). The composition and amount of each peptide were confirmed by amino acid analysis (Analytical Biotechnology Services, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan). Names and sequences of the peptides are shown in Table I. Phosphorylation of each peptide was carried in a final volume of 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml diolein (Sigma), 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol), 1 mm peptide (MBP4–14, Sigma), and 0.01 mU of PKC. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min. The phosphorylated peptides were segregated from [γ-32P]ATP by 20% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described elsewhere (20Honegger A. Dull T.J. Szapary R. Komoriya A. Kris R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed with two changes of 30% (v/v) methanol followed by two changes of 10% (v/v) acetic acid after which they were exposed to the film at −80 °C.Table ISynthetic peptides encoding the potential phosphorylation sites of ACVILocationNameSequenceC1aSer325VCTHYPAEVSQRQAFQETRC1aThr372AMEMKEDINTKKEDMMFHC1aSer568IETFLILGASQKRKEEKAMC1bSer619AFRQMGIDDSSKENRGAQDC1bSer674FLLTFQREDLEKKYSRKVDPRFGThe amino acid sequences of each peptide are listed. The potential PKC phosphorylation sites are in boldface letters. Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences of each peptide are listed. The potential PKC phosphorylation sites are in boldface letters. In addition to phosphorylation of the highly variable N domain at Ser10, our previous study (10Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that PKC might phosphorylate other cytosolic domains (C1a/b and C2, Fig.1A). Because the C1 and C2 domains form the catalytic core complex (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we examined whether the activation state of the catalytic core complex affects the ability of ACVI to be regulated by PKC. Activation of ACVI was first achieved by pretreating ACVI with activated Gαs proteins (240 nm), which enhanced the activity of ACVI by ∼5 fold (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2, ACVI in both the basal/non-stimulated and Gαs-activated states could be inhibited by PKC treatment to a similar extent. Based on the available crystallographic structure of VC1a/IIC2 (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we built a computer model of the catalytic core composed of the C1a and C2 domains of ACVI (Fig. 3). According to the model, two potential PKC phosphorylation sites, Ser489and Ser1126, are located in the catalytic core of the C1a·C2 complex of ACVI. Ser489 and Ser1126 are very conserved among eight other AC isoforms, and lie close to the forskolin and ATP binding sites, respectively (Fig. 3). Because these two residues are most likely buried inside the core catalytic complex at all times (basal or activated), they are less likely to be accessible to PKC-mediated phosphorylation. We next determined whether the other putative PKC phosphorylation residues located in the C1 (Ser325, Thr372, Ser568, Ser619, and Ser674) and C2 (Thr931) domains of ACVI could be phosphorylated by PKC. Because synthetic peptides have been used to assess the most likely phosphorylation sites (21Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 22Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2818-2823Google Scholar), peptides (TableI) representing the potential PKC phosphorylation sites of the C1 domain were treated with PKC to screen for the most likely PKC phosphorylation sites in the C1 domain. As shown in Fig. 4A, peptides containing Ser325, Ser568, or Ser674, but not the others, were phosphorylated by PKC. In addition, the recombinant C1a domain (amino acids 356–599) could be effectively phosphorylated by PKC (Fig. 4B). PKC, therefore, might phosphorylate the C1 domain of ACVI, and the likely phosphorylated residues of the C1 domain by PKC are Ser325, Ser568, and Ser674. We next proceeded to individually mutate the three most likely phosphorylation sites (Ser325, Ser568, or Ser674) of the C1 domain into alanine and then expressed the resultant ACVI mutants in insect cells using a baculovirus-driven system. As shown in Fig. 4C, each ACVI mutant carrying a single point mutation exhibited similar molecular weights as that of the wild-type ACVI. In addition, mutation of Ser568 or Ser674 led to a statistically significant reduction in the phosphorylation levels of ACVI by PKC (Fig. 4D). Because multiple residues of ACVI might be phosphorylated by PKC, it is not surprising to find that PKC was able to cause a substantial level of phosphorylation in both ACVI-S568A and ACVI-674. In contrast, mutation of Ser325 did not diminish the PKC-mediated phosphorylation levels. In some of the experiments performed, we even observed a slight increase in PKC-mediated phosphorylation of ACVI-S325A compared with that of the wild-type (WT, Fig. 4C). However, the difference in the PKC-mediated phosphorylation levels between the WT and the ACVI-S325A mutant was not statistically significant (Fig.4D). Collectively, at least two residues (Ser568and Ser674) located in the C1 domain of ACVI might be phosphorylated by PKC. To assess the functional relevance of Ser568 and Ser674 in PKC-mediated inhibition of ACVI, we next examined the effect of PKC treatment on the activities of ACVI-S568A and ACVI-S674A. As shown in Table II, mutation of Ser568 or Ser674 diminished PKC-mediated inhibition when relative activities of the PKC-treated WT and PKC-treated ACVI-mutant groups were compared. Reduced PKC-evoked inhibition of both ACVI mutants correlated well with the decreased phosphorylation levels of ACVI-S568A and S674A. Ser568 and Ser674, therefore, might be critical for PKC-mediated inhibition of ACVI activity. It is interesting to note that individual mutations of these two residues only partially relieved PKC-mediated inhibition, further supporting our hypothesis that multiple residues contribute to the phosphorylation and suppression of ACVI by PKC.Table IIContribution to PKC-mediated inhibition of ACVI activity by phosphorylation of the N, C1, and C2 domains of ACVIACVILocation of the mutated residue(s)Vm′Vm′ of PKC-treated ACVI variantPKC-evoked phosphorylationpmol/(min · mg)%%WT249.4 ± 77.438 ± 182-ap < 0.05.

We have focused attention on mammalian enamel formation because it relies on a self-assembling protein complex to direct mineral habit. The principle protein of enamel is amelogenin, a 180-amino acid hydrophobic protein that self-assembles to form nanospheres. We have used independent technical methods, consisting of the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to demonstrate the importance of amelogenin self-assembly domains. In addition, we have analyzed mutations in amelogenin observed in patients with amelogenesis imperfecta who demonstrate defects in enamel formation. Assessments of self-assembly of these mutant amelogenins by either SPR or Y2H assay yield concordant data. These data support the conclusion that the amelogenin amino-terminal self-assembly domain is essential to the creation of an enamel extracellular organic matrix capable of directing mineral formation. It also suggests that a pathway through which point mutations in the amelogenin protein can adversely impact on the formation of the enamel organ is by disturbing self-assembly of the organic matrix. These data support the utilization of the Y2H assay to search for protein interactions among extracellular matrix proteins that contribute to biomineralization and provide functional information on protein-protein and protein-mineral interactions.

The self-assembly of a protein complex is a hallmark of biological systems. From processive enzymatic reactions to extracellular matrices, cells achieve control over their microenvironment through the assembly of a mixture of proteins. Protein assemblies are created with a specific stoichiometry. Such assembly precision is achieved through the interaction of protein motifs contained within the constituent protein members. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 1The abbreviations used are: Y2Hyeast two-hybridAIH1X-linked amelogenesis imperfectaSPRsurface plasmon resonanceDLSdynamic light scatteringAFMatomic force microscopy1The abbreviations used are: Y2Hyeast two-hybridAIH1X-linked amelogenesis imperfectaSPRsurface plasmon resonanceDLSdynamic light scatteringAFMatomic force microscopy assay has been used successfully to study protein assembly and offers distinct advantages over many biochemical techniques used previously. An example of the value of the Y2H assay can be seen in the assembly properties of type X collagen. Type X collagen is a homotrimer of α1(X) chains encoded by the COL10A1 gene, which is expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes during the process of endochondral ossification. Dwarfism in domestic pigs is a result of a single change (Gly590 → Arg) to the α1(X) chain of type X collagen (1.Nielsen V.H. Bendixen C. Arnbjerg J. Sorensen C.M. Jensen H.E. Shukri N.M. Thomsen B. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In humans, a similar phenotype has been described for a mutation at the equivalent position (Gly590 → Glu) of type X collagen. These patients have Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, which is a mild skeletal disorder associated with dwarfism and growth plate abnormality. The Y2H assay and in vitro assembly experiments demonstrated that the amino acid substitution interfered with the ability of the mutated collagen molecules to engage in trimerization (1.Nielsen V.H. Bendixen C. Arnbjerg J. Sorensen C.M. Jensen H.E. Shukri N.M. Thomsen B. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this example, confirmation of a valid animal model for a human genetic disease has been possible in part by the Y2H assay. At the same time, the Y2H assay has given unique information about assembly dynamics that add to the genetic, radiologic, histologic, and biochemical data previously available. Although biochemical methods can be used to detect dimerization, they often lack specificity, they may not be quantitative, they are not easy to perform, and they do not facilitate the genetic analysis of protein-protein interactions under physiological conditions. yeast two-hybrid X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta surface plasmon resonance dynamic light scattering atomic force microscopy yeast two-hybrid X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta surface plasmon resonance dynamic light scattering atomic force microscopy We have focused attention on mammalian enamel as an example of the self-assembly of an extracellular matrix protein complex. In the case of enamel, a complex mixture of proteins self-assemble to form supramolecular complexes that are capable of guiding the crystal habit of hydroxyapatite crystallites (2.Paine M.L. Zhu D.H.

Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The crystals organize in such a way that the final product resists wear from repeated use during mastication, resisting non-catastrophic failure in a wet and bacterial laden environment (5.White S.N. Paine M.L. Sarikaya M. Fong H. Yu Z. Li Z.C. Snead M.L. J. Am. Ceramic Soc. 2000; 83: 238-240Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The principal protein of enamel is amelogenin, a hydrophobic protein that has been shown to undergo self-assembly to form nanospheres (6.Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Diekwisch T.G.H. Lyaruu D.M. Wright J.T. Bringas Jr., P. Slavkin H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Two domains in amelogenin (an A domain consisting of amino-terminal residues 1–42 and a B domain consisting of carboxyl-terminal residues 157–173) were subsequently identified as mediating amelogenin self-assembly by using the Y2H assay (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present study, we corroborate the importance of these two self-assembly domains to the process of amelogenin self-assembly using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We further define altered assembly dynamics for changes in single residues in the A domain, which are altered in individuals affected with X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AIH1). These mutations result in a Thr21 → Ile alteration (8.Lench N.J. Winter G.B. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 252-259Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and a Pro41 → Thr alteration (9.Ravassipour D.B. Hart P.S. Ritter A.V. Yamauchi M. Gibson C. Wright J.T. J. Dent. Res. 2000; 79: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Amelogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary disease of enamel and, when linked to the amelogenin locus, severely reduces the ability of amelogenin to self-assembly as measured by either the Y2H assay or by SPR. We have used the Y2H system and SPR to perform a genetic analysis of the determinants of amelogenin self-assembly. The favorable correlation between assembly parameters for amelogenin as measured by either the Y2H assay or SPR support the utility of these techniques to further define and understand the contribution of protein assembly to direct specific mineralized architecture. Enhanced understanding of the physicochemical guidelines governing protein self-assembly and the ability to manipulate these interactions will contribute to the studies of nanotechnology and biomimetics (10.Sarikaya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13611-13614Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Preparation of the recombinant mouse amelogenin rM179 has been described elsewhere (11.Simmer J.P.

Briefly, polyhistidine-containing recombinant proteins were prepared in the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and recovered using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography using the protocol supplied by Qiagen Inc. The rp(H)M180ΔA contains the FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT) epitope in place of domain A (2.Paine M.L. Zhu D.H. Luo W. Bringas P.J. Goldberg M. White S.N. Lei Y.P. Sarikaya M. Fong H.K.

Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The recombinant amelogenin constructs with single or dual point mutations did not contain any marker peptides besides the polyhistidine cartridge at the amino terminus (Qiagen Inc.). The A domain and B domain of mouse amelogenin and the relative positions of the Thr21 → Ile and the Pro41 → Thr mutations for human amelogenesis imperfecta phenotypes are illustrated in Fig. 1. The amino acid sequences for each construct prepared for SPR have been published previously (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The Biacore®3000 system, CM5 (carboxymethylated dextran surface) sensor chips, software, and reagents were obtained from the Biacore AB company (Uppsala, Sweden). There are four flow cells in a CM5 chip and among these four cells, three were used for the assay. Flow cell 1 was used as a control surface, whereas flow cells 2 and 3 were used as test surfaces. The carboxyl groups on the surface of each flow cell were activated with an injection of a solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Recombinant mouse amelogenin rM179, suspended in 10 mm acetate, pH 4.5, was injected over flow cells 2 and 3 at a flow rate of 10 μl/min until ∼2000 response units of protein was coupled to the sensor surface (data not included). One response unit corresponds to an immobilized protein density of 1 pg/mm2 (13.Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Flow cell 1 was treated in an identical manner but without any protein. The immobilization was completed by a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride to block any remaining activated carboxyl groups. Protein purity and concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using laser densitometry to compare the recombinant amelogenin to bovine albumin (molecular mass 69.3 kDa) of a known concentration and subsequently extrapolating molar concentrations for each of the amelogenin samples. To calculate the concentration of each amelogenin, individual molecular weights were taken into account (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Each test protein was diluted from stock solution in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes with 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mmEDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P-20, pH 7.4) to a desired concentration. The sample was then injected at 10 μl/min at 25 °C with an ∼5-min contact period, followed by a 2-min dissociation period. The sensor chip was regenerated with 1 mMgCl2 after each experiment. Data transformation and overlay plots for all experimental interactions were prepared with BIAevaluation software 3.0 (Biacore AB). To correct for refractive index changes and nonspecific binding, the binding responses generated from flow cell 1 were subtracted from the responses generated in flow cells 2 and 3. Wild-type and mutated amelogenin cDNAs were engineered into the GAL4 DNA-binding hybrid vector pPC97 (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The signal peptide of amelogenin has been excluded from all constructs in this study. Briefly, the plasmids prepared above (rM180, rp(H)M180, rp(H)M180ΔB, rp(H)M180T21 → I, rp(H)M180P41 → T, and rp(H)M180T21 → I,P41 → T M180) were used as template DNA for PCR using the forward primer TTCGGATCCTATGCCCCTACCACCT and the reverse primer TAGGGAGCTCTTAATCCACTTCTTCCCG. These two primers included aBamHI (forward primer) and SacI (reverse primer) restriction endonuclease restriction sites (underlined) to allow for efficient, in-frame cloning of the PCR product into pPC97. The construct rp(H)M180ΔB includes the hemagglutinin epitope (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Respectively, these amelogenin-containing, GAL4 DNA-binding hybrid vectors have been called p97-M180, p97-M180ΔB, p97-M180T21 → I, p97-M180P41 → T and p97-M180T21 → I,P41 → T M180. DNA nucleotide sequences for each plasmid were obtained to confirm correct orientation, framing, and sequence of the cDNA insert. The domain A-deleted amelogenin in the GAL4 binding domain plasmid had been prepared for a previous study (pMa97/3 (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) and will be referred to in this work as p97-M180ΔA. Construct p97-M180ΔA does not contain the FLAG epitope. The wild-type amelogenin-containing GAL4 DNA transcriptional activating hybrid vector had also been prepared for a previous study (pMa86/N (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) and will be referred to in this communication as p86-M180. Positive hybrid plasmids for p53 and SV40 large T antigen and hybrid plasmids for H-ras and CDC25 have been used and reported previously (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The liquid assay used to quantitate β-galactosidase activity has been reported previously (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The results from the yeast liquid culture assay are presented (Table I). Yeast hybrid assay was used to compare relative interaction strengths (including standard deviations) between wild-type and mutated amelogenin proteins. For each double-transformant combination eight yeast clones were grown until anA 600 reading of 0.6–0.8 was reached and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Wild-type amelogenin interacting with itself is calculated at unity; and other readings are reported relative to this including calculated p values. Each of the mutated amelogenin proteins studied showed a statistically significant decreased ability to interact with wild-type amelogenin; the most significant was the domain A-deleted construct followed by the Thr21 → Ile point mutation construct. Positive controls were the tumor suppressor protein p53 cotransformed with the SV40 large T antigen and H-ras (wild type) cotransformed with the CDC25 protein ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (14.Paine M.L. Krebsbach P.H. Chen L.S. Paine C.T. Yamada Y. Deutsch D. Snead M.L. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Negative controls involve each of the amelogenin protein-hybrid constructs cotransformed with either pPC86 (for the pPC97 hybrids) or pPC97 (for the pPC86 hybrids). All negative control combinations had no ascertainable β-galactosidase activity as measured by the liquid culture assay.Table IYeast two-hybrid assay results comparing relative interaction strengths (including standard deviations) between wild-type and mutated amelogenin proteinsGAL4 DNA binding domain fusion vectorGAL4 activation domain fusion vectorInteraction (relative strength)p valuep97-M180p86-M1801.00p97-M180ΔAp86-M1800.08 ± 0.02<0.002p97-M180ΔBp86-M1800.75 ± 0.16<0.002p97-M180T21 → Ip86-M1800.57 ± 0.14<0.002p97-M180P41 → Tp86-M1800.74 ± 0.20<0.002p97-M180T21 → I,P41 → Tp86-M1800.83 ± 0.18<0.008p53SV40 large T antigen0.66 ± 0.17H-rasCDC25>16Positive controls were p53 cotransformed with SV40 large T antigen and H-ras cotransformed with CDC25.

Open table in a new tab Positive controls were p53 cotransformed with SV40 large T antigen and H-ras cotransformed with CDC25.

The p values for each of the mutated amelogenins interacting with wild-type amelogenin are given; p values were determined by comparing each amelogenin combination to the self-assembly of wild-type amelogenin (line 1). The real-time interaction of wild-type and mutant amelogenins were determined using SPR at concentrations of 0.25 μm (test molecule) to the rM179 ligand. The first sample tested (rp(H)M180) was tested a second time following the completion of the experiment and gave consistent data for both passes. In addition, this experiment in its entirety was repeated in two different laboratories by different individuals and gave identical results. A representative overlay of a sensorgram generated for each interaction is presented (Fig. 2). It is apparent from these data that the chip surface remains fully active between each sample. It is also apparent that the greatest disruption to the amelogenin, as measured by response units, is seen for the ΔA (rp(H)M180ΔA) test construct. The real-time interaction of the various test molecules was determined at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.50 μm to the rM179 ligand. For each analysis at these two concentrations, the sensorgram was calculated at the same selected time points; threshold, response, and final response. Threshold was measured 5 s before the end of the injection of the sample, the response was measured 10 s after the end of the injection, and the final response point was measured after an additional 10 s (an example is illustrated in Fig. 3 A). The data for both these concentrations are presented in Fig. 3 B. At a 0.25 and 0.50 μm concentration, rp(H)M180 produced the highest binding response whereas rp(H)M180ΔA yielded the smallest binding response (Fig. 3 B). Amelogenin is an extracellular matrix protein, the amino acid sequence of which is highly conserved across species. Following the initial description of amelogenin proteins in the early 1960s, scientists have attempted to gain information about its secondary and tertiary structure. Amelogenin CD spectrum suggests that the amelogenin amino terminus contains β-sheet structure, whereas the central region and carboxyl-terminal region exhibits a random-coil conformation (15.Goto Y. Kogure E. Takagi T. Aimoto S. Aoba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that that amelogenin protein fails to retain stable secondary or tertiary structure (16.Termine J.D. Torchia D.A. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 741-750Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar); however, stable supermolecular structures are observed and take the form of 10–15-nm diameter “nanospheres” (6.Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Diekwisch T.G.H. Lyaruu D.M. Wright J.T. Bringas Jr., P. Slavkin H.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). How amelogenin assembly into nanospheres is achieved is today being addressed using a number of technologies. The Y2H system was used to define the “A” and “B” domains of amelogenin (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Domain A is essential for amelogenin to amelogenin interactions. In isolation, domain A has the capability to direct interactions with another amelogenin protein. In contrast, domain B cannot be separated as an interacting domain in isolation, suggesting that conformation is of significance. The previous observation that a truncated amelogenin lacking domain B can no longer interact with domain A (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) could explain in part matrix disassembly following proteolytic cleavage at the carboxyl end of M180 amelogenin by a specific enamel protease (17.Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) have recently been used to study the assembly properties of recombinant amelogenin proteins that have been engineered with gross alterations to either domain A or to domain B or point mutations within domain A (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By measuring the parameters of nanosphere size and assembly kinetics, it was concluded that domain A and domain B (of amelogenin) have significant and different roles to play in the nature and dynamics of amelogenin self-assembly (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The study here blends SPR and Y2H methodologies to investigate amelogenin assembly characteristics and presents data that help to explain previous AFM and DLS data in a quantitative manner. For both SPR and Y2H methodologies we provide relative quantitative data for wild-type amelogenin as well as for mutated amelogenins to interact with wild-type amelogenin. Previously AFM and DLS studies gave data related to amelogenin multimolecular assemblies (i.e. nanospheres), and these data included assembly dynamics and size distributions (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The Y2H assay provides data related to the ability of two molecules to interact and is both qualitative and quantitative (7.Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance provides additional information relating to how proteins react, in real time, to other proteins or protein complexes. The aqueous environment chosen to dilute the test protein for the SPR studies is similar to the aqueous environment of the enamel matrix as determined previously,i.e. HBS-EP buffer at pH 7.4 (including150 mmNaCl) approximates closely these ionic values previously determined for maturing enamel (pH 7.26, with 140 mm Na+and 150 mm Cl−) (18.Aoba T. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the recombinant proteins prepared for the SPR studies are non-phosphorylated, a characteristic apparent in some animal species (19.Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Sarte P.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 55: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the use of recombinant proteins to study amelogenin biochemistry is widely accepted and well documented (4.Wen H.B. Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11.Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L.

To simplify our data, we present the following relationship among the studied amelogenins. For the Y2H we determined the strength of interaction for wild-type amelogenin (p86-M180) interacting with the wild-type or altered amelogenins in the pPC97 cassette to be: M180 > (M180T21 → I,P41 → T ≥ M180ΔB ≥ M180P41 → T ≥ M180T21 → I) > M180ΔA. The ratio of magnitude of interaction recorded for the two extreme readings (M180:M180ΔA) is ∼10:1. In a similar fashion, we can present that the SPR response activity for wild-type amelogenin (rM179) interacting with wild-type and altered amelogenin complexes. In the case of SPR the relationship of response activity (for the histidine-tagged recombinant proteins) would be M180 > (M180T21 → I ≥ M180P41 → T) > (M180T21 → I,P41 → T ≥ M180ΔB) ≥ M180ΔA where the ratio of response units of the two extreme readings (M180:M180ΔA) is ∼10:1. Thus, data from the Y2H and SPR techniques are largely concordant. The one anomalous result appears to relate to the M180T21 → I,P41 → T protein. The data from the SPR assay indicate that amelogenin self-assembly is severely affected with this double mutation whereas the Y2H data suggest that this double mutation is minor when compared with other combinations. The double mutation studied in this recombinant protein does not exist in nature and was created to explore another aspect of amelogenin assembly, that being if multiple point mutations have an additive adverse effect on enamel matrix assembly capabilities. We do not know if teeth created with such a double mutation would exhibit a phenotype. The study here has demonstrated that the most dramatic mutation, with respect to interaction and nanosphere assemblies, occurs with the removal of the A domain (amino-terminal 42 amino acids). This domain is roughly equivalent to the tyrosine-rich amelogenin peptide (amino-terminal 45 amino acids of mouse amelogenin). This is not a surprising result and emphasizes previous DLS data in which we found that the A domain is required for protein-to-protein interactions leading to nanosphere self-assembly whereas the absence of the A domain led to inhibition of the self-assembly process (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering showed that the A domain-deleted construct (rp(H)M180ΔA) in solution produced a very heterogeneous size distribution (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To equate this DLS conclusion to our SPR data, it is clear that the A domain-deleted construct reacted weakly with the sensor-bound wild-type amelogenin. Presumably this interaction was mediated through the intact B domain of the sensor-bound protein. Although some self-assembly of the mutated protein may occur prior to passing over the sensor, there appears to be a significant population of monomeric (mutated) amelogenins. This has been determined by generating a series of sensorgrams for selected protein combinations (wild-type interacting with serial dilutions of the A domain-deleted construct) for which kinetic data were determined and matched that of the 1:1 Langmuir binding model (data not shown) (13.Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Removal of the domain B (p97-M180ΔB) resulted in a loss of 75% β-galactosidase activity, compared with wild-type amelogenin, as determined by the yeast assay. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy data showed that the interaction of rp(H)M180ΔB with rM179 produced a significantly reduced response when compared with the rp(H)M180 to rM179 amelogenin interaction using identical molar concentrations (Figs. 2 and 3 B). The removal of the hydrophilic carboxyl terminus may promote hydrophobic interaction between amelogenin molecules. It has previously been postulated that the amelogenin hydrophilic carboxyl terminus is exposed on the surface of the amelogenin nanosphere, making the nanosphere soluble in an aqueous environment and thus preventing the fusion of neighboring nanospheres (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been shown that disruption of the carboxyl terminus would then encourage interactions with neighboring molecules and molecular assemblies. Indeed, DLS data have demonstrated that amelogenin assemblies lacking domain B are unstable and progressively fuse with neighboring assembled amelogenin nanospheres (12.Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a question of correlating the in vitrodata derived here to in vivo data already available. Biomaterials inspired by designs of nature comprise the newly emergent discipline of biomimetics. We anticipate that identifying and understanding the role for the various domains within amelogenin to direct its self-assembly into nanospheres will improve our understanding of the structural hierarchy of the native material and also provide the knowledge base for an enamel biomimetic. With the goal of predicting protein-to-protein and protein-to-mineral interactions using in vitro approaches, we can then correlate such outcomes to the data derived from in vivo experiments using transgenic animals bearing engineered amelogenin protein constructs. Ultimately such a correlation will allow the construction of a biomimetic matrix that can direct the formation of hydroxyapatite into a highly ordered material mimicking the unique properties of the original enamel composite ceramic and do so at physiologic parameters of temperature and ion concentration. We thank Drs. Alan Fincham and Janet Moradian-Oldak for supplying recombinant mouse amelogenin (rM179) protein and William D. Hunter for his expert technical help with the surface plasmon resonance experiments. We would like to thank all our colleagues at the University of Southern California, especially Drs. Zoltan Tokes, Robert Stellwagen, and Noriyuki Kasahara for their support during this study."

The pentameric B-subunit of the toxin can bind to GM1-ganglioside receptors, leading to toxin entry into mammalian cells. Here, the in vitrodisassembly and reassembly of CtxB5 (the B subunit pentamer of cholera toxin) is investigated. When CtxB5 was acidified at pH 1.0 and then neutralized, the B-subunits disassembled and could no longer migrate as SDS-stable pentamers on polyacrylamide gels or be captured by GM1. However, continued incubation at neutral pH resulted in the B-subunits regaining the capacity to be detected by GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (t 1/2 ∼ 8 min) and to migrate as SDS-stable pentamers (t 1/2 ∼ 15 min). Time-dependent changes in Trp fluorescence intensity during B-subunit reassembly occurred with a half-time of ∼8 min, similar to that detected by GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, suggesting that both methods monitor earlier events than B-pentamer formation alone. Based on the Trp fluorescence intensity measurements, a kinetic model of the pathway of CtxB5 reassembly was generated that depended on trans to cisisomerization of Pro-93 to give an interface capable of subunit-subunit interaction. The model suggests formation of intermediates in the reaction, and these were successfully detected by glutaraldehyde cross-linking.

Expression of either CtxB or EtxB in the absence of their corresponding A-subunits results in the formation of highly stable B-subunit pentamers that are devoid of enterotoxic activity. The in vivo pathway of B-subunit pentamerization is poorly understood, chiefly because of the difficulty of investigating such processes in the complex environment of the periplasmic space (17.Mekalanos J.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 118: 97-118PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Hardy S.J. Holmgren J. Johansson S. Sanchez J. Hirst T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(19.Finkelstein R.A. Boesman M. Neoh S.H. LaRue M.K. Delaney R. J. Immunol. 1974; 113: 145-150PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that purified cholera toxin could be denatured in acid urea and subsequently reassembled into active toxin when neutralized. Similarly, when purified CtxB5 or EtxB5 were denatured in acid and subsequently neutralized, the B-subunits were shown to be able to reassemble into stable pentameric complexes (18.Hardy S.J.

The intrinsic stability of CtxB5 or EtxB5 in the presence of SDS has meant that pentamer formation can be investigated by use of SDS-PAGE, and this approach has been used to monitor the kinetics of EtxB pentamerization. However, nothing is known of the pathway of assembly intermediates that are formed during the assembly process. Many other bacterial pathogens also produce toxins with complex oligomeric structures (23.Falnes P.O. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 24.Lesieur C. Vecsey-Semjen B. Abrami L. Fivaz M. Gisou van der Goot F. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 45-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although proper acquisition of their quaternary structure is also known to be essential for the mode of action of these toxins, no stoichiometric intermediates have yet been isolated. Here, we address the question of intermediate formation by studying the reassembly of CtxB pentamers after acid denaturation and subsequent neutralization at pH 7. The assembly of CtxB was followed using different signals, GM1 ELISA, capturing GM1-bound species, SDS-PAGE, measuring pentamer formation, and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, which was found to monitor a structural transition, consistent with oligomer formation. The latter was subjected to a rigorous analysis by computational modeling. CtxB was purified fromVibrio sp. 60 (pTRH64) as described previously (9.Aman A.T. Fraser S. Merritt E.A. Rodigherio C.

The toxin concentration is calculated as the monomeric concentration. SDS-polyacrylamide (13.5%) gel electrophoresis was performed with a Bio-Rad Protean II system using the Laemmli method, as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Either 5 or 2 μg of protein were loaded into each well, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver stain, respectively. The buffers used were McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1m citric acid, pH 6–9), PBS, or KCl/HCl, pH 1. All buffers were filtered through sterile 0.22-μm filter before use. The conditions used for disassembly and reassembly of CtxB5were adapted from those previously employed for studying the reassembly of E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin B-subunit (EtxB) (22.Ruddock L.W. Coen J.J.F. Cheesman C. Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19118-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentration of purified CtxB5 was adjusted with PBS to 344 μm and then diluted 4 times in 0.1m KCl/HCl, pH 1.0. After specified time intervals in these acidic conditions, the samples were diluted 10 times to a final concentration of 8.6 μm in McIlvaine buffer, pH 7.0, and then incubated for a further 60 min at 23 °C. Both immediately after neutralization and after incubation for specified times at 23 °C samples were removed and diluted 100-fold in PBS to prevent further assembly, followed by analysis using a GM1 ELISA (see below, under “Experimental Procedures”). In addition, samples were also removed from the reaction mixture at specified time points and mixed at a ratio of 4:1 with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. These were kept on ice for up to 1 h before applying them to SDS-polyacrylamide gels without prior heating of the samples. This later procedure permits identification of reassembled CtxB5, since at ambient temperatures CtxB5 is stable in SDS-containing buffers and migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an electrophoretic mobility characteristic of the B-subunit pentamer. The percentage of reassembled CtxB5 was determined by quantification of the amount of pentamer at each time point relative to the equivalent amount of native CtxB5 as applied on the same gel using the densitometry software (TL TotalLab V1.11) from Phoretix. Reassembly of CtxB was monitored by measurement of Trp fluorescence in a PerkinElmer LS-50B spectrofluorometer. Base-line data collection was initiated in a cuvette containing neutralizing McIlvaine buffer alone into which was added CtxB that had been subjected to a 10-min denaturation in acid as documented above. The toxin concentration during the acidification step was maintained at 86 μm, whereas after dilution in McIlvaine buffer at appropriate pH levels, the reassembly reaction was monitored over a range of toxin concentrations from 4.3 to 26 μm. Excitation was at 295 nm, with emission recorded at 354 nm, and slit widths of 5 and 8 nm, respectively. When emission spectra were recorded, the Raman contribution for water was removed by subtraction of a buffer blank. The amount of B-subunit in a reassembly mixture that had acquired the ability to bind to GM1 receptors was determined using a GM1 ELISA (21.Ruddock L.W. Ruston S.P. Kelly S.M. Price N.C.

Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Samples of the reassembly mixture were taken at specified time points, diluted 100-fold to a toxin concentration of 86 nm and then added to ELISA plates that had previously been coated with 200 ng of GM1 and subsequently blocked with 1% Marvel in PBS. Samples were serially diluted 2-fold in PBS, and bound B-subunits were detected using a polyclonal mouse anti-CtxB5 antiserum (α12) used at a 1/10000 dilution. All other steps of the GM1 ELISA were as reported previously (26.Amin T. Hirst T.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For quantification of the amount of CtxB bound to the ELISA plates for each test sample, optical density readings corresponding to dilutions located on the linear part of the curve were compared with the dilution of a CtxB5 standard (1 μg/ml, diluted 2-fold), giving the same optical density reading. All the fluorescence spectroscopic data were fitted using the Scientist program (MicroMath Scientific Software) to perform a numerical simulation based on the kinetic pathway proposed in the model (Fig. 6 A). The numerical simulation was performed using Euler integration, and least squares fitting was performed using the modified Powell method within the Scientist program (version 2.01, Micromath 1995). The dependent variables of the equations are M, D, T, TE, and P for the molar concentration of monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer with the proline in a cis conformation and U, M2, M3, M4, M5 for the molar concentration of monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer with the proline in trans conformation.

It is assumed that the fluorescence signal (SIG) for the formation of each interface is equal and therefore varies according to the following relation.SIG=F·(U+M+R·(M2+2·M3+3·M4Equation 11 +4·M5+D+2·T+3·Te+5·P))where F is the fluorescence intensity at time 0, and R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of tryptophan at a properly formed interface by that at a free interface. The fluorescence signal was carried by the pentamer as well as intermediates. The data for all protein concentrations were fitted globally. Differential equations were derived for each partial reaction and weighted statistically before being compiled into a Scientist equation file. All four rate constants, plus base line and the signal of fluorescence were allowed to vary in the fitting procedure. CtxB5 was acidified and neutralized at a final toxin concentration of 26 μm. The reassembly reaction was performed at 23 °C, and aliquots were taken at discrete times (0, 2, 4, 10, and 30 min) after neutralization and mixed for 2 min with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 4% (v/v). 5× sample buffer was added at a ratio of 1:4 to quench the reaction, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. CtxB pentamers disassemble in acidic conditions, giving rise to monomeric B-subunits that can reassemble if placed in buffers of neutral pH (18.Hardy S.J. Holmgren J. Johansson S. Sanchez J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19118-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate the reaction mechanism of reassembly, we analyzed the time course of CtxB oligomerization after acid denaturation and neutralization. First, we monitored the extent of disassembly and reassembly using a GM1 ELISA technique that captures assembled B-subunits on GM1-immobilized microtiter plates. CtxB5 was incubated for various times ranging from 0.3 to 60 min in HCl/KCl buffer, pH 1.0, then neutralized in McIlvaine buffer, pH 7.0, diluted and immediately tested in a GM1 ELISA. Short periods of acidification, e. g. 0.3 min was insufficient to achieve full disassembly of CtxB5, since ∼15% of the B-subunits were detected in the GM1 ELISA immediately after neutralization (Fig. 1 A). However, it was found that acidification for a period of 10–60 min resulted in full disassembly of the B-subunits, since no protein could be detected in the GM1 ELISA (Fig. 1 A; 0 min of neutralization). If after neutralization, the samples were maintained at 23 °C for 60 min before being diluted and then tested in the GM1 ELISA, it was evident that the B-subunits had reassembled and could now be detected by this technique (Fig. 1 A). It was noted that the extent of reassembly declined if the B-subunits were acidified for longer time periods. When CtxB5 was acidified for 10 min then neutralized and incubated for 60 min, ∼75% of the B-subunits regained the ability to be detected in the GM1 ELISA. Because extended periods of acidification reduced the overall yield of assembled CtxB, all subsequent reassembly reactions reported were performed with a 10-min acidification step followed by neutralization. To confirm that assembly of CtxB5 occurs during the 60-min incubation period, samples were taken both immediately and 60 min after neutralization and analyzed by SDS-PAGE without prior heating of the samples. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, after 60 min CtxB pentamers are clearly present, whereas immediately after neutralization they were absent (compare lanes 2 and 3). The electrophoretic mobility of reassembled CtxB5 was identical to that of native CtxB5 (lane 1). Analysis of the kinetics of B-subunit reassembly was monitored by both GM1 ELISA and SDS-PAGE by sampling at various time points after neutralization (Fig. 2). In this experiment CtxB5 was acidified for 10 min and then neutralized to give a final concentration of B-monomers of 8.6 μm. By both techniques a time-dependent increase in formation of reassembled B-subunits was observed, but the half-times for reassembly were different, corresponding to ∼8 or ∼15 min by GM1 ELISA and SDS-PAGE, respectively. In addition the amount of assembled CtxB detectable by the two methods at each time point was also different. These discrepancies may be explained if the GM1 ELISA technique detects intermediate species in addition to CtxB5, since SDS-PAGE monitors the amount of the pentamer alone. In this regard, the GM1 binding site is located at the interface between two subunits, and it is thus reasonable that a dimer, a trimer, or a tetramer as well as a pentamer may bind to GM1. To investigate the kinetics of the assembly process further, Trp fluorescence was employed as a continuous probe to yield data that could be used to model the reassembly reaction and, thus, explain the apparent discrepancy in the assembly kinetics observed by GM1 ELISA and SDS-PAGE. Each CtxB subunit contains a single Trp residue at position 88 that is located at the subunit interface in native CtxB5and should therefore be a useful probe for studying CtxB assembly. Emission scans of native CtxB5 and of CtxB just after neutralization (referred to as CtxB (0 min)) are shown in Fig. 3 A. The fluorescence intensity of CtxB immediately after neutralization was found to be 4-fold lower than that of native CtxB5 when measured at a concentration 8.6 μm (Fig. 3 A). This indicates that upon dissociation/unfolding and neutralization of CtxB, the environment around Trp-88 changes. Taking advantage of this, we investigated the time-dependent change in fluorescence intensity during a reassembly reaction (Fig. 3 B). The experiment was initiated by recording the signal of McIlvaine pH 7 buffer alone, which was then followed by the addition of acidified toxin (arrow in Fig. 3 B). The trace shows that there was an abrupt increase in the initial fluorescence intensity due to the addition of the toxin. Thereafter, a slower increase in fluorescence intensity was observed during the next 60 min. Such a slow increase in fluorescence is unlikely to be monitoring a conformational change associated with the early stages of folding (for review see Refs. 27.Ptitsyn O.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 28.Widmann M. Christen P. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assess whether the slow increase in fluorescence intensity was attributable to an intrinsic slow folding process in the CtxB monomer or to the oligomerization event, the influence of CtxB concentration on the kinetics of fluorescence changes was investigated. CtxB5 was acidified at 86 μm for 10 min and diluted at concentrations ranging from 4.3 to 26 μm in buffer of appropriate pH values to give a final reaction of pH of 7. As can be seen in Fig. 4 the rate of increase in fluorescence intensity increased with CtxB concentration. This demonstrates that the fluorescence measurements monitor a concentration-dependent process. A first-order reaction such as folding of the monomer or intramolecular rearrangement of the pentamer would be concentration-independent. We therefore conclude that the changes in Trp fluorescence monitor the progress of a multi-molecular reaction in which association events were rate-limiting. Interestingly, the half-time of the oligomerization reaction obtained from fluorescence measurements at a CtxB concentration of 8.6 μm was 7.6 ± 0.5 min, which was virtually identical to the half-time of reassembly determined by GM1 ELISA (Fig. 2). This suggests that both techniques are reporting the same reaction. To test if this is the case, the half-time for reassembly at various CtxB concentrations was determined by GM1 ELISA and compared with the half-times obtained using Trp fluorescence (Table I). A striking concurrence of half-times for assembly was obtained using the two techniques. We therefore conclude that the GM1 ELISA and changes in Trp fluorescence measure the same reaction.Table IHalf-times of CtxB5 reassembly as measured by Trp fluorescence and GM1-ELISAMethodsToxin Concentration26 μm17.2 μm8.6 μm4.3 μmminGM1-ELISA2.1 ± 0.53.4 ± 0.77.7 ± 1.015.0 ± 4.0Trp fluorescence2.6 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.57.6 ± 0.516.0 ± 3.0The half-times are given in minutes for toxin reassembly at four different toxin concentrations.

All the experiments were done at 23 °C for 60 min. Because of the accuracy of the kinetic measurements of CtxB assembly obtained by Trp fluorescence, a kinetic model of the reaction mechanism was generated. Given that the changes in Trp fluorescence appear to be reporting the same events as those involved in B-subunit captured by GM1, we speculated that oligomer formation (i.e. dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) is the event being monitored. As can be seen on the x-ray crystallographic structure of CtxB5 reported by Zhanget al. (30.Zhang R.G. Scott D.L. Westbrook M.L. Nance S. Spangler B.D. Shipley G.G. Westbrook E.M. J. Mol.

Scott D.L. Westbrook M.L. Nance S. Spangler B.D. Shipley G.G. Westbrook E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang R.G. Westbrook M.L. Westbrook E.M. Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Maulik P.R. Reed R.A. Shipley G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For these β-strands to align, proline at position 93 must be in a cis configuration, so that β-strand number 6 orients toward the adjacent subunit to form the inter-subunit interface (Fig. 5). In generating a kinetic model of CtxB assembly we have thus assumed that acis proline conformation is required for formation of the inter-subunit interface. Therefore in this model (Fig. 6 A), the monomer exists in two states, a trans configuration (filled circles) and a cis configuration (open circles), and the rate-limiting step in the oligomerization reaction is the rate of proline isomerization. These two states of the monomer have different physical properties with respect to their ability to interact with another monomer and to assemble into oligomeric complexes. Each monomer has two surfaces that are able to interact with adjacent monomers. Thus, if one considers monomer M, a stable subunit interface can be formed through a hydrogen bond network between β-strand number 3 of M and β-strand number 6 of subunit M + 1 or it can be formed between β-strands number 6 of M and β-strand number 3 of subunit M-1. However, if M is in a trans configuration, only one of its surfaces can interact with another monomer since in this case β-strand number 6 is not in the proper orientation to interact with β-strand number 3 of M-1. Thus, if M is in a transconfiguration it can only associate with M + 1, which must be in acis configuration, whereas if M is in a cisconfiguration, both of its surfaces are available for interaction with M + 1 (in a cis configuration) and M − 1 (incis or trans states). Hence only one subunit in the trans configuration can be present in any oligomeric complex, with proline isomerization to a cis configuration required for further association of other monomers. The equilibrium between trans and cis states in any complex formed during the assembly reaction is represented by thevertical arrows in Fig. 6 A. Thehorizontal and the diagonal arrows represent all possible association and dissociation reactions with monomer in atrans or cis configuration (upper pathway), whereas association and dissociation with monomer only in a cis configuration is represented by thehorizontal arrows of the lower pathway. Apart from the monomer in a trans state that cannot associate on one side before proline isomerization, all pathways to the pentamer are allowed, and the rate constants forcis-trans isomerization (k trans for cis-to-transand k cis fortrans-to-cis), association (k ass), and dissociation (k diss) are the same at any stage in the pathway. It is assumed that the dissociation of pentamers is infinitely slow. The fluorescence data were fitted based on the model shown in Fig. 6 A. The equations describing how each species appears and disappears in time are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on those equations, a numerical simulation of all the fluorescence data was undertaken, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and a"

Indeed the ability of aspirin to inhibit TXA2 synthesis is the primary rationale for the widespread use of this agent in recurrent myocardial infarction and more recently in thromboembolic stroke (9.Clarke R.J.

However, despite the clear importance of TXA2 in these disease processes, the molecular interaction of TXA2 with its receptor protein remains unknown. To date, the information available concerning the TP receptor ligand-binding domain(s) has been mostly limited to mutational analyses using receptor chimeras or expressed receptor protein containing site-specific mutations as well as ligand interactions with modified receptor peptides or molecular modeling. Collectively results from these studies have implicated transmembrane domains I, III, IV, V, VI, and VII as well as extracellular domains II and III as potential regions for ligand coordination sites (11.Hirata M.

Since all of the cited receptor regions would not be expected to participate in or form the ligand-binding domain, it would seem that the interpretation of some of these results may be limited by the potential for gross alterations in receptor tertiary structure. Based on this consideration, the present study used two different approaches to identify critical ligand coordination sites in the TP receptor protein. The first of these approaches utilized a novel and recently characterized bifunctional TP receptor antagonist, SQBAzide, to irreversibly label and track ligand-binding sites; the second approach utilized site-specific antibodies to probe different regions of the TP receptor protein. Our results indicate that the C-terminal portion of ED3 may form a critical ligand-binding domain for the TP receptor protein. thromboxane A2 thromboxane A2receptor intracellular domain extracellular domain 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay continuous elution electrophoresis transmembrane domain N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine thromboxane A2 thromboxane A2receptor intracellular domain extracellular domain 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay continuous elution electrophoresis transmembrane domain N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine CHAPS, thrombin, A23187, rabbit preimmune IgG, streptavidin, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, trypsin, and CNBr were purchased from Sigma. U46619 and SQ29,548 were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). [3H]SQ29,548 and Na125I were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The continuous elution electrophoresis apparatus and Whole Gel Eluter were provided by Bio-Rad Laboratories. Outdated human platelet phoresis units (5–10 days postdraw) were acquired from Heartland Blood Services (Aurora, IL). Site-specific peptides were synthesized and purified to >95% purity by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). Dynex Technologies (Chantilly, VA) produced the Immulon 2HB microtiter plates used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Flow cytometric experiments were conducted using a Becton Dickinson FACStar analyzer and Calibrite beads (San Jose, CA). Sequence-specific antibodies were raised by previously described procedures (19.Borg C. Lam C.-T. Dieter J.P. Lim C.T. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) against the following receptor peptide segments: ED2 (ED2Ab: His89–Val98), the N-terminal segment of ED3 (ED3aAb: Gly172–Cys183), the C-terminal segment of ED3 (ED3bAb: Cys183–Asp193), and the N-terminal segment of ED4 (ED4Ab: Thr268–Met276) (Fig. 1 A). Each of these antibodies was reactive against their cognate peptide (shown by ELISA; data not shown). In separate studies, immunoblots against solubilized platelet membranes revealed immunoreactivity at 55 kDa that was blocked by preincubation of the antibodies with their cognate peptides (100 μm; Fig. 1 B). Additional experiments demonstrated that the affinity-purified antibodies also recognized solubilized TP receptors coated to ELISA plates (Fig. 1 C) as well as TP receptors present on intact platelets (determined by flow cytometry; Fig. 1 D). Thus, these antibodies are capable of interacting with their peptide targets in the denatured receptor conformation, in the native receptor conformation, and in the membrane-imbedded conformation. ELISAs were performed to test peptide purified antibody reactivity against conjugate peptide as well as native receptor protein. Immulon 2HB microtiter plates were coated with either 12.5 μg/well synthetic peptide or 125 μg/well solubilized platelet membranes for 18–24 h at room temperature. Following the incubation, the plates were washed three times with 200 μl/well modified Tyrode's buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mmdextrose, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and then nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (200 μl/well) in the same buffer. Plates were again washed three times with the modified Tyrode's buffer prior to applying serial dilutions of various peptide purified site-specific antibodies to the wells in triplicate. Antibodies were allowed to incubate for 1 h followed by three more washes. Antibodies bound to the immobilized peptide or protein were detected by incubation (1 h) with goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy + light) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The wells were then washed a final time before the addition of the horseradish peroxidase substrate solution (50 μl of 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine, 0.012% H2O2 in 80 mm citrate phosphate, pH 5). After a 10-min incubation in the dark, the reaction was quenched with 2 n H2SO4 (200 μl/well). The presence of specific antibodies was measured by the absorbance at 490 nm. Resuspended platelets (20.Kattelman E.J. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 471-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1 × 107 platelets/ml were incubated with various peptide purified site-specific antibodies (1:100 (v/v)) for 1 h. Samples were washed twice prior to the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:80 (v/v)). Samples were incubated for an additional hour prior to analysis. A Becton Dickinson FACStar analyzer was used to perform single-color analysis on the samples. The fluorescence channel was calibrated with 2-μm Calibrite beads and adjusted to reflect logarithmic output. A lower limit threshold was set for data acquisition thereby eliminating background scatter. CHAPS-solubilized platelet membranes were incubated with SQBAzide (2 μm) for 15 min in the dark, and the samples were then subjected to photolysis with ultraviolet light for 1 min at a distance of 5 cm using a 100-watt Olympus mercury lamp. Photolysis was terminated by the addition of dithiothreitol (4 mm) to the samples followed by a 10× concentration of the product by centrifugal filtration through 0.1-μm low binding Durapore membranes from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Proteins within the concentrated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the entire gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The receptor protein was then blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dried milk and probed for irreversibly bound SQBAzide by incubating the membrane for 2 h with 5% nonfat dried milk containing 37.5 nm125I-streptavidin (which binds the biotin functional groups of SQBAzide). After washing with 0.1% Tween in 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h, autoradiography of the membrane was performed. Chemical digestion of TP receptors was performed with CNBr according to the method described by Gross (21.Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-253Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In this procedure, receptor protein was suspended in 70% formic acid resulting in a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. CNBr crystals were then added in 100× molar excess over methionine residues in the protein with digestion carried out at room temperature while tilting the solution for 24–36 h in the dark. Digestion was terminated by diluting the sample solution to 7% formic acid with deionized water immediately followed by lyophilization. Receptor proteins were partially purified by the technique of SDS-CEE as described previously (22.Hager K.M. Wright E.M. Bulletin 1685. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA1994Google Scholar). In this procedure, using a continuous elution electrophoresis apparatus, a typical SDS-polyacrylamide gel was cast in a cylindrical electrophoresis tube bathed in a tank of running buffer. Solubilized platelet membranes in sample buffer were then applied to the top of the tube gel. The apparatus was operated at 2 watts constant power until the dye front migrated through the tube gel. At this time, an outlet connection at the bottom of the tube gel was connected to a peristaltic pump (rate = 0.1 ml/min), and 1-ml fractions containing proteins of decreasing electrophoretic mobilities were isolated over a 16-h period. A modification of this technique was used to fractionate receptor protein fragments following chemical digestion (23.Turek J.W. Le Breton G.C. Bulletin 2344. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA1998Google Scholar). To isolate these low molecular weight proteins, 16.5% Tricine gels were cast in the tube gel system using buffers as first described by Schagger and von Jagow (24.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Protein digests were then electrophoresed at 4 watts and fractionated as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed with either ED3aAb or rabbit preimmune IgG. Specifically 400 μl of antibody (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 400 μl of receptor digestion fragments overnight followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (200 μl) for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with 400 μl of 10 mm CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline. After the final wash, the supernatant was removed and the remaining beads were boiled for 5 min and then microcentrifuged for 2 min. The supernatant served as the immunoprecipitated product. Protein fragments were dialyzed and lyophilized to dryness prior to resuspension in 100 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The samples were subsequently incubated with trypsin at a 1:50 dilution of enzyme:substrate for 4 h at 37 °C. CHAPS-solubilized platelet membranes (100 μl; 2 mg/ml protein) were incubated with [3H]SQ29,548 (2 nm) for total binding samples. [3H]SQ29,548 (2 nm) plus unlabeled SQ29,548 (2 μm) were co-incubated in the nonspecific binding samples, and [3H]SQ29,548 (2 nm) plus various amounts of site-specific antibodies or rabbit preimmune IgG (1 nm–1 μm) were co-incubated in the competition binding samples. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the protein samples were immobilized on Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters (presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine for 1 h) by vacuum filtration and immediately washed twice with 5 ml of buffer (25 mm Tris base, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4; 4 °C). The filters were assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a Beckman LS 6800. Resuspended platelets used in the aggregation studies were prepared from platelet-rich plasma obtained from the University of Illinois Hospital Blood Bank (Chicago, IL) according to the method of Kattelman (20.Kattelman E.J. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 471-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly platelet-rich plasma was treated with aspirin (3 mm) to inhibit endogenous platelet production of TXA2. The platelet-rich plasma was then centrifuged at 1400 × g for 15 min at 22 °C to pellet the platelets, and the pellet was resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer. Platelets were counted and adjusted to a cell count of ∼1.0 × 109 platelets/ml. The platelets were incubated with indomethacin (20 μm). In the aggregation studies, various site-specific antibodies or rabbit preimmune IgG (200 nm) were incubated at room temperature with the platelets for 30 min prior to the addition of submaximal concentrations (eliciting ∼80% maximal aggregation) of the TP receptor agonist U46619 (200 nm), thrombin (1 unit/ml), or the divalent cation ionophore A23187 (2 μm). The aggregatory response was measured on a model 400 Lumi-aggregometer. SQBAzide (25.Halmos T. Turek J.W. Le Breton G.C. Antonakis K. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2963-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) represents a unique probe that combines a photolabile azide moiety with a biotin functional group (Fig. 2 A). To assess the ability of SQBAzide to specifically and irreversibly label TP receptor protein, competition photoaffinity labeling studies were first performed. Labeling of solubilized platelet membranes with SQBAzide followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography with 125I-streptavidin revealed intense labeling of TP receptors at 55 kDa. The specificity of this labeling for ligand-binding sites was demonstrated by the finding that two structurally different receptor antagonists, SQ29,548 (Fig. 2 B) and BM13.505 (data not shown), effectively competed for the bulk of the 55 kDa photolabeling. In subsequent experiments, the photolabeled TP receptors were partially purified using SDS-CEE (22.Hager K.M. Wright E.M. Bulletin 1685. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA1994Google Scholar). The eluted fraction containing the 55-kDa proteins was chemically digested on the C-terminal side of methionine residues using CNBr. The predicted CNBr cleavage sites of TP receptor protein would be expected to yield peptide fragments of varying size between 27.4 and 0.7 kDa (Table I). It was found that Tricine gel electrophoresis (24.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) of the digestion products followed by autoradiography with 125I-streptavidin yielded a major labeled fragment that corresponds to one of these predicted fragments,i.e. an 8.1-kDa peptide (Fig. 2 C and Table I). The presence of this 8.1-kDa fragment suggests that photolabeling of the receptor protein occurs within a peptide sequence spanning amino acids Ala127 through Met202, which represents a region between ID2 and the leading edge of transmembrane domain V (TM5).Table IPredicted major CNBr cleavage fragments of the human TP receptorSequenceMolecular massReceptor location1-aReceptor localization of CNBr-digested fragments based upon sequence hydrophobicity analysis of the putative seven transmembrane-spanning receptor, TP receptor.kDaTrp2–Met10827.4 (glycosylated)N terminus, TM1, ID1, TM2, ED2, part of TM3Ile113–Met1261.4Most of TM3, part of ID2Ala127–Met2028.1Most of ID2, TM4, ED3, part of TM5Leu203–Met2434.4Most of TM5, most of ID3Ala245–Met2510.7Part of ID3, part of TM6Val252–Met2762.7Most of TM6, part of ED4Ser277–Met36910.5Most of ED4, TM7, C terminus1-a Receptor localization of CNBr-digested fragments based upon sequence hydrophobicity analysis of the putative seven transmembrane-spanning receptor, TP receptor. Open table in a new tab The sequence identity of this labeled 8.1-kDa fragment was next investigated by studies using a new library of rabbit antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”) directed against different peptide regions of the TP receptor protein. It can be seen that when this putative amino acid sequence (Ala127–Met202) was probed with antibodies against ED2 (ED2Ab: His89–Val98), ED3 (ED3aAb: Gly172–Cys183; ED3bAb: Cys183–Asp193), and ED4 (ED4Ab: Thr268–Met276) no immunoreactivity was observed in the region of ED2 or ED4 (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, positive immunoreactivity was observed for both ED3aAb and ED3bAb (Fig. 3 A), which target the sequence between Gly172and Asp193 comprising ED3. These findings therefore indicate that the 8.1-kDa photolabeled fragment contains an amino acid sequence (Gly172–Asp193) known to be present in ED3 and that the presence of this sequence in the CNBr digest is consistent with the known CNBr cleavage sites. The sequence identity of the 8.1-kDa labeled fragment was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies. Specifically samples containing the 8.1 ± 1-kDa CNBr digest were pooled, concentrated, and immunoprecipitated with ED3aAb, which recognizes the N-terminal half of ED3 containing amino acids Gly172–Cys183. The immunoprecipitated protein was then probed by dot blot analysis using125I-streptavidin for assessment of SQBAzide photolabeling. It can be seen (Fig. 3 B) that relative to preimmune IgG, ED3aAb immunoprecipitated the SQBAzide-photolabeled 8.1-kDa CNBr fragment. Thus, the predicted chemical CNBr cleavage sequence for the 8.1-kDa fragment (Ala127–Met202) was confirmed by immunoblotting, and photolabeling of this predicted sequence was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. However, while the above studies establish that the Gly172–Cys183 sequence constitutes a portion of the 8.1-kDa labeled fragment, they do not determine whether photolabeling occurs within the Gly172–Cys183sequence itself. This possibility was investigated by a series of experiments in which the concentrated 8.1-kDa sample was subjected to further digestion with trypsin. Specifically the concentrated 8.1-kDa CNBr digest was divided into two samples. One sample was treated with trypsin vehicle, and the other sample was digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each sample was then subjected to SDS-CEE. To determine the efficiency of tryptic digestion, fragments in each sample migrating to 8.1 ± 1 kDa were collected, pooled, and concentrated. Furthermore, since tryptic digestion of the CNBr 8.1-kDa fragment is predicted to yield a 2.9-kDa peptide (Arg174–Met202) containing ED3 (previously shown to be immunoreactive against ED3aAb and ED3bAb; Fig. 3 A), fractions migrating to 2.9 ± 1 kDa were also collected, pooled, and concentrated. The SDS-CEE fractions corresponding to the following molecular masses were collected: the 8.1-kDa fraction (no trypsin), the 2.9-kDa fraction (no trypsin), the 8.1-kDa fraction (plus trypsin), and the 2.9- kDa fraction (plus trypsin). These fractions were then immunoprecipitated with ED3aAb. The immunoprecipitated protein was probed by dot blot analysis using125I-streptavidin for assessment of SQBAzide photolabeling and normalized for nonspecific immunoprecipitation by using preimmune serum. Table II illustrates that the efficiency of trypsin digestion was ∼60%, i.e. the counts in the 8.1-kDa fragment decreased from 16,758 to 6,480 cpm. It can also be seen that following trypsin digestion the bulk of the counts shifted to the 2.9-kDa fragment. More importantly, however, the decrease in counts in the 8.1-kDa fragment can be completely accounted for by the increase in counts in the 2.9-kDa fragment. This finding establishes that the labeling of the 8.1-kDa fragment is exclusively localized in the 2.9-kDa subfragment. Furthermore, the ability of ED3aAb to immunoprecipitate this 2.9-kDa fragment is consistent with the known cleavage sites for both CNBr and trypsin and provides evidence that SQBAzide photolabels the amino acid sequence Arg174–Met202 of the TP receptor protein.Table IIImmunoprecipitation of photolabeled fragments from CNBr/trypsin digestionCNBrCNBr + trypsin8 kDa3 kDa8 kDa16,758ND2-aND, not detectable.6,48011,3592-a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Subsequent competition radioligand binding studies confirmed this notion and identified a subregion of the Arg174–Met202 sequence that is required for ligand interaction. Specifically affinity-purified antibodies against ED2 (ED2Ab), ED3 (ED3aAb and ED3bAb), and ED4 (ED4Ab) were tested for their ability to compete with binding of the TP receptor antagonist [3H]SQ29,548 to solubilized TP receptors. It was found (Fig. 4, A and B) that throughout the concentration range of 10−9–10−6m, ED2Ab (His89–Val98) or ED4Ab (The268–Met276) had no measurable effect on [3H]SQ29,548 binding. This finding may be expected since neither antibody targets the photolabeled sequence (Arg174–Met202). Furthermore, when the N-terminal portion of this sequence was probed with ED3aAb (Gly172–Cys183), again no effect on ligand binding was observed (Fig. 4 C). This lack of inhibition cannot be due to an inability of ED3aAb to interact with membrane-associated TP receptors since this antibody was shown by flow cytometry to react with intact platelet TP receptors (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the N-terminal portion of ED3 does not appear to be critical for ligand interaction. In contrast, the same concentration range of ED3bAb, which targets the C-terminal portion of ED3 (Cys183–Asp193), produced a dose-dependent inhibition of binding with the highest concentration resulting in an 80% reduction of binding activity (Fig4 D). Furthermore, evidence that this inhibition was sequence-specific was provided in additional experiments in which ED3bAb was preabsorbed with its cognate peptide. Under these conditions, the ability of the antibody to inhibit binding was reversed (data not shown). Based on these considerations, it appears that the C-terminal (Cys183–Asp193) and not the N-terminal portion (Gly172–Cys183) of ED3 is important for ligand coordination. Since the above results demonstrate that ED3bAb blocks TP receptor ligand binding, it might be expected that this antibody should also affect TP receptor-mediated platelet aggregation. This was indeed found to be the case. In these experiments, resuspended platelets were treated with ED3bAb or preimmune IgG prior to addition of the TXA2 mimetic U46619. It was found that 200 nmof this antibody produced substantial inhibition of platelet aggregation (Fig. 5 A). In separate experiments it was shown that preabsorption of ED3bAb with its cognate peptide completely reversed this antibody inhibition of aggregation. Furthermore, this same concentration of ED3bAb had no effect on aggregation induced by either thrombin or the divalent cation ionophore A23187 (Fig. 5, B and C). These results indicate that antibody interaction with the C-terminal segment (Cys183–Asp193) of ED3 specifically blocks platelet aggregation mediated through the TP receptor pathway. ED3bAb therefore represents the first functional antibody against the TP receptor protein. Additional studies with ED2Ab and ED3aAb revealed no effect on U46619-induced aggregation (Fig. 6). However, ED4Ab was found to produce limited inhibition. Since this antibody had no effect on radioligand binding (Fig. 4 B), the nature of the inhibition is unclear. Finally, none of these antibodies had any effect on thrombin- orA23187-induced aggregation (data not shown).Figure 6Ability of various site-specific antibodies to inhibit TP receptor-mediated platelet aggregation.

The biotinylated photoaffinity probe SQBAzide was shown to specifically label TP receptor protein, and digestion of this protein with CNBr revealed that the bulk of the photolabeling appeared in an 8.1-kDa fragment predicted to represent the receptor segment between Ala127–Met202. The identity of this predicted sequence and the location of labeling within this sequence was next determined by the application of site-specific antibodies directed against different regions of the receptor protein. Consistent with the predicted cleavage sites for CNBr, it was found that the labeled 8.1-kDa CNBr fragment was not recognized by antibodies against sequences in ED2 (His89–Val98) or ED4 (Thr268–Met276) but could be immunoblotted and immunoprecipitated by antibodies raised against contiguous sequences in ED3, i.e. Gly172–Cys183 and Cys183–Asp193. Furthermore, the digestion of this CNBr fragment with trypsin yielded a labeled 2.9-kDa fragment with a predicted sequence of Arg174–Met202. This predicted sequence was in turn confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies using an antibody (ED3aAb) that recognizes the Gly172–Cys183 sequence contained within ED3. Subsequent studies used different antibodies to probe the subregion of the 2.9-kDa fragment that is involved in ligand binding. It was found that only ED3bAb effectively blocked [3H]SQ29,548 binding, suggesting that the sequence Cys183–Asp193 may contain a critical ligand coordination site. The inability of the other antibodies to interfere with binding cannot be due to slight differences in affinity for TP receptors (Fig. 1 D) since the radioligand binding studies were conducted over a 3 log unit antibody concentration range. The importance of the region containing the Cys183–Asp193 sequence was confirmed in platelet aggregation studies that revealed that ED3bAb specifically blocked U46619-induced aggregation, while antibodies against other receptor regions (ED2Ab and ED3aAb) were without effect. On the other hand, these studies also showed that ED4Ab produced modest inhibition of U46619-induced aggregation (Fig. 6). However, since ED4Ab did not interfere with radioligand binding to TP receptors (Fig. 4 B), the observed inhibition may derive from secondary causes, e.g. allosteric effects on receptor-G protein coupling. This mechanism presumably does not play an important role in ED3bAb inhibition since a given concentration of ED3bAb produced similar inhibition of ligand binding and aggregation (50 and 70%), suggesting a direct relationship between reduced ligand binding and reduced aggregation. Taken together the present results therefore indicate that the third extracellular receptor domain contains an important ligand-binding site in the region of amino acids Cys183–Asp193. In contrast to the aforementioned data, much of the previous work done to elucidate a ligand-binding domain on the TP receptor and other G protein-coupled receptors has centered on the participation of transmembrane regions. This focus can be traced to earlier studies done on bacteriorhodopsin and its G protein-coupled receptor homolog, rhodopsin, that revealed a binding pocket in the seventh membrane-spanning region of the receptor protein (26.Findlay J.B.C. Pappin D.J.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 625-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The subsequent cloning of several of the G protein-coupled receptors identified a family of proteins not only sharing structural similarity but also notable transmembrane sequence homology with rhodopsin. As a result, the majority of investigations into the composition of the ligand-binding pocket for these receptors hypothesized transmembrane involvement. In this regard, experiments performed on two of the most extensively studied seven transmembrane receptors, the α2- and β2-adrenergic receptors, suggested that the fourth and seventh transmembrane regions, respectively, participate in ligand binding (27.Matsui H. Lefkowitz R. Caron M. Regan J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28.Wong S.K.-F. Slaughter C. Ruoho A. Ross E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7925-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the TP receptor belongs to the seven transmembrane-spanning class of receptors, it was originally proposed that the binding domain of this receptor may also reside in TM7 (11.Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Other investigators (14.Narumiya S. Hirata N. Namba T. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 6: 155-161PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that while TM7 interacts with the ligand carboxyl group, separate transmembrane regions also participate in ligand binding,i.e. TM3 coordinates with the prostanoid ring, and the TM4 and TM5 regions interact with the alkyl chains. More recently site-directed mutagenesis studies have investigated the ligand coordination site for TP receptors. Specifically, Funk et al. (12.Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. FitzGerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar) obtained four mutants with point mutations at TM7 of the TP receptor, i.e. between Leu291 and Trp299. Three of these mutants completely lost binding activity to both antagonists and agonists. Although the fourth mutant, W299L, did not recognize the TP receptor antagonist SQ29,548, it was capable of binding two different TP receptor agonists with the same affinity as that observed for the wild type receptor. In addition, Chiang et al. (15.Chiang N. Kan W.M. Tai H.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that mutations of S201A and S255A at TM5 and TM6, respectively, caused altered affinity to the agonist I-BOP but had no effect on binding SQ29,548. Collectively these latter results indicate that alterations in either the TM5, TM6, or TM7 region can diminish ligand binding to TP receptors. Separate studies by Dorn et al. (17.Dorn II, G.W. Davis M.G. D'Angelo D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12399-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) used receptor chimeras to evaluate ligand binding activity. We concluded that residues in TM1 constitute an important portion of the TP receptor binding site. Finally, reports from two different groups suggested that the putative disulfide bond between Cys105 and Cys183/184 in ED2 and ED3, respectively, plays a critical role in receptor-ligand binding. In particular, mutants C105A and C183A from the human placenta TP receptor (15.Chiang N. Kan W.M. Tai H.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and mutants C105S and C184S from human K562 TP receptors (16.D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J. Davis M.G. Dorn II, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6233-6240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) did not show binding activity of either agonists or antagonists. In addition, both groups reported that Cys102, which is conserved in most seven transmembrane-spanning receptors including the TP receptor (but absent in other prostanoid receptors), also plays an important, yet unspecified role in ligand binding. Thus, the previous results point to multiple sites in the TP receptor that may seem critical for ligand binding, i.e.transmembrane regions I, III, IV, V, VI, and VII as well as cysteine residues in ED2 and ED3. However, since alterations in either hydrophobic segments or the elimination of disulfide bonds can lead to significant effects on protein structure, at least some of these receptor alterations may not be at the critical ligand coordination site(s). Based on this consideration, the existence of a definitive transmembrane ligand-binding domain for the TP receptor has yet to be established. Regarding other possible ligand-binding sites, evidence also exists to support the notion that ligands can coordinate with extracellular domains. Specifically our previous results using the biotinylated TP receptor antagonist SQB (29.Komiotis D. Wencel-Drake J.D. Dieter J.P. Lim C.T. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SQB can simultaneously bind to intact platelet TP receptors and the 68-kDa protein avidin. On the other hand, molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the SQB extended conformation is only 20.5 Å, and the relaxed conformation is considerably less. On this basis, we proposed that the ligand coordination site(s) for the TP receptor must reside at or near the external aspect of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, work done on the bradykinin B2 receptor using site-specific antibodies has identified the N-terminal portion of ED3 as crucial to both ligand binding and agonist function (30.Alla S.A. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recently a constrained peptide containing amino acids representing ED3 of the TP receptor was shown to change conformation in response to the TP receptor antagonist SQ29,548 (18.Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results in combination with the present data suggest that extracellular regions of seven transmembrane receptors may represent important ligand coordination sites. For the TP receptor we have provided evidence that one of these extracellular regions may reside in the C-terminal portion of ED3 that contains amino acids Cys183–Asp193. On the other hand, this finding does not exclude the possibility that other amino acid sequences in the receptor may also participate in ligand coordination. Nevertheless it is believed that identification of this specific amino acid region will serve as an important reference point for future modeling studies describing the three-dimensional structure of the TP receptor binding pocket. This information should, in turn, facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which TXA2 binds to this biologically important receptor protein."

This regulation is an important developmental event that rids receptors from the extrajunctional region of the developing muscle fiber. In avian muscle, it has been proposed that muscle activity suppresses nAChR gene expression via calcium-activated protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation of the myogenic transcription factor, myogenin. Here, we examined the role that PKC and other kinases play in mediating calcium- and activity-dependent suppression of nAChR genes in rat primary myotubes. We found that although activated PKC could regulate nAChR promoter activity and transiently suppressed both nAChR and myogenin gene expression, it did not appear to be required for calcium- or activity-dependent control of nAChR gene expression in mammalian muscle. Neither depletion of PKC from myotubes nor specific pharmacological inhibition of PKC blocked the suppression of nAChR gene expression produced by calcium or muscle depolarization. In contrast, we provide evidence that calcium/calmodulin-activated protein kinase II participates in mediating the effects of muscle depolarization on nAChR and myogenin gene expression.

They are ligand-gated ion channels that are composed of four different subunits with a stoichiometry of α2βγ(ɛ)δ. The nerve plays an important role in regulating the expression and distribution of nAChRs along the surface of the muscle fiber (reviewed in Ref. 1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Prior to muscle innervation or after denervation, nAChRs are expressed throughout the surface membrane. In contrast, after innervation, these receptors are localized to the neuromuscular junction. The process of receptor localization involves both neurotrophic influences and nerve-elicited muscle depolarization. Neuronal secretion of agrin and acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity result in receptor clustering and subsynaptic nuclear expression of nAChR genes, whereas muscle depolarization results in suppression of nAChR genes in extrajunctional nuclei. Depolarization-dependent suppression of nAChR gene expression has been attributed to increases in intracellular calcium (2Klarsfeld A. Laufer R. Fontaine B. Devillers-Thiery A. Dubreuil C.

When skeletal muscle is made inactive by denervation or pharmacological treatment with drugs such as the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), calcium concentrations remain low (4Huang C.-F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 167-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and extrajunctional expression of the nAChR genes is increased dramatically (5Merlie J.P. Isenberg K.E.

Neuron. 1988; 1: 329-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, when denervated muscle is electrically stimulated, intracellular calcium concentrations are elevated (4Huang C.-F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 167-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and receptor expression is suppressed (6Goldman D. Brenner H.R. Heinemann S.

Similarly, receptor expression is suppressed in TTX-treated myotubes when they are exposed to calcium-elevating drugs (2Klarsfeld A. Laufer R. Fontaine B. Devillers-Thiery A. Dubreuil C.

Although muscle depolarization and increases in intracellular calcium can initiate the process of nAChR suppression in extrajunctional nuclei, the signal transduction pathways involved in these processes remain controversial. Experiments performed in avian muscle have implicated protein kinase C (PKC) as the primary mediator of activity-dependent, calcium-induced suppression of nAChR gene expression (2Klarsfeld A.

The proposed model of suppression involves depolarization-dependent activation of a calcium- and phospholipid-dependent PKC (4Huang C.-F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J.

Although there is ample evidence that PKC participates in mediating the effects of muscle activity on nAChR gene expression in birds (2Klarsfeld A. Laufer R. Fontaine B. Devillers-Thiery A.

Moreover, although previous experiments have suggested that a phorbol ester-responsive PKC mediates nAChR gene expression by muscle depolarization in chick muscle, recent experiments have not supported these data and suggest that an atypical PKC may be involved (11Altiok N. Changeux J.-P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, even in chick muscle, the mechanism by which muscle activity suppresses nAChR gene expression remains unclear. We recently showed that the rat muscle nAChR δ-subunit gene promoter is robustly regulated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) activity (19Tang H. Sun Z. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26057-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CaMK II activity increases upon muscle depolarization and reduces binding of a myogenin-containing complex to the 47-bp activity-dependent enhancer of the δ-subunit gene. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative CaMK II in contracting primary rat myotubes increased nAChR δ-subunit promoter activity (19Tang H. Sun Z. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26057-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data suggest that CaMK II may participate in activity-dependent suppression of nAChR gene expression in mammalian muscle. However, the above studies did not determine whether other nAChR subunit genes are also regulated by CaMK II and whether this enzymatic activity is solely responsible for nAChR gene suppression by muscle depolarization. To further evaluate the role that myogenin, PKC, and CaMK II play in regulating mammalian nAChR gene expression by muscle activity and calcium, we have employed a sensitive RNase protection assay for nAChR hnRNA. This assay allows for analysis of rapid changes (3–6 h) in gene expression that may be missed using more conventional mRNA assays and gene transfection studies. These experiments revealed that active PKC can suppress both nAChR and myogenin gene expression in mammalian muscle. However, nAChR gene suppression produced by either calcium-elevating drugs or electrical stimulation did not require PKC activity. This result contrasts with that reported for chick muscle, where PKC enzymatic activity is required for depolarization-dependent gene suppression (2Klarsfeld A. Laufer R. Fontaine B. Devillers-Thiery A. Dubreuil C. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1229-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Huang C.-F. Tong J. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Altiok N. Changeux J.-P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Instead, we found that CaMK II activity contributes to the effects of muscle depolarization on nAChR gene expression. In addition, our data suggest that decreased nAChR gene expression caused by muscle depolarization and sustained increases in intracellular calcium is mediated by different signal transduction cascades. Rat primary myoblasts were isolated as described previously (20Goldman D. Carlson B.M. Staple J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 649-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 35-mm collagen-coated culture dishes at a density of 106/ml. Proliferating myoblasts were grown at 37 °C and 8% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. Between 48 and 72 h post-plating, cultures became confluent, and the medium was adjusted to 5% horse serum to induce myotube formation. At this time, cells were treated with 3 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside for 48 h to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. All primary myotube cultures were treated with 2 μg/ml TTX from the time of myotube formation. With the exception of TTX, pharmacological reagents were added to myotubes between 4 and 6 days after myotube formation. TTX was obtained from Oretek, Inc. (Fremont, CA) and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (2 μg/ml). All other drugs were purchased from Sigma or Calbiochem and prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO. The final drug concentrations used in our experiments were as follows: KN-93, 5 μm; A23187, phorbol 21-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and ryanodine, 1 μm; Go6983, 600 nm; GF109203X, 250 nm; thapsigargin, 100 nm; and staurosporine, 20 nm. Stock solutions were between 500- and 1000-fold concentrated and stored frozen at −20 °C. Treatment of myotubes with 0.2% Me2SO had no effect on either myogenin or nAChR RNA or on cell morphology. For experiments in which myotubes were electrically stimulated, cultures were rinsed twice with TTX-free medium and then returned to the incubator for ∼1 h before commencing with the stimulation protocol. Myotubes were electrically stimulated to contract for up to 24 h using conditions described previously (21Chahine K.G. Walke W. Goldman D. Development. 1992; 115: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented for myotubes that were electrically stimulated for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated by homogenizing cell cultures in Trizol (Invitrogen), followed by the single-step purification method described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Antisense probes used to detect myogenin and nAChR α-, γ-, and ɛ-subunit RNAs were the same as those described by Chahineet al. (22Chahine K.G. Baracchini E. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were carried out as previously described (3Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The probe for the nAChR α-subunit contains 240 nucleotides of exon 8 flanked by ∼310 nucleotides of intron on the 5′-end and 50 nucleotides of intron on the 3′-end. Consequently, measures of the full-length protected probe reflected changes in the nAChR α-subunit hnRNA, whereas measures of the 240-nucleotide fragment reflected changes in the nAChR α-subunit mRNA. The probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). GAPDH probes were included in each experiment and served to normalize for differences in the amount of RNA in each of the samples. GAPDH was chosen for normalization because it was not regulated by any of the conditions employed in this report (7Huang C.-F. Tong J. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 2P. Macpherson and D. Goldman, unpublished data. RNase-resistant hybrids were analyzed on 8 m urea and 6% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Probe signals were quantified by scanning densitometry, and values were normalized to the RNA signal obtained for GAPDH. The specificity of the protected bands was confirmed by hybridizing probes to tRNA, resulting in no protected fragments on the gel. Probe integrity was monitored for each experiment by running an aliquot of non-hybridized probe on each gel. Cytosolic and membrane fractions from cultured myotubes were prepared by scraping cells from the dishes in homogenization buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μmeach leupeptin and pepstatin A). Cells were sheared by passage through a 26.5-gauge needle and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatants were collected (cytosolic fraction), and pellets (membrane fraction) were solubilized in SDS-containing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm each leupeptin and pepstatin A). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Gels with identical samples were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and used as an additional control for equilibration of protein loading. After transfer, Immobilon-P membranes were blocked in Blotto buffer containing 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-myogenin monoclonal antibody (clone F5D; obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) or with rabbit anti-phospho-PKCα/β polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). Immunodetection was done using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) with subsequent chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was quantified by scanning densitometry. A constitutively active PKCα isoform was created by deleting its inhibitory domain as previously described (23James G. Olson E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). pδ-47MEKLuc contains the 47-bp activity-dependent enhancer of the nAChR δ-subunit gene upstream of the minimal enkephalin promoter (24Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMVCAT, which harbors the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used for normalization. The pCS2Gal4 plasmid, containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was a kind gift of Dr. Turner (University of Michigan). The pCS2Gal4Mgn plasmid, containing full-length rat myogenin (Mgn) cDNA fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, was made by subcloning myogenin into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the pCS2Gal4 plasmid. Expression of full-length myogenin using this plasmid was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-myogenin antibody (clone F5D). The pGal4TKLuc reporter plasmid harbors four tandem repeats of the Gal4 DNA-binding sequence upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving luciferase expression. Primary embryonic rat muscle cell cultures (80–90% confluence) in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1.5 μg of DNA mixture containing active pPKCα (0.2 μg), pδ-47MEKLuc (0.3 μg), pCMVCAT (0.5 μg), and Bluescript (BSSK) plasmid (0.5 μg) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were incubated in differentiation medium. Three days later, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and CAT activities as described previously (25Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were transfected with pGal4Luc (0.6 μg), pCMVCAT (0.5 μg), and pGal4 (0.4 μg) or pGal4-Mgn (0.4 μg); differentiated; and then treated with buffer or drug (A23187 or ryanodine; 0.2 μm) to raise intracellular calcium levels. Forty-eight hours after drug treatment, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and CAT activities. Means ± S.E. were determined for samples from primary cultures. To determine differences in mean values of expression of myogenin and nAChR RNAs and myogenin protein, one-way analyses of variance were performed. If the F statistic of the analysis of variance showed significance, differences among means were detected using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons post-hoc test. The level of significance was set a priori atp < 0.05. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Muscle denervation induces myogenin and nAChR RNA expression, whereas electrical stimulation of denervated muscle suppresses both of these gene activities (14Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kostrominova T.Y. Macpherson P.C.D. Carlson B.M. Goldman D. Am. J.

Goldman D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This effect of muscle activity on gene expression is thought to be mediated by increases in intracellular calcium (2Klarsfeld A. Laufer R. Fontaine B. Devillers-Thiery A. Dubreuil C. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1229-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In avian muscle, activity- and calcium-dependent suppression of myogenin and nAChR RNAs occurs within a few hours after the onset of stimulation (4Huang C.-F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 167-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although we had previously documented that increasing intracellular calcium can suppress nAChR gene expression in rat muscle (3Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we did not know how rapidly this response occurred or whether myogenin was regulated in a similar fashion. To examine the effects of calcium on myogenin and nAChR RNA expression in mammalian muscle, we assayed their RNAs at various times after raising intracellular calcium. Myogenin is a relatively unstable mRNA with a half-life of ∼20 min (28Edmondson D.G. Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21343-21346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); and therefore, its level is thought to reflect its gene activity. In contrast, nAChR mRNAs are relatively stable and do not necessarily reflect rapid changes in gene expression (30Neville C. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To obtain a more accurate reflection of nAChR gene activity, we assayed nAChR α-subunit hnRNA as well as mRNA levels. In general, hnRNAs are processed rapidly to remove noncoding intronic sequences from the primary RNA transcript prior to mRNA export (31Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once mRNA is formed, a variety of factors can have an impact on its stability (32Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Consequently, the levels of hnRNA more accurately reflect rapid changes in transcription than do measurements of relatively long-lived mRNAs. In our experiments, rat primary myotubes were treated with A23187, a calcium ionophore; ryanodine, an activator of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; or thapsigargin, an inhibitor of calcium ATPases. Within 6 h of treatment with either A23187 or ryanodine, the level of myogenin mRNA was reduced by at least 50%, but returned to control values by 48 h of drug treatment (Fig.1, A and B). In contrast, thapsigargin had little effect on myogenin RNA, yet suppressed nAChR hnRNA and mRNA (Fig. 1C). After treatment of cells with A23187, ryanodine, or thapsigargin, reductions in nAChR α-subunit hnRNA occurred within 6–12 h of drug stimulation; but unlike the myogenin response, further reductions were observed through 48 h of stimulation (Fig. 1). Although the time required to produce an initial reduction in mRNA tended to take longer, the changes observed in the nAChR α-subunit hnRNA were also reflected at the level of its mRNA (Fig. 1). The observation that myogenin RNA does not change significantly in response to thapsigargin treatment may indicate that the effects of calcium drugs on myogenin expression are nonspecific. However, we noted a reproducible, but statistically insignificant, 10–15% decrease in myogenin RNA levels at 6 h of thapsigargin treatment (Fig.1C). This small response may reflect the mechanism of thapsigargin action rather than a nonspecific effect of other calcium-elevating drugs. Unlike A23187 and ryanodine, which cause rapid and large changes in intracellular calcium, thapsigargin inhibits the ATPase responsible for calcium re-uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is plausible that in an inactive myotube (TTX-treated), where depolarization-dependent release of calcium is blocked, thapsigargin would only inhibit the re-uptake of calcium leaking out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This would result in a much smaller increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels compared with ryanodine andA23187. This reduced elevation in calcium may be approaching the threshold of myogenin responsiveness. To ensure that the rapid effect of calcium stimulation was not limited to the nAChR α-subunit RNA, we also assayed for changes in nAChR γ- and ɛ-subunit RNAs after treatment with A23187 (Fig. 1D). Like the α-subunit mRNA, those encoding the γ- and ɛ-subunits were reduced relatively rapidly and were further reduced with continued exposure to the drug. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with ryanodine and thapsigargin, except that the ɛ-subunit was less responsive to thapsigargin treatment.2 These data indicate that as in avian muscle, calcium-dependent suppression of myogenin and nAChR-encoding RNAs occurs relatively rapidly in mammalian muscle. However, the apparent dissociation between the return of myogenin RNA to pre-stimulus levels and the continued suppression of nAChR hnRNA and mRNA during extended periods of elevated calcium (Fig. 1,A and B) suggests a more complex regulatory pathway at work in mammalian muscle compared with that previously proposed for chick muscle (4Huang C.-F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 167-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Huang C.-F. Tong J. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Mendelzon D. Changeux J.P. Nghiem H.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2568-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on studies in chick muscle, calcium is proposed to mediate its effects on nAChR gene expression via inactivation of myogenin function by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (12Mendelzon D. Changeux J.P. Nghiem H.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2568-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, because myogenin is proposed to autoregulate its own gene, this suppression of myogenin function should be reflected in reduced myogenin gene expression and therefore RNA levels. Surprisingly, we found that although calcium could initially suppress myogenin RNA levels, this effect was transient. Therefore, myogenin may not participate in nAChR gene suppression in response to sustained elevated levels of intracellular calcium. Alternatively, myogenin protein function may be affected by this increased calcium that is not reflected in its RNA. To directly assay myogenin protein function, we employed a Gal4TKLuc reporter and a Gal4-Mgn fusion protein. The Gal4-Mgn fusion harbors the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the N terminus of myogenin. The reporter Gal4TKLuc contains four Gal4-binding sites upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving luciferase expression. Primary muscle cells were cotransfected with these vectors along with CMVCAT for normalization purposes. Transfected myotubes were then treated with either 0.2 μmA23187 or 0.2 μmryanodine for 48 h before harvesting cells for luciferase and CAT assays. These concentrations of drugs were previously shown to reduce nAChR α-subunit RNA expression by ∼50% (A23187) (10Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 80% (ryanodine) (3Adams L. Goldman D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that A23187and ryanodine suppressed myogenin-dependent reporter gene activation by 38 and 70%, respectively (Fig.2). When higher concentrations of drug were employed, larger decreases in Gal4-Mgn-dependent reporter"

Upon two-dimensional PAGE, each heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-C splice form was present as multiple spots because of differing levels of phosphorylation. Upon treatment with H2O2, there was an increase in phosphorylation at 10–20 min, which partially reversed by 30 min. Subsequently, at 60 min after treatment, a population of unphosphorylated protein was transiently present. The effects were observed with as little as 1 μmH2O2 and were maximal with 5–8 μm H2O2.

Of these species, H2O2 is the only one with the chemical stability required to establish significant steady-state concentrations in vivo (1Cadenas E. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). H2O2 has the added advantage of being small and uncharged, allowing it to freely diffuse across plasma membranes (2Ohno Y. Gallin J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8438-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties of relative stability, neutrality, and small size make H2O2 an ideal candidate for a signaling molecule analogous to nitric oxide (·NO). It has been generally accepted that small quantities of H2O2 “leak” out of the mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. It has been estimated that 1–2% of all oxygen consumed in humans is transformed into H2O2 rather than water (3Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). It has also been known for some time that in leukocytes, NADPH oxidase enzymatically produces O2·¯, which is then rapidly converted to H2O2 by both enzymatic and nonenzymatic routes (for review, see Ref. 4Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme is responsible for the respiratory burst as part of the inflammatory response. The catalytic component of this multisubunit complex is a heme-containing glycoprotein (gp91phox). An important recent advance in biology has been the demonstration that there are multiple isoforms of this hemoprotein and that some of these isoforms are expressed in human endothelial cells and in human vascular smooth muscle (for reviews, see Refs. 5Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar and 6Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). The amount of O2·¯ and H2O2 produced by endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle is considerably less than that produced by leukocytes, suggesting that the low-output enzymes in the vessel wall produce H2O2 for signaling rather than for cytostasis. This would be analogous to the ·NO systems in which an inducible high-output enzyme in macrophages generates ·NO for cytostasis and a constitutive low-output enzyme in endothelial cells generates·NO for signaling (for review, see Ref. 7Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar).

In most of these cases, downstream effects of the agent can be inhibited by nonspecific antioxidants such asN-acetylcysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or by specific H2O2 scavengers such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase. For example, platelet-derived growth factor-induced DNA synthesis and migration in vascular smooth muscle are inhibited by catalase (17Yu M. Sundaresan Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (9680) Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of H2O2 appears to be a fundamental aspect of receptor-mediated signaling events in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the presence of a low concentration of H2O2 appears to be required for the proper functioning of numerous signal transduction pathways. In the absence of additional factors, low concentrations of H2O2 appear to mediate a “pro-life” signal to mammalian cells in culture. Studies in which H2O2 was applied to mammalian cells have shown that low concentrations of H2O2 (<10 μm) stimulate mitogenesis and/or promote survival in a wide variety of cell types, including endothelial cells (18Ohguro N. Fukuda M. Sasabe T. Tano Y. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1999; 83: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Ostrovidov S. Franck P. Capiaumont J. Dousset B. Belleville F. In Vitro Cell. Dev.

Also, these low concentrations of H2O2 stimulate endothelial migration as well as tube formation in an in vitro model of angiogenesis (20Yasuda M. Ohzeki Y. Shimizu S. Naito S. Ohtsuru A. Yamamoto T. Kuroiwa Y. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidized low density lipoprotein induces endothelial proliferation by stimulating the formation of O2·¯ and H2O2 by activating the NADPH oxidase (24Heinloth A. Heermeier K. Raff U. Wanner C. Galle J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the overexpression of catalase inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle (25Brown M.R. Li F.J. Miller W.-G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P. Engelhardt J.F. Zwacka R.M. Oberley L.W. Fang X. Spector A.A. Weintraub N.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects seen with low concentrations of H2O2, higher concentrations of H2O2 (50 μm to 1 mm) typically cause cells in culture to undergo growth arrest, apoptosis, and/or necrosis (for review, see Ref. 26Davies K.J.A. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, the molecular mechanisms by which low concentrations of H2O2 function in mammalian cells are poorly understood. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, there is a transcription factor named Oxy-R that serves as a sensor for H2O2 (27Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Cysteines 199 and 208 of Oxy-R react with H2O2 to from a disulfide bond, resulting in the activation of the transcription factor. The reaction is fast, with a second order rate constant of 105m−1 s−1, allowing the transcription factor to be activated by low concentrations of H2O2 (28Aslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Once activated by H2O2, Oxy-R stimulates transcription of the bacterial catalase gene. To date, no definitive Oxy-R-like H2O2 sensor has been identified in humans. In fact, there is virtually no information on how human cells respond biochemically to concentrations of H2O2 below 10 μm. Several signal transduction pathways in cultured mammalian cells have been reported to be activated by the application of H2O2, including tyrosine kinases (29Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar). However, in these circumstances, the concentration of H2O2 required for activation typically ranged from 50 μm to 1 mm, well above the concentrations that would expected to be routinely generated for signaling physiologically. These higher concentrations are best considered as oxidative stress. Thus, although low concentrations of H2O2 (<10 μm) have been shown to be involved in numerous signal transduction pathways and to independently stimulate mitogenesis and survival, there is currently no information on precisely how human cells respond biochemically to these low concentrations of H2O2. Here we have employed a functional proteomic approach to identify signaling pathways for sensing low physiologic levels of H2O2 in human endothelial cells. With this approach, it was determined that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)1C1/C2, a nuclear restricted, pre-mRNA-binding protein (for review, see Ref. 39Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), is rapidly and reversibly phosphorylated in response to low concentrations of H2O2. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from fresh human umbilical cords and cultured as described previously (40Gimbrone M.A. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). HUVECs were prepared confluent in 10-cm dishes at passage 3 in Medium 199 (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 20% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.). Confluent endothelial cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (without phenol red; BioWhittaker, Inc.) and incubated in this medium in the absence of serum for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with the same medium in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of H2O2 (0–21 μm) for 60 min. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (67 mm phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and harvested by scraping in Buffer A (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The cells were then pelleted by spinning at 500 × g for 15 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (41Slomiany B.A. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended in Buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 750 μm spermidine, 150 μm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 10 min. The crude nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 5 min. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of Buffer B and then underlaid with 300 μl of Buffer B containing 30% sucrose. The sample was centrifuged at 1300 ×g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 60 μl of Buffer C (20 mm Tris, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol, pH 8.0) to which was added an equal volume of cold 0.8 m ammonium sulfate. The nuclear slurry was incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was applied to a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with isoelectric focusing (IEF) sample buffer (9 m urea, 65 mm dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, and 0.1% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte (Bio-Rad)). Confluent HUVECs in Medium 199 containing fetal calf serum, heparin, and endothelial cell growth supplement were incubated in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of H2O2 (0–9 μm) for 0–90 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, the cells were treated with catalase (1000 units/ml) or actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), either without H2O2 or added 1 min prior to H2O2. The nuclear pellet was obtained as described for cell treatment Procedure 1. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of IEF sample buffer and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column equilibrated with IEF sample buffer. HUVEC nuclear extracts were subjected to IEF using a PROTEAN IEF cell and 17-cm IPG Ready-Strips (pH 3–10 and 4–7; Bio-Rad). Upon completion of IEF, the IPG Ready-Strips were incubated first with equilibration buffer (375 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, and 20% glycerol, pH 8.8) containing 130 mmdithiothreitol for 10 min and then with equilibration buffer containing 135 mm iodoacetamide for 10 min. The strips were placed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed with a constant current of 20 mA/gel. In some experiments, the gels were then fixed and stained using Silver-Stain Plus (Bio-Rad) following the procedure supplied by the manufacturer. Stained gels were analyzed using the program PD-Quest (Bio-Rad) to detect changes in the protein spots upon treatment. The portion of the gel containing a protein spot of interest was excised using a razor blade, cutting as close to the spot as possible. The silver-stained spot was then destained by washing the gel spot with 15 mm potassium ferricyanide and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate until clear. The gel portion was washed three times with H2O, followed by two washes with 200 mmammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile. The gel portion was then dehydrated in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc.) and rehydrated using 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.5 μg of trypsin (Promega). The gel portion was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was quenched with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then the gel spot was washed twice with 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The quench and the two washes were pooled and concentrated to 30% of the initial volume in the SpeedVac concentrator. The sample was then absorbed onto a reverse-phase Zip-Tip (Millipore Corp.). The resin was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptides were eluted with 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was then concentrated to 30% of the initial volume in the SpeedVac concentrator. The masses of the tryptic peptides were determined at the University of Michigan Protein Core Facility by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry using a VESTEC-2000 mass spectrometer. The peptide masses together with the apparent molecular mass and pI of the protein were used to search the NCBI Non-redundant Human Protein Database using the program PROFOUND (42Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). 2Available at prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 0.2 A for 16 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer (7 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and then incubated with goat anti-hnRNP-C1/C2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100 dilution. After primary incubation and washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at 1:5000 dilution. In some experiments, the membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer, and anti-phospho-casein kinase II substrate monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) at 1:100 dilution was used as the primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Blots were imaged using an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Film was developed using an Eastman Kodak M35A X-Omat processor. Nuclear extracts from 107 endothelial cells (prepared by cell treatment Procedure 2) were applied to spin columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9. The extracts were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of either alkaline phosphatase (100 units; New England Biolabs Inc.) or the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (20 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). After incubation, the samples were applied to spin columns equilibrated with IEF sample buffer and then subjected to two-dimensional PAGE and immunoblotting. H2O2 concentrations of stock solutions were determined using an ɛ of 81 m−1 at 230 nm (43Pick E. Keisari Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 38: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Bio UV-Visible spectrophotometer. If not otherwise specified, chemicals were obtained from Sigma. A functional proteomic approach was used to screen for nuclear proteins that are altered by the application of low concentrations of H2O2 to HUVECs. In the screening procedure (cell treatment Procedure 1), confluent HUVECs were serum-starved for 1 h and then treated with a low concentration of H2O2 for an additional hour. Nuclear extracts were prepared from isolated nuclei by ammonium sulfate extraction. With this procedure, nuclear extract from ∼107 HUVECs typically yielded ∼300 protein spots upon two-dimensional PAGE at pH 3–10 (Fig. 1A). The vast majority of these spots were unaltered by the addition of low concentrations of H2O2. However, one of these protein spots was consistently altered by the application of H2O2 (Fig. 1, A (arrow) and B). This spot appeared as a doublet with molecular masses of 39 and 41 kDa and a pI of ∼5.0. Based on silver staining, the lower protein (39 kDa) was present at approximately three times the concentration of the upper protein (41 kDa). Initially, the protein doublet appeared as single broad spots with a pI of 5.00–5.05. One hour after the application of H2O2, each protein composing the doublet appeared as four spots with apparent pI values ranging from 5.00 to 5.15. As shown in Fig.1B, there was significant alteration of the spot(s) with just 1 μm H2O2, and the alteration appeared to be complete with 8 μmH2O2. The alteration was consistent with a portion of the protein present in the control sample being altered to a higher pI 60 min after treatment with low concentrations of H2O2. Proteolytic peptide mass fingerprinting was performed on the lower portion of the middle two spots (pI 5.05 and 5.10) present after treating cells with 8 μmH2O2 for 1 h (Fig. 1B). Spots were pooled from a total of 12 gels, utilizing a total of ∼3 × 108 endothelial cells. Representative MALDI mass spectra are depicted in Fig. 2. Using the program PROFOUND, the peptide masses were used to search the NCBI Non-redundant Human Protein Database (Table I). Both spots matched hnRNP-C1/C2 with significant Zscores of 2.43 (44Williamson D.J. Banik-Maiti S. DeGregori J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4094-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). hnRNP-C1/C2 is a nuclear restricted, RNA-binding protein that is present as a heterotetramer (C13C2) in which C1 and C2 are splice variants differing by the presence of an additional 13 amino acids in C2 (45Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 46Barnett S.F. Friedman D.L. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This heterotetrameric structure explains the doublet pattern observed upon two-dimensional PAGE. Significant regions of the N-terminal RNA-binding portion of the protein could be accounted for by the observed tryptic peptides (Fig.2C). However, much of the acidic C-terminal regulatory portion of the protein was not identified, suggesting that this portion of the protein may be the site of potential post-translational modifications.Table ITryptic peptide assignmentspI 5.05 spot peptide masspI 5.10 peptide massPeptide assignment in hnRNP-C1Calculated peptide massDaDaDa731.18731.28Asp118–Arg122731.30731.18731.28Glu186–Lys191731.43887.35Met123–Arg129887.41842.45842.50Ile43–Lys50842.46903.38903.38Met123–Arg129903.401-aWith methionine oxidation.943.50943.58Val130–Arg138943.571316.711316.78Val18–Lys291316.791316.711316.78Arg145–Arg1551316.731329.581329.68Gly51–Arg611329.661698.821698.90Met74–Lys891698.911-aWith methionine oxidation.1698.821698.90Ser158–Lys1741698.851940.811940.93Met1–Arg121940.881-aWith methionine oxidation.2002.00Val194–Lys2102002.072101.802101.90Ser100–Arg1172101.882117.832117.95Ser100–Arg1172117.881-aWith methionine oxidation.2384.05Gln211–Lys2312384.131-aWith methionine oxidation.All masses are monoisotopic.1-a With methionine oxidation. Open table in a new tab All masses are monoisotopic. To more fully explore the effect of H2O2 on hnRNP-C1/C2, the time course was examined. In initial studies, it was observed that serum starvation, as used in the screening procedure, caused subtle alterations in the hnRNP-C1/C2 spot positions (data not shown). Therefore, all subsequent analyses were performed in complete medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition, because hnRNP-C1/C2 has been reported to be resistant to salt extraction (47Dreyfuss G. Choi Y.D. Adam S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the protein was extracted from the nuclei with urea. As depicted by the two-dimensional immunoblots in Fig. 3A, prior to treatment, hnRNP-C1/C2 existed as up to three spots with pI values of 5.00, 5.05, and 5.10. The presence of the form at pI 5.10 was variable; and frequently, only the spots at pI 5.00 and 5.05 were present under resting conditions. At 10–20 min after treatment with 8 μm H2O2, the more acidic spots were enhanced, and a spot at pI 4.95 appeared. This partially reversed by 30 min; and by 45–60 min, a fifth hnRNP-C1/C2 protein spot appeared at pI 5.15. This latter alteration reversed by 90 min. Thus, the apparent post-translational modification status of hnRNP-C1/C2 is complex, with at least five major forms present in human endothelial cells. Low concentrations of H2O2 stimulate the appearance of a more acidic form at 10–20 min, followed by the transient appearance of a more basic form at 45–60 min. Because the appearance of the acidic form at pI 4.95 (10–20 min after treatment) was more proximal in the H2O2signaling pathway, the concentration dependence of this alteration was determined by immunoblotting. As depicted in Fig. 3B, there was significant formation of the form at pI 4.95 with just 2 μm H2O2, and the alteration appeared to be complete with 5 μmH2O2. Thus, the concentration dependence for the appearance of the form at pI 4.95 (10–20 min after treatment) is in good agreement with that observed for the appearance of the more basic form at pI 5.15 (60 min after treatment) (Fig.1B). To verify that the observed effect at 20 min was due to H2O2 and not to the presence of any contaminants, the effect of catalase on the H2O2-induced alteration was determined. Interestingly, the addition of catalase to the cells in the absence of H2O2 caused a modest decrease in the quantity of the more acidic forms of hnRNP-C1/C2 (Fig.4A). This implies that endogenous levels of H2O2 present during cell culture are sufficient to alter the pI of some of the hnRNP-C1/C2. When added together with H2O2, catalase substantially inhibited the H2O2-induced shift to lower pI values (4.95 and 5.00) at 20 min. Thus, the effect of H2O2 on the pI of hnRNP-C1/C2 is inhibited by a specific H2O2 scavenger. The biological role of hnRNP-C1/C2 is to bind pre-mRNA as it is generated in the nucleus (39Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Thus, the alteration of this protein seen 20 min after treatment could be a direct effect or could be the result of rapidly synthesized pre-mRNA. To determine whether transcription is required for the H2O2-induced alteration 20 min after treatment, the effect of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D was investigated. As shown in Fig.4B, the appearance of the more acidic form at pI 4.95 (20 min after H2O2 treatment) was not inhibited by actinomycin D. This observation suggests that the production of new pre-mRNA is not required for the effect and that H2O2 may stimulate the alteration of hnRNP-C1/C2 more directly. It has been demonstrated that hnRNP-C is phosphorylated “in vivo” in HeLa cells (48Holcomb E.R. Friedman D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 31-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number and sites of phosphorylation have not been determined. The pattern of five spots present on the two-dimensional gels would be consistent with hnRNP-C containing zero to four phosphate groups. It would be expected that the spots on the left (lower pI) would contain more phosphates than the spots on the right. To verify that the pattern of four spots was due to differences in phosp"

The FRS2 PTB domain recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated TRKs at an NPXpY (where pY is phosphotyrosine) motif, whereas its constitutive association with FGFR involves a receptor juxtamembrane region lacking Tyr and Asn residues. Here we show by isothermal titration calorimetry that the FRS2α PTB domain binding to peptides derived from TRKs or FGFR is thermodynamically different. TRK binding is largely enthalpy-driven, whereas the FGFR interaction is governed by a favorable entropic contribution to the free energy of binding. Furthermore, our NMR spectral analysis suggests that disruption of an unstructured region C-terminal to the PTB domain alters local conformation and dynamics of the residues at the ligand-binding site, and that structural disruption of the β8-strand directly weakens the PTB domain association with the FGFR ligand. Together, our new findings support a molecular mechanism by which conformational dynamics of the FRS2α PTB domain dictates its association with either fibroblast growth factor or neurotrophin receptors in neuronal development.

Protein modular domains serve as molecular interfaces for interactions with proteins, nucleic acids, and phospholipids that regulate numerous cellular processes ranging from signaling of cell-surface receptors to chromosomal transcriptional regulation in the nucleus (1.Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse functionality of these domains has been enriched through evolution such that different structural folds can perform a conserved function or a conserved fold can carry out different functions (2.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Nature. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). Examples of the former case include the Src homology 3 and WW domains, which are structurally different but recognize related proline-rich sequences on target proteins (2.Pawson T. Scott J.D.

This single FRS2 PTB domain is capable of binding different neurotrophic receptor targets in highly conserved regions that do not necessarily share any detectable sequence homology, linking receptor activation to Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase and the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in neuronal differentiation (30.Xu H.

Strikingly, it can also bind to the juxtamembrane region of FGFR independent of receptor phosphorylation, in a segment not even containing any Tyr or Asn residues (29.Ong S.H. Guy G.R. Hadari Y.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our recent solution structure of the FRS2α PTB domain in complex with a peptide derived from FGFR1 shows that the protein adopts a typical PTB domain fold consisting of a β-sandwich of two nearly perpendicular anti-parallel β-sheets capped by a C-terminal α-helix (38.Dhalluin C. Yan K.S. Plotnikova O. Lee K.W. Zeng L. Kuti K. Mujtaba S. Goldfarb M.P. Zhou M.-M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our structural and biochemical studies have concluded, however, that an eighth β-strand C-terminal to the α-helix unique to this particular PTB domain is critical for its association with FGFR1 but not for TRK.In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which one protein modular domain interacts with divergent targets, we have characterized the thermodynamic properties of FRS2α PTB domain binding to FGFR1- and TRK-derived peptides by using the technique of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We found that the free energy of the FRS2α PTB domain interaction with FGFR1 peptide is primarily entropy-dependent, in contrast to that of the enthalpy-dependent TRK peptide binding. Furthermore, we show by ITC and NMR analyses that truncation of residues C-terminal to the PTB domain causes structural perturbation of β8, which in turn results in alteration of local conformation and/or dynamics of the ligand-binding site residues in their binding to FGFR1 or TRK. These new results strengthen our hypothesis that local conformational perturbation involving the β8 region serves to modulate the FRS2α PTB domain association with either fibroblast growth factor or neurotrophin receptors.DISCUSSIONWhereas the original discovery of PTB domains is attributed to their recognition of phosphotyrosine in the context of NPXpY sequences, growing evidence suggests that protein modules with the PTB domain-fold have much broader ligand-binding specificities (1.Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Yan K.S. Kuti M. Zhou M.-M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6.Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Structural studies highlight the evolutionary changes of structural elements around the ligand-binding site on the conserved fold, which endow these protein modules with functional versatility. Thermodynamics, together with the complementary structures of protein-biological ligand complexes, can provide valuable insights into the detailed mechanisms of molecular recognition of such versatile systems (40.Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized and demonstrated that the thermodynamics of the FRS2α PTB domain binding to two classes of unrelated neurotrophic receptor peptides are very different: FGFR1 recognition is governed by a favorable entropic contribution to the free energy of binding, whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated TRK binding is largely enthalpy-driven.The favorable entropy change in FGFR1 binding is possibly due to structural reordering of the PTB domain, resulting from an increase in protein conformational flexibility and/or changes in solvation at the complex interface that accompanies the burial of more hydrophobic surface upon complex formation. Although the former possibility may exist, the latter is supported by the NMR structure, which reveals that the complex contains a large intermolecular interface including nearly 2025 Å2 of buried hydrophobic surface area between the two molecules. Specifically, three bulky hydrophobic residues Val-429, Val-427, and Val-414 of the FGFR1 peptide intercalate into the hydrophobic core of the PTB domain from either side of the β-sandwich and form extensive interactions with over 13 protein residues (38.Dhalluin C. Yan K.S. Plotnikova O. Lee K.W. Zeng L. Kuti K. Mujtaba S. Goldfarb M.P. Zhou M.-M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For such a highly specific complex, the enthalpy change would be expected to be much larger than that observed. However, if the PTB domain undergoes a local conformational change upon peptide binding, an associated energetic enthalpy penalty could result in an overall small ΔH of the system. Thus, these thermodynamic data suggest that the overall entropy-driven FGFR1 binding by the FRS2α PTB domain is likely due to local protein conformational restructuring to accommodate extensive hydrophobic and aromatic interactions with the peptide.The FRS2α PTB domain binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated TRK peptides is much more exothermic than that to FGFR1, despite the fact that the latter ligand has a significantly greater number of residues that contact with the protein (as least 22 residues) than the former peptide (at most 12 residues). The large favorable enthalpy contribution associated with TRK binding could be due to intermolecular hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding contacts established in the complex. While the structure of the FRS2α PTB domain in complex with a tyrosine-phosphorylated NPXpY-containing TRK receptor remains to be determined, several lines of evidence suggest that the mode of this molecular recognition is similar to that of the IRS-1 PTB domain binding to the IL-4R peptide (Fig. 2 B). Supporting evidence includes the following. (i) Both PTB domains require the canonical NPXpY motif and its N-terminal bulky hydrophobic residues for ligand specificity (11.Zhou M.-M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazak M. Trüb T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38.Dhalluin C. Yan K.S.

(ii) The two key solvent-exposed arginine residues, Arg-63 and Arg-78 in FRS2α (38.Dhalluin C. Yan K.S. Plotnikova O. Lee K.W. Zeng L. Kuti K. Mujtaba S. Goldfarb M.P. Zhou M.-M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Arg-212 and Arg-227 in IRS-1 (11.Zhou M.-M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazak M. Trüb T. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), essential for phosphotyrosine binding are located in structurally analogous positions in the corresponding proteins (Fig. 2). (iii) Both PTB domains bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides in an overall enthalpy-driven interaction, which is exemplified by an NPXpY-containing peptide from IL-4R (Table I) (41.Farooq A. Plotnikova O. Zeng L. Zhou M.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6114-6121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results clearly show that both the extent of protein conformational change and the thermodynamic modes of interaction are different in FRS2α PTB domain binding to the NPXpY motif-containing TRK or the FGFR1 peptides.The distinct thermodynamic modes of interaction reflect differences in the structural characteristics of FRS2α PTB domain binding to these two unrelated receptor sequences. The FRS2α and IRS-1 PTB domains share high homology in overall sequence and structural topology and recognize NPXpY-containing peptides in a thermodynamically similar manner. The amino acid sequences and secondary structures of the two PTB domains align extremely well but only through the β7-strand (38.Dhalluin C. Yan K.S. Plotnikova O. Lee K.W. Zeng L. Kuti K. Mujtaba S. Goldfarb M.P. Zhou M.-M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the FRS2α region (residues 116–136, C-terminal to the β8-strand) that exhibits high sequence homology (∼45% identity) to the C-terminal α-helix in the IRS-1 PTB domain is structurally disordered (Fig. 2). The loss of helical conformation in that region of FRS2α is perhaps due to the presence of multiple proline residues that disrupts helical propensity. This divergence in the FRS2α sequence is accompanied by a new helix-forming insert (comprising residues 94–107), which is structurally analogous to the C-terminal α-helix in the IRS-1 PTB domain that blocks one side of the β-sandwich (Fig. 2, Aand B). Despite their structural homology in overall three-dimensional fold, the helices are encoded by very different and divergent amino acid sequences in the two PTB domains. Moreover, residues 111–115 in FRS2α, corresponding to a sequence homologous loop between β7 and α1 in IRS-1, form β8 that interacts extensively with β′ of the FGFR1 peptide in an anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 2). Finally, our binding studies showed that β8 is essential for FRS2α PTB domain binding to FGFR1 but not TRK peptides (Table II) (38.Dhalluin C. Yan K.S. Plotnikova O. Lee K.W. Zeng L. Kuti K. Mujtaba S. Goldfarb M.P. Zhou M.-M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The striking evolutionary change of protein sequences between two otherwise highly structurally homologous protein domains may have endowed FRS2α with greater structural plasticity, thus enabling it to recognize two very different neurotrophic receptors. The functional importance of regulating the constitutive FRS2α/FGFR association is further underscored by the recent discovery of alternative splicing of FGFR1 that directly affects the receptor interaction with the β8-strand (37.Burgar H.R. Burns H.D. Elsden J.L. Lalioti M.D. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4018-4023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The functional importance of the β8 and its C-terminal residues in the PTB domain is demonstrated by the observation of NMR resonance doubling of FRS2α in complex with either FGFR1 or TRK peptides upon protein C-terminal truncation. This resonance doubling suggests that truncation of the C-terminal sequence causes the protein residues at the ligand-binding site to exist in two populations with different local chemical environment, conformation, and/or dynamics in association and dissociation with the receptor ligands. Interestingly, the resonance doubling in the TRKA peptide-bound form showed up more readily upon truncation than that of the FGFR1 peptide-complexed form. Moreover, whereas signal intensities of the double resonances in the FGFR1 complex (residues 11–114) are nearly equal, the signals corresponding to the truncation-induced conformation in the TRKA-bound form appear stronger than those of the initial conformation. These results suggest that conformational disruption of β8 of the PTB domain, induced by C-terminal truncation, perturbs the protein interaction with either FGFR1 or TRKA and particularly weakens the protein association with the FGFR1 receptor ligand. Together, our NMR analysis data strongly argue that the FRS2α PTB domain employs distinct modes of interaction involving correspondingly different ligand-binding site residues for preferential recognition of FGFR1 or TRK ligands. Perturbation of the FRS2α sequence C-terminal to the PTB domain may directly affect the structural integrity of the unique β8-strand, resulting in a conformational and thus functional switch of the protein.Our findings have implications for a biological role of SNTs in modulating fibroblast growth factor and neurotrophin receptor signaling in neuronal survival and differentiation. The unstructured polyproline sequence C-terminal to the PTB domain could serve as a possible site of interaction with a putative signaling protein containing either an Src homology 3, WW domain, or another type of protein interaction domain. Such an interaction could disrupt and dissociate the FRS2α PTB domain from its constitutive association with FGFR, making FRS2α available for interaction with activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated TRKs in developing neurons. Our new thermodynamic and NMR structural results demonstrate how a conserved protein modular domain has evolved to acquire the structural plasticity necessary to recognize two very different ligands by altering a short region in the protein sequence, and how this unique structural capability enables this domain to regulate distinct biological processes in neuronal development. Protein modular domains serve as molecular interfaces for interactions with proteins, nucleic acids, and phospholipids that regulate numerous cellular processes ranging from signaling of cell-surface receptors to chromosomal transcriptional regulation in the nucleus (1.Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse functionality of these domains has been enriched through evolution such that different structural folds can perform a conserved function or a conserved fold can carry out different functions (2.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Nature. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). Examples of the former case include the Src homology 3 and WW domains, which are structurally different but recognize related proline-rich sequences on target proteins (2.Pawson T. Scott J.D.

https://openalex.org/W1994014617,"Members of the nuclear factor 1 (NF1) transcription factor family have been postulated to be involved in the regulation of milk genes. In this work we have been able to identify the splice variant NF1-C2 as an important member of a tissue-specific activating complex that regulates the milk gene encoding carboxyl ester lipase (CEL). Mutation of the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter results in a drastic reduction of the gene expression to about 15% in mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NF1-C2 protein interacts with a higher affinity to the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter than other NF1 family members do and that NF1-C2 in the mouse mammary gland is a phosphorylated protein. During development of the mouse mammary gland, binding of NF1-C2 to the CEL gene promoter is induced at midpregnancy, in correlation with the induction of CEL gene expression. The fact that the NF1-C2 involving complex remains throughout the lactation period and decreases during the weaning period, when the CEL gene is down-regulated, supports its importance in the regulation of CEL gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying a specific, endogenously expressed NF1 isoform to be involved in the tissue-specific activation of a gene.

Mammary epithelial cell differentiation is a complex process in which quiescent ductular cells proliferate and form alveolar structures that express their specialized products, the milk proteins. The differentiation process is driven by the cooperative action of multiple steroid and peptide hormones (1Topper Y.J. Freeman C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). As milk protein genes are expressed only in differentiating epithelial cells, they act as markers for the differentiation of these cells. Studies of the regulation of milk protein genes are therefore of great interest for the understanding of mammary gland development and function. Extensive studies have defined multiple cis-acting elements and transcription factors involved in the regulation of milk protein production. These include binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor (2Welte T. Philipp S. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.A. Doppler W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

J. 1998; 336: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a member(s) of the NF1 family plays an important role in the expression of the milk protein gene carboxyl ester lipase (CEL). The CEL gene is highly expressed in the mouse mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation and in the mouse exocrine pancreas (7Kannius-Janson M. Lidberg U. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, we showed that the involvement of NF1 was mammary gland-specific. Initially, NF1 was identified as a factor required for the replication of adenovirus DNA (reviewed in Ref. 8de Jong R.N. van der Vliet P.C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but has since been recognized as a potent transcriptional regulator of many viral and cellular genes (9Miksicek R. Borgmeyer U. Nowock J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,10Cato A.C. Skroch P. Weinmann J. Butkeraitis P. Ponta H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The NF1 family in vertebrates is composed of four members, NF1-A, NF1-B, NF1-C, and NF1-X, that are all differentially spliced and expressed in unique but overlapping patterns (11Apt D. Liu Y.

Functional NF1-binding sites have been characterized in genes expressed in almost every tissue. They have been shown to regulate both ubiquitous and tissue-specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 14Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). With such a diverse set of tissue-specific and developmentally regulated genes under the control of NF1 proteins, it appears likely that NF1 proteins play a major role in development. Streuli et al. (15Streuli C.H. Edwards G.M. Delcommenne M. Whitelaw C.B. Burdon T.G. Schindler C. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have shown that there is a connection between NF1 binding and the differentiated stage of the mammary gland epithelium. This is further supported by Furlong et al. (16Furlong E.E. Keon N.K. Thornton F.D. Rein T. Martin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29688-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) who described a switch in expression and binding of different NF1 proteins as mammary epithelial cells move from the fully differentiated stage to the involution stage. These findings suggest that different NF1 family members might be important for both the development and the regression of the mammary gland epithelial cells. However, the particular forms of NF1 that are active in these processes have not been characterized. Here we report that the particular isoform NF1-C2 binds to the NF1-binding site in the mouse CEL gene promoter. The DNA binding activity of NF1-C2, an ∼50-kDa phosphoprotein, is increased at day 13 of pregnancy and decreased at involution in mice, which is in concordance with the expression of the CEL gene. We also show that binding of NF1-C2 increases the expression of the CEL gene in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 and that this activation is mammary gland-specific. Mutation of the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter reduced the CEL gene expression to about 15%. Furthermore, by showing that NF1-C2 binds to the NF1-binding site with higher affinity than NF1-A1, we provide evidence that different NF1 family members can bind with different affinity to the same site. The inguinal mammary glands from different stages of development were dissected from F1:C57Bl6 × CBA mice. Preparations of nuclear extracts for EMSA and Western experiments were carried out as described previously (17Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Moore, D., Smith, J., Seidman, J., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 12.1.1–12.1.4, Wiley Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar), and the extracts were stored in aliquots at −70 °C before use. The mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11, kindly provided by Dr. R. Ball, Friedrich Miescher-Institute, Basel, Switzerland, was grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. The rat pancreatoma cell line AR4–2J (ATCC) was cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HC11 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectin in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of either of the pCHNF1A1.1, pCHNF1B2, pCHNF1C2, or pCHNF1X2 expression plasmids (expressing HA-tagged mouse NF1-A1, NF1-B2, NF1-C2, and NF1-X2) (kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Gronostajski, Lerner Institute (19Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) per 6-cm culture dish. After 24 h the medium was switched to the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described above. After about 40 h the cells were harvested and nuclear proteins were prepared. The complementary oligonucleotides (5′-GTTCTGCTTGGCGTGTTATCAAG-3′ and 5′-AGCAACCTTGATAACACGCCAAG-3′) were annealed and radiolabeled by filling in with Klenow polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, creating a probe referred as the NF1 oligonucleotide, representing −1792 to −1764 of the mouse CEL promoter (6Kannius-Janson M. Lidberg U. Hulten K. Gritli-Linde A. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A GC box oligonucleotide was created by annealing and end labeling the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CTGAGGGGGTAGAGGGGAGGGAGTGC-3′ and 5′-TCAGGCACTCCCTCCCCTCTACCCCC-3′ and a USF oligonucleotide by annealing and end labeling the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-TCTGTCCCAGAAGTCACGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGAGCACGTGACTTCTGGGA-3′. The WAP oligonucleotide was the same as described previously (20Mukhopadhyay S.S. Wyszomierski S.L. Gronostajski R.M. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (4–8 μg) were incubated with 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 25,000 cpm of labeled probe in EMSA binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) in a 20-μl reaction volume for 15 min at room temperature. For supershift experiments, 2 μl of anti-NF1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, 8199, reacting with the C-terminal half of NF1-C, kindly provided by Dr. N. Tanese, New York University Medical Center, New York) or 2 μl of anti-Stat 5a antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included in the binding reaction and preincubated for 15 min before addition of probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Tris glycine, 5% glycerol). Nuclear extracts (20 μg) were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by electroblotting onto Hybond-P filter (Amersham Biosciences). For the dephosphorylation experiments, nuclear extracts (20 μg) were treated with 1.5 units of potato acid phosphatase (PAP) (Sigma) in 0.1m BisTris buffer (pH 6.0) in a 60-μl reaction volume at 30 °C for 1 h. To detect endogenous NF1-C, filters were incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of anti-NF1 antibody (8199), and the primary antibody was detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG using the BM Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and ECL films (Amersham Biosciences). In the overexpression experiments the overexpressed NF1 proteins were detected by incubating the filters with anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-NF1-C antibody (8199). The primary antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. Nuclear extracts (20 μg) were incubated with 4.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 50,000 cpm of labeled probe in EMSA binding buffer in a 50-μl reaction volume for 15 min at room temperature. The reactions were UV cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) at 254 nm for 15 min and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film at −70 °C. The inguinal mammary glands from different stages of development were dissected from F1:C57Bl6 × CBA mice. Total RNA was extracted from these glands, HC11 cells, and AR4–2J cells by Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR experiments were carried out using the TitanTM One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers used for NF1-C amplification were “FwdC,” 5′-GCCGGCATGAGAAGGACTCTACCCA-3′ (bp 1164–1188, GenBankTM accession number Y07693), and “RevC,” 5′-AGGAGGGATGGGAAGGCAACCTCGG-3′ (bp 1736–1760, GenBankTMaccession number Y07693), yielding a 597-bp fragment of the mouse NF1-C2 and a 520-bp fragment of the mouse NF1-C5. For mouse GAPDH amplification, the primers used were 5′-CACCACCATGGAGAAGGCCGGGGCC-3′ and 5′-TTGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACCTGGT-3′, yielding a 554-bp fragment. For each reaction, 10 ng of poly(A)+ RNA was used, and the reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, 97 °C for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of 1 min at 97 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 4 min at 68 °C, and 30 cycles (or 20 cycles for GAPDH) of 30 s at 97 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C. From cycle 11 the 68 °C step was extended by 5 s every cycle. Finally the reactions were incubated at 68 °C for 7 min. For Northern blotting, poly(A)+ RNA was separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a GeneScreen PlusTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) nylon filter. The filter was hybridized with probes detecting NF1-C (a 550 bp-fragment excised by NaeI/BglII digestion from pCHNF1-C2 kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Gronostajski, Lerner Institute (19Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) or human β-actin (CLONTECH). HC11 cells, stably transfected with CEL promoter/luciferase constructs with an intact (mCEL-1831Luc) or mutated (mCEL-1831NF1:1mutLuc) NF1-binding site (previously described (6Kannius-Janson M. Lidberg U. Hulten K. Gritli-Linde A. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) were grown to different degrees of confluence and then harvested as described previously (21Lidberg U. Kannius-Janson M. Nilsson J. Bjursell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31417-31426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega kit with 50 μl of cell lysate and assayed in a luminometer (Berthold). The luciferase activity was normalized to the protein concentration of each extract, determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar). Our earlier promoter studies in mouse mammary gland-derived cells revealed that a major positive element in the CEL gene promoter interacts with a member(s) of the NF1 family (6Kannius-Janson M. Lidberg U. Hulten K. Gritli-Linde A. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The CEL gene is activated between day 11 and 14 of pregnancy in mice, and we wanted to analyze if this activation correlates with binding of NF1 at this specific stage of differentiation. EMSA analysis with an oligonucleotide including the NF1-binding site and nuclear extract prepared from mouse mammary gland tissue at different stages of development revealed that there is an increased intensity of the NF1 complex at day 13 of pregnancy (P13) (Fig. 1A). The intensity is maintained at day 16 of pregnancy (P16) and at day 1 of lactation (L1) but is reduced 2 days after weaning (W2). An EMSA with the same extracts but an unrelated probe containing a GC box confirmed that the difference in NF1 binding to the NF1-binding site was not due to unequal quantification of the extracts (Fig. 1A). Epithelial cells have been shown previously (12Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) to express factors of the NF1-C family. We preincubated the EMSA binding reaction with an anti-NF1 antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminal domain of NF1-C proteins (Fig. 1B). Because the NF1 complex was supershifted, we could conclude that it contains NF1-C. No supershifted band was observed with a control anti-Stat5a antibody. The specificity of the antibody is shown in Fig. 1C. Together these results indicate that NF1-C binding could be coupled to the developmental regulation of the CEL gene. Furthermore, by EMSA and supershift analysis we have demonstrated that NF1-C also interacts with the promoter of the rat whey acidic protein (WAP) gene (data not shown), another milk protein gene induced simultaneously with the CEL gene. This suggests that NF1-C is important for the expression of different milk genes induced at midpregnancy. Earlier reports (22Roy R.J. Guerin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that NF1 proteins can range in sizes from 30 to 100 kDa, which is due to the many isoforms and different kinds of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation (14Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To examine the sizes of the NF1-C proteins in the extracts used, a Western blot was performed. This analysis revealed that the expression patterns of the NF1-C proteins vary during mammary gland development (Fig. 2). The NF1-C protein of ∼50 kDa increases and decreases with the degree of differentiation in a pattern similar to the binding pattern observed in the EMSA experiment. Hence, we conclude that this protein is most likely responsible for the interaction with the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter. The ∼74-kDa NF1 protein appearing in W2 is presumably the same as that described earlier (16Furlong E.E. Keon N.K. Thornton F.D. Rein T. Martin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29688-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as an NF1 protein triggered in early involution of the mouse mammary gland. Our data demonstrate that even this factor is an NF1-C protein since we used an NF1-C-specific antibody. This shows that different NF1-C proteins are present in the mammary gland during development and regression. One way to determine the size of DNA-binding proteins is by covalently cross-linking the proteins to its regulatory sequence using UV light. Because the efficiency of UV cross-linking is usually low, it is exceedingly rare for more than one cross-linking event to occur in a complex. Consequently, the observed molecular masses, when using the NF1-binding site, are likely to be those of monomers rather than dimers. Hence, this gives us the opportunity to investigate if the ∼50-kDa protein is responsible for the interaction with the NF1-binding site. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the indicated species with high intensity generated in the extract from L1 were reduced in the extract from W2. The band corresponding to free, unbound probe was estimated to ∼30 kDa, which was subtracted from the size of the bound species. The resulting size of about 50 kDa is in agreement with that of the NF1-C protein observed in the Western blot analysis. To analyze the activation potential of NF1-C we used the mammary gland epithelial cell line HC11. The cells were grown to different degrees of confluence in media containing epidermal growth factor and insulin, because increased confluence has been shown previously to affect the differentiation ability. EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts from the different stages of confluence showed a change in NF1-C binding activity (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, there was a higher intensity of the NF1-C complex, in the extract from cells grown to the lowest degree of confluence (stage 1), although in extract from cells grown to the highest degree of confluence (stage 3) there was no binding of this complex at all. We observed no difference in DNA binding activity for these extracts to the control GC box oligonucleotide (data not shown). Western blot analysis also confirmed that the ∼50-kDa proteins were most abundant at stage 1, and minimal levels were found in the extract from stage 3 (Fig. 4B). Hence, HC11 cells provided us with a suitable system to investigate the activation potential of the ∼50-kDa protein in a mammary epithelial context, because we now had a stage where the factor was present and one in which it was not. HC11 cells stably transfected with the mCEL-1831Luc and the mCEL-1831NF1:1mutLuc constructs (6Kannius-Janson M. Lidberg U. Hulten K. Gritli-Linde A. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were grown to different degrees of confluence and then analyzed with a luciferase reporter gene assay and EMSA. The overall activity of the two constructs increased with increasing degrees of confluence (Fig. 4C). However, the proportional difference in luciferase activity between the two constructs decreased as the cells became more confluent (Fig. 4D). At stage 1 the activation potential was 7-fold higher for the wild type construct compared with that of the mutant construct. At the highest stage of confluence there was almost no difference at all. By comparing the results from the reporter gene analysis and the EMSA we suggest that the presence and binding of the ∼50-kDa NF1-C protein to the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter activates the CEL gene. Mutation of the NF1-binding site precludes binding of NF1-C, and accordingly the expression was reduced to ∼15%. Because the ∼50-kDa protein is the dominant NF1-C protein in HC11 cells as well as in the mammary gland at P13 to L1, we wanted to investigate which NF1-C isoform it represents. Based on the sequence of the mouse NF1-C gene, we devised an RT-PCR strategy that allowed us to detect and distinguish the different NF1-C isoforms that are known to exist in mouse (Fig. 5A). Poly(A+) RNA from HC11 cells at stages 1 and 2 of confluence was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Two NF1-C products were detectable corresponding to the isoforms NF1-C2 (exon 9 spliced) and NF1-C5 (exons 9 and 10 spliced). However, the expression level of NF1-C5 was barely detectable which implies that the ∼50-kDa protein is NF1-C2. Subcloning and sequencing verified the identity of the NF1-C2 transcript. As shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 2, the binding of NF1-C2 to the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter increased and decreased congruently with the expression of the NF1-C2 protein. To investigate if the amount of NF1-C was regulated at the transcriptional level, a Northern blot was performed with mRNA prepared from different stages of the mammary gland (Fig. 6). Two major transcripts of ∼4 and 6.5 kb were detected throughout mammary gland development, from day P10 to L1, whereas the mRNA level was drastically reduced in the involution stage (W2). The relationship between these two transcripts is not clear, although it is believed that the larger transcript is a precursor of the smaller mRNA (24Nebl G. Mermod N. Cato A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7371-7378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF1-C transcripts were also detected in the virgin stage (V) at levels comparable with those at day P10 to L1 (data not shown). Our data are in contrast with Mukhopadhyay et al. (20Mukhopadhyay S.S. Wyszomierski S.L. Gronostajski R.M. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) who could not detect any NF1-C transcripts in the lactating mouse mammary gland. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but the fact that we could detect not only NF1-C transcripts but also NF1-C proteins in the lactating mammary gland, as well as similar findings by Kane et al. (25Kane R. Finlay D. Lamb T. Martin F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrates that NF1-C proteins are indeed present. The presence of NF1-C transcripts in early stages of the mammary gland development (V and P10) indicates that the expression of NF1-C proteins at day P13 is not regulated at the transcriptional level. It is known that NF1 proteins can be phosphorylated in vivo (26Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Yang B.S.

We therefore wanted to investigate if the NF1-C2 protein in the mammary gland is a phosphorylated protein. Nuclear extracts from HC11 cells at stage 1 of confluence were treated with potato acid phosphatase (PAP) and analyzed by Western blot using the anti-NF1-C antibody (Fig. 7). This analysis revealed that PAP converted the ∼50-kDa NF1-C2 protein to a faster migrating species with the size of about ∼35 kDa. The data indicate that the NF1-C2 protein involved in binding to the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter is a phosphoprotein. Analysis of the same PAP-treated extract by EMSA and supershift experiment revealed that PAP converted the NF1-C2 complex to the faster migrating complex that can be seen in Fig. 1A in the extracts P13-L1 (data not shown). The existence of these less phosphorylated NF1-C2 proteins in extracts not treated with PAP is probably an artifact that results from endogenous phosphatase activity in the nuclear extracts because the intensity of this complex is increased with longer incubation times at room temperature. Taken together, these data suggest that the NF1-C2 protein responsible for the interaction with the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter is a phosphorylated protein. However, a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event cannot be responsible for regulating the binding of this factor because NF1-C2 proteins of only one degree of phosphorylation, the ∼50-kDa proteins, is detected during mammary gland development. Northern blot analysis revealed that not only the NF1-C gene, but also the NF1-A, -B, and -X genes are expressed in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation as well as in HC11 cells (data not shown). However, the facts that the NF1 complex binding to the NF1-binding site in the CEL gene promoter can be supershifted with the NF1-C-specific antibody and that only a few strong bands appear in the UV cross-linking experiment suggest that this site might be specific to NF1-C2 or that NF1-C2 binds to this site with higher affinity than other NF1 family members. To investigate this we overexpressed the NF1-C2 or NF1-A1 proteins in HC11 cells, prepared nuclear extracts, and investigated DNA binding with EMSA (Fig. 8A). When overexpressing NF1-A1, a new, weak, and slower migrating band appeared, but the endogenous NF1-C2 complex remained at the same intensity. In contrast, when overexpressing NF1-C2 the new band that appeared had strong intensity, whereas the endogenous band was almost outcompeted. EMSA with an oligonucleotide containing a binding site for upstream stimulating factor (USF oligonucleotide) confirmed that the different extracts were equally quantified. A Western blot analysis"
https://openalex.org/W2142530649,"We previously found that endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten is an endo-type glycosidase that cleaves the xylosyl serine linkage between a glycosaminoglycan chain and its core protein (Takagaki, K., Kon, A., Kawasaki, H., Nakamura, T., Tamura, S., and Endo, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 854–860). Screening for endo-β-xylosidase activity in several cellulases detected this activity in the enzymes from Aspergillus niger, Penicillium funiculosum, Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma viride, and Irpex lacteus. The cellulase derived from A. niger was purified, and its molecular weight was determined to be 26,000 by SDS-PAGE. Examination of the specificity of the cellulase revealed that 1) the enzyme acts on the linkage region (xylosyl serine) between a core peptide and a glycosaminoglycan chain; 2) enzymatic activity is greater with shorter glycosaminoglycan chains; 3) the enzyme readily hydrolyzes the linkage in glycosaminoglycan peptides, but intact proteoglycan is cleaved only slowly; and 4) the activity is unaffected by the glycosaminoglycan component (chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate). Judging from these enzymatic characteristics, this cellulase is different from the endo-β-xylosidase of Patinopecten. We believe that this cellulase will become a useful tool in the further development of glycotechnology, because, like the endo-β-xylosidase of Patinopecten, it enables the release of intact glycosaminoglycans from glycosaminoglycan peptides.

Although GAG chains are broadly divided into chondroitin sulfate (ChS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS), heparin, hyaluronic acid, and keratan sulfate by their particular combination of repeating disaccharide units, ChS, DS, HS, and heparin are all attached to a serine residue of a core protein by the linkage region GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser (8Lindahl U.

Recently, it has been shown that the linkage region is modified by phosphate and sulfate groups (9Oegema T.R., Jr. Kraft E.L. Jourdian G.W. Van Valen T.R. J. Biol.

Such diversity of linkage regions is notable, because it suggests that the modification is a signal involved in the control of GAG biosynthesis (11Sugahara K. Yamashina I., De Waard P. Van Halbeek H.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrated that urinary GAG chains bear in part glucuronic acid, galactose, or xylose residues at their reducing terminals. These observations demonstrate that nonterminal internal glucuronide, galactoside, and xyloside linkages of GAG chains are cleaved in tissues. Indeed, Takagaki et al. (13Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Majima M. Endo M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Endo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) found endo-type glycosidase activities acting on the linkage regions in rabbit liver, in the form of ChS-degrading endo-β-glucuronidase, endo-β-galactosidase, and endo-β-xylosidase activities. These enzymes appear to act in the initial catabolism of PGs in animal tissues. One of them, endo-β-xylosidase, was purified from the mid-gut gland of the mollusk Patinopecten (15Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It specifically hydrolyzes the internal xylosyl serine (Xyl-Ser) linkage between a core protein and a GAG chain (ChS, DS, and HS) and is therefore a useful tool for isolating native GAG chains, including the linkage region, from GAG peptides.Cellulases endolytically hydrolyze 1,4-β-glucoside linkages and are widely distributed in plants, microorganisms and in particular, fungi. Furthermore, the presence of endogenous cellulases in animals has been suggested recently (16Smant G. Stokkermans J.P.W.G. Yan Y., De Boer J.M. Baum T.J. Wang X. Hussey R.S. Gommers F.J. Henrissat B.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There is evidence that exo-type enzymes recognize both xyloside and glucoside linkages. An exo-xylosidase acting on p-nitrophenyl β-xylose and p-nitrophenyl β-glucose has been purified from Charonia lampas (22Fukuda M. Muramatsu T. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 65: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was suggested that β-glucosidase purified from Aspergillus sojae has β-xylosidase activity (24Kimura I. Yoshioka N. Tajima S. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that a single protein in pig kidney has both β-xylosidase activity and β-glucosidase activity (25Robinson D. Abrahams H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 132: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Xylose and glucose have very similar configurations, with the C-5 of xylose having a hydrogen atom rather than the hydroxymethyl group of glucose. Therefore, it is likely that enzymes that recognize glucose will also recognize xylose. Additionally, it is of interest to determine whether the endo-β-xylosidase derived from Patinopecten was originally a cellulase, whether it is a cellulase with endo-β-xylosidase activity, or whether the two activities represent independent enzymes.In this paper, we demonstrate that a fungal cellulase is able to hydrolyze the Xyl-Ser linkage between the core peptide and the GAG chain of GAG peptides. Although this cellulase has endo-β-xylosidase activity, it is different from the endo-β-xylosidase of Patinopecten.DISCUSSIONPGs are composed of a core protein and a GAG chain whose molecular weight is several tens of thousands (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hascall V.C. Evered D. Whelan J. Functions of the Proteoglycans. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 1-8Google Scholar). The GAG chains are attached to serine residues of the core protein via a linkage region, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which is common to ChS, DS, HS, and heparin (8Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1972: 491-517Google Scholar). In this paper, we showed that the cellulase purified from A. niger has endo-β-xylosidase activity, which cleaves the Xyl-Ser linkage between the core protein and the GAG chain of GAG peptides, in addition to containing endo-β-glucosidase. An endo-β-xylosidase with similar catalytic activity has been purified from Patinopecten and characterized (15Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the specificity of the cellulase from A. niger revealed that 1) the enzyme acts on the linkage region (Xyl-Ser) between a core peptide and GAG chains; 2) enzymatic activity is greater with shorter GAG chains; 3) the enzyme readily hydrolyzes the linkage in GAG peptides, but intact PG is cleaved only slowly; and 4) the activity is unaffected by the GAG component (ChS, DS, and HS). This enzyme was similar to endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten in the first, third, and fourth conclusions above. However, Patinopecten endo-β-xylosidase catalyzes hydrolysis of long GAG chains, but short GAG chains are hardly cleaved. Additionally, the amino acid sequence of endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten showed no homology to that of the cellulases. 3K. Takagaki, M. Iwafune, I. Kakizaki, K. Ishido, Y. Kato, and M. Endo, unpublished data. Taken together with the fact that the endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten had little cellulase activity, these observations show that the Patinopecten enzyme is different from the cellulase purified in this study.It is known that some glycosidases recognize both xyloside linkages and glucoside linkages as a result of the similarity of the configurations of these molecules. An exo-type glycosidase acting on both p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl β-xyloside has been purified from C. lampas (22Fukuda M. Muramatsu T. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 65: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that β-glucosidase purified from A. sojae has β-xylosidase activity (24Kimura I. Yoshioka N. Tajima S. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and a single protein in pig kidney has both β-xylosidase activity and β-glucosidase activity (25Robinson D. Abrahams H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 132: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that addition of Xyl-MU to cultured human skin fibroblasts or Chinese hamster ovary cells induces SAα2–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-MU, which is initiated by β-xyloside as a primer, rather than the expected SAα2–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-MU, which is initiated by β-glucose as a primer (40Shibata S. Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Kojima K. Kato I. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13794-13798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the galactosyltransferases involved in biosynthesis cannot distinguish between xylose and glucose. Similarly, cellulase, which is a glucosidase, seems also to show endo-type β-xylosidase activity.Endo-β-xylosidase activity was compared with endo-β-glucosidase activity in the purified cellulase from A. niger. The optimal pH was around 5.0, and the activity curves were similar for both activities. Hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase was slower than that by endo-β-glucosidase (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of metal ions were similar for endo-β-xylosidase activity and endo-β-glucosidase activity across the range of 11 reagents examined. Endo-β-xylosidase activity was slightly inhibited by bivalent cations compared with cellulase activity. GAG-MU was used as a substrate for assay of endo-β-xylosidase activity. GAG contains a large number of negative charges such as sulfate groups and carboxyl groups (42Roux L. Holojda S. Sundblad G. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8879-8889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that bivalent cations, for example Ca2+, can form chelates between the negative charges of GAG (43Hunter G.K. Wong K.S. Kim J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the configuration of the entire GAG may be altered by binding of cation, which may have affected enzymatic activity.The properties of endo-β-xylosidase activity toward natural substrates were investigated. The optimal pH for and the effect of metal ions on hydrolysis of ChS peptide were similar to those of hydrolysis of GAG-MU. The enzyme hydrolyzed the Xyl-Ser linkages of ChS, DS, and HS peptides but not ChS-PG. In addition, the hydrolysis of HS peptide was faster than that of ChS and DS peptides.Although GAG chains are attached to serine residues of the core protein via the common linkage region (8Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1972: 491-517Google Scholar), it has been shown recently that the linkage region is modified by phosphate and sulfate groups (9Oegema T.R., Jr. Kraft E.L. Jourdian G.W. Van Valen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fransson L.Å. Silverberg I. Carlstedt I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been suggested that the linkage region can act as a recognition signal for sorting in the biosynthesis of different GAG chains (11Sugahara K. Yamashina I., De Waard P. Van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linkage regions of the GAG peptides used in this study did not contain phosphorylated xylose or sulfated galactose. Therefore, it is unclear whether the enzyme can act on substrates containing phosphorylated xylose and/or sulfated galactose, and this requires further investigation.Endo-β-xylosidase activity was found in cellulase preparations from A. niger, P. funiculosum, T. reesei, T. viride, and I. lacteus, although not in the preparations from Eupenicillium sp., P. nigra, and P. sativum. Consequently, this activity is not specific for the cellulase from A. niger. Although the presence or absence of endo-β-xylosidase activity may be related to the different action patterns of cellulases, for example endolytic or exolytic cleavage, this is not clear at the present time.The structural diversity of GAG chains in terms of sugar chain length, sugar chain composition and position, and degree of sulfation is well established. However, all GAG chains are attached to a xylose residue, which forms an O-glycoside linkage (9Oegema T.R., Jr. Kraft E.L. Jourdian G.W. Van Valen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chemical method, β-elimination (44Heinegård D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 285: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is known to release GAG chains but may cause their decomposition by the peeling reaction. On the other hand, endo-β-xylosidase is useful for analysis of GAG chains, because it specifically releases intact GAG chains from GAG peptides. Using this enzyme, it was possible to analyze GAG chains from 50 mg wet weight of animal tissues with the combined use of PA labeling at the reducing terminal of the released sugar chains and HPLC (45Takagaki K. Takeda Y. Nakamura T. Daidouji K. Narita H. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this enzyme is useful in the molar quantification of GAG chains (45Takagaki K. Takeda Y. Nakamura T. Daidouji K. Narita H. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in giving directivity to GAG chains (46Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Saitoh H. Endo M. Kojima K. Kato I. Majima M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6503-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and in preparing artificial substrates for novel endo-type enzymes (35Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Kawasaki H. Kon A. Ohishi S. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that cellulases with endo-β-xylosidase activity will become useful tools for structural and functional analysis.

Majima M. Endo M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Endo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) found endo-type glycosidase activities acting on the linkage regions in rabbit liver, in the form of ChS-degrading endo-β-glucuronidase, endo-β-galactosidase, and endo-β-xylosidase activities. These enzymes appear to act in the initial catabolism of PGs in animal tissues. One of them, endo-β-xylosidase, was purified from the mid-gut gland of the mollusk Patinopecten (15Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It specifically hydrolyzes the internal xylosyl serine (Xyl-Ser) linkage between a core protein and a GAG chain (ChS, DS, and HS) and is therefore a useful tool for isolating native GAG chains, including the linkage region, from GAG peptides. Cellulases endolytically hydrolyze 1,4-β-glucoside linkages and are widely distributed in plants, microorganisms and in particular, fungi. Furthermore, the presence of endogenous cellulases in animals has been suggested recently (16Smant G. Stokkermans J.P.W.G. Yan Y., De Boer J.M. Baum T.J. Wang X. Hussey R.S. Gommers F.J. Henrissat B.

An exo-xylosidase acting on p-nitrophenyl β-xylose and p-nitrophenyl β-glucose has been purified from Charonia lampas (22Fukuda M. Muramatsu T. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 65: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was suggested that β-glucosidase purified from Aspergillus sojae has β-xylosidase activity (24Kimura I. Yoshioka N. Tajima S. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that a single protein in pig kidney has both β-xylosidase activity and β-glucosidase activity (25Robinson D. Abrahams H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 132: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Xylose and glucose have very similar configurations, with the C-5 of xylose having a hydrogen atom rather than the hydroxymethyl group of glucose. Therefore, it is likely that enzymes that recognize glucose will also recognize xylose. Additionally, it is of interest to determine whether the endo-β-xylosidase derived from Patinopecten was originally a cellulase, whether it is a cellulase with endo-β-xylosidase activity, or whether the two activities represent independent enzymes. In this paper, we demonstrate that a fungal cellulase is able to hydrolyze the Xyl-Ser linkage between the core peptide and the GAG chain of GAG peptides. Although this cellulase has endo-β-xylosidase activity, it is different from the endo-β-xylosidase of Patinopecten. DISCUSSIONPGs are composed of a core protein and a GAG chain whose molecular weight is several tens of thousands (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hascall V.C. Evered D. Whelan J. Functions of the Proteoglycans. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 1-8Google Scholar). The GAG chains are attached to serine residues of the core protein via a linkage region, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which is common to ChS, DS, HS, and heparin (8Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1972: 491-517Google Scholar). In this paper, we showed that the cellulase purified from A. niger has endo-β-xylosidase activity, which cleaves the Xyl-Ser linkage between the core protein and the GAG chain of GAG peptides, in addition to containing endo-β-glucosidase. An endo-β-xylosidase with similar catalytic activity has been purified from Patinopecten and characterized (15Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the specificity of the cellulase from A. niger revealed that 1) the enzyme acts on the linkage region (Xyl-Ser) between a core peptide and GAG chains; 2) enzymatic activity is greater with shorter GAG chains; 3) the enzyme readily hydrolyzes the linkage in GAG peptides, but intact PG is cleaved only slowly; and 4) the activity is unaffected by the GAG component (ChS, DS, and HS). This enzyme was similar to endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten in the first, third, and fourth conclusions above. However, Patinopecten endo-β-xylosidase catalyzes hydrolysis of long GAG chains, but short GAG chains are hardly cleaved. Additionally, the amino acid sequence of endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten showed no homology to that of the cellulases. 3K. Takagaki, M. Iwafune, I. Kakizaki, K. Ishido, Y. Kato, and M. Endo, unpublished data. Taken together with the fact that the endo-β-xylosidase from Patinopecten had little cellulase activity, these observations show that the Patinopecten enzyme is different from the cellulase purified in this study.It is known that some glycosidases recognize both xyloside linkages and glucoside linkages as a result of the similarity of the configurations of these molecules. An exo-type glycosidase acting on both p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl β-xyloside has been purified from C. lampas (22Fukuda M. Muramatsu T. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 65: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that β-glucosidase purified from A. sojae has β-xylosidase activity (24Kimura I. Yoshioka N. Tajima S. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and a single protein in pig kidney has both β-xylosidase activity and β-glucosidase activity (25Robinson D. Abrahams H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 132: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that addition of Xyl-MU to cultured human skin fibroblasts or Chinese hamster ovary cells induces SAα2–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-MU, which is initiated by β-xyloside as a primer, rather than the expected SAα2–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-MU, which is initiated by β-glucose as a primer (40Shibata S. Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Kojima K. Kato I. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13794-13798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the galactosyltransferases involved in biosynthesis cannot distinguish between xylose and glucose. Similarly, cellulase, which is a glucosidase, seems also to show endo-type β-xylosidase activity.Endo-β-xylosidase activity was compared with endo-β-glucosidase activity in the purified cellulase from A. niger. The optimal pH was around 5.0, and the activity curves were similar for both activities. Hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase was slower than that by endo-β-glucosidase (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of metal ions were similar for endo-β-xylosidase activity and endo-β-glucosidase activity across the range of 11 reagents examined. Endo-β-xylosidase activity was slightly inhibited by bivalent cations compared with cellulase activity. GAG-MU was used as a substrate for assay of endo-β-xylosidase activity. GAG contains a large number of negative charges such as sulfate groups and carboxyl groups (42Roux L. Holojda S. Sundblad G. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8879-8889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that bivalent cations, for example Ca2+, can form chelates between the negative charges of GAG (43Hunter G.K. Wong K.S. Kim J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the configuration of the entire GAG may be altered by binding of cation, which may have affected enzymatic activity.The properties of endo-β-xylosidase activity toward natural substrates were investigated. The optimal pH for and the effect of metal ions on hydrolysis of ChS peptide were similar to those of hydrolysis of GAG-MU. The enzyme hydrolyzed the Xyl-Ser linkages of ChS, DS, and HS peptides but not ChS-PG. In addition, the hydrolysis of HS peptide was faster than that of ChS and DS peptides.Although GAG chains are attached to serine residues of the core protein via the common linkage region (8Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1972: 491-517Google Scholar), it has been shown recently that the linkage region is modified by phosphate and sulfate groups (9Oegema T.R., Jr. Kraft E.L.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been suggested that the linkage region can act as a recognition signal for sorting in the biosynthesis of different GAG chains (11Sugahara K. Yamashina I., De Waard P. Van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linkage regions of the GAG peptides used in this study did not contain phosphorylated xylose or sulfated galactose. Therefore, it is unclear whether the enzyme can act on substrates containing phosphorylated xylose and/or sulfated galactose, and this requires further investigation.Endo-β-xylosidase activity was found in cellulase preparations from A. niger, P. funiculosum, T. reesei, T. viride, and I. lacteus, although not in the preparations from Eupenicillium sp., P. nigra, and P. sativum. Consequently, this activity is not specific for the cellulase from A. niger. Although the presence or absence of endo-β-xylosidase activity may be related to the different action patterns of cellulases, for example endolytic or exolytic cleavage, this is not clear at the present time.The structural diversity of GAG chains in terms of sugar chain length, sugar chain composition and position, and degree of sulfation is well established. However, all GAG chains are attached to a xylose residue, which forms an O-glycoside linkage (9Oegema T.R., Jr. Kraft E.L. Jourdian G.W. Van Valen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chemical method, β-elimination (44Heinegård D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 285: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is known to release GAG chains but may cause their decomposition by the peeling reaction. On the other hand, endo-β-xylosidase is useful for analysis of GAG chains, because it specifically releases intact GAG chains from GAG peptides. Using this enzyme, it was possible to analyze GAG chains from 50 mg wet weight of animal tissues with the combined use of PA labeling at the reducing terminal of the released sugar chains and HPLC (45Takagaki K. Takeda Y. Nakamura T. Daidouji K. Narita H. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this enzyme is useful in the molar quantification of GAG chains (45Takagaki K. Takeda Y. Nakamura T. Daidouji K. Narita H. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in giving directivity to GAG chains (46Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Izumi J. Saitoh H. Endo M. Kojima K. Kato I. Majima M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6503-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and in preparing artificial substrates for novel endo-type enzymes (35Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Kawasaki H. Kon A.

Therefore, we believe that cellulases with endo-β-xylosidase activity will become useful tools for structural and functional analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2169890920,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis. The most common disease-causing mutation, F508, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is unable to function as a plasma membrane chloride channel. To investigate whether the ER retention of F508CFTR is caused by immobilization and/or aggregation, we have measured the diffusional mobility of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of wild type (wt)-CFTR and F508-CFTR by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. GFP-labeled F508-CFTR was localized in the ER and wt-CFTR in the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes in transfected COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. Both chimeras localized to the ER after brefeldin A treatment. Spot photobleaching showed that CFTR diffusion (diffusion coefficient 10 9 cm 2 /s) was not significantly slowed by the F508 mutation and that nearly all wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR diffused throughout the ER without restriction. Stabilization of molecular chaperone interactions by ATP depletion produced remarkable F508-CFTR immobilization (50%) and slowed diffusion (6.5 10 10 cm 2 /s) but had little effect on wt-CFTR. Fluorescence depletion experiments revealed that the immobilized F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells remained in an ER pattern. The mobility of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR was reduced by maneuvers that alter CFTR processing or interactions with molecular chaperones, including tunicamycin, geldanamycin, and lactacystin. Photobleaching of the fluorescent ER lipid diOC4(3) showed that neither ER restructuring nor fragmentation during these maneuvers was responsible for the slowing and immobilization of CFTR. These results suggest that (a) the ER retention of F508-CFTR is not due to restricted ER mobility, (b) the majority of F508-CFTR is not aggregated or bound"

Despite the alarming rise in the prevalence of this disorder, the initial molecular events that promote insulin resistance remain unclear. The data presented here demonstrate that LG100754, an antidiabetic RXR ligand, defines a novel type of nuclear receptor agonist. Surprisingly, LG100754 has minimal intrinsic transcriptional activity, instead it enhances the potency of proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ-retinoid X receptor heterodimers for PPARγ ligands. The ability of LG100754 to both increase PPARγ sensitivity and relieve insulin resistance implies that a deficiency in endogenous PPARγ ligands may represent an early step in the development of insulin resistance.

Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Over 125 million people worldwide suffer from NIDDM, and these individuals face a dramatically increased risk for developing atherosclerotic heart disease, stroke, renal disease, blindness, and limb amputations. It is thus alarming that the number of NIDDM cases have increased 5-fold in the past decade, a trend that is predicted to continue. Equally worrisome is that NIDDM, initially defined as a disease of adult onset, is now appearing in adolescents. Insulin responsiveness can be modulated by a number of processes including transcriptional cascades controlled by nuclear hormone receptors. Nuclear receptors comprise a superfamily of transcription factors that directly regulate gene expression in response to low molecular weight ligands. Upon binding these ligands, receptors undergo a conformational change that promotes an exchange of coregulatory proteins and ultimately a change in the rate of transcription of specific target genes (3.Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).

A variety of cellular, molecular, and pharmacologic studies have shown that PPARγ activation results in increased adipogenesis, redistribution of fatty acids and triglycerides into fat, and ultimately improved insulin sensitivity (2.Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 6.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin.

Metab. 2000; 11: 362-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Indeed, PPARγ-specific ligands such as rosiglitazone are currently used for the clinical treatment of NIDDM (17.Inzucchi S.E. Maggs D.G. Spollett G.R. Page S.L. Rife F.S. Walton V. Shulman G.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). PPARγ functions as part of a heterodimeric complex with a nuclear receptor known as RXR (4.Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 5.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

RXR serves as a common heterodimeric partner for several nuclear receptors and is modulated by a class of ligands known as rexinoids. Since PPARγ functions as an obligate heterodimer with RXR, there has been an interest in developing RXR-specific rexinoids as potential treatments for NIDDM. A particularly interesting compound is LG754, which primarily activates PPAR-RXR heterodimers and retains potent antidiabetic properties (18.Cesario R.M. Klausing K. Razzaghi H. Crombie D. Rungta D. Heyman R.A. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We now show that LG754 defines a novel rexinoid agonist that paradoxically has little intrinsic transcriptional activity. Instead, LG754 functions by enhancing the affinity of PPARγ for its ligands. LG754 thus defines a new class of receptor agonist that can be described as a ligand sensitizer. The fact that this PPARγ sensitizer relieves insulin resistance suggests that a relative deficiency in endogenous PPARγ ligands may play a primary role in the development of insulin resistance. This notion accounts for several critical paradoxes in our understanding of NIDDM. The PPARγ luciferase reporter construct PPRE × 3 TK-Luc contains the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter (−105/+51) linked to three copies of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE (5′-AGGGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGA-3′). The GAL4 reporter was as described previously (19.Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). A cytomegalovirus expression vector with a T7 promoter was used to express the following proteins in cells and/or in vitro: PPARγ (mouse PPARγ1, GenBankTM accession number U10374), RXR (human RXRα, GenBankTM accession number X52773), Gal-PBP (human PBP, GenBankTM accession number AF283812, Val574–Ser649), VP-PPARγ (mouse PPARγ ligand binding domain, GenBankTM accession number U10374, Cys163–Tyr475). For two-hybrid studies, an RXR ligand binding domain expression vector was used that contains the SV40 TAg nuclear localization signal (APKKKRKVG) fused upstream of the RXR ligand binding domain (human RXRα, GenBankTM accession number X52773, Glu203–Thr462). Gal4 fusions contained the indicated fragments fused to the C-terminal end of the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain; VP16 fusions contained the 78 amino acid herpesvirus VP16 transactivation domain. For bacterial expression, p160 coactivator proteins were expressed as fusion proteins containing GST upstream of the 3 receptor interaction domains of SRC-1 (human SRC-1, GenBankTM accession number U59302, Asp617–Asp769), ACTR (human ACTR, GenBankTM accession number AF036892, Gly615–Gln768) or GRIP1 (mouse GRIP1, GenBankTM accession number U39060, Arg625–Lys765). The PBP fusion contained the two receptor interaction domains of PBP (human PBP, GenBankTM accession number AF283812, Val574–Ser649). CV-1 cells were grown and transfected as described previously (20.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). GST-coactivator fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose columns. In vitrotranslated PPARγ (0.6 μl), RXR (0.4 μl), and coactivator proteins (5 μg) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100,000 cpm of Klenow-labeled probes in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 12.5 ng/μl poly(dI·dC) and the indicated ligands. Complexes were electrophoresed through 7% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. A32P-labeled rat acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE was used as probe (5′-AGGGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGA-3′) in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3 the PPRE was not labeled, instead a radiolabeled PPARγ ligand ([125I]SB-236636) (21.Young P.W. Buckle D.R. Cantello B.C. Chapman H. Clapham J.C. Coyle P.J. Haigh D. Hindley R.M. Holder J.C.

E, schematic diagram of the PPARγ ligand deficiency hypothesis. This model suggests that deficiencies in endogenous PPARγ ligands represent an early step in the development of insulin resistance in lipodystrophic diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and in individuals with mutations in PPARγ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cesario et al. (18.Cesario R.M. Klausing K. Razzaghi H. Crombie D. Rungta D. Heyman R.A. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have shown that the RXR ligand LG754 is a selective activator of PPAR-RXR heterodimers. As expected for a PPARγ-RXR agonist, LG754 was also shown to promote adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and to relieve insulin resistance in db/db mice. This prompted us to directly compare the extent of PPARγ activation by LG754 and known PPARγ ligands. To determine the relative efficacy of LG754, we transiently transfected RXR-expressing CV-1 cells with PPARγ reporter and expression vectors and compared the activation of LG754 with that of rosiglitazone, a standard PPARγ agonist (20.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Rosiglitazone (1 μm) produced the expected strong activation (28-fold) of PPARγ, but the RXR ligand LG754 (1 μm) yielded only a 5-fold activation. These findings were unexpected in light of the fact that LG754 effectively mimics the biological effects of PPARγ ligands in vivo. Nuclear hormone receptors activate transcription by recruiting transcriptional coactivator proteins. Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, Cesario et al. (18.Cesario R.M. Klausing K. Razzaghi H. Crombie D. Rungta D. Heyman R.A. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LG754 specifically recruits the coactivator PBP (also known as TRAP220 and DRIP205) to the PPARγ-RXR heterodimer. Since LG754 had less intrinsic transcriptional activity than PPARγ ligands (Fig. 1A), we compared the relative ability of LG754 and rosiglitazone to recruit PBP using the same two-hybrid assay described above. In this system, reporter expression is activated if the herpesvirus VP16 transactivation domain becomes tethered to the promoter via a PPAR-coactivator interaction. Using this assay, we found that rosiglitazone produced a strong 10-fold increase in the recruitment of PPARγ to PBP, whereas LG754 had only a 2–3-fold effect on this interaction (Fig. 1B). The relative differences in coactivator recruitment by these two ligands closely paralleled the weak effect of LG754 on activation of the PPARγ-RXR heterodimer (Fig. 1A). To further explore the effect of LG754 on coactivator recruitment, we utilized an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Unlike the two-hybrid assay, this approach examines the effect of ligands on DNA-bound PPARγ-RXR heterodimers, i.e. native receptor complexes. Thus, PPARγ, RXR, and affinity-purified GST-coactivator fusion proteins were incubated with a 32P-labeled response element and separated by electrophoresis through a nondenaturing gel. In this experiment, we compared LG754 to LG268, another RXR-specific rexinoid with antidiabetic activity (22.Mukherjee R. Davies P.J. Cromble D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L. Hammann L.G. Boehm M.F. Mondon C.E. Nadzan A.M. Paterniti J.R. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). LG268 effectively recruited the p160 family of coactivators (SRC1, ACTR, GRIP) but had no effect on the GST control (Fig. 2). A quantitatively smaller, but highly reproducible, shift was also seen with PBP (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that RXR ligands can recruit coactivators to the DNA-bound PPARγ-RXR heterodimer. In contrast, LG754 failed to recruit any of these proteins (Fig. 2), confirming that LG754 does not effectively recruit coactivators to the PPARγ-RXR complex. Thus, in contrast to previously described nuclear receptor agonists, LG754 is unique in that does not possess strong transcriptional activating properties. Since LG754 has only weak intrinsic transcriptional activity, its ability to mimic PPARγ ligands in vivoimplies that this compound is functioning by an alternative mechanism. Previous studies have demonstrated that individual subunits of nuclear receptor heterodimers can have dramatic allosteric effects on its partner receptor. For example, the insect ecdysone receptor does not bind its ligand with high affinity, instead ligand binding requires association of the ecdysone receptor with its heterodimeric partner, ultraspiracle (USP) (23.Yao T.P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The existence of such allosteric interactions among receptor heterodimers prompted us to ask whether LG754 can increase the affinity of the PPARγ-RXR complex for PPARγ ligands. Cell-based transfection assays were used to examine the effect of LG754 on rosiglitazone-mediated activation of PPARγ. CV-1 cells were transfected with PPARγ reporter and expression vectors and treated with suboptimal amounts of rosiglitazone (60 nm) in the presence of increasing amounts of LG754 (Fig. 3A). As expected, rosiglitazone (60 nm) activated PPARγ, but notably this activation was further enhanced by LG754. The optimal effect of LG754 was seen at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 3A), which is similar to the optimal doses required for adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells (18.Cesario R.M. Klausing K. Razzaghi H. Crombie D. Rungta D. Heyman R.A. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of LG754 on the PPARγ dose-response curve. As expected from Fig. 1A, LG754 had minimal activity by itself. However, it shifted the rosiglitazone dose response curve leading to a 3-fold increase in the apparent potency of rosiglitazone (Fig. 3B). LG754 had a similar effect on the potency of other PPARγ ligands including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (20.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that LG754 increases the affinity of PPARγ for its ligands. To assess the effect of LG754 on the ligand binding activity of PPARγ, an assay was required that can efficiently measure ligand binding to PPARγ-RXR heterodimers. Standard solution-based binding assays are useful for measuring binding to PPARγ monomers. While such assays can be performed in the presence of RXR, it can be difficult to ensure that all PPARγ molecules in the reaction are complexed with RXR. Therefore, solution-based assays may measure binding to a mixed population of PPARγ monomers and PPARγ-RXR heterodimers. To overcome this limitation, ligand binding was measured in a modified electrophoretic mobility shift assay where heterodimer-containing complexes can be separated and identified within the gel. Complexes were analyzed as in Fig. 2, but instead of using radiolabeled DNA, the complexes were visualized with a 125I-labeled PPARγ ligand (21.Young P.W. Buckle D.R. Cantello B.C. Chapman H. Clapham J.C. Coyle P.J. Haigh D. Hindley R.M. Holder J.C. Kallender H. Latter A.J. Lawrie K.W. Mossakowska D. Murphy G.J. Roxbee Cox L. Smith S.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 751-759PubMed Google Scholar). Note that LG754 significantly increased the amount of125I-labeled PPARγ ligand in the complex (Fig. 3D) without affecting the total amount of complex formed (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These data suggest that LG754 enhances the affinity of PPARγ for its ligands. A large body evidence of biochemical, structural, and genetic data have firmly demonstrated that nuclear receptors activate transcription by recruiting transcriptional coactivator proteins (3.Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This has led to the commonly accepted paradigm that nuclear receptor agonists function by inducing a conformation change that favors a more stable receptor-coactivator complex. The data presented here indicate that LG754 defines a new class of nuclear receptor agonist that has minimal coactivator recruitment activity and therefore minimal inherent transcriptional activity. Instead, this compound activates transcription by allosterically enhancing the ligand binding activity of its partner receptor, PPARγ. We refer to this agonist class as a “sensitizer.” LG754 therefore represents the first example of a nuclear receptor-sensitizing agent. In addition to being a PPARγ sensitizer, previous studies have demonstrated that LG754 relieves insulin resistance in vivo(18.Cesario R.M. Klausing K. Razzaghi H. Crombie D. Rungta D. Heyman R.A. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These findings have important implications, since the molecular events that result in insulin resistance remain obscure. It is well known that PPARγ ligands reverse insulin resistance both in humans and in a variety of animal models. PPARγ agonists have the interesting property of lowering glucose in diabetic animals but not in non-diabetic animals (24.Zhang B. Graziano M.P. Doebber T.W. Leibowitz M.D. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D.M. Hey P.J. Wu M. Cullinan C.A. Bailey P. Lollmann B. Frederich R. Flier J.S. Strader C.D. Smith R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9455-9459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This implies that PPARγ ligands reverse or replace a deficiency that is unique to the diabetic state. It is intriguing to speculate that insulin resistance arises from a relative deficiency in endogenous PPARγ ligands and that PPARγ agonists are effective antidiabetic agents, because they correct this deficiency. In principle, this hypothesis could be directly tested by determining the levels of endogenous PPARγ ligands in normal and diabetic individuals. Several fatty acid derivatives and prostanoids have been shown to bind to PPARγ (4.Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 20.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar); however, these ligands are not specific for PPARγ, and the precise identity of the endogenous PPARγ ligand is unknown (25.Forman B.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 331-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, a direct quantitation of endogenous PPARγ ligand levels is not currently possible and an alternative approach is required to test this “PPARγ ligand deficiency” model. Since LG754 is a PPARγ sensitizer, this compound reverses the biological effects that result from a deficiency in PPARγ ligands. The previous demonstration that LG754 relieves insulin in db/db mice (18.Cesario R.M. Klausing K. Razzaghi H. Crombie D. Rungta D. Heyman R.A. Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) provides support for the hypothesis that insulin resistance is secondary to suboptimal levels of the yet-to-be identified PPARγ ligand. A genetic test of the “ligand deficiency” hypothesis might include the development of animals expressing PPARγ mutants with diminished ligand binding affinity. These animals would not respond to endogenous PPARγ ligands and would be predicted to develop insulin resistance. Such animals have not been described, although PPARγ-null mice have been established (26.Miles P.D. Barak Y. He W. Evans R.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 27.Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y.

Cell. 1999; 4: 597-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). However, as PPARγ integrates both positive (endogenous ligands) and negative signals (MAP kinase) (28.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), the effects of chronic PPARγ ablation cannot be equated with those resulting from ligand deficiency. While appropriate animal models do not exist, several patients have been described with point mutations in PPARγ that result in defects in ligand binding and/or transactivation (29.Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). These individuals provide insights into the pathological consequences associated with a diminished response to endogenous PPARγ ligands. Indeed, these patients develop lipodystrophy and severe insulin resistance as would be predicted by the PPARγ ligand-deficiency hypothesis (Fig. 3E). There are a number of critical gaps in our understanding of the NIDDM-PPARγ connection. For example, PPARγ is required for adipogenesis (27.Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Kitamura T. Fujita T. Ezaki O. Aizawa S.

Doebber T.W. Leibowitz M.D. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D.M. Hey P.J. Wu M. Cullinan C.A. Bailey P. Lollmann B. Frederich R. Flier J.S. Strader C.D. Smith R.G. J. Biol.

This raises a question as to how an adipogenic agent can also act as an antidiabetic agent (32.Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol.

Another gap is highlighted by the fact that certain rare forms of NIDDM are paradoxically associated with diminished fat mass (lipodystrophy) (33.Arioglu E. Duncan-Morin J. Sebring N. Rother K.I. Gottlieb N. Lieberman J. Herion D. Kleiner D.E. Reynolds J. Premkumar A. Sumner A.E. Hoofnagle J. Reitman M.L. Taylor S.I. Ann. Intern. Med. 2000; 133: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and perhaps even more surprising is the observation that PPARγ activators can effectively treat both obesity-dependent and lipodystrophic diabetes (6.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 33.Arioglu E. Duncan-Morin J. Sebring N. Rother K.I. Gottlieb N. Lieberman J. Herion D. Kleiner D.E. Reynolds J. Premkumar A. Sumner A.E. Hoofnagle J. Reitman M.L. Taylor S.I. Ann. Intern. Med. 2000; 133: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The PPARγ ligand deficiency hypothesis (Fig. 3E) is intriguing as it provides a rationale to close these gaps. Given the dual role of PPARγ ligands in enhancing adipose mass and insulin responsiveness, I suggest that a primary defect in the synthesis or accumulation of an endogenous PPARγ ligand might be the molecular event that underlies lipodystrophic diabetes. Although the identity of the endogenous PPARγ ligand is unknown, it has been suggested that the transcription factor SREBP-1c (ADD1) is required to produce an endogenous ligand in adipocytes (34.Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The PPARγ ligand deficiency hypothesis would predict that treatments which lower SREBP-1c levels should result in lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and decreased adipogenesis. Indeed, two human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (indinavir and nelfinavir) that promote lipodystrophic diabetes in vivo (35.Carr A. Samaras K. Burton S. Law M. Freund J. Chisholm D.J. Cooper D.A. AIDS. 1998; 12: F51-F58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar) have been shown to inhibit adipogenesis and to reduce SREBP-1 activity (36.Dowell P. Flexner C. Kwiterovich P.O. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41325-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37.Caron M. Auclair M. Vigouroux C. Glorian M. Forest C. Capeau J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These observations provide further support for the PPARγ ligand deficiency hypothesis. In the opposing state of obesity, it is reasonable to imagine that feedback mechanisms are triggered in an attempt to limit further lipid storage. In principle, this could be accomplished by decreasing lipogenic signals such as those represented by endogenous PPARγ ligands. Indeed, several groups have shown that SREBP-1c levels are lower in obesity (38.Kolehmainen M. Vidal H. Alhava E. Uusitupa M.I. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39.Ducluzeau P.H. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 40.Nadler S.T. Stoehr J.P. Schueler K.L. Tanimoto G. Yandell B.S. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11371-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), suggesting that the obese state may be associated with a corresponding decrease in endogenous PPARγ ligands. While this response may provide short term benefits, a chronic deficiency in PPARγ ligands could eventually lead to the development of insulin resistance. In effect, lipodystrophy may represent a primary PPARγ ligand deficiency, whereas in obesity-related diabetes the deficiency would be secondary to increasing fat mass. Thus, the ligand deficiency hypothesis accounts for the paradoxical association of NIDDM with both obesity and lipodystrophy. It also explains how PPARγ ligands can treat both disorders. Given the rising toll of NIDDM, these findings provide further impetus to identify and quantitate the endogenous PPARγ ligand.

https://openalex.org/W2152452579,"A conserved glycine residue in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain of the β2 subunit has been identified to be involved with desensitization induced by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and anesthetics. Recombinant GABAA receptors expressed in Sf9 cells were recorded using semi-fast agonist application. Upon direct activation by GABA or anesthetics, the main effect of the TM1 point mutation on the β2 subunit (G219F) was to slow the time constant (τ) of desensitization. At GABA concentrations eliciting maximum currents, the corresponding median τ values were 0.87 s (25–75% interval (0.76; 1.04 s)), 0.93 s (0.76; 1.23 s), and 1.36 s (1.17; 1.57 s) for α1β2γ2, α1(G223F)β2γ2, and α1β2(G219F)γ2, respectively. The τ value for the β2-mutant receptor was significantly longer than α1β2γ2 (p < 0.01) and α1(G223F)β2γ2 (p < 0.05). For pentobarbital-induced currents (500 μm), the corresponding median τ values were 1.36 s (0.81; 1.41 s), 1.47 s (1.31; 2.38 s), and 2.82 s (2.21; 5.56 s) for α1β2γ2, α1(G223F)β2γ2, and α1β2(G219F)γ2, respectively. The τ value for the β2-mutant receptor was significantly longer than that for α1β2γ2 (p < 0.01). The present findings suggest that this TM1 glycine residue is critical for the rate at which desensitization occurs and that both GABA and intravenous anesthetics implement an analogous pathway for generating desensitization.

Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specifically, anesthetics are known to prolong GABA-induced Cl− channel opening (1Belelli I. Pistis I. Peter J.A.

Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and, depending on the type of anesthetic, this potentiation of GABA-gated currents appears to alter deactivation and/or desensitization. For example, halothane, a volatile anesthetic, has been shown to slow the dissociation of GABA from its receptor,i.e. slows deactivation (3Li W. Pearce R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 898-907Google Scholar). Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, slows both deactivation and the exit rate from desensitization (4Bai D. Pennefather P.S. MacDonald J.F. Orser B.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10635-10646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neurosteroids, some of which have anesthetic qualities (5Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), also decrease the recovery rate from desensitization (6Zhu W.J. Vicini S. J.

From these studies, it is apparent that desensitization of GABAA receptors is altered in the presence of intravenous anesthetics. γ-aminobutyric acid type A γ-aminobutyric acid transmembrane domains 1–3 Spodoptera frugiperda 9 artificial balanced salt solution γ-aminobutyric acid type A γ-aminobutyric acid transmembrane domains 1–3 Spodoptera frugiperda 9 artificial balanced salt solution Investigations using chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis have identified key amino acids in the second transmembrane domain (TM2) of both the α and β subunits, which are involved in the conformational state of desensitization (7Dalziel J.E.

Furthermore, for GABAAreceptors, structural determinants of anesthetic action have been primarily located to both the TM2 and TM3 regions of GABAAreceptors (9Belelli D. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A.

These same regions have been described to be an integral part of the channel gating domain of the GABAAreceptor (13Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2542-2551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the desensitization machinery appears to lie within the channel gating region and that this domain is also allosterically sensitive to anesthetics. Another GABAA receptor domain to be allosterically sensitive to intravenous anesthetics is the TM1 region. As shown below in Fig. 1, the N-terminal of TM1 is highly conserved among GABAA receptor subunits, including the ρ1 subunit, which comprises the homomeric receptors that are insensitive to most anesthetics (1Belelli I. Pistis I. Peter J.A. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the TM1 glycine residue, which is conserved across GABAA receptor subunits, is replaced by a phenylalanine in the ρ1 subunit (see Fig. 1). In the previous study by Carlson et al. (2000), the mutation of the TM1 glycine of the β2 subunit to the homologous residue, phenylalanine, in the ρ1 subunit,i.e. β2(G219F) was shown to affect receptor gating induced by both GABA and anesthetics (15Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This finding was consistent with the suggestion that the TM1 region may work together with TM2 for channel gating (16Akabas M.H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12496-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because this TM1 glycine on the β subunit is perhaps linked with the channel gating region of TM2, the present study tests the hypothesis that glycine 219 on the β2 subunit affects the conformational events of desensitization induced by GABA and/or anesthetics. Kinetic analyses were performed on whole-cell patch clamp recordings from wild type GABAA receptors, α1β2γ2, and mutant GABAA receptors, α1(G223F)β2γ2 and α1β2(G219F)γ2, which were recombinantly expressed in Sf9 cells. It was determined that a TM1 glycine on the β2 subunit is involved with desensitization of GABA-, pentobarbital-, and propofol-induced currents. These findings suggest that the structural determinants for regulating desensitization resulting from direct activation of the GABAA receptor chloride ionophore are similar for GABA and anesthetics. Point mutations were introduced into the cDNAs of rat α1 and β2 GABAA receptor subunits with an in vitro mutagenesis system (Altered Sites II, Promega). The coding region of α1 (and β2 subunit performed separately) was subcloned into pAlter, and both mutations, α1(G223F) and β2(G219F), were incorporated using a mutagenic oligonucleotide. Following verification of mutagenesis by DNA sequencing, the point-mutated GABAA receptor subunits were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vectors for generation of recombinant baculovirus according to BAC-BAC expression system (Invitrogen) or BaculoGold transfection kit (BD PharMingen). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's suggestion and as previously described (15Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda) were grown as a shaking culture (140 rpm) in serum-free medium (Sf900 II medium, Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Sf9 cells were infected with multiple combinations of recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viruses encoding for the following rat GABAAreceptor subunits: α1, β2, γ2, α1(G223F), and β2(G219F). The determination of virus titer and the amount of recombinant baculovirus added for each infection was performed according to the protocol from the Invitrogen instruction manual, Guide to Baculovirus Expression Vector Systems (BEVS) and Insect Cell Culture Techniques. The experiments were performed essentially as described earlier (15Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Sf9 cell cultures were used in experiments after incubation with virus for 27–30 h. They were placed in an artificial balanced salt solution (ABSS) composed of (in millimolar): NaCl 162.5, KCl 3.5, Na2HPO4 1.25, MgSO4 2, CaCl2 2, glucose 10, and HEPES 10. pH was 7.35 at 22 °C. Membrane currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15057) Google Scholar). The intrapipette solution contained (in millimolar): KCl 160, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, EGTA 10, MgATP 2, and HEPES 10; pH 7.3 at 22 °C. A holding potential of −40 mV was used. Series resistance was 60% compensated. Stock solutions of GABA (Sigma) and pentobarbital sodium (DAK, Denmark) were dissolved to a concentration at least 100× greater than that required for perfusion and premixed by diluting solutions in ABSS. Propofol (Tocris) was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted in ABSS; the content of Me2SO in the perfusion solutions was at most 0.1%, which had no effect of its own on membrane current. The solutions were applied from a multibarreled perfusion pipette (18Kristiansen U. Lambert J.D.C. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) ∼100 μm from the cell. Agonists were applied for 5 s every 1 min. In modulation experiments, pentobarbital or propofol was applied together with GABA as a premixed solution and in some experiments also for 10 s immediately before the combined application. Between drug applications the cell was perfused from one of the barrels with ABSS. The extracellular solution exchange rate was determined in separate experiments. Initially a stable (desensitized) current was established by application of 2 mm GABA in normal ABSS. Then the extracellular Cl− concentration was lowered by switching to application of the same GABA concentration dissolved in modified ABSS, where 90 mm of the NaCl was substituted by an equimolar concentration of sodium gluconate. The time constant and 10–90% relaxation time for the resulting current relaxation were measured. Responses were quantified by measuring the peak current during application of agonist (e.g. GABA and/or anesthetics) and the current remaining after 5 s of application (end current). Rise time was estimated as the time needed for the current to increase from 10–90% of the peak response. The time constant for desensitization (τdesens) was estimated from the current decay from the peak to the end of the 5-s application, whereas the time constant for deactivation (τdeact) was estimated using the current decay from the termination of agonist application to baseline. Time constants were fitted by mono- and biexponential functions, using PulseFit (HEKA) software. The quality of the fit was evaluated by the root mean square value. In general, the fit was not significantly improved by using two exponentials. Current data (peak currents, end currents) were normally distributed. They were described using mean and standard error (S.E.) and compared with analysis of variance followed where relevant by a Tukey multiple comparison procedure. Time data (rise times, time constants) were often not normally distributed and therefore described using median, 25 and 75% quartiles. Comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed where relevant by Dunn's multiple comparison procedure. Probabilities (p) < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The GABA concentration-response relationships for the wild type (α1β2γ2) GABAA receptor and the mutated α1(G223F)β2γ2 and α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptors have been characterized in our previous study (15Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the vital data are summarized in Table I. Briefly, mutation of the α1 subunit did not significantly affect the concentration-response relation for GABA-induced peak currents. The corresponding mutation in the β2 subunit, on the other hand, significantly decreased the EC50 of the receptor for GABA. The Hill coefficients determined for the three subunit combinations were not significantly different.Table IGABA-induced currents in wild type and mutant GABAA receptorsSubunit combinationGABAHill coefficientEC50/μmα1β2γ239 (29–49)1.19 (0.98–1.40)α1(G223F)β2γ230 (23–37)1.27 (0.91–1.62)α1β2(G219F)γ25.4 (4.3–6.5)1-ap<0.001, significant difference between the EC50 of the β2-mutant receptor compared with the wild type and the α1-mutant receptors.

To estimate possible differences in the kinetics of the different GABA receptors, the lowest concentrations of GABA giving rise to maximum peak responses (saturating concentrations) were investigated (i.e. 2 mm for the wild type and the α1(G223F)β2γ2 receptors, and 0.2 mm for the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor (Fig. 2). The rate of current onset was described using the 10–90% rise time. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the rise time did not significantly differ between the wild type and the α1(G223F) and β2(G219F) mutated receptors. Increasing the GABA concentration from 0.2 to 2 mm for the β2-mutant receptor did not further decrease the rise time. None of the 10–90% rise times for saturating GABA concentrations were significantly different from the 10–90% exchange time for extracellular solution (median 112 ms, 25–75% interval (79; 141 ms)) determined in nine cells expressing the α1β2γ2 receptor. The time constant for solution exchange was 52 ms (37; 67 ms).Figure 3Comparison of GABA kinetics at maximum GABA currents in the α1β2γ2 (2 mm GABA), α1(G223F)β2γ2 (2 mm GABA), and α1β2(G219F)γ2 (0.2 mm and 2 mm GABA) GABAA receptor combinations.

No significant differences in the extent of current fade between the wild type and the mutant receptors were detected using the saturating GABA concentrations mentioned above (Fig. 3 B). The desensitization kinetics were described using the time course of current fade, which for all three receptor types was described by one exponential component (Figs. 2 and 3 C). Although the corresponding time constants (τdesens) for the wild type GABAA receptor and the α1(G223F) mutated receptor were similar, the τdesens for the β2(G219F) mutated receptor was significantly longer than the τdesens of the wild type (p < 0.01) and the α1-mutant (p< 0.05) receptors. Increasing the GABA concentration to 2 mm on the β2-mutant decreased τdesens(p < 0.05) and the end current (p < 0.05) significantly. Deactivation time course of the GABA-elicited currents were also adequately described by one exponential component (Fig. 3 D), with similar time constants (τdeact) for the wild type and mutant receptors at saturating concentrations. When 2 mm GABA concentration was applied to the β2-mutant receptor, the τdeact increased, and it was significantly longer than that for the α1(G223F) mutant receptor (p< 0.01). The modulating effect of propofol on currents induced by GABA at EC20 in the wild type and mutant receptors is summarized in Table II, which shows the effect of the highest propofol concentration tested for each receptor combination without inducing direct activation: 50 μm for the α1β2γ2 and α1(G223F)β2γ2 and 5 μm for the α1β2(G219F)γ2 combinations. In all three receptor combinations, pretreatment with propofol was necessary to significantly enhance peak currents induced by GABA (wild type: p < 0.01, α-mutant and β-mutant: p < 0.001). The modulating effect of propofol was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) for the α1(G223F)β2γ2 combination as compared with the α1β2γ2 combination at both 10 and 50 μm propofol (Table II and Fig. 4). The α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor showed significantly smaller modulation of GABA-induced currents when comparing 1 and 5 μm propofol for the β2 mutant with 10 and 50 μm propofol for the wild type (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the modulating effect of propofol between the α1(G223F)β2γ2 and the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptors (Table II). Neither the rise times nor the end currents remaining after 5-s application were significantly altered by propofol in any of the receptor combinations, and furthermore no significant differences were found in the rise times between the different receptor combinations (data not shown). Due to the slow time course of current decay during GABA application at EC20 the corresponding time constants could not be calculated.Table IIModulation of GABA-induced peak currents by propofol in GABAA receptor combinationsSubunit combinationGABA (EC20) + propofolGABA (EC20) + propofol with pretreatmentα1β2γ2190 ± 312-a(p < 0.05).285 ± 582-a(p < 0.05).α1(G223F)β2γ2115 ± 3166 ± 12α1β2(G219F)γ2120 ± 6155 ± 14Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of modulated currents in percent of GABA EC20 for 5–21 Sf9 cells.

Open table in a new tab Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of modulated currents in percent of GABA EC20 for 5–21 Sf9 cells. EC20 values were calculated from the data in Table I: α1β2γ2, 12 μM; α1(G223F)β2γ2, 10 μM; and α1β2(G219F)γ2, 1.2 μM. The increased (percent of GABA at EC20) peak current for the α1β2γ2 (50 μm propofol) receptor combination was significantly larger than for the α1(G223F)β2γ2 (50 μm propofol) and α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor combinations (5 μMpropofol). Concentration-response data for propofol-modulated currents in wild type and α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptors have been presented previously in Carlson et al. (15Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For concentration-response data for α1(G223F)β2γ2 receptors, please refer to Fig. 4 legend. Although equivalent concentrations of GABA with respect to response amplitude (EC20) were chosen for the modulation experiments, the corresponding deactivation time constants differed between the receptor combinations. The deactivation time constants of the unmodulated responses were (median and 25–75% interval in milliseconds): α1β2γ2, 268 (219; 385); α1(G223F)β2γ2, 247 (207; 385); α1β2(G219F)γ2, 471 (358; 551). The deactivation time constant of the β2-mutant receptor was significantly longer (p < 0.01) than those of the wild type and the α1-mutant receptors, whereas the latter two were similar. Due to these absolute differences, the effects of the anesthetics on the deactivation time constant was estimated by calculating the ratio of τdeact of the modulated and unmodulated responses in each cell. The propofol-modulated τdeact relative to unmodulated were (median and 25–75% interval in percent of unmodulated): α1β2γ2, 151 (121; 157); α1(G223F)β2γ2, 108 (101; 118); α1β2(G219F)γ2, 118 (105; 129). The relative τdeact on the wild type receptor was significantly greater than 100% (p < 0.01). The effect of propofol was to slow the τdeact on the wild type receptor. In addition, pentobarbital-modulated τdeact relative to unmodulated were assessed: α1β2γ2, 116 (95; 134); α1(G223F)β2γ2, 102 (98; 108); α1β2(G219F)γ2, 86 (84; 100). For pentobarbital, none of the relative τdeact differed significantly from 100%. Pentobarbital did not alter the τdeact as compared with unmodulated τdeact. As shown previously (15Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor demonstrated a biphasic concentration-response curve and was significantly more sensitive than the α1β2γ2 combination to the direct effect of pentobarbital. The concentration-response relationships for pentobarbital in the wild type and mutant receptors are shown in Fig. 5 A. For the β2-mutant receptor, the peak currents at 500 μm(p < 0.001) and 1500 μm(p < 0.05) pentobarbital were significantly higher than at 50 μm pentobarbital. There was no significant difference between the peak currents of the α1β2γ2 and the α1(G223F)β2γ2 receptors at any concentration of pentobarbital tested. The kinetics of pentobarbital-activated currents in the β2-mutant was investigated by employing 50, 500, and 1500 μmpentobarbital (Fig. 6). The rise times were significantly shorter at 1500 μm pentobarbital than 50 (p < 0.01) and 500 μm(p < 0.05) (Fig. 6 A), as expected for a concentration-dependent activation. The current remaining after application of 500 μm pentobarbital was significantly larger than the current remaining after application of 50 (p < 0.01) and 1500 μm pentobarbital (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6 B). From the peak, the current faded monoexponentially for all the pentobarbital concentrations tested (Fig. 6 C). The time constants for the current fade elicited by 500 μm pentobarbital were significantly longer than the time constants for 50 and 1500 μm pentobarbital (p < 0.01). Deactivation τ values for 50 and 500 μm pentobarbital were not significantly different from each other (see Fig. 8 D below). For 1500 μm pentobarbital, termination of the agonist application gave rise to a transient current peak (off-current) in all of 10 cells tested. Therefore, there was no estimation of the deactivation τ value at this higher concentration.Figure 8Comparison of pentobarbital (PB) direct activation kinetics of the α1β2γ2, α1(G223F)β2γ2, and α1β2(G219F)γ GABAA receptor combinations. A, the 10–90% rise time. Each column represents the median ± 25–75% interval of 5–26 Sf9 cells. B, at 500 μm, the end-current (after 5-s application of pentobarbital relative to the peak current) of the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor was significantly greater than the end current of the α1β2γ2 receptor. Each column represents the means ± S.E. of 4–27 Sf9 cells (**, p < 0.01).C, the time constant of desensitization (τdesens) for 500 μm pentobarbital at the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor was significantly longer than for 50 μm at the same receptor and 500 μmpentobarbital at the α1β2γ2 receptor. Each column represents the median ± 25–75% interval of 3–26 Sf9 cells (**, p < 0.01). D, the time constant of deactivation (τdeact) at 500 μmpentobarbital for all the receptor combinations were not significantly different from each other. For the β-mutant receptor, the τdeact values at 50 and 500 μmpentobarbital were not significantly different from each other. Each column represents the median ± 25–75% interval of 3–20 Sf9 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For propofol, the α1β2γ2 receptor showed no significant direct activation up to 1 mm (Fig. 5 B), consistent with another study, which showed that the β2-containing GABAAreceptors are not an efficient substrate for propofol modulation (19Sanna E. Mascia M.P. Klein R.L. Whiting P.J. Biggio G. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 353-360PubMed Google Scholar). The α1(G223F)β2γ2 receptor followed the same pattern as the wild type. The α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor, on the other hand, demonstrated a monophasic concentration-dependent activation by propofol. The kinetics of this direct activation were investigated by comparing rise time, end current, and time constant at two propofol concentrations. There was no significant difference between the rise times at 300 and 1000 μm propofol (Fig. 7 A). The end current remaining was smaller for 1000 μm propofol as compared with 300 μm propofol (p < 0.05, Fig. 7 B), whereas the time courses of desensitization for both concentrations were monoexponential with time constants that were not significantly different from each other (Fig. 7 C). Deactivation τ was significantly smaller with 1000 μmpropofol than 300 μm propofol (p < 0.05, Fig. 7 D). As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, the peak response levels of 50 μm pentobarbital on the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor and 500 μm pentobarbital on the α1β2γ2 and α1(G223F)β2γ2 receptors were not significantly different, whereas the peak response of 500 μm pentobarbital on the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor was significantly larger than any of these (p < 0.001 in all cases). The rise-time for the wild type and the α1-mutant receptors at 500 μmpentobarbital and for the β2-mutant receptor at 50 and 500 μm pentobarbital did not significantly differ from each other (Fig. 8 A). To compare the desensitization kinetics, the fading of direct pentobarbital-induced currents was compared (Fig. 8 B). Upon application of 500 μm pentobarbital to the β2-mutant receptor, a significantly larger (p < 0.01) end current remained than with 500 μm pentobarbital for the wild type and the α1-mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2122372411,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is essential for DNA replication of mammalian cells and their small DNA tumor viruses. The mechanism of the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the human PCNA promoter is not clear despite extensive investigations. In this report, we employed organotypic cultures of primary human keratinocytes, which closely resemble native skin comprising both proliferating and postmitotic, differentiated cells, to examine the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the human PCNA gene (hPCNA) in the absence or presence of the human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18) E7 protein. HPV-18 E7 promotes S phase re-entry in post-mitotic differentiated keratinocytes by abrogating the transcription repression of E2F transcription factors by the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein, pRb. We demonstrated that E7 reactivated the transcription of the endogenous hPCNA in differentiated keratinocytes. In contrast, with or without E7, the expression of a transduced hPCNA promoter-driven reporter did not correlate with that of the endogenous hPCNA gene in either proliferating or differentiated cells. Moreover, in Chinese hamster ovary and L-cells, HPV E7 and the adenovirus E1A protein repressed the transduced hPCNA promoter, but both activated an extended promoter construct spanning the first intron. Mutations of two E2F sites in the intron reduced the basal activity and abolished the response to E7 or E1A. Promoter repression or activation required the CR2 domain of E7 and, to a lesser extent, CR1 as well. However, in organotypic cultures, this extended promoter construct failed to recapitulate the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the endogenous hPCNA gene. Only when a full-length Myc-tagged hPCNA spanning the 5' promoter and all exons and introns was used was the native pattern of expression largely restored, indicative of the complexity of its regulation."
