The images are believed to be at least as ancient as some found in the Grotte Chauvet in southern France--the current record holder at 32,000 years--and possibly even older. More important, cave art experts say, the new paintings bolster other evidence that humans engaged in sophisticated symbolic expression much earlier than once thought."

The discovery paved the way for revolutionary applications such as full-color displays for cellular phones and plastic electronics for computerized merchandise."

https://openalex.org/W1964222866,"The discussion about the recent Health Effects Institute reports ([1][1], [2][2]) on air pollution in two News of the Week articles by Jocelyn Kaiser, “Evidence mounts that tiny particles can kill” (7 Jul., p. [22][3]) and “Panel backs EPA and ‘Six Cities’ study” (4 Aug., p. [711][4]), is a bit superficial and occasionaly misleading. Both the morbidity and the mortality parts of the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study II (NMMAPS II) ([1][1]), discussed in the earlier article, focused on particulate matter pollution and did not pay adequate attention to the role of copollutants. The morbidity study is virtually uninterpretable because it used an untested method with unknown properties and probably has little power [see p. 77 in ([1][1])] to control confounding by copollutants. The mortality study, on the other hand, is ingenious in its conception, but it is flawed in its execution. Apparently, computational problems deterred a broad investigation with all pollutants treated equally in a Bayesian framework. Are there other pollutants more strongly associated with morbidity and mortality than is particulate matter? If so, how does that affect the interpretation of the particulate matter associations reported in these studies? NMMAPS II fails to address these important questions.

In the second article, about the reanalyses of studies of particulate air pollution and mortality ([2][2]) by Harvard researchers and by the American Cancer Society, Kaiser does not mention that the association of death rates with particulate matter is strongly modified by educational attainment. Nor does she mention that, in the American Cancer Society study, which is the only one large enough for sensitivity analyses, the strongest and most stable associations with mortality are seen, not with particulate matter, but with SO2. In analyses with both pollutants included, the coefficient of SO2 remains stable and significant, whereas the coefficient for particulate matter is attenuated and, in some cases, becomes insignificant [see table 6 in ([2][2])]. The table accompanying Kaiser's article gives the impression that the results presented there were adjusted for “more than 30 possible confounders,” whereas the table actually presents the results of the validation study, which included only the confounders considered by the original investigators and, most importantly, did not include any pollutant other than particulate matter.
