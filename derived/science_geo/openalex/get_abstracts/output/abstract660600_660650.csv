https://openalex.org/W3090844627,"An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase I/II coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after vaccination with BNT162b1 from a second, non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial in healthy adults, 18–55 years of age. Two doses of 1–50 μg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those seen in serum from a cohort of individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 serum-neutralizing antibodies on day 43 were 0.7-fold (1-μg dose) to 3.5-fold (50-μg dose) those of the recovered individuals. Immune sera broadly neutralized pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had T helper type 1 (TH1)-skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon-γ was produced by a large fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest that it has the potential to protect against COVID-19 through multiple beneficial mechanisms. In a phase I/II dose-escalation clinical trial, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b1 elicits specific T cell and antibody responses that suggest it has protective potential."
https://openalex.org/W3089379338,"Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, help to regulate brain function by removing dying neurons, pruning non-functional synapses, and producing ligands that support neuronal survival1. Here we show that microglia are also critical modulators of neuronal activity and associated behavioural responses in mice. Microglia respond to neuronal activation by suppressing neuronal activity, and ablation of microglia amplifies and synchronizes the activity of neurons, leading to seizures. Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes. ATP triggers the recruitment of microglial protrusions and is converted by the microglial ATP/ADP hydrolysing ectoenzyme CD39 into AMP; AMP is then converted into adenosine by CD73, which is expressed on microglia as well as other brain cells. Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A1R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour. Our findings suggest that this microglia-driven negative feedback mechanism operates similarly to inhibitory neurons and is essential for protecting the brain from excessive activation in health and disease. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, suppress neuronal activity in response to synaptic ATP release and alter behavioural responses in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3090928025,"A recent genetic association study1 identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for respiratory failure after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A separate study (COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative)2 comprising 3,199 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and control individuals showed that this cluster is the major genetic risk factor for severe symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization. Here we show that the risk is conferred by a genomic segment of around 50 kilobases in size that is inherited from Neanderthals and is carried by around 50% of people in south Asia and around 16% of people in Europe. Risk of severe COVID-19 is conferred by a genomic segment that is inherited from Neanderthals and is carried by around 50% and 16% of people in south Asia and Europe, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3089633091,"Plants grow within a complex web of species that interact with each other and with the plant1–10. These interactions are governed by a wide repertoire of chemical signals, and the resulting chemical landscape of the rhizosphere can strongly affect root health and development7–9,11–18. Here, to understand how interactions between microorganisms influence root growth in Arabidopsis, we established a model system for interactions between plants, microorganisms and the environment. We inoculated seedlings with a 185-member bacterial synthetic community, manipulated the abiotic environment and measured bacterial colonization of the plant. This enabled us to classify the synthetic community into four modules of co-occurring strains. We deconstructed the synthetic community on the basis of these modules, and identified interactions between microorganisms that determine root phenotype. These interactions primarily involve a single bacterial genus (Variovorax), which completely reverses the severe inhibition of root growth that is induced by a wide diversity of bacterial strains as well as by the entire 185-member community. We demonstrate that Variovorax manipulates plant hormone levels to balance the effects of our ecologically realistic synthetic root community on root growth. We identify an auxin-degradation operon that is conserved in all available genomes of Variovorax and is necessary and sufficient for the reversion of root growth inhibition. Therefore, metabolic signal interference shapes bacteria–plant communication networks and is essential for maintaining the stereotypic developmental programme of the root. Optimizing the feedbacks that shape chemical interaction networks in the rhizosphere provides a promising ecological strategy for developing more resilient and productive crops. Experiments using an ecologically realistic 185-member bacterial synthetic community in the root system of Arabidopsis reveal that Variovorax bacteria can influence plant hormone levels to reverse the inhibitory effect of the community on root growth."
https://openalex.org/W3089350271,"The ability to recognize information that is incongruous with previous experience is critical for survival. Novelty signals have therefore evolved in the mammalian brain to enhance attention, perception and memory1,2. Although the importance of regions such as the ventral tegmental area3,4 and locus coeruleus5 in broadly signalling novelty is well-established, these diffuse monoaminergic transmitters have yet to be shown to convey specific information on the type of stimuli that drive them. Whether distinct types of novelty, such as contextual and social novelty, are differently processed and routed in the brain is unknown. Here we identify the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) as a novelty hub in the hypothalamus6. The SuM region is unique in that it not only responds broadly to novel stimuli, but also segregates and selectively routes different types of information to discrete cortical targets—the dentate gyrus and CA2 fields of the hippocampus—for the modulation of mnemonic processing. Using a new transgenic mouse line, SuM-Cre, we found that SuM neurons that project to the dentate gyrus are activated by contextual novelty, whereas the SuM–CA2 circuit is preferentially activated by novel social encounters. Circuit-based manipulation showed that divergent novelty channelling in these projections modifies hippocampal contextual or social memory. This content-specific routing of novelty signals represents a previously unknown mechanism that enables the hypothalamus to flexibly modulate select components of cognition. The supramammillary nucleus in the hypothalamus acts as a novelty hub that selectively directs different types of novelty signals to different subregions of the hippocampus and flexibly modulates the encoding of memory."

https://openalex.org/W3091396062,"The RecQ DNA helicase WRN is a synthetic lethal target for cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI), a form of genetic hypermutability that arises from impaired mismatch repair1–4. Depletion of WRN induces widespread DNA double-strand breaks in MSI cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which WRN protects MSI-associated cancers from double-strand breaks remains unclear. Here we show that TA-dinucleotide repeats are highly unstable in MSI cells and undergo large-scale expansions, distinct from previously described insertion or deletion mutations of a few nucleotides5. Expanded TA repeats form non-B DNA secondary structures that stall replication forks, activate the ATR checkpoint kinase, and require unwinding by the WRN helicase. In the absence of WRN, the expanded TA-dinucleotide repeats are susceptible to cleavage by the MUS81 nuclease, leading to massive chromosome shattering. These findings identify a distinct biomarker that underlies the synthetic lethal dependence on WRN, and support the development of therapeutic agents that target WRN for MSI-associated cancers. In cells with microsatellite instability, expanded TA-dinucleotide repeats form cruciform structures that stall replication forks and cause chromosome shattering in the absence of the WRN helicase."
https://openalex.org/W3091159762,"Blood vessels support tumours by providing nutrients and oxygen, while also acting as conduits for the dissemination of cancer1. Here we use mouse models of breast and lung cancer to investigate whether endothelial cells also have active 'instructive' roles in the dissemination of cancer. We purified genetically tagged endothelial ribosomes and their associated transcripts from highly and poorly metastatic tumours. Deep sequencing revealed that metastatic tumours induced expression of the axon-guidance gene Slit2 in endothelium, establishing differential expression between the endothelial (high Slit2 expression) and tumoural (low Slit2 expression) compartments. Endothelial-derived SLIT2 protein and its receptor ROBO1 promoted the migration of cancer cells towards endothelial cells and intravasation. Deleting endothelial Slit2 suppressed metastatic dissemination in mouse models of breast and lung cancer. Conversely, deletion of tumoural Slit2 enhanced metastatic progression. We identified double-stranded RNA derived from tumour cells as an upstream signal that induces expression of endothelial SLIT2 by acting on the RNA-sensing receptor TLR3. Accordingly, a set of endogenous retroviral element RNAs were upregulated in metastatic cells and detected extracellularly. Thus, cancer cells co-opt innate RNA sensing to induce a chemotactic signalling pathway in endothelium that drives intravasation and metastasis. These findings reveal that endothelial cells have a direct instructive role in driving metastatic dissemination, and demonstrate that a single gene (Slit2) can promote or suppress cancer progression depending on its cellular source."
https://openalex.org/W3101227144,"Radiation sensors based on the heating effect of absorbed radiation are typically simple to operate and flexible in terms of input frequency, so they are widely used in gas detection1, security2, terahertz imaging3, astrophysical observations4 and medical applications5. Several important applications are currently emerging from quantum technology and especially from electrical circuits that behave quantum mechanically, that is, circuit quantum electrodynamics6. This field has given rise to single-photon microwave detectors7-9 and a quantum computer that is superior to classical supercomputers for certain tasks10. Thermal sensors hold potential for enhancing such devices because they do not add quantum noise and they are smaller, simpler and consume about six orders of magnitude less power than the frequently used travelling-wave parametric amplifiers11. However, despite great progress in the speed12 and noise levels13 of thermal sensors, no bolometer has previously met the threshold for circuit quantum electrodynamics, which lies at a time constant of a few hundred nanoseconds and a simultaneous energy resolution of the order of 10h gigahertz (where h is the Planck constant). Here we experimentally demonstrate a bolometer that operates at this threshold, with a noise-equivalent power of 30 zeptowatts per square-root hertz, comparable to the lowest value reported so far13, at a thermal time constant two orders of magnitude shorter, at 500 nanoseconds. Both of these values are measured directly on the same device, giving an accurate estimation of 30h gigahertz for the calorimetric energy resolution. These improvements stem from the use of a graphene monolayer with extremely low specific heat14 as the active material. The minimum observed time constant of 200 nanoseconds is well below the dephasing times of roughly 100 microseconds reported for superconducting qubits15 and matches the timescales of currently used readout schemes16,17, thus enabling circuit quantum electrodynamics applications for bolometers."
https://openalex.org/W3090039612,"TASK2 (also known as KCNK5) channels generate pH-gated leak-type K+ currents to control cellular electrical excitability1-3. TASK2 is involved in the regulation of breathing by chemosensory neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus in the brainstem4-6 and pH homeostasis by kidney proximal tubule cells7,8. These roles depend on channel activation by intracellular and extracellular alkalization3,8,9, but the mechanistic basis for TASK2 gating by pH is unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of Mus musculus TASK2 in lipid nanodiscs in open and closed conformations. We identify two gates, distinct from previously observed K+ channel gates, controlled by stimuli on either side of the membrane. Intracellular gating involves lysine protonation on inner helices and the formation of a protein seal between the cytoplasm and the channel. Extracellular gating involves arginine protonation on the channel surface and correlated conformational changes that displace the K+-selectivity filter to render it nonconductive. These results explain how internal and external protons control intracellular and selectivity filter gates to modulate TASK2 activity."

https://openalex.org/W3090601068,"An ongoing challenge in chemical research is to design catalysts that select the outcomes of the reactions of complex molecules. Chemists rely on organocatalysts or transition metal catalysts to control stereoselectivity, regioselectivity and periselectivity (selectivity among possible pericyclic reactions). Nature achieves these types of selectivity with a variety of enzymes such as the recently discovered pericyclases-a family of enzymes that catalyse pericyclic reactions1. Most characterized enzymatic pericyclic reactions have been cycloadditions, and it has been difficult to rationalize how the observed selectivities are achieved2-13. Here we report the discovery of two homologous groups of pericyclases that catalyse distinct reactions: one group catalyses an Alder-ene reaction that was, to our knowledge, previously unknown in biology; the second catalyses a stereoselective hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. Guided by computational studies, we have rationalized the observed differences in reactivities and designed mutant enzymes that reverse periselectivities from Alder-ene to hetero-Diels-Alder and vice versa. A combination of in vitro biochemical characterizations, computational studies, enzyme co-crystal structures, and mutational studies illustrate how high regioselectivity and periselectivity are achieved in nearly identical active sites."

Fanconi anemia (FA), a DNA repair disorder, is the most frequently inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome. Patients with FA suffer from early childhood onset of BMF, developmental abnormalities, and heightened susceptibility to solid tumors. FA patients also have a strong predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Alter, 2014Alter B.P. Fanconi anemia and the development of leukemia.Best Pract. Res.

Med. 2019; 25: 1396-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). FA is caused by biallelic mutations in one of 23 FANC genes, whose protein products cooperate in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway and regulate cellular resistance to DNA cross-linking agents (Rodríguez and D’Andrea, 2017Rodríguez A. D’Andrea A.D. Quick guide. Fanconi anemia pathway.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: R979-R1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because of their underlying DNA repair defect, FA cells exhibit chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to genotoxic DNA cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC) (Oostra et al., 2012Oostra A.B.

FA bone marrow (BM) HSPCs are also hypersensitive to oxidative stress (Li et al., 2017Li Y. Amarachintha S. Wilson A.F. Li X. Du W.

FA patients develop BMF because of HSPC exhaustion. Progressive age-related attrition is observed in CD34+ cell content in FA patients (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M.

The molecular pathways in FA HSPCs leading to BMF and MDS/AML remain unknown. Although primary HSPCs from BM of FA patients are a useful model system, studying these cells is challenging because of their heterogeneity and low numbers. Sub-populations of HSPCs with heterogeneous transcriptional profiles may co-exist in the BM of FA patients. These subpopulations may include (1) stressed HSPCs sustaining hematopoiesis, (2) HSPCs committed to apoptosis resulting from accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, and (3) premalignant/malignant cells that eventually lead to clinically detectable MDS or AML. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows high-resolution whole-transcriptome profiling of individual cells and direct analysis of cell subpopulations from heterogeneous samples (Zheng et al., 2017Zheng G.X.

Importantly, FA HSPCs overexpressed the MYC pathway, seemingly as a counteracting force against the growth-suppressive activities of the p53 and TGF-β pathways. “High-MYC”-expressing HSPCs from patients with FA also have a reduction in expression of cell adhesion genes, resulting in a propensity for egress from the BM. Using scRNA-seq, we analyzed HSPCs from 7 FA patients and 5 healthy donors (Table S1) and resolved the heterogeneity of their gene expression profile. We combined the sequenced FA and healthy HSPCs in a single bioinformatics pipeline (Figure 1A). Using Seurat (Butler et al., 2018Butler A. Hoffman P. Smibert P. Papalexi E. Satija R.

Thirteen different HSPCs clusters were identified, including a HSC-containing cluster (shown in green in Figure 1B) and two divergent progenitor populations (composed of several clusters). Clusters committed to the lympho-myeloid fate (shaded blue colors in Figure 1B) and the megakaryocyte-erythroid fate (shaded red colors in Figure 1B) were also identified. Interestingly, FA and healthy cells clustered together in every subpopulation, demonstrating that lineage commitment during early hematopoietic differentiation is preserved in FA (Figure 1C). An unusual cell cluster, Unannotated-2 (shown in yellow in Figure 1B), with a unique gene expression profile of unknown significance was enriched in FA-derived cells. Because FA patients have a strong predisposition to MDS and AML, we speculate that this cluster may consist of pre-leukemic cells or leukemia stem cells. Besides this cluster, there were two additional FA-specific sub-clusters, one in B-progenitors and one in the megakaryocyte/erythroid (MK/E) cluster (circled in Figure 1C). Both of these clusters were part of a larger cell type cluster. Analysis of cells in these FA-specific sub-clusters revealed specific functional differences from the corresponding big clusters, such as elevation of expression of genes involved in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) pathway, Toll-like receptor pathway, and apoptosis pathway, consistent with BMF in FA patients.

Biol. 2018; 14: e8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were used for lineage trajectory analysis (Figure S1B). Cells positive for AVP and negative for CDK6 expression in the HSC-containing cluster have the most primitive gene expression profile and were used as the root of the lineage trajectory analysis (Zheng et al., 2018Zheng S. Papalexi E. Butler A. Stephenson W. Satija R. Molecular transitions in early progenitors during human cord blood hematopoiesis.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2018; 14: e8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In concordance with the previous study (Velten et al., 2017Velten L. Haas S.F. Raffel S. Blaszkiewicz S. Islam S. Hennig B.P. Hirche C. Lutz C. Buss E.C. Nowak D. et al.Human haematopoietic stem cell lineage commitment is a continuous process.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), committed progenitors emerged early from primitive HSCs but not from intermediary progenitors. In addition, two very distinctive differentiation outcomes were identified. One pathway is composed of cells committed to the lympho-myeloid fate (shades of blue in Figure 1D), and the other pathway is composed of cells committed to the megakaryocyte-erythroid fate (shades of red in Figure 1D). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that these cell populations are the major branches of differentiation emerging from the most primitive human HSCs. FA cells (Figure 1E, red dots) follow the same differentiation trajectories as normal cells (Figure 1E, blue dots), indicating that FA HSPCs exhibit an appropriate hematopoietic differentiation program. Expression of CD38, a progenitor commitment marker, was gained by CD34-expressing cells as they differentiated into specific cell types (Figure S1C). FA patients had a decreased number of cells in the HSC-containing cluster and an increased frequency of cells in cluster Unannotated-2 in comparison with healthy donors (Figure S1D). Quantitation of CD34-expressing cells and HSCs confirmed the decreased number of these populations in FA patients compared with healthy donors, consistent with a previous report (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M. Kim J.M. Regairaz M. Pla M. Vasquez N. Zhang Q.S. Pondarre C. et al.Bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is triggered by an exacerbated p53/p21 DNA damage response that impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 36-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, older FA patients had a reduced number of CD34-expressing cells compared with the younger patients (Figures S1E and S1F). The reduced CD34-expressing cell content in FA patients did not correlate with their aplastic anemia status (Figure S1G). Inter-cluster gene expression analysis identified MYC as one of the top overexpressed genes in CD34-expressing cells from FA patients (Figure 2A). As a consequence, the subset of genes transcriptionally regulated by MYC are also significantly overexpressed in FA across all of the HSPC clusters, as shown by single-cell enrichment scores of CD34-expressing cells (Figure 2B). In addition to MYC, other genes overexpressed in CD34-expressing cells from FA patients include the members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, linked previously to stimulatory division signals in premalignant states. Expression of DYNLL1, a recently described gene regulating anti-resection and Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ), was also upregulated in FA cells (He et al., 2018He Y.J. Meghani K. Caron M.C. Yang C.

HSPA8, was also upregulated, consistent with the observation that chaperone proteins are upregulated in FA (Karras et al., 2017Karras G.I. Yi S. Sahni N. Fischer M. Xie J. Vidal M. D’Andrea A.D. Whitesell L. Lindquist S. HSP90 Shapes the Consequences of Human Genetic Variation.Cell. 2017; 168: 856-866.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); RPL9, a ribosome gene, exhibited increased expression, consistent with a nucleolar function of an FA protein in ribosome biogenesis (Sondalle et al., 2019Sondalle S.B. Longerich S. Ogawa L.M. Sung P. Baserga S.J. Fanconi anemia protein FANCI functions in ribosome biogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The top 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in FA HSPCs versus HSPCs from healthy donors, are shown in Figure S2A. MYC overexpression was validated through real-time PCR in progenitor-enriched fractions from BM of FA patients (Figure 2C). In addition to MYC overexpression, which varies greatly among FA patients, we detected, in some samples, upregulation of the MYC paralog MYCN and MAX, the dimerization partner of MYC (Mathsyaraja and Eisenman, 2016Mathsyaraja H. Eisenman R.N. Parsing Myc Paralogs in Oncogenesis.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar; Figure S2B). Inter-patient scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated clear overexpression of MYC in most of the samples derived from patients with FA; one healthy control exhibited increased levels of MYC expression, demonstrating interindividual variability (Figure S2C). No significant variation was observed in terms of MYC levels with respect to the age of the FA patients (Figure S2C). However, the MYC phenotype was associated with the severity of the aplastic anemia status. FA patients with mild/moderate disease, but not patients with severe disease, had high MYC levels in their HSPCs (Figure S2D). Because MYC is a transcription factor (Nasi et al., 2001Nasi S. Ciarapica R. Jucker R. Rosati J. Soucek L. Making decisions through Myc.FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we validated changes in the expression of MYC targets in bulk HSPCs from 11 FA patients. EIF4A1 showed the highest upregulation level (Figure 2D), consistent with the known transcriptional regulatory pattern of MYC. Overexpression of EIF4A1, ODC1, and TOP1 in primary HSPCs may indicate that the patients are responding to inflammatory stimuli (Figure 2D). The single-cell enrichment score of the scRNA-seq dataset using AUCell verified enrichment of other pathways known previously to be overexpressed in FA, including the p53 pathway (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M. Kim J.M. Regairaz M. Pla M. Vasquez N. Zhang Q.S. Pondarre C. et al.Bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is triggered by an exacerbated p53/p21 DNA damage response that impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 36-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar; Figure S2E) and the TGF-β pathway (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang H. Kozono D.E. O’Connor K.W. Vidal-Cardenas S. Rousseau A. Hamilton A. Moreau L. Gaudiano E.F. Greenberger J. Bagby G. et al.TGF-β Inhibition Rescues Hematopoietic Stem Cell Defects and Bone Marrow Failure in Fanconi Anemia.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 668-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; Figure S2F). Finally, we observed that FA patients who have mosaicism (Tables S1 and S2; Figure S2G) or clonal hematopoiesis (Figure S2H) still exhibit the characteristic increase in MYC expression in their HSPCs, comparable with the level observed in other FA patients. Overexpression of TP53, demonstrated previously in FA and linked to BMF (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M. Kim J.M. Regairaz M. Pla M. Vasquez N. Zhang Q.S. Pondarre C. et al.Bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is triggered by an exacerbated p53/p21 DNA damage response that impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 36-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), was validated in the scRNA-seq dataset (Figure S2E). However, real-time PCR analysis of a bulk population of primary HSPCs did not show significant overexpression of TP53 in FA patients (Figure S3A). Because MYC and TP53 are transcription factors with opposing activities (Aguda et al., 2011Aguda B.D. Kim Y. Kim H.S. Friedman A. Fine H.A. Qualitative network modeling of the Myc-p53 control system of cell proliferation and differentiation.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 2082-2091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), cells with their differential outcomes may co-exist in the BM of FA patients. By dividing the scRNA-seq log ratio of TP53 expression by the log ratio of MYC expression, we identified a gradient of high-TP53-expressing FA HSPCs and high-MYC-expressing FA HSPCs (Figure 3A). The TP53-MYC gradient was not exclusive to FA BM cells; however, the “high TP53” and “high MYC” cell states were exacerbated in FA. BM from healthy donors exhibited a more “balanced” state, whereas BM samples from FA patients exhibited “unbalanced” expression of both genes, with a clear indication of high MYC expression in FA. This gradient behavior was observed in every HSPC cluster from FA patients (Figure S3B) and along the entire trajectory of HSPC differentiation (Figure S3C). In every patient with FA, this dichotomy of “high TP53” and “high MYC” cellular states is present (Figure S3D). Of note, BM from one of the healthy individuals also showed a moderate dichotomy of the cellular states. The presence of “high MYC” and “high p53” HSPC populations in FA was also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of p53 and MYC protein levels (Figure 3B). Increased p53 expression in FA cells was more evident at the protein level than at the RNA level. CD34+ cells in S phase and G2 phase showed the highest levels of MYC, suggesting that MYC is required for progression into the cell cycle of FA CD34+ cells (Figure 3C). The dichotomic cellular state, orchestrated by TP53 versus MYC, suggests that FA patients have HSPC populations controlled by different cellular states. Collectively, these results also support a model of mutual exclusivity and suggest that some FA HSPCs are prone to apoptosis or quiescence (high p53) and some are prone to enhanced proliferation and survival (high MYC). Previous studies have failed to detect MYC gene amplification or translocation in BM or leukemia samples from FA patients (Quentin et al., 2011Quentin S. Cuccuini W. Ceccaldi R. Nibourel O. Pondarre C. Pagès M.P. Vasquez N. Dubois d’Enghien C. Larghero J. Peffault de Latour R. et al.Myelodysplasia and leukemia of Fanconi anemia are associated with a specific pattern of genomic abnormalities that includes cryptic RUNX1/AML1 lesions.Blood. 2011; 117: e161-e170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the increase in MYC expression in FA BM cells may result from transcriptional upregulation, perhaps via a superenhancer mechanism and activation of BET proteins (Bahr et al., 2018Bahr C. von Paleske L. Uslu V.V. Remeseiro S. Takayama N. Ng S.W. Murison A. Langenfeld K. Petretich M. Scognamiglio R. et al.A Myc enhancer cluster regulates normal and leukaemic haematopoietic stem cell hierarchies.Nature. 2018; 553: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis using a BRD4 inhibitor with superenhancer inhibitory capacity, (+)-JQ1, known to suppress MYC transcription (Qi, 2014Qi J. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitors (BETi) for cancer therapy: chemical modulation of chromatin structure.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6: a018663Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). scRNA-seq analysis of lineage-negative (Lin−) cells from BM of FA mice (Fancd2−/− mice) showed a gradient of ""high-Trp53""-expressing and ""high-Myc""-expressing cells (Figure S4A). In comparison with BM from FA patients, however, the co-existence of Trp53-high and Myc-high HSPCs was less prominent in BM of FA mice. This is consistent with the previous observation that most FA mice do not exhibit spontaneous BMF unless they are exposed to physiological stress-inducing agents (Parmar et al., 2009Parmar K.

Classical models posit persistent activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a primary neural correlate, but emerging views suggest additional mechanisms may exist. We screened ∼200 genetically diverse mice on a working memory task and identified a genetic locus on chromosome 5 that contributes to a substantial proportion (17%) of the phenotypic variance. Within the locus, we identified a gene encoding an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr12, which is sufficient to drive substantial and bidirectional changes in working memory. Molecular, cellular, and imaging studies revealed that Gpr12 enables high thalamus-PFC synchrony to support memory maintenance and choice accuracy. These findings identify an orphan receptor as a potent modifier of short-term memory and supplement classical PFC-based models with an emerging thalamus-centric framework for the mechanistic understanding of working memory."

https://openalex.org/W3090189072,"Slide-free digital pathology techniques, including nondestructive 3D microscopy, are gaining interest as alternatives to traditional slide-based histology. In order to facilitate clinical adoption of these fluorescence-based techniques, software methods have been developed to convert grayscale fluorescence images into color images that mimic the appearance of standard absorptive chromogens such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). However, these false-coloring algorithms often require manual and iterative adjustment of parameters, with results that can be inconsistent in the presence of intensity nonuniformities within an image and/or between specimens (intra- and inter-specimen variability). Here, we present an open-source (Python-based) rapid intensity-leveling and digital-staining package that is specifically designed to render two-channel fluorescence images (i.e. a fluorescent analog of H&E) to the traditional H&E color space for 2D and 3D microscopy datasets. However, this method can be easily tailored for other false-coloring needs. Our package offers (1) automated and uniform false coloring in spite of uneven staining within a large thick specimen, (2) consistent color-space representations that are robust to variations in staining and imaging conditions between different specimens, and (3) GPU-accelerated data processing to allow these methods to scale to large datasets. We demonstrate this platform by generating H&E-like images from cleared tissues that are fluorescently imaged in 3D with open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, and quantitatively characterizing the results in comparison to traditional slide-based H&E histology."

https://openalex.org/W3044365091,"Fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the main cellular source of fatty degeneration in muscle injury; however, the underlying mechanism of FAP adipogenesis in muscle degeneration needs to be further examined. Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) has been reported to induce the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, but whether MMP-14 also regulates the differentiation of FAPs remains unclear. To investigate whether and how MMP-14 regulates FAP adipogenesis and fatty infiltration in muscle degeneration, we examined MMP-14 expression in degenerative muscles and tested the effect of MMP-14 on FAP adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. As expected, MMP-14 enhanced FAP adipogenesis and fatty infiltration in degenerative muscles; moreover, blocking endogenous MMP-14 in injured muscles facilitated muscle repair. Further investigations revealed that Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) was a transcription factor associated with MMP-14 and acted as an on-off switch in the differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes or myofibroblasts. Moreover, KLF6 was the target gene of miR-22-3p, which was downregulated during FAP adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of miR-22-3p markedly prevented FAP adipogenesis and attenuated fatty degeneration in muscles. Our study revealed that miR-22-3p/KLF6/MMP-14 is a novel pathway in FAP adipogenesis and that inhibiting KLF6 is a potential strategy for the treatment of muscular degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3089378313,"Mammalian LGR5 and LGR4, markers of adult stem cells, are involved in many physiological functions by enhancing WNT signaling. However, whether LGR5 and LGR4 are coupled to other intracellular signaling pathways to regulate stem cell function remains unknown. Here, we show that LGR5 and LGR4 can constitutively activate NF-κB signaling in a ligand-independent manner, which is dependent on their C-termini, but independent of receptor endocytosis. Moreover, the C-termini of LGR5/4 interact with TROY, which is required for activating NF-κB signaling. In small intestinal crypt organoids, overexpression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of LGR5 inhibits the growth and bud formation of organoids, whereas overexpression of the R-spondin-binding mutant of LGR5 that is defective for WNT signaling can still promote organoid growth. Our study reveals that NF-κB signaling, regulated by LGR5 and LGR4, plays an important role in the survival of colon cancer cells and the growth of intestinal crypts. Our findings also suggest that LGR5/4-induced NF-κB signaling and WNT signaling may co-regulate the growth of LGR5+ adult stem cells and intestinal crypts."
https://openalex.org/W3090580073,"Pearl millet is a key cereal for food security in arid and semi-arid regions but its yield is increasingly threatened by water stress. Physiological mechanisms relating to conservation of soil water or increased water use efficiency can alleviate that stress. Aquaporins (AQP) are water channels that mediate root water transport, thereby influencing plant hydraulics, transpiration and soil water conservation. However, AQP remain largely uncharacterized in pearl millet. Here, we studied AQP function in root water transport in two pearl millet lines contrasting for water use efficiency (WUE). We observed that these lines also contrasted for root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and AQP contribution to Lpr. The line with lower WUE showed significantly higher AQP contribution to Lpr. To investigate AQP isoforms contributing to Lpr, we developed genomic approaches to first identify the entire AQP family in pearl millet and secondly, characterize the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP) gene expression profile. We identified and annotated 33 AQP genes in pearl millet, among which ten encoded PIP isoforms. PgPIP1-3 and PgPIP1-4 were significantly more expressed in the line showing lower WUE, higher Lpr and higher AQP contribution to Lpr. Overall, our study suggests that the PIP1 AQP family are the main regulators of Lpr in pearl millet and may possibly be associated with mechanisms associated to whole plant water use. This study paves the way for further investigations on AQP functions in pearl millet hydraulics and adaptation to environmental stresses."

We recently developed anti-fungal cultures with the capacity to inhibit the growth of mycotoxigenic filamentous fungi on cocoa beans. However, it is not clear how these anti-fungal cultures affect the fermentation process and cocoa bean quality. For that, the anti-fungal co-cultures, Lactobacillus fermentum M017-Saccharomyces cerevisiae H290 (A) and Lb. fermentum 223-S. cerevisiae H290 (B), were applied to 180-kg box fermentations in Honduras in three time-independent replications each including a spontaneous control fermentation. The comparison of inoculated and spontaneous fermentation processes revealed that the co-cultures only marginally affected the fermentation process and cocoa bean quality. Microorganisms reached maximal levels of 6.2–7.6 log CFU/g of yeasts and acetic acid bacteria and 7.9–9.5 log CFU/g of lactic acid bacteria during all fermentations and led to maximal metabolite concentrations in bean cotyledons of 4–12 mg/g ethanol, 2–6 mg/g lactic acid and 6–14 mg/g acetic acid. The fermentation and drying processes resulted in 38–90 mg epicatechin equivalents/g in the cotyledons of dried beans. However, the co-cultures led to up to ten times higher mannitol levels in cotyledons of inoculated beans compared to beans during spontaneous fermentation, and caused a slower fermentation process, detectable as up to 8–12 °C lower temperatures in the centre of the fermenting pulp-bean mass and up to 22% lower proportions of well-fermented beans after drying. Co-culture B–with Lb. fermentum 223 –led to improved cocoa bean quality compared to co-culture A–with Lb. fermentum M017 –, i.e. cocoa beans with 0.5–1.9 mg/g less acetic acid, 4–17% higher shares of well-fermented beans and, on a scale from 0 to 10, to 0.2–0.6 units lower astringency, up to 1.1 units lower off-flavours, and 0.2–0.9 units higher cocoa notes. Therefore, the anti-fungal co-culture B is recommended for future applications and its capacity to limit fungal growth and mycotoxin production during industrial-scale cocoa bean fermentation should be investigated in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3091170130,"While flow is known to be a major driver of estuarine ecosystems, targeted flow manipulations are rare because tidal systems are extremely variable in space and time, and because the necessary infrastructure is rarely available. In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States. The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE. The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 106 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. Three-dimensional modeling showed that directing additional low salinity water into Suisun Marsh (“Flow Action”) substantially increased the area of low salinity habitat for Delta Smelt that persisted beyond the period of SMSCG operations. Field monitoring showed that turbidity and chlorophyll were at higher levels in Suisun Marsh, representing better habitat conditions, than the upstream Sacramento River region throughout the study period. The Flow Action had no substantial effects on zooplankton abundance, nor did Suisun Marsh show enhanced levels of these prey species in comparison to the Sacramento River. Fish monitoring data suggested that small numbers of Delta Smelt colonized Suisun Marsh from the Sacramento River during the 2018 Flow Action. Comparison of the salinity effects of the Flow Action to historical catch data for Suisun Marsh further supported our hypothesis that the Flow Action would have some benefit for this rare species. Our study provides insight into both the potential use of targeted flow manipulations to support endangered fishes such as Delta Smelt, and into the general response of estuarine habitat to flow management."

Recently, TP53 gene mutations have been described as a potential predictive biomarker of better outcome in patients treated with a ten-day decitabine regimen., However, functional characteristics of TP53 mutant are heterogeneous, as reflected in multiple functional TP53 classifications and their impact in patients treated with azacitidine is less clear. We analyzed the therapeutic course and outcome of 279 patients treated with azacitidine between 2007 and 2016, prospectively enrolled in our regional healthcare network. By screening 224 of them, we detected TP53 mutations in 55 patients (24.6%), including 53 patients (96.4%) harboring high-risk cytogenetics. The identification of any TP53 mutation was associated with worse overall survival but not with response to azacitidine in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of patients with adverse karyotype. Stratification of patients according to three recent validated functional classifications did not allow the identification of TP53 mutated patients who could benefit from azacitidine. Systematic TP53 mutant classification will deserve further exploration in the setting of patients treated with conventional therapy and in the emerging field of therapies targeting TP53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3045078212,"MHC-II on alveolar type-II (AT-II) cells is associated with immune tolerance in an inflammatory microenvironment. Recently, we found TNF-α upregulated MHC-II in AT-II in vitro. In this study, we explored whether TNF-α-mediated inflammation upregulates MHC-II on AT-II cells to trigger Treg expansion in inflammation-driven lung adenocarcinoma (IDLA). Using urethane-induced mice IDLA model, we found that IDLA cells mainly arise from AT-II cells, which are the major source of MHC-II. Blocking urethane-induced inflammation by TNF-α neutralization inhibited tumorigenesis and reversed MHC-II upregulation on tumor cells of AT-II cellular origin in IDLA. MHC-II-dependent AT-II cells were isolated from IDLA-induced Treg expansion. In human LA samples, we found high expression of MHC-II in tumor cells of AT-II cellular origin, which was correlated with increased Foxp3+ T cells infiltration as well as CXCR-2 expression. CXCR-2 and MHC-II colocalization was observed in inflamed lung tissue and IDLA cells of AT-II cellular origin. Furthermore, at the pro-IDLA inflammatory stage, TNF-α-neutralization or CXCR-2 deficiency inhibited the upregulation of MHC-II on AT-II cells in inflamed lung tissue. Thus, tumor cells of AT-II cellular origin contribute to Treg expansion in an MHC-II-dependent manner in TNF-α-mediated IDLA. At the pro-tumor inflammatory stage, TNF-α-dependent lung inflammation plays an important role in MHC-II upregulation on AT-II cells."

Methods We enrolled patients who was newly diagnosed as having fibromyalgia between 1 January, 2000 and 31 December, 2010 from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. The claim data for both the acupuncture cohort and non-acupuncture cohort were assessed from the index date to 31 December, 2013. A Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and drugs use was used to compare the hazard ratios of the two cohorts. The cumulative incidence of stroke was estimated by using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results After performing a propensity score matching with a 1:1 ratio, there were 65,487 patients in the acupuncture and non-acupuncture cohorts with similar distributions in the baseline characteristics. The cumulative incidence of stroke was significantly lower in the acupuncture cohort (log-rank test, p < 0.001). In the follow-up period, 4,216 patients in the acupuncture cohort (11.01 per 1000 person-years) and 6,849 patients in the non-acupuncture cohort (19.82 per 1000 person-years) suffered from stroke (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.51–0.55). Acupuncture favorably affected the incidence of stroke regardless of the patient’s age, sex, comorbidities, and conventional drug use. Conclusions Our study found that acupuncture might have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of stroke in patients with fibromyalgia in Taiwan. Additional clinical and basic science studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3090919857,"Electromagnetic radiation has been proposed to non-aqueously stimulate shale formations, which can generate fractures and enhance the porosity of the matrix. The proposed method consumes electricity and thereby possesses significant advantages for sustainable and environmental hydrocarbon production. In this study, we investigate the pore structure variations of marine shale during electromagnetic radiation. First, the prepared marine shale samples are exposed to electromagnetic radiation for different times; an infrared thermometer monitors the temperatures. Then, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption technique is applied to examine the evolutions of the pore structure. Next, a scanning electron microscope is adopted to reveal the morphology and identify newly developed pores. Lastly, fractal analyses are performed to quantify pore structure variations. The sample exhibits quick temperature rises, whose temperature reaches about 300 °C after 5 min of electromagnetic radiation. The elevated temperature causes clay dehydration, thermal expansion, and organic matter decomposition, leading to significant changes in pore structures. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption characteristics demonstrate enhancements in pore spaces, including volume, size, and surface area. Fractal analyses show that the pores become rougher and exhibit less heterogeneity after electromagnetic radiation. The obtained results demonstrate a great potential of using electromagnetic radiation to enhance the porosity of shale rocks."
https://openalex.org/W3091691401,"The spiral ganglion neurons constitute the primary connection between auditory hair cells and the brain. The spiral ganglion afferent fibers and their synapse with hair cells do not regenerate to any significant degree in adult mammalian ears after damage. We have investigated gene expression changes after kainate-induced disruption of the synapses in a neonatal cochlear explant model in which peripheral fibers and the afferent synapse do regenerate. We compared gene expression early after damage, during regeneration of the fibers and synapses, and after completion of in vitro regeneration. These analyses revealed a total of 2.5% differentially regulated transcripts (588 out of 24,000) based on a threshold of p<0.005. Inflammatory response genes as well as genes involved in regeneration of neural circuits were upregulated in the spiral ganglion neurons and organ of Corti, where the hair cells reside. Prominent genes upregulated at several time points included genes with roles in neurogenesis (Elavl4 and Sox21), neural outgrowth (Ntrk3 and Ppp1r1c), axonal guidance (Rgmb and Sema7a), synaptogenesis (Nlgn2 and Psd2), and synaptic vesicular function (Syt8 and Syn1). Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analysis of genes that had not previously been described in the cochlea confirmed their cochlear expression. The time course of expression of these genes suggests that kainate treatment resulted in a two-phase response in spiral ganglion neurons: an acute response consistent with inflammation, followed by an upregulation of neural regeneration genes. Identification of the genes activated during regeneration of these fibers suggests candidates that could be targeted to enhance regeneration in adult ears."
https://openalex.org/W3045669508,"α-Synuclein (α-syn)-induced neurotoxicity has been generally accepted as a key step in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Microtubule-associated protein tau, which is considered second only to α-syn, has been repeatedly linked with PD in association studies. However, the underlying interaction between these two PD-related proteins in vivo remains unclear. To investigate how the expression of tau affects α-syn-induced neurodegeneration in vivo, we generated triple transgenic mice that overexpressed α-syn A53T mutation in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs) with different expression levels of tau. Here, we found that tau had no significant effect on the A53T α-syn-mediated mDANs degeneration. However, tau knockout could modestly promote the formation of α-syn aggregates, accelerate the severe and progressive degeneration of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), accompanied with anxiety-like behavior in aged PD-related α-syn A53T mice. The mechanisms may be associated with A53T α-syn-mediated specifically successive impairment of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B), postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) in PV+ neurons. Our study indicates that MAP1A may play a beneficial role in preserving the survival of PV+ neurons, and that inhibition of the impairment of NR2B/PSD-95/MAP1A pathway, may be a novel and preferential option to ameliorate α-syn-induced neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3048000431,"We previously demonstrated that Tetraticopeptide 4 (TTC4) inhibited apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (VEC) deprived of serum and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). In this study, we aimed to resolve the mechanism of TTC4 inhibiting VEC apoptosis. TTC4, predicted as a HSP70 co-chaperone protein, may regulate the fate of cells by affecting the activity of HSP70, however, there is no experimental evidence showing the interaction of TTC4 and HSP70. Using Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), we demonstrated that TTC4 interacted with HSP70. If HSP70 was knockdown, TTC4 no longer suppressed apoptosis. Furthermore, we found ABO, an inhibitor of annexin A7 (ANXA7) GTPase, could promote the interaction of TTC4 and HSP70 and the translocation of ANXA7 to lysosome. At the same time, ABO inhibited the interaction of HSP70 and ANXA7. Moreover, Akt, as a downstream effector of HSP70 was upregulated, and ANXA7 translocating to lysosome protected the stability of lysosomal membrane. Here, we discovered a special mechanism by which TTC4 inhibited apoptosis via HSP70 in VECs. On the one hand, increasing TTC4 and HSP70 interaction upregulated Akt that inhibited apoptosis. On the other hand, decreasing HSP70 and ANXA7 interaction promoted the translocation of ANXA7 to lysosome, which inhibited apoptosis through protecting the lysosomal membrane stability."
https://openalex.org/W3089395297,"In general survival analysis, multiple studies have considered a single failure time corresponding to the time to the event of interest or to the occurrence of multiple events under the assumption that each event is independent. However, in real-world events, one event may impact others. Essentially, the potential structure of the occurrence of multiple events can be observed in several survival datasets. The interrelations between the times to the occurrences of events are immensely challenging to analyze because of the presence of censoring. Censoring commonly arises in longitudinal studies in which some events are often not observed for some of the subjects within the duration of research. Although this problem presents the obstacle of distortion caused by censoring, the advanced multivariate survival analysis methods that handle multiple events with censoring make it possible to measure a bivariate probability density function for a pair of events. Considering this improvement, this paper proposes a method called censored network estimation to discover partially correlated relationships and construct the corresponding network composed of edges representing non-zero partial correlations on multiple censored events. To demonstrate its superior performance compared to conventional methods, the selecting power for the partially correlated events was evaluated in two types of networks with iterative simulation experiments. Additionally, the correlation structure was investigated on the electronic health records dataset of the times to the first diagnosis for newborn babies in South Korea. The results show significantly improved performance as compared to edge measurement with competitive methods and reliability in terms of the interrelations of real-life diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3090115576,"Background To prevent bio-accumulation of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) in patients with decreased kidney function, dosage reduction and anti-Xa monitoring has been suggested. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pre-emptive dosage reduction of LMWH on anti-Xa levels. Furthermore, we investigated the association between anti-Xa levels and bleeding, thrombotic events and mortality. Methods In this single center study, we followed 499 patients with decreased renal function in whom anti-Xa levels were measured. We observed how many patients had anti-Xa levels that fell within the reference range, with a standard protocol of a pre-emptive dosage reduction of LMWH (25% reduction in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and a reduction of 50% in patients with an eGFR below the 30 ml/min/1.73m2). Furthermore, Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios to investigate the association between anti-Xa levels and major bleeding, thrombotic events and mortality within three months of follow-up. Results In a cohort of 499 patients (445 dalteparin and 54 nadroparin users), a pre-emptive dosage reduction of LMWH led to adequate levels of anti-Xa in only 19% of the patients (12% for the dalteparin users and 50% for nadroparin users). We did not find an association between anti-Xa levels and bleeding, thrombosis or mortality. Conclusion Pre-emptive dosage reduction of LMWH leads to low anti-Xa levels in a large proportion, but this was not associated with bleeding, thrombosis or mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3090777789,"Mastering the evolution of urban land cover is important for urban management and planning. In this paper, a method for analyzing land cover evolution within urban built-up areas based on nighttime light data and Landsat data is proposed. The method solves the problem of inaccurate descriptions of urban built-up area boundaries from the use of single-source diurnal or nocturnal remote sensing data and was able to achieve an effective analysis of land cover evolution within built-up areas. Four main procedures are involved: (1) The neighborhood extremum method and maximum likelihood method are used to extract nighttime light data and the urban built-up area boundaries from the Landsat data, respectively; (2) multisource urban boundaries are obtained using boundary pixel fusion of the nighttime light data and Landsat urban built-up area boundaries; (3) the maximum likelihood method is used to classify Landsat data within multisource urban boundaries into land cover classes, such as impervious surface, vegetation and water, and to calculate landscape indexes, such as overall landscape trends, degree of fragmentation and degree of aggregation; (4) the changes in the multisource urban boundaries and landscape indexes were obtained using the abovementioned methods, which were supported by multitemporal nighttime light data and Landsat data, to model the urban land cover evolution. Using the cities of Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin in northeastern China as experimental areas, the multitemporal landscape index showed that the integration and aggregation of land cover in the urban areas had an increasing trend, the natural environment of Shenyang and Harbin was improving, while Changchun laid more emphasis on the construction of artificial facilities. At the same time, the method proposed in this paper to extract built-up areas from multi-source city data showed that the user accuracy, production accuracy, overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are at least 3%, 1%, 1% and 0.04 higher than the single-source data method."
https://openalex.org/W3091156092,"Decidualization of the endometrial stroma is an essential differentiation process for embryo implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. We previously reported that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) acts as a key mediator during cAMP-induced decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs). However, the mechanism underlying its activation has remained obscure in hESCs. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the mechanism that induces the nitration of PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) during cAMP-induced decidualization of hESCs. First, cAMP-induced PP2Ac nitration was significantly repressed using L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Among several NOS isoforms, only inducible NOS (iNOS) was highly expressed in hESCs, indicating that iNOS directly induces the nitration of PP2Ac. Second, cAMP-induced iNOS expression and PP2Ac nitration were decreased by treatment with TSA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5). cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CaMKII and HDAC5 was suppressed by treatment with U73122 (an inhibitor of phospholipase C) or transfection of PLCε siRNA. Finally, small G protein Rap1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1 were found to be involved in cAMP-induced PP2A activation. Taken together, our results suggest that PP2Ac nitration during cAMP-induced decidualization of hESCs is induced through the Epac1-Rap1-PLCε-CaMKII-HDAC5-iNOS signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3089730151,"Studies have documented that traditional motor skills (i.e. motor habits) are part of the cultural way of life that characterises each society. Yet, it is still unclear to what extent motor skills are inherited through culture. Drawing on ethnology and motor behaviour, we addressed this issue through a detailed description of traditional pottery skills. Our goal was to quantify the influence of three kinds of constraints: the transcultural constraints of wheel-throwing, the cultural constraints induced via cultural transmission, and the potters' individual constraints. Five expert Nepalese potters were invited to produce three familiar pottery types, each in five specimens. A total of 31 different fashioning hand positions were identified. Most of them (14) were cross-cultural, ten positions were cultural, five positions were individual, and two positions were unique. Statistical tests indicated that the subset of positions used by the participants in this study were distinct from those of other cultural groups. Behaviours described in terms of fashioning duration, number of gestures, and hand position repertoires size highlighted both individual and cross-cultural traits. We also analysed the time series of the successive hand positions used throughout the fashioning of each vessel. Results showed, for each pottery type, strong reproducible sequences at the individual level and a clearly higher level of variability between potters. Overall, our findings confirm the existence of a cultural transmission in craft skills but also demonstrated that the skill is not fully determined by a cultural marking. We conclude that the influence of culture on craft skills should not be overstated, even if its role is significant given the fact that it reflects the socially transmitted part of the skill. Such research offers insights into archaeological problems in providing a representative view of how cultural constraints influence the motor skills implied in artefact manufacturing."

However, the community composition revealed by different marker genes and whether the marker genes influence the resulted community composition remain unclear. We compared the community structure of anammox bacteria in enriched and natural environments revealed by 16S rRNA and functional genes (hzo, hzsA and hzsB) from public database and published papers. The genus of Ca. Scalindua showed the lowest similarities with other genera, especially for the hzsA gene (66.9%-68.6%). The 16S rRNA gene is the most commonly used marker gene in natural habitats with 151 out 221 papers in total. The anammox bacterial community composition is distributed according to the source of habitat regardless the use of various marker genes. The role of marker gene is limited with explanatory of 5.4% for variance of community composition, versus 20.5% of habitat. The effect of marker gene is mainly acted on freshwater habitat, which shows significant different community composition revealed by 16S rRNA and hzo, with Ca. Brocadia and Ca.

https://openalex.org/W3089356945,"Tendinopathy is a degenerative disease in which inflammatory mediators have been found to be sometimes present. The interaction between inflammation and matrix remodeling in human tendon cells (TCs) is supported by the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-33. In this context, it has been demonstrated that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) were able to reduce inflammation and promote tendon marker synthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anabolic and anti-inflammatory PEMF-mediated response on TCs in an in vitro model of inflammation. Moreover, since PEMFs enhance the anti-inflammatory efficacy of adenosine through the adenosine receptors (ARs), the study also focused on the role of A2AARs. Human TCs were exposed to PEMFs for 48 hours. After stimulation, A2AAR saturation binding experiments were performed. Along with 48 hours PEMF stimulation, TCs were treated with IL-1β and A2AAR agonist CGS-21680. IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-33, VEGF, TGF-β1, PGE2 release and SCX, COL1A1, COL3A1, ADORA2A expression were quantified. PEMFs exerted A2AAR modulation on TCs and promoted COL3A1 upregulation and IL-33 secretion. In presence of IL-1β, TCs showed an upregulation of ADORA2A, SCX and COL3A1 expression and an increase of IL-6, IL-8, PGE2 and VEGF secretion. After PEMF and IL-1β exposure, IL-33 was upregulated, whereas IL-6, PGE2 and ADORA2A were downregulated. These findings demonstrated that A2AARs have a role in the promotion of the TC anabolic/reparative response to PEMFs and to IL-1β."

We conducted a community-based survey to determine outcomes of HIV-exposed infants at 18-24 months in Lesotho.Between November 2015 and December 2016, we conducted a survey among households with a child born 18-24 months prior to data collection. Catchment areas from 25 health facilities in Butha-Buthe, Maseru, Mohale's Hoek and Thaba-Tseka districts were randomly selected using probability proportional to size sampling. Consecutive households were visited and eligible consenting caregivers and children were enrolled. Rapid HIV antibody testing was performed on mothers of unknown HIV status (never tested or tested HIV-negative >3 months prior) and their children, and to children born to known HIV-positive mothers. Information on demographics, health-seeking behavior, HIV, and mortality were captured for mothers and children, including those who died. The difference in survival between subgroups was determined using the log-rank test.Of the 1,852 mothers/caregivers enrolled, 570 mothers were HIV-positive. The mother-to-child HIV transmission rate was 5.7% [95% CI: 4.0-8.0]. The mortality rate was 2.6% [95% CI: 1.6-4.2] among HIV-exposed children compared to 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9-2.3) among HIV-unexposed children. HIV-free survival was 91.8% [95% CI: 89.2-93.8] among HIV-exposed infants. Disclosure of mother's HIV status (aOR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.3-18.2) and initiation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in the child (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2-12.6) were independently associated with increased HIV-free survival while child growth problems (aOR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.09-0.5) were independently associated with reduced HIV-free survival.Even in the context of lifelong antiretroviral therapy among pregnant and breastfeeding women, HIV has a significant effect on survival among HIV-exposed children compared to unexposed children. Lesotho has not reached elimination of HIV transmission from mother to child."
https://openalex.org/W3090363439,"Single-centre studies examining the transgenerational inheritance of pathologies in rodents exposed to pesticides have not always taken important design and analysis issues into account. This paper examines these methodological and statistical issues in detail. Its particular focus is on the estimation of ‘litter effects’: the tendency for rodents within a litter to be more alike than rodents in different litters. Appropriate statistical models were fitted to published data from a series of widely reported studies carried out at Washington State University. These studies were amalgamated into a single dataset in order to estimate these litter effects and associated treatment effects. Litter effects varied by outcome and were often substantial. Consequently, the effective sample size was often substantially less than the number of observations with implications for the power of the studies. Moreover, the reported precision of the estimates of treatment effects was too low. These problems are exacerbated by unexplained missing data across generations. Researchers in the life sciences could be more cognisant of the guidelines established in medicine for reporting randomised controlled trials, particularly cluster randomised trials. More attention should be paid to the design and analysis of multi-generational rodent studies; their imperfections have important implications for assessments of the evidence relating to the risks of pesticides for public health."
https://openalex.org/W3090892471,"In developing countries, the emergence of informal groundwater markets is accidental rather than planned due to the water scarcity and supply-side constraints. It is less often that water markets are assessed for agents bargaining power and equity impacts. In this paper, I examine the relative bargaining power of sellers and buyers in informal groundwater markets in India. To understand the process of bargaining, a framed-field experiment is conducted with actual buyers and sellers in groundwater contracts. In the experiment, sellers and buyers make a series of choices between output-shared and fixed-price contracts under varied risk conditions, first individually and then jointly. I define bargaining power as the relative ability of the agent to influence the joint decision for their individually preferred contract type. I find that there is a large preference disagreement between sellers and buyers. Buyers have preferences for output-shared contracts while sellers' choices are motivated by expected earnings. Using the random-parameter probit model, I show that sellers have relatively more power to drive the joint decision in their favour. Nevertheless, factors like interpersonal relationships between buyers and sellers, such as kinship ties, long contractual history, and higher education of buyers augment buyers' power relative bargaining power."

But while a lot of emphasis has been directed to the assessment of measurement invariance, there has been substantially less concern on how measurement error can affect the results of measurement invariance testing. In this study, we show how correction for measurement error can be applied to measurement invariance analysis. We illustrate this using the concept of ""Perceived ethnic threat"" measured in the European Social Survey Round 3 (2006). The measurement invariance results before and after correction for measurement error are compared. We show that correction for measurement error offers a viable way to ensure that non-invariant parameters are actually caused by differences in the data and not caused by the measurement method."

It is assumed that the non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) plays a key role in B. cereus induced diarrhea. The ability to trace Nhe activity is important for food safety. While assays such as PCR and ELISA exist to detect Nhe, those methods cannot differentiate between active and inactive forms of Nhe. The existing rabbit ileal loop bioassay used to detect Nhe activity is ethically disfavored because it uses live experimental animals. Here we present a custom built low-cost CCD based luminometer and applied it in conjunction with a cell-based assay using Vero cells transduced to express the luciferase enzyme. The activity of Nhe was measured as its ability to inhibit synthesis of luciferase as quantified by reduction of light emission by the luciferase reaction.

https://openalex.org/W3090153187,"We recently described a regulatory loop, which we termed autoregulation of infection (AOI), by which Sinorhizobium meliloti, a Medicago endosymbiont, downregulates the root susceptibility to secondary infection events via ethylene. AOI is initially triggered by so-far unidentified Medicago nodule signals named signal 1 and signal 1’ whose transduction in bacteroids requires the S. meliloti outer-membrane-associated NsrA receptor protein and the cognate inner-membrane-associated adenylate cyclases, CyaK and CyaD1/D2, respectively. Here, we report on advances in signal 1 identification. Signal 1 activity is widespread as we robustly detected it in Medicago nodule extracts as well as in yeast and bacteria cell extracts. Biochemical analyses indicated a peptidic nature for signal 1 and, together with proteomic analyses, a universally conserved Medicago ribosomal protein of the uL2 family was identified as a candidate signal 1. Specifically, MtRPuL2A (MtrunA17Chr7g0247311) displays a strong signal activity that requires S. meliloti NsrA and CyaK, as endogenous signal 1. We have shown that MtRPuL2A is active in signaling only in a non-ribosomal form. A Medicago truncatula mutant in the major symbiotic transcriptional regulator MtNF-YA1 lacked most signal 1 activity, suggesting that signal 1 is under developmental control. Altogether, our results point to the MtRPuL2A ribosomal protein as the candidate for signal 1. Based on the Mtnf-ya1 mutant, we suggest a link between root infectiveness and nodule development. We discuss our findings in the context of ribosomal protein moonlighting."
