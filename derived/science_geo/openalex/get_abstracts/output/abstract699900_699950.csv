https://openalex.org/W4294052458,"The social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) measures the monetized value of the damages to society caused by an incremental metric tonne of CO2 emissions and is a key metric informing climate policy. Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit-cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO2 estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine1 (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO2 estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO2 estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO2. Our preferred mean SC-CO2 estimate is $185 per tonne of CO2 ($44-$413 per tCO2: 5%-95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6 times higher than the US government's current value of $51 per tCO2. Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO2 estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO2 values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies."
https://openalex.org/W4294042823,"The molecular mechanism underlying brain regeneration in vertebrates remains elusive. We performed spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing (Stereo-seq) to capture spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes of axolotl telencephalon sections during development and regeneration. Annotated cell types exhibited distinct spatial distribution, molecular features, and functions. We identified an injury-induced ependymoglial cell cluster at the wound site as a progenitor cell population for the potential replenishment of lost neurons, through a cell state transition process resembling neurogenesis during development. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that these induced cells may originate from local resident ependymoglial cells. We further uncovered spatially defined neurons at the lesion site that may regress to an immature neuron-like state. Our work establishes spatial transcriptome profiles of an anamniote tetrapod brain and decodes potential neurogenesis from ependymoglial cells for development and regeneration, thus providing mechanistic insights into vertebrate brain regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4294167233,"Three-dimensional (3D) laser nanoprinting allows maskless manufacturing of diverse nanostructures with nanoscale resolution. However, 3D manufacturing of inorganic nanostructures typically requires nanomaterial-polymer composites and is limited by a photopolymerization mechanism, resulting in a reduction of material purity and degradation of intrinsic properties. We developed a polymerization-independent, laser direct writing technique called photoexcitation-induced chemical bonding. Without any additives, the holes excited inside semiconductor quantum dots are transferred to the nanocrystal surface and improve their chemical reactivity, leading to interparticle chemical bonding. As a proof of concept, we printed arbitrary 3D quantum dot architectures at a resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Our strategy will enable the manufacturing of free-form quantum dot optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting devices or photodetectors."
https://openalex.org/W4294074096,"Cyclic adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose (cADPR) isomers are signaling molecules produced by bacterial and plant Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+) hydrolysis. We show that v-cADPR (2'cADPR) and v2-cADPR (3'cADPR) isomers are cyclized by O-glycosidic bond formation between the ribose moieties in ADPR. Structures of 2'cADPR-producing TIR domains reveal conformational changes that lead to an active assembly that resembles those of Toll-like receptor adaptor TIR domains. Mutagenesis reveals a conserved tryptophan that is essential for cyclization. We show that 3'cADPR is an activator of ThsA effector proteins from the bacterial antiphage defense system termed Thoeris and a suppressor of plant immunity when produced by the effector HopAM1. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular basis of cADPR isomer production and establish 3'cADPR in bacteria as an antiviral and plant immunity-suppressing signaling molecule."
https://openalex.org/W4294042805,"Metallic materials experience irreversible deformation with increasing applied stress, manifested in localized slip events that result in fatigue failure upon repeated cycling. We discerned the physical origins of fatigue strength in a large set of face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic metallic materials by considering cyclic deformation processes at nanometer resolution over large volumes of individual materials at the earliest stages of cycling. We identified quantitative relations between the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength, fatigue strength, and physical characteristics of early slip localization events. The fatigue strength of metallic alloys that deform by slip could be predicted by the amplitude of slip localization during the first cycle of loading. Our observations provide a physical basis for well-known empirical fatigue laws and enable a rapid method of predicting fatigue strength as reflected by measurement of slip localization amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W4294073631,"Compared with peripheral late-stage transformations mainly focusing on carbon-hydrogen functionalizations, reliable strategies to directly edit the core skeleton of pharmaceutical lead compounds still remain scarce despite the recent flurry of activity in this area. Herein, we report the skeletal editing of indoles through nitrogen atom insertion, accessing the corresponding quinazoline or quinoxaline bioisosteres by trapping of an electrophilic nitrene species generated from ammonium carbamate and hypervalent iodine. This reactivity relies on the strategic use of a silyl group as a labile protecting group that can facilitate subsequent product release. The utility of this highly functional group-compatible methodology in the context of late-stage skeletal editing of several commercial drugs is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W4294042832,"Earth's forests harbor extensive biodiversity and are currently a major carbon sink. Forest conservation and restoration can help mitigate climate change; however, climate change could fundamentally imperil forests in many regions and undermine their ability to provide such mitigation. The extent of climate risks facing forests has not been synthesized globally nor have different approaches to quantifying forest climate risks been systematically compared. We combine outputs from multiple mechanistic and empirical approaches to modeling carbon, biodiversity, and disturbance risks to conduct a synthetic climate risk analysis for Earth's forests in the 21st century. Despite large uncertainty in most regions we find that some forests are consistently at higher risk, including southern boreal forests and those in western North America and parts of the Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W4294073550,"Salamanders are tetrapod models to study brain organization and regeneration; however, the identity and evolutionary conservation of brain cell types are largely unknown. We delineated the cell populations in the axolotl telencephalon during homeostasis and regeneration using single-cell genomic profiling. We identified glutamatergic neurons with similarities to amniote neurons of hippocampus, dorsal and lateral cortex, and conserved γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) neuron classes. We inferred transcriptional dynamics and gene regulatory relationships of postembryonic, region-specific neurogenesis and unraveled conserved differentiation signatures. After brain injury, ependymoglia activate an injury-specific state before reestablishing lost neuron populations and axonal connections. Together, our analyses yield insights into the organization, evolution, and regeneration of a tetrapod nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W4294073634,"The evolution of advanced cognition in vertebrates is associated with two independent innovations in the forebrain: the six-layered neocortex in mammals and the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) in sauropsids (reptiles and birds). How these innovations arose in vertebrate ancestors remains unclear. To reconstruct forebrain evolution in tetrapods, we built a cell-type atlas of the telencephalon of the salamander Pleurodeles waltl. Our molecular, developmental, and connectivity data indicate that parts of the sauropsid DVR trace back to tetrapod ancestors. By contrast, the salamander dorsal pallium is devoid of cellular and molecular characteristics of the mammalian neocortex yet shares similarities with the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Our findings chart the series of innovations that resulted in the emergence of the mammalian six-layered neocortex and the sauropsid DVR."
https://openalex.org/W4294042827,"Hydroxyl (OH) radicals are highly reactive species that can oxidize most pollutant gases. In this study, high concentrations of OH radicals were found when people were exposed to ozone in a climate-controlled chamber. OH concentrations calculated by two methods using measurements of total OH reactivity, speciated alkenes, and oxidation products were consistent with those obtained from a chemically explicit model. Key to establishing this human-induced oxidation field is 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), which forms when ozone reacts with the skin-oil squalene and subsequently generates OH efficiently through gas-phase reaction with ozone. A dynamic model was used to show the spatial extent of the human-generated OH oxidation field and its dependency on ozone influx through ventilation. This finding has implications for the oxidation, lifetime, and perception of chemicals indoors and, ultimately, human health."
https://openalex.org/W4294042844,"At the present time, no viable treatment exists for cognitive and olfactory deficits in Down syndrome (DS). We show in a DS model (Ts65Dn mice) that these progressive nonreproductive neurological symptoms closely parallel a postpubertal decrease in hypothalamic as well as extrahypothalamic expression of a master molecule that controls reproduction-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-and appear related to an imbalance in a microRNA-gene network known to regulate GnRH neuron maturation together with altered hippocampal synaptic transmission. Epigenetic, cellular, chemogenetic, and pharmacological interventions that restore physiological GnRH levels abolish olfactory and cognitive defects in Ts65Dn mice, whereas pulsatile GnRH therapy improves cognition and brain connectivity in adult DS patients. GnRH thus plays a crucial role in olfaction and cognition, and pulsatile GnRH therapy holds promise to improve cognitive deficits in DS."
https://openalex.org/W4294042843,"The existence of evolutionarily conserved regions in the vertebrate brain is well established. The rules and constraints underlying the evolution of neuron types, however, remain poorly understood. To compare neuron types across brain regions and species, we generated a cell type atlas of the brain of a bearded dragon and compared it with mouse datasets. Conserved classes of neurons could be identified from the expression of hundreds of genes, including homeodomain-type transcription factors and genes involved in connectivity. Within these classes, however, there are both conserved and divergent neuron types, precluding a simple categorization of the brain into ancestral and novel areas. In the thalamus, neuronal diversification correlates with the evolution of the cortex, suggesting that developmental origin and circuit allocation are drivers of neuronal identity and evolution."

https://openalex.org/W4294073636,"In most organisms, reproduction is correlated with shorter life span. However, the reproductive queen in eusocial insects exhibits a much longer life span than that of workers. In Harpegnathos ants, when the queen dies, workers can undergo an adult caste switch to reproductive pseudo-queens (gamergates), exhibiting a five-times prolonged life span. To explore the relation between reproduction and longevity, we compared gene expression during caste switching. Insulin expression is increased in the gamergate brain that correlates with increased lipid synthesis and production of vitellogenin in the fat body, both transported to the egg. This results from activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) branch of the insulin signaling pathway. By contrast, the production in the gamergate developing ovary of anti-insulin Imp-L2 leads to decreased signaling of the AKT/forkhead box O (FOXO) branch in the fat body, which is consistent with their extended longevity."

https://openalex.org/W4294044402,"For over two years, the global COVID-19 pandemic has forced major transformations on health, social, and educational systems, with concomitant impacts on mental health. This study aimed to understand the unique and additional challenges faced by children with chronic illness and their families during the COVID-19 era.Parents of children receiving treatment for a chronic illness within the neurology, cancer, renal and respiratory clinics of Sydney Children's Hospital were invited to participate. We used qualitative methodology, including a semi-structured interview guide, verbatim transcription, and thematic analysis supported by QSR NVivo.Thirteen parents of children receiving tertiary-level care, for nine chronic illnesses, participated. Parents reported intense fears relating to their ill child's additional vulnerabilities, which included their risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease and the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to accessing clinical care, medications, allied health support and daily care protocols should their parent contract COVID-19. Parents perceived telehealth as a highly convenient and preferred method for ongoing management of less complex healthcare needs. Parents reported that the accrual of additional stressors and responsibilities during the pandemic, experienced in combination with restricted social interaction and reduced access to usual support networks was detrimental to their own mental health. Hospital-based visitation restrictions reduced emotional support, coping, and resilience for both parents and children and in some cases led to marital discord, sibling distress, and financial loss. Supportive factors included increased time spent together at home during the pandemic and improved hygiene practices at school, which dramatically reduced the incidence of non-COVID-19-related communicable illnesses in chronically ill children.For families caring for a chronically ill child, COVID-19 made a difficult situation harder. The pandemic has highlighted the need for targeted psychosocial intervention for vulnerable families, to mitigate current mental health burden and prevent chronic psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W4294044675,"To create vortex vein congestion in the monkey eye as a possible pachychoroid model.We ligated superotemporal and inferotemporal vortex veins at the surface of the sclera in monkey eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) were performed before and 2, 7, and 28 days after the vortex vein ligations to investigate changes in vortex vein morphology and alterations in choroidal blood flow.Before the vortex vein ligations, en face OCT and ICGA images showed well organized vortex veins as well as horizontal and vertical watershed zones. Two days after the vortex vein ligations, dilatation of the superotemporal and inferotemporal vortex veins as well as intervortex venous anastomoses were seen on en face OCT and ICGA images. B-mode OCT images showed choroidal thickening associated with dilatation of the outer choroidal vessels. Moreover, video ICGA revealed choriocapillaris filling delay and pulsatile flow in the dilated vortex veins. At 7 and 28 days after we ligated the vortex veins, these findings were reduced, except for the intervortex venous anastomoses.We created a monkey model of vortex vein congestion by ligating two vortex veins. This animal model demonstrated pachychoroid-related findings, indicating that vortex vein congestion is involved in the pathogenesis of pachychoroid. However, remodeling of the choroidal drainage route via intervortex venous anastomosis appeared to compensate for the vortex vein congestion created in this model."
https://openalex.org/W4294044654,"Purpose To demonstrate the diagnostic performance of rapid SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assays, comparing the performance of genomic versus sub-genomic sequence target with subsequent application in an asymptomatic screening population. Methods RT-LAMP diagnostic specificity (DSe) and sensitivity (DSe) was determined using 114 RT-PCR clinically positive and 88 RT-PCR clinically negative swab samples processed through the diagnostic RT-PCR service within the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. A swab-based RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 screening programme was subsequently made available to all staff and students at the University of Leicester (Autumn 2020), implemented to ISO 15189:2012 standards using NHS IT infrastructure and supported by University Hospital Leicester via confirmatory NHS diagnostic laboratory testing of RT-LAMP ‘positive’ samples. Results Validation samples reporting a Ct &lt; 20 were detected at 100% DSe and DSp, reducing to 95% DSe (100% DSp) for all samples reporting a Ct &lt; 30 (both genomic dual sub-genomic assays). Advisory screening identified nine positive cases in 1680 symptom free individuals (equivalent to 540 cases per 100,000) with results reported back to participants and feed into national statistics within 48 hours. Conclusion This work demonstrates the utility of a rapid RT-LAMP assay for collapsing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in an asymptomatic screening population."
https://openalex.org/W4294167209,"The utility of ferroic materials is determined by the formation of domains and their poling behavior under externally applied fields. For multiferroics, which exhibit several types of ferroic order at once, it is also relevant how the domains of the coexisting ferroic states couple and what kind of functionality this might involve. In this work, we demonstrate the reversible transfer of a domain pattern between magnetization and electric-polarization space in the multiferroic Dy 0.7 Tb 0.3 FeO 3 . A magnetic field transfers a ferromagnetic domain pattern into an identical ferroelectric domain pattern while erasing it at its magnetic origin. Reverse transfer completes the cycle. To assess the generality of our experiment, we elaborate on its conceptual origin and aspects of application."
https://openalex.org/W4293718623,"Akkermansia muciniphila is key member of the human gut microbiota that impacts many features of host health. A major characteristic of this bacterium is its interaction with host mucin, which is abundant in the gut environment, and its ability to metabolize mucin as a nutrient source. The machinery deployed by A. muciniphila to enable this interaction appears to be extensive and sophisticated, yet it is incompletely defined. The uncharacterized protein AMUC_1438 is encoded by a gene that was previously shown to be upregulated when the bacterium is grown on mucin. This uncharacterized protein has features suggestive of carbohydrate-recognition and peptidase activity, which led us to hypothesize that it has a role in mucin depolymerization. Here, we provide structural and functional support for the assignment of AMUC_1438 as a unique O-glycopeptidase with mucin-degrading capacity. O-glycopeptidase enzymes recognize glycans but hydrolyze the peptide backbone and are common in host-adapted microbes that colonize or invade mucus layers. Structural, kinetic, and mutagenic analyses point to a metzincin metalloprotease catalytic motif but with an active site that specifically recognizes a GalNAc residue α-linked to serine or threonine (i.e., the Tn-antigen). The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of the bond immediately N-terminal to the glycosylated residue. Additional modeling analyses suggest the presence of a carbohydrate-binding module that may assist in substrate recognition. We anticipate that these results will be fundamental to a wider understanding of the O-glycopeptidase class of enzymes and how they may contribute to host adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W4294045134,"In previous work, we determined the transcriptomic impacts of flg22 pre-induced Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana on the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto). During PTI exposure we observed expression patterns in Pto reminiscent of those previously observed in a Pto algU mutant. AlgU is a conserved extracytoplasmic function sigma factor which has been observed to regulate over 950 genes in Pto in growth media. We sought to identify the AlgU regulon when the bacteria are inside the plant host and which PTI-regulated genes overlapped with AlgU-regulated genes. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data from RNA-sequencing to identify the AlgU regulon (while in the host) and its relationship with PTI. Our results showed that the upregulation of 224 genes while inside the plant host require AlgU, while another 154 genes are downregulated dependent on AlgU in Arabidopsis during early infection. Both stress response and virulence-associated genes were upregulated in a manner dependent on AlgU, while the flagellar motility genes are downregulated in a manner dependent on AlgU. Under the pre-induced PTI condition, more than half of these AlgU-regulated genes have lost induction/suppression in contrast to mock treated plants, and almost all function groups regulated by AlgU were affected by PTI."
https://openalex.org/W4294125592,"Medical students are vulnerable to anxiety. Identifying its key influencing factors can potentially benefit both students and their future patients. Trait emotional intelligence (EI) and perceived stress may play important roles in anxiety. The main objective of this study was to examine the associations between trait EI, perceived stress and anxiety among Chinese medical students.Self-report questionnaires, consisting of the Chinese versions of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and demographic section were distributed to 1500 students at three medical universities in China. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between trait EI, perceived stress and anxiety. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were utilized to examine the mediating effect of perceived stress.A total number of 1388 medical students became final participants. After adjustment for demographics, while trait EI was strongly and negatively associated with anxiety, accounting for 21.1% of its variance, perceived stress was strongly and positively related to anxiety, explaining an additional 10.0% of the variance. Stress appeared to have a mediating effect on the association between trait EI and anxiety in students with high and moderate levels of stress, but not in low stress group.Both constructs of trait EI and perceived stress could be of vital importance to understand anxiety in medical students. Evidence-based strategies to enhance trait EI and reduce perceived stress might be undertaken to prevent and treat anxiety in the students."
https://openalex.org/W4294128230,"Understanding general migration characteristics and how breeding and non-breeding sites are connected is crucial for predicting the response of long-distance migratory bird populations to environmental changes. We use data collected from six geolocators to describe migratory routes and identify breeding and non-breeding locations, migratory behaviour and differences between spring and autumn migration of Common Whitethroats Curruca communis , an Afro-Palearctic migrant, wintering in Nigeria. Most individuals departed on spring migration in April, following a north-easterly direction, arriving at their breeding grounds across central-eastern Europe (~425,000 km 2 ) in May. Departures from breeding grounds took place between July and August in a south-westerly direction. During spring migration individuals travelled longer distances at faster rates making its overall duration shorter than autumn migration. We suggest that, while Whitethroats can cross the Sahara Desert and Mediterranean Sea in a single flight, they are likely to refuel before and after crossing. Results indicate that Whitethroats undertook loop migration and visited two wintering sites: first in the Sahel, then in Nigeria, where they remained until spring migration. Geolocator results and data from the European Union for Bird Migration’s (EURING) ringing database suggest that Whitethroats have a relatively high migratory spread—individuals from a single non-breeding site breed across a wide area of Europe. Our research is the first to track and describe the complete annual cycle of Whitethroats and one of the few studies to do so for any Afro-Palearctic migrant from non-breeding grounds. We identified the Sahel as an important refuelling and first wintering site indicating its conservation, alongside other stopover sites, is crucial for the species. We believe that changes in this region will have severe effects on a subset of individuals of specific European breeding populations, but these effects will greatly depend on the severity of the changes and at what spatial scale they occur."
https://openalex.org/W4294043440,"Skeletal muscle unloading due to joint immobilization induces muscle atrophy, which has primarily been attributed to reductions in protein synthesis in humans. However, no study has evaluated the skeletal muscle proteome response to limb immobilization using SWATH proteomic methods. This study characterized the shifts in individual muscle protein abundance and corresponding gene sets after 3 and 14 d of unilateral lower limb immobilization in otherwise healthy young men. Eighteen male participants (25.4 ±5.5 y, 81.2 ±11.6 kg) underwent 14 d of unilateral knee-brace immobilization with dietary provision and following four-weeks of training to standardise acute training history. Participant phenotype was characterized before and after 14 days of immobilization, and muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis at baseline (pre-immobilization) and at 3 and 14 d of immobilization for analysis by SWATH-MS and subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immobilization reduced vastus group cross sectional area (-9.6 ±4.6%, P <0.0001), immobilized leg lean mass (-3.3 ±3.9%, P = 0.002), unilateral 3-repetition maximum leg press (-15.6 ±9.2%, P <0.0001), and maximal oxygen uptake (-2.9 ±5.2%, P = 0.044). SWATH analyses consistently identified 2281 proteins. Compared to baseline, two and 99 proteins were differentially expressed (FDR <0.05) after 3 and 14 d of immobilization, respectively. After 14 d of immobilization, 322 biological processes were different to baseline (FDR <0.05, P <0.001). Most (77%) biological processes were positively enriched and characterized by cellular stress, targeted proteolysis, and protein-DNA complex modifications. In contrast, mitochondrial organization and energy metabolism were negatively enriched processes. This study is the first to use data independent proteomics and GSEA to show that unilateral lower limb immobilization evokes mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular stress, and proteolysis. Through GSEA and network mapping, we identify 27 hub proteins as potential protein/gene candidates for further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W4294045115,"Chloroplast metabolism is very sensitive to environmental fluctuations and is intimately related to plant leaf development. Characterization of the chloroplast proteome dynamics can contribute to a better understanding on plant adaptation to different climate scenarios and leaf development processes. Herein, we carried out a discovery-driven analysis of the Eucalyptus grandis chloroplast proteome during leaf maturation and throughout different seasons of the year. The chloroplast proteome from young leaves differed the most from all assessed samples. Most upregulated proteins identified in mature and young leaves were those related to catabolic-redox signaling and biogenesis processes, respectively. Seasonal dynamics revealed unique proteome features in the fall and spring periods. The most abundant chloroplast protein in humid (wet) seasons (spring and summer) was a small subunit of RuBisCO, while in the dry periods (fall and winter) the proteins that showed the most pronounced accumulation were associated with photo-oxidative damage, Calvin cycle, shikimate pathway, and detoxification. Our investigation of the chloroplast proteome dynamics during leaf development revealed significant alterations in relation to the maturation event. Our findings also suggest that transition seasons induced the most pronounced chloroplast proteome changes over the year. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding on the subcellular mechanisms that lead to plant leaf adaptation and ultimately gives more insights into Eucalyptus grandis phenology."
https://openalex.org/W4294045119,"Detecting and assessing changes in the hydrologic cycle and its response to a changing environment is essential for maintaining regional ecological security and restoring degraded ecosystems. There is no clear scientific evidence on the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff and its components in typical arid areas. Therefore, in this study, a heuristic segmentation algorithm, a variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), and remote sensing data to quantify the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff in the catchment of Lake Ebinur, Xinjiang, China. The results found: (1) The heuristic segmentation algorithm divided the study period into reference period (1964–1985) and two impact periods: I (1986–2000) and II (2001–2017). (2) Cropland and forest land showed an increasing trend, with grassland and barren land accounting for most of the increase. At the same time, the leaf area index (LAI) increased by 0.002 per year during the growing season. (3) Compared with the reference period, runoff depth decreased by 108.80 mm in impact period I due to human activities, but increased by 110.5 mm due to climate variability, resulting in an overall increase in runoff depth of 1.72 mm. Runoff depth increased by 11.10 mm in the impact period II compared to the reference period, with climate variability resulting in an increase of 154.40 mm, but human activities resulted in a decrease of 143.30 mm. Our results shed light on decision-making related to water stress in changing circumstances in arid regions."
https://openalex.org/W4294045131,"An important criterion for the proper functioning of a managed competition healthcare system, such as operates in the Netherlands, is that all citizens can make well-informed decisions regarding their health insurance policy. In order to achieve this, citizens need certain health insurance literacy skills. It is not known how far citizens in the Netherlands have these skills. The aim of this study is to provide a reliable instrument that measures the health insurance literacy of citizens in the Netherlands. It would be based upon an existing instrument developed in the US. We translated the US Health Insurance Literacy Measure (HILM) into Dutch. Furthermore, we established the psychometric properties of the Dutch version (HILM-NL), and we validated the HILM-NL in a general population sample by sending surveys to members of the Nivel Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (DHCCP) in February and March 2020. The response rates were respectively 54% (n = 806) and 56% (n = 595). No insurmountable difficulties with equivalence were encountered throughout the translation process. The HILM-NL showed an acceptable level of internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and a good construct validity. The HILM-NL is a reliable instrument for measuring health insurance literacy among citizens in the Netherlands. With this instrument, it is better possible both to assess how these citizens choose and use a health insurance policy, and also the difficulties they face. It enables citizens in the Netherlands to be supported better in making well-informed decisions on health insurance."
https://openalex.org/W4294045133,"Generating specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize multiple antigen variants is challenging. Here, we present a strategy to generate mAbs that bind seven subtypes of botulinum neurotoxin serotype F (BoNT/F) that differ from each other in amino acid sequence by up to 36%. Previously, we identified 28H4, a mouse mAb with poor cross-reactivity to BoNT/F1, F3, F4, and F6 and with no detectable binding to BoNT/F2, F5, or F7. Using multicolor labeling of the different BoNT/F subtypes and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of yeast displayed single-chain Fv (scFv) mutant libraries, 28H4 was evolved to a humanized mAb hu6F15.4 that bound each of seven BoNT/F subtypes with high affinity (KD 5.81 pM to 659.78 pM). In contrast, using single antigen FACS sorting, affinity was increased to the subtype used for sorting but with a decrease in affinity for other subtypes. None of the mAb variants showed any binding to other BoNT serotypes or to HEK293 or CHO cell lysates by flow cytometry, thus demonstrating stringent BoNT/F specificity. Multicolor FACS-mediated antibody library screening is thus proposed as a general method to generate multi-specific antibodies to protein subtypes such as toxins or species variants."
https://openalex.org/W4294124009,"This study investigated whether heat acclimation (HA) could improve rowing performance in temperate conditions in national-level rowers. Using a parallel-group design, eleven rowers (3 female, 8 male, age: 21±3 years, height: 182.3±6.8cm, mass: 79.2±9.0kg, [Formula: see text]: 61.4±5.1ml·kg·min-1) completed either a HA intervention (HEAT, n = 5) or acted as controls (CON, n = 6). The intervention replaced usual cross-training sessions and consisted of an hour of submaximal cycling or rowing ergometry in either 34±0°C for HEAT or 14±1°C for CON daily over two five-day blocks (10 sessions total), separated by 72h. Participants performed the '10+4' test that consists of 10-min submaximal rowing and a 4-min time-trial (TT) in temperate conditions (20±0°C) before and after the intervention. Heat acclimation following the 10-session intervention was evidenced by large significant (p<0.05) decreases in maximum tympanic temperature (d = -1.68) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (d = -2.26), and a large significant increase in sweat loss (d = 0.91). Large non-significant (p>0.05) decreases were seen in average tympanic temperature (d = -3.08) and average heart rate (d = -1.53) in HEAT from session 2 to session 10 of the intervention. Furthermore, a large significant increase was seen in plasma volume (d = 3.74), with large significant decreases in haemoglobin concentration (d = -1.78) and hematocrit (d = -12.9). Following the intervention, large non-significant increases in respiratory exchange ratio (d = 0.87) and blood lactate (d = 1.40) as well as a large non-significant decrease in RPE (d = -1.23) were seen in HEAT during the 10-min submaximal rowing.

This study suggests that a 10-session HA intervention may elicit HA in national-level rowers, with potential to improve 4-min TT performance in temperate conditions."

The objective of this study is to explore the predictors of modern contraceptive use among Pakistani men.This study is a secondary analysis of Pakistan demographic and health survey (PDHS) 2017-18 data. The study sample consists of 3691 ever married men aged 15-49 years. Pearson's chi square test and logistic regression were used to find out the determinants of modern contraceptive use among men. Data analysis was carried out in December, 2020.Findings of logistic regression showed that men who were uneducated (aOR = 0.746; 95% CI = 0.568-0.980), residing in Sindh (aOR = 0.748; 95% CI = 0.568-0.985), Baluchistan (aOR = 0.421; 95% CI = 0.280-0.632) or FATA (aOR 0.313; 95% CI 0.176-0.556) and those who belonged to the poorest wealth quintile (aOR = 0.569; 95% CI = 0.382-0.846) were less likely to use modern contraceptives. Men who did not wish for another child (aOR = 2.821; 95% CI = 2.305-3.451) had a higher likelihood of modern contraceptive use. Finally, men who thought that contraception was women's business (aOR = 0.670; 95% CI = 0.526-0.853) and those who did not discuss family planning with health worker (aOR = 0.715; 95% CI = 0.559-0.914) were also less likely to use modern contraceptives.Reproductive health education of males, targeting males, in addition to, females for addressing family planning issues and improvement of family planning facilities in socioeconomically under-privileged regions are suggested to improve contraceptive use among couples."
https://openalex.org/W4294043424,"Background Cervical cancer is an important area of action because of the mortality and morbidity of the disease, and the potential for effective prevention by screening. Involving the social support groups by health education improves cervical cancer screening and early detection of the disease in the community. In the ongoing efforts to strengthen cervical cancer prevention, control, and management, digital health and technology will have a significant role to play. Objective To assess the effectiveness of the mHealth-based intervention on cervical cancer preparedness among women social support groups. Materials &amp; methods A pre-post interventional study was conducted among women social support groups from lower socio-economic status, identified from the field practice area. Purposive sampling technique was employed. A Cervical Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) instrument was used to assess the cancer preparedness among the social support group women After taking inputs from the stakeholders’ mobile health application was developed. The mHealth educational intervention was given to 102 women. Both pre-and post-test questionnaires were administered through mHealth application to assess the change in knowledge after a gap of 1 month to 2 months. The data obtained was coded and entered into Microsoft Excel worksheet 2016 and was later imported and analyzed using SPSS version 22 (licensed to the Institute). The difference in median scores of knowledge and practice were interpreted as statistically significant at p value of &lt; 0.05. Results &amp; conclusion Before the intervention only 13 (12.7%) of them had heard about cervical cancer. There was a significant increase in the knowledge about warning signs &amp; symptoms, risk factors of cervical cancer, and HPV vaccination. Around 5% increase in Pap smear test uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4294043690,"In a long-lasting major disease outbreak such as that of COVID-19, the challenge for public health authorities is to keep people motivated and keen on following safety guidelines. In this study, a compartmental model with a heterogeneous transmission rate (based on awareness) is utilized to hypothesize about the public adoption of preventive guidelines. Three subsequent outbreaks in South Korea, Pakistan, and Japan were analyzed as case studies. The transmission, behavior change, and behavioral change ease rates of the disease were measured in these countries. The parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method with an additional identifiability analysis performed to determine the uniqueness of the estimated parameters for quantitatively comparing them during the first three waves of COVID-19. The mathematical analysis and simulation results show that individual responses had a significant effect on the outbreak. Individuals declining to follow the public health guidelines in Korea and Japan between the second and third waves contributed to making the third peak the highest of the three peaks. In Pakistan, however, individual responses to following public health guidelines were maintained between the second and third waves, resulting in the third peak being lower than the first, rather than being associated with the highest transmission rate. Thus, maintaining a high level of awareness is critical for containing the spread. Improvised public health campaigns are recommended to sustain individual attention and maintain a high level of awareness."
https://openalex.org/W4294044381,"Water shortages have always been the primary bottleneck for the healthy and sustainable development of the ecological environment on the Loess Plateau (LP). Proper water resource management requires knowledge of the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation frequency. This paper employed the gridded precipitation dataset obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Centre to present a spatially explicit characterization of precipitation frequencies in tandem with their return periods on the LP based on the L-moment method. The 60% and 80% of the mean annual precipitation from 1981 to 2010 were synonymous with severe and moderate droughts, respectively. Droughts occurred more frequently in the northwest than in the southeast of the LP. Moreover, the frequencies of moderate drought showed a slight difference throughout the area, while those of severe droughts demonstrated considerable differences between the northwestern arid zone and the southeastern semi-humid zone. The maps associated with various return periods of precipitation deficits can be used to produce drought risk maps together with drought vulnerability maps. These findings could also provide useful information for drought management, water resource management and the development of food security policies."
https://openalex.org/W4294044384,"Background Globally, complications due to preterm birth are the leading contributor to neonatal mortality, resulting in an estimated one million deaths annually. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) has been endorsed by the World Health Organisation as a low cost, safe, and effective intervention in reducing morbidity and mortality among preterm infants. The objective of this study was to describe the implementation of a KMC model among preterm infants and its impact on neonatal outcomes at a tertiary level hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods We conducted a prospective descriptive study using data collected from the KMC room at the University Teaching Hospital between January 2016 and September 2017. Mothers and government nurses were trained in KMC. We monitored skin-to-skin and breastfeeding practices, weight at admission, discharge, and length of admission. Results We enrolled 573 neonates into the study. Thirteen extremely low weight infants admitted to the KMC room had graduated to Group A (1,000g-1,499g) at discharge, with a median weight gain of 500g. Of the 419 very low weight neonates at admission, 290 remained in Group A while 129 improved to Group B (1,500g-2,499g), with a median weight gain of 280g. Among the 89 low weight neonates, 1 regressed to Group A, 77 remained in Group B, and 11 improved to Group C (≥2,500g), individually gaining a median of 100g. Of the seven normal weight neonates, 6 remained in Group C individually gaining a median of 100g, and 1 regressed to Group B. Among all infants enrolled, two (0.35%) died in the KMC room. Conclusions Based on the RE-AIM metrics, our results show that KMC is a feasible intervention that can improve neonatal outcomes among preterm infants in Zambia. The study findings show a promising, practical approach to scaling up KMC in Zambia. Trial registration The trial is registered under ClinicalTrials.gov under the following ID number: NCT03923023 ."
https://openalex.org/W4294044512,"Crucial to its success is that physicians enhance their competence in Lifestyle Medicine and take on their role as Health Advocates in Health Counseling and Promotion (HC&P). However, studies on patients' views of lifestyle counseling in clinical practice demonstrate that many patients neither perceived a need to adopt a healthy lifestyle nor having had any discussion with their physician about their lifestyle. This study is part of a participatory action research project focusing on identifying areas of improvement for health promotion in the practice of internists. Within this project, we interviewed 28 internists from six different subspecialties of an academic medical center in the Netherlands. This study aims to gain insight into how internists understand their role in HC&P by a qualitative analysis of their beliefs and attitudes in the interview data. Participants claimed that promoting a healthy lifestyle is important. However, they also reflected a whole system of beliefs that led to an ambivalent attitude toward their role in HC&P. We demonstrate that little belief in the success of HC&P nurtured ambivalence about the internists' role and their tasks and responsibilities. Ambivalence appeared to be reinforced by beliefs about the ability and motivation of patients, the internists' motivational skills, and the patient-doctor relationship, and by barriers such as lack of time and collaboration with General Practitioners. When participants viewed HC&P as a part of their treatment and believed patients were motivated, they were less ambivalent about their role in HC&P. Based on our data we developed a conceptual framework that may inform the development of the competences of the Health Advocate role of internists in education and practice."

More than 10% of children and adolescents in Iceland suffer from mental disorders, and rates of psychotropics use are very high. The aim of this novel observational longitudinal case-control study, “Meals, Microbiota and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents (MMM-Study)” is to contribute to the promotion of treatment options for children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders through identification of patterns that may affect the symptoms. All children and adolescents, 5–15 years referred to the outpatient clinic of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at The National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, for one year ( n≈1 50) will be invited to participate. There are two control groups, i.e., sex-matched children from the same postal area ( n≈1 50) and same parent siblings (full siblings) in the same household close in age +/- 3 years ( n &lt;150). A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Extensive population-based data of this quality has not been collected before, with collection repeated in three years’ time, contributing to the high scientific value. The MMM-study follows the “Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology” (STROBE) guidelines. Approval has been obtained from the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee, and the study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov. The study will contribute to an improved understanding of the links between diet, gut microbiota and mental health in children through good quality study design by collecting information on multiple components, and a longitudinal approach. Furthermore, the study creates knowledge on possibilities for targeted and more personalized dietary and lifestyle interventions in subgroups.

https://openalex.org/W4294045122,"The creation of global research partnerships is critical to produce shared knowledge for the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sustainability science promotes the coproduction of inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge, with the expectation that studies will be carried out through groups and truly collaborative networks. As a consequence, sustainability research, in particular that published in high impact journals, should lead the way in terms of ethical partnership in scientific collaboration. Here, we examined this issue through a quantitative analysis of the articles published in Nature Sustainability (300 papers by 2135 authors) and Nature (2994 papers by 46,817 authors) from January 2018 to February 2021. Focusing on these journals allowed us to test whether research published under the banner of sustainability science favoured a more equitable involvement of authors from countries belonging to different income categories, by using the journal Nature as a control. While the findings provide evidence of still insufficient involvement of Low-and-Low-Middle-Income-Countries (LLMICs) in Nature Sustainability publications, they also point to promising improvements in the involvement of such authors. Proportionally, there were 4.6 times more authors from LLMICs in Nature Sustainability than in Nature articles, and 68.8-100% of local Global South studies were conducted with host country scientists (reflecting the discouragement of parachute research practices), with local scientists participating in key research steps. We therefore provide evidence of the promising, yet still insufficient, involvement of low-income countries in top sustainability science publications and discuss ongoing initiatives to improve this."
https://openalex.org/W4294045135,"Body-size scaling of metabolic rate in animals is typically allometric, with mass exponents that vary to reflect differences in the physiological status of organisms of both endogenous and environmental origin. Regarding the intraspecific analysis of this relationship in bivalve molluscs, one important source of metabolic variation comes from the large inter-individual differences in growth performance characteristic of this group. In the present study, we aimed to address the association of growth rate differences recorded among individual mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) with variable levels of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) resulting in growth-dependent shift in size scaling relationships. SMR was measured in mussels of different sizes and allometric functions fitting SMR vs. body-mass relationships were compared both inter- and intra-individually. The results revealed a metabolic component (the overhead of growth) attributable to the differential costs of maintenance of feeding and digestion structures between fast and slow growers; these costs were estimated to amount to a 3% increase in SMR per unit of increment in the weight specific growth rate. Scaling exponents computed for intraindividual SMR vs body-mass relationships had a common value b = 0.79 (~ ¾); however, when metabolic effects caused by differential growth were discounted, this value declined to 0.67 (= ⅔), characteristic of surface dependent processes. This last value of the scaling exponent was also recorded for the interindividual relationships of both standard and routine metabolic rates (SMR and RMR) after long-lasting maintenance of mussels under optimal uniform conditions in the laboratory. The above results were interpreted based on the metabolic level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W4294126896,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses a major threat to the global public health. Importantly, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) still impedes the elimination of TB incidence since it has a substantial risk to develop active disease. A multi-stage subunit vaccine comprising active and latency antigens of Mtb has been raised as the promising vaccine to trigger immune protection against all stages of TB. Therefore, the discovery of new antigens that could trigger broad immune response is essential. While current development of TB vaccine mainly focuses on protective immunity mediated by adaptive immune response, the knowledge on triggering the innate immune response by antigens is still limited. We showed that recombinant dormancy-associated Mtb proteins Rv2659c and Rv1738 were recognized by human innate immune recognition molecules, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 by using HEK-Blue™ hTLR2/hTLR4 systems. We further demonstrated that these two proteins activated phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (Ser536) in the human CD14 + blood cells. We also investigated that these two proteins significantly induced level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α) which were mediated through TLR2 and TLR4 pathways in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). These findings suggest that proteins Rv2659c and Rv1738 stimulated innate immune response targeting TLR2 and TLR4 to produce inflammatory cytokines, and their benefits would be valuable for the development of an effective prophylactic tuberculosis vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W4294043692,"Crotalaria is a plant genus that is found all over the world, with over 700 species of herbs and shrubs. The species are potential alternative food and industrial crops due to their adaptability to different environments. Currently, information on the genetic diversity and population structure of these species is scanty. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a cost-effective high-throughput technique in diversity evaluation of plant species that have not been fully sequenced. In the current study, de novo GBS was used to characterize 80 Crotalaria accessions from five geographical regions in Kenya. A total of 9820 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were obtained after thinning and filtering, which were then used for the analysis of genetic diversity and population structure in Crotalaria. The proportion of SNPs with a minor allele frequency (maf) > = 0.05 was 45.08%, while the Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content was 0.45, from an average sequence depth of 455,909 reads per base. The transition vs transversion ratio was 1.81 and Heterozygosity (He) ranged between 0.01-0.07 in all the sites and 0.04 to 0.52 in the segregating sites. The mean Tajima's D value for the population was -0.094, suggesting an excess of rare alleles. The fixation index (Fst) between the different populations based on the Wright Fst (1943) ranged from 0.0119 to 0.066 for the Eastern-Western and Nairobi-Western populations. Model based techniques of population structure analysis including structure, k-means and cross-entropy depicted eight clusters in the study accessions. Non-model based techniques especially DAPC depicted poor population stratification. Correspondence Analysis (CA), Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) and phylogenetic analysis identified a moderate level of population stratification. Results from this study will help conservationists and breeders understand the genetic diversity of Crotalaria. The study also provides valuable information for genetic improvement of domesticated species."
https://openalex.org/W4294043697,"Although strategic coalition formation is traditionally modeled using cooperative game theory, behavioral game theorists have repeatedly shown that outcomes predicted by game theory are different from those generated by actual human behavior. To further explore these differences, in a cooperative game theory context, we experiment to compare the outcomes resulting from human participants' behavior to those generated by a cooperative game theory solution mechanism called the core partition. Our experiment uses an interactive simulation of a glove game, a particular type of cooperative game, to collect the participant's decision choices and their resultant outcomes. Two different glove games are considered, and the outputs from 62 trial games are analyzed. The experiment's outcomes show that core coalitions, which are coalitions in a core partition, are found in about 42% of games. Though this number may seem low, a trial's outcome is more complex than whether the human player finds a core coalition or not. Finding the core coalition depends on factors such as the other possible feasible solutions and the payoffs available from these solutions. These factors, and the complexity they generate, are discussed in the paper."
https://openalex.org/W4294044368,"Evidence concerning the effects of indicators of waterborne pathogens on healthcare systems is of importance for policymaking, future infrastructure considerations and healthcare planning. This paper examines the association between the detection of E . coli in water tests associated with drinking water supplies and the use of healthcare services by older people in Ireland. Uniquely, three sources of data are linked to conduct the analysis. Administrative records of E . coli exceedances recorded from routine water quality tests carried out by Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency are first linked to maps of water systems infrastructure in Ireland. Then, residential addresses of participants of The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA), a nationally representative survey of over 50-year-olds in Ireland, are linked to the water systems dataset which has the associated water quality monitoring information. Multivariate regression analysis estimates a greater incident rate ratio (IRR) of General Practitioner (GP) visits in the previous year where E . coli is detected in the water supply associated with an older person’s residence (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 1.118; [95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.019–1.227]), controlling for demographic and socio-economic factors, health insurance coverage, health, and health behaviours. Where E . coli is detected in water, a higher IRR is also estimated for visits to an Emergency Department (IRR: 1.292; [95% CI: 0.995–1.679]) and nights spent in hospital (IRR: 1.351 [95% CI: 1.004–1.818])."

To address this gap, we developed models based on Erdős-Rényi and a power law degree distribution that first incorporate the role of heterogeneity and connectivity and then can be expanded to make assumptions about demographic characteristics. Results demonstrate that variations in the number of connections of individuals within a population modify the impact of public health interventions such as lockdown or vaccination approaches. We conclude that the most effective strategy will vary depending on the underlying contact structure of individuals within a population and on timing of the interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4294044963,"Background There is increasing evidence of the need to consider advance care planning (ACP) for older adults who have been recently admitted to hospital as an emergency. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how to facilitate ACP following acute illness in later life. Aim/Objectives To explore the perceived impact of ACP on the lives of older persons aged 70+ who have been acutely admitted to hospital. Method Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with older adults aged 70+ who were admitted to hospital as an emergency. Thematic analysis was enhanced by dual coding and exploration of divergent views within an interdisciplinary team. Results Twenty participants were interviewed. Thematic analysis generated the following themes: (1) Bespoke planning to holistically support a sense of self, (2) ACP as a socio-cultural phenomenon advocating for older persons rights, (3) The role of personal relationships, (4) Navigating unfamiliar territory and (5) Harnessing resources. Conclusion These findings indicate that maintaining a sense of personal identity and protecting individuals’ wishes and rights during ACP is important to older adults who have been acutely unwell. Following emergency hospitalization, older persons believe that ACP must be supported by a network of relationships and resources, improving the likelihood of adequate preparation to navigate the uncertainties of future care in later life. Therefore, emergency hospitalization in later life, and the uncertainty that may follow, may provide a catalyst for patients, carers and healthcare professionals to leverage existing or create new relationships and target resources to enable ACP, in order to uphold older persons’ identity, rights and wishes following acute illness."
https://openalex.org/W4294045114,"Food production facilities are often routinely tested over time for the presence of foodborne pathogens (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ). Strains detected in a single sampling event can be classified as transient; positive findings of the same strain across multiple sampling events can be classified as resident pathogens. We analyzed whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 4,758 isolates ( L . monocytogenes = 3,685; Salmonella = 1,073) from environmental samples taken by FDA from 536 U.S. facilities. Our primary objective was to determine the frequency of transient or resident pathogens within food production facilities. Strains were defined as isolates from the same facility that are less than 50 SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) different from one another. Resident pathogens were defined as strains that had more than one isolate collected &gt;59 days apart and from the same facility. We found 1,076 strains (median = 1 and maximum = 21 strains per facility); 180 were resident pathogens, 659 were transient, and 237 came from facilities that had only been sampled once. As a result, 21% of strains (180/ 839) from facilities with positive findings and that were sampled multiple times were found to be resident pathogens; nearly 1 in 4 (23%) of L . monocytogenes strains were found to be resident pathogens compared to 1 in 6 (16%) of Salmonella strains. Our results emphasize the critical importance of preventing the colonization of food production environments by foodborne pathogens, since when colonization does occur, there is an appreciable chance it will become a resident pathogen that presents an ongoing potential to contaminate product."

This work aims to contribute to the understanding of differences in the speech encoding of infants and school-age children by assessing the effects of child development, in different phases of early childhood, on the encoding of speech sounds. There were 98 subjects of both sexes, aged from 1 day to 8 years and 9 months who participated in the study. All subjects underwent a Frequency Following Response (FFR) assessment. A regression and linear correlation showed the effects of age in the FFR components, i.e., significant decrease in the latency and increased amplitude of all FFR waves with age. An increase in the slope measure was also observed. Younger infants require more time and show less robust responses when encoding speech than their older counterparts, which were shown to have more stable and well-organized FFR responses."
https://openalex.org/W4294125454,"Objective To describe 4-year survival outcomes and assess the value of established and additional relevant variables to predict complete response (CR), four-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of CD20 positive AIDS-Related Lymphoma (ARL) treated with standard combination chemotherapy. Method We performed a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with CD20 positive ARL between 2006 and 2016. All patients over 12 years of age who received at least one cycle of combination chemotherapy with curative intent were included in the analysis. Variables assessed included the International Prognostic Index (IPI), age-adjusted-IPI, age, gender, B symptoms, extent of disease, functional performance status, CD4 cell count, viral load, concurrent ART with chemotherapy, rituximab inclusion, and number of chemotherapy cycles used. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for OS and PFS at 4 years were compared for IPI and aaIPI using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the effects of prognostic variables for patients achieving OS and PFS at 4 years and logistic regression for patients achieving CR. Results A total of 102 patients were included in the analysis. At year four of follow-up, the OS was 50% (n = 51) and PFS was 43% (n = 44). Attaining a CR and male gender were significantly associated with improved 4-year OS (p&lt;0.001 and p = 0.028 respectively) and PFS (p&lt;0.001 and 0.048 respectively). A viral load of &lt; 50 copies/ml was associated with a higher complete response rate (aOR 6.10 [95% CI 1.15, 24.04], p = 0.01). Six or more cycles of chemotherapy was superior to fewer cycles for both PFS (aHR 0.17 [95% CI 0.10, 0.29]) and OS (aHR 0.12 [95% CI 0.07, 0.22]) with p-value &lt; 0.001 for both PFS and OS. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates demonstrated the prognostic utility of the IPI and aaIP for OS (p = 0.002 and 0.030 respectively) and the IPI for PFS (p = 0.002). Conclusion This study is a first from a high prevalence HIV area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and confirms the utility of the internationally accepted prognostic scoring systems in predicting survival in CD20 positive ARL in the local population."
