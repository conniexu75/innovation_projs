Circulating miRNAs were recently identified as biomarkers for various physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify the circulating miRNA fingerprint of vulnerable coronary artery disease (CAD) and explore its potential as a novel biomarker for this disease. Methods and Results The Taqman low-density miRNA array and coexpression network analyses were used to identify distinct miRNA expression profiles in the plasma of patients with typical unstable angina (UA) and angiographically documented CAD (UA group, n = 13) compared to individuals with non-cardiac chest pain (control group, n = 13). Significantly elevated expression levels of miR-106b/25 cluster, miR-17/92a cluster, miR-21/590-5p family, miR-126*, and miR-451 were observed in UA patients compared to controls. These findings were validated by real-time PCR in another 45 UA patients, 31 stable angina patients, and 37 controls. In addition, miR-106b, miR-25, miR-92a, miR-21, miR-590-5p, miR-126* and miR-451 were upregulated in microparticles (MPs) isolated from the plasma of UA patients (n = 5) compared to controls (n = 5). Using flow cytometry and immunolabeling, we further found that Annexin V+ MPs were increased in the plasma samples of UA patients compared to controls, and the majority of the increased MPs in plasma were shown to be Annexin V+ CD31+ MPs. The findings suggest that Annexin V+ CD31+ MPs may contribute to the elevated expression of the selected miRNAs in the circulation of patients with vulnerable CAD. Conclusion The circulating miRNA signature, consisting of the miR-106b/25 cluster, miR-17/92a cluster, miR-21/590-5p family, miR-126* and miR-451, may be used as a novel biomarker for vulnerable CAD.

https://openalex.org/W2149200410,"Recent excavations in Level 4 at BK (Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) have yielded nine hominin teeth, a distal humerus fragment, a proximal radius with much of its shaft, a femur shaft, and a tibia shaft fragment (cataloged collectively as OH 80). Those elements identified more specifically than to simply Hominidae gen. et sp. indet are attributed to Paranthropus boisei. Before this study, incontrovertible P. boisei partial skeletons, for which postcranial remains occurred in association with taxonomically diagnostic craniodental remains, were unknown. Thus, OH 80 stands as the first unambiguous, dentally associated Paranthropus partial skeleton from East Africa. The morphology and size of its constituent parts suggest that the fossils derived from an extremely robust individual who, at 1.338±0.024 Ma (1 sigma), represents one of the most recent occurrences of Paranthropus before its extinction in East Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2092252270,"γ-Secretase complexes are involved in the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain. Therefore, γ-secretase has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease (AD). Targeting γ-secretase activity in AD requires the pharmacological dissociation of the processing of physiological relevant substrates and the generation of ""toxic"" Aβ. Previous reports suggest the differential targeting of γ-secretase complexes, based on their subunit composition, as a valid strategy. However, little is known about the biochemical properties of the different complexes, and key questions regarding their Aβ product profiles should be first addressed. Here, we expressed, purified, and analyzed, under the same conditions, the endopeptidase and carboxypeptidase-like activities of the four γ-secretase complexes present in humans. We find that the nature of the catalytic subunit in the complex affects both activities. Interestingly, PSEN2 complexes discriminate between the Aβ40 and Aβ38 production lines, indicating that Aβ generation in one or the other pathway can be dissociated. In contrast, the APH1 subunit mainly affects the carboxypeptidase-like activity, with APH1B complexes favoring the generation of longer Aβ peptides. In addition, we determined that expression of a single human γ-secretase complex in cell lines retains the intrinsic attributes of the protease while present in the membrane, providing validation for the in vitro studies. In conclusion, our data show that each γ-secretase complex produces a characteristic Aβ signature. The qualitative and quantitative differences between different γ-secretase complexes could be used to advance drug development in AD and other disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1977914294,"IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis. There are different pathologic biopsy-based scoring systems in use, but there is no consensus among nephrologists yet regarding the best classification method. Our aim was to test urine proteomics as a non-invasive method for classification of IgA nephropathy. This aim was pursued by discovering novel prognostic protein biomarkers in urine, and linking them to pathogenesis of the disease through known signaling and metabolic pathways. 13 urine samples of the patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy were analyzed via two proteomics approaches: nanoflow LC-MS/MS and GeLC-MS/MS. The results of label-free quantification were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, which could classify patients into two groups, broadly corresponding to the primary and advance stages. The proteome classification correlated well with biopsy-based scoring systems, especially endocapillary hypercellularity score of the Oxford’s classification. Differentially excreted candidate proteins were found as potential prognostic biomarkers: afamin, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-microgolbulin, hemopexin, apolipoprotein A-I, complement C3, vitamin D-binding protein, beta-2-microglobulin, and retinol-binding protein 4. Pathway analysis suggested impairment of Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM)-Receptor Interaction pathways as well as activation of complement and coagulation pathway in progression of IgA nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2128327754,"S-nitrosylation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) on the p65 subunit of the p50/p65 heterodimer inhibits NF-κB DNA binding activity. We have recently shown that p65 is constitutively S-nitrosylated in the lung and that LPS-induced injury elicits a decrease in SNO-p65 levels concomitant with NF-κB activation in the respiratory epithelium and initiation of the inflammatory response. Here, we demonstrate that TNFα-mediated activation of NF-κB in the respiratory epithelium similarly induces p65 denitrosylation. This process is mediated by the denitrosylase thioredoxin (Trx), which becomes activated upon cytokine-induced degradation of thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip). Similarly, inhibition of Trx activity in the lung attenuates LPS-induced SNO-p65 denitrosylation, NF-κB activation, and airway inflammation, supporting a pathophysiological role for this mechanism in lung injury. These data thus link stimulus-coupled activation of NF-κB to a specific, protein-targeted denitrosylation mechanism and further highlight the importance of S-nitrosylation in the regulation of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2156774360,"Speech processing inherently relies on the perception of specific, rapidly changing spectral and temporal acoustic features. Advanced acoustic perception is also integral to musical expertise, and accordingly several studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between musical training and superior processing of various aspects of speech. Speech and music appear to overlap in spectral and temporal features; however, it remains unclear which of these acoustic features, crucial for speech processing, are most closely associated with musical training. The present study examined the perceptual acuity of musicians to the acoustic components of speech necessary for intra-phonemic discrimination of synthetic syllables. We compared musicians and non-musicians on discrimination thresholds of three synthetic speech syllable continua that varied in their spectral and temporal discrimination demands, specifically voice onset time (VOT) and amplitude envelope cues in the temporal domain. Musicians demonstrated superior discrimination only for syllables that required resolution of temporal cues. Furthermore, performance on the temporal syllable continua positively correlated with the length and intensity of musical training. These findings support one potential mechanism by which musical training may selectively enhance speech perception, namely by reinforcing temporal acuity and/or perception of amplitude rise time, and implications for the translation of musical training to long-term linguistic abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2058004572,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by idiopathic dilation and systolic contractile dysfunction of the cardiac chambers. The present work aimed to study the alterations in gene expression of ion channels involved in cardiomyocyte function.Microarray profiling using the Affymetrix Human Gene® 1.0 ST array was performed using 17 RNA samples, 12 from DCM patients undergoing cardiac transplantation and 5 control donors (CNT). The analysis focused on 7 cardiac ion channel genes, since this category has not been previously studied in human DCM. SCN2B was upregulated, while KCNJ5, KCNJ8, CLIC2, CLCN3, CACNB2, and CACNA1C were downregulated. The RT-qPCR (21 DCM and 8 CNT samples) validated the gene expression of SCN2B (p < 0.0001), KCNJ5 (p < 0.05), KCNJ8 (p < 0.05), CLIC2 (p < 0.05), and CACNB2 (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we performed an IPA analysis and we found a functional relationship between the different ion channels studied in this work.This study shows a differential expression of ion channel genes involved in cardiac contraction in DCM that might partly underlie the changes in left ventricular function observed in these patients. These results could be the basis for new genetic therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1990224501,"Recognition and removal of DNA damages is essential for cellular and organismal viability. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the sole mechanism in humans for the repair of carcinogenic UV irradiation-induced photoproducts in the DNA, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. The broad substrate versatility of NER further includes, among others, various bulky DNA adducts. It has been proposed that the 5'-3' helicase XPD (xeroderma pigmentosum group D) protein plays a decisive role in damage verification. However, despite recent advances such as the identification of a DNA-binding channel and central pore in the protein, through which the DNA is threaded, as well as a dedicated lesion recognition pocket near the pore, the exact process of target site recognition and verification in eukaryotic NER still remained elusive. Our single molecule analysis by atomic force microscopy reveals for the first time that XPD utilizes different recognition strategies to verify structurally diverse lesions. Bulky fluorescein damage is preferentially detected on the translocated strand, whereas the opposite strand preference is observed for a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion. Both states, however, lead to similar conformational changes in the resulting specific complexes, indicating a merge to a ""final"" verification state, which may then trigger the recruitment of further NER proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2017795269,"Protein kinase R (PKR) functions in a plethora of cellular processes, including viral and cellular stress responses, by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2α. The minimum requirements for PKR function are homodimerization of its kinase and RNA-binding domains, and autophosphorylation at the residue Thr-446 in a flexible loop called the activation loop. We investigated the interdependence between dimerization and Thr-446 autophosphorylation using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system. We showed that an engineered PKR that bypassed the need for Thr-446 autophosphorylation (PKR(T446∼P)-bypass mutant) could function without a key residue (Asp-266 or Tyr-323) that is essential for PKR dimerization, suggesting that dimerization precedes and stimulates activation loop autophosphorylation. We also showed that the PKR(T446∼P)-bypass mutant was able to phosphorylate eIF2α even without its RNA-binding domains. These two significant findings reveal that PKR dimerization and activation loop autophosphorylation are mutually exclusive yet interdependent processes. Also, we provide evidence that Thr-446 autophosphorylation during PKR activation occurs in a cis mechanism following dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2051446253,"PI3K/Akt signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte death machinery, which can cause stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. Here, we report that apoptosis regulator through modulating IAP expression (ARIA), a recently identified transmembrane protein, regulates the cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling and thus modifies the progression of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy. ARIA is highly expressed in the mouse heart relative to other tissues, and it is also expressed in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. The stable expression of ARIA in H9c2 cardiac muscle cells increased the levels of membrane-associated PTEN and subsequently reduced the PI3K/Akt signaling and the downstream phosphorylation of Bad, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein. When challenged with DOX, ARIA-expressing H9c2 cells exhibited enhanced apoptosis, which was reversed by the siRNA-mediated silencing of Bad. ARIA-deficient mice exhibited normal heart morphology and function. However, DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction was significantly ameliorated in conjunction with reduced cardiomyocyte death and cardiac fibrosis in ARIA-deficient mice. Phosphorylation of Akt and Bad was substantially enhanced in the heart of ARIA-deficient mice even after treatment with DOX. Moreover, repressing the PI3K by cardiomyocyte-specific expression of dominant-negative PI3K (p110α) abolished the cardioprotective effects of ARIA deletion. Notably, targeted activation of ARIA in cardiomyocytes but not in endothelial cells reduced the cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling and exacerbated the DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies, therefore, revealed a previously undescribed mode of manipulating cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling by ARIA, thus identifying ARIA as an attractive new target for the prevention of stress-induced myocardial dysfunction.

Many aspects of cardiology are regulated by the PI3K/PTEN pathway, including cell survival, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial contractility, electrophysiology, and energy metabolism. PI3K is a lipid kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate, membrane phospholipids that recruit and activate 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), and Akt (5Morello F.

On the other hand, PTEN is a nonredundant, plasma membrane lipid phosphatase that converts the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate into the inactive phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate, functioning as an endogenous antagonist of PI3K (1Kishimoto H.

PTEN is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although its substrate phospholipids bind to the plasma membrane. Because PTEN needs to associate with membrane to antagonize PI3K, the subcellular localization of PTEN is a major determinant of PTEN activity (8Salmena L. Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P.

Although doxorubicin (DOX) is a powerful anticancer drug, fatal cardiotoxic effects are of concern over this drug and limit its use (9Singal P.K. Iliskovic N. Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.N.

The induction of free radical formation and subsequent oxidative stress is a primary cause of DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity (9Singal P.K. Iliskovic N. Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.N. Engl. J.

This DOX-induced oxidative stress activates apoptotic signaling pathways that lead to the cardiomyocyte death. The heart is very sensitive to myocyte death, and very low levels of myocyte apoptosis (23 myocytes/105 nuclei) were sufficient to cause lethal cardiomyopathy in mice (13Wencker D. Chandra M.

Members of the Bcl-2 family regulate apoptosis, and the balance between anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members largely determines whether cells undergo apoptosis (14Sprick M.R. Walczak H.

We recently identified a previously uncharacterized gene, termed ARIA, that is highly expressed in endothelial cells (EC) (24Ikeda K. Nakano R. Uraoka M. Nakagawa Y. Koide M. Katsume A. Minamino K.

Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8227-8232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ARIA significantly reduced EC apoptosis in association with enhanced Akt activity. In addition, ARIA modifies the PI3K/Akt signaling by interacting with PTEN in EC (25Koide M. Ikeda K. Akakabe Y. Kitamura Y. Ueyama T. Matoba S. Yamada H. Okigaki M. Matsubara H.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 9472-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ARIA is a membrane protein and binds to PTEN at its intracellular domain. Therefore, ARIA anchors PTEN to the plasma membrane, enhancing the membrane-association of PTEN, which results in enhanced antagonism to PI3K. In the current study we identified significant expression of ARIA in the heart and cardiomyocytes. We demonstrate the crucial role of ARIA in the regulation of cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling and cardiac function through the analysis of the DOX-induced cardiomyopathy model using genetically modified mice including ARIA-deficient (ARIA−/−), cardiac-specific ARIA transgenic (αMHC-ARIA-Tg), EC-specific ARIA transgenic (TIE2-ARIA-Tg), and cardiac-specific dominant negative PI3K (110α) transgenic (αMHC-dnPI3K-Tg) mice. Our data revealed a unique role of ARIA in the regulation of cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling, identifying ARIA as a novel target to manipulate this important signaling pathway in the heart. Antibodies for phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-Akt (Thr-308), total-Akt, phospho-Bad (Ser-136), total-Bad, total-PTEN, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The Na+/K+ ATPase antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against GAPDH and pancadherin were obtained from Millipore, whereas the FLAG tag antibody was obtained from Sigma. The antibody for ARIA was prepared as previously reported (24Ikeda K. Nakano R. Uraoka M. Nakagawa Y. Koide M. Katsume A. Minamino K. Yamada E. Yamada H. Quertermous T. Matsubara H.

Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and prepared as described previously (26Ogata T. Ueyama T. Isodono K. Tagawa M. Takehara N. Kawashima T. Harada K.

The culture medium was changed to serum-free medium after 24 h, and neonatal cardiomyocytes were cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h before use for experiments. Transfection of target genes into rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was performed using HVJ envelope (HVJ Envelope VECTOR Kit GenomONE-Neo: Ishihara Sangyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. H9c2 cells were retrovirally transfected with GFP or ARIA. Transfected cells were then selected by culturing in the medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. Individual stable cell lines were clonally isolated using a cloning cup. Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissues by using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was then synthesized by using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed with LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) and FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The expression levels of target genes were normalized to GAPDH expression. The sequences of all primers are shown in Table 1. To compare the expression levels of ARIA between cells of different species, primers were designed at the nucleotide regions with 100% homology between the species.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequence of primersMouse ARIAATGTCCTTCAGCCACAGAAGCACACCACGTTGATGTTCCTCATGGAGATGMouse and rat ARIAACATCAGAGTCAGTGCTAACTGTGGCTGCCATTGGCTGTGGAGCAGCTTTCAGRat and human ARIAGCTTCATTGTCATCCTGGTGGATTGGCTGTGGAGCAGCTTTCMouse Top2bAGAGAGATACGAAAGGGCGAGAGGTTAGGGCATTGTCTCCTCCAGCTGAAGTRat Top2bGTGGAAGCACAAGAACGAGAAGACATTTCTGCTGGCGTCTGCCTTCATGGCA18 SCCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCCGGTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATTGAPDHCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT Open table in a new tab H9c2 cells were treated with DOX for 24 h and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde.

In vivo cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL method using the CardioTacs kit (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were then quantified by counting the number of TUNEL-positive myocyte nuclei at 10 random fields per section and were expressed as a percentage of total myocyte nuclei.

Cells were homogenized gently on ice using a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 30 min using an Optima TLX centrifuge (Beckman) with the TLA 100.3 rotor. Pellets were lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and used as the membrane fraction. The supernatants were obtained as the cytosolic fraction. CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) was used to detect reactive oxygen species levels in H9c2 cells. Briefly, H9c2 cells were treated with DOX for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with CM-H2DCFDA at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then harvested, and the fluorescent intensity was measured using flow cytometry. Cross-sections of the heart were stained with isolectin GS-IB4 from Griffonias implicifolia labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) followed by detection under a fluorescence microscope. The capillary density was quantified by measuring the number of isolectin-IB4-positive cells in six random fields per section. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and then immunoblotting was performed as described previously (25Koide M. Ikeda K. Akakabe Y. Kitamura Y. Ueyama T. Matoba S.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 9472-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels were assessed using a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate mass ELISA kit (Echelon) following the non-radioactive lipid extraction protocol provided by the manufacturer. We generated transgenic mice that overexpressed ARIA in cardiomyocytes under control of the αMHC promoter (αMHC-ARIA-Tg) or in EC under control of the Tie2-promotor (TIE2-ARIA-Tg). The plasmids containing the αMHC and Tie2-promoters were kind gifts from Jeffrey Robbins (The Children's Hospital Research Foundation) and Thomas N. Sato (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan), respectively. The αMHC-dnPI3K (p110α)-Tg mice were a generous gift from Dr. Tetsuo Shioi (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan). Mice were propagated as heterozygous Tg animals by breeding with wild-type C57BL6/J mice. Cardiomyopathy was induced by weekly intraperitoneal injection of DOX at a dose of 3 mg/kg to cumulative levels of 15 mg/kg in male mice starting at 8–10 weeks of age. The control group was injected with PBS. All mice were sacrificed and analyzed two weeks after the last injection. The Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine approved all experimental protocols. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) for Bad was obtained from Dharmacon, and the negative control siRNA (scramble) was obtained from Ambion. Cells at ∼50% confluency were transfected with 25 nmol/liter siRNA by using Dharmafect (Dharmacon). The growth medium was replaced after 24 h, and cells were incubated for another 24 h before use. Echocardiography was performed 2 weeks after the last doxorubicin injection using a 30-MHz transducer (RMV 704; VisualSonics, Inc.) connected to an ultrasound system (Vevo 2100; VisualSonics). M-mode images were then recorded from parasternal short-axis images. Fractional shortening was calculated as [(LVDd − LVDs)/LVDd] × 100. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significances between two groups were determined by unpaired Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Comparisons between four or more groups were assessed for significance using non-repeated analysis of variance. When significant differences were detected, individual mean values were then compared using the Bonferroni's post hoc test. Probability values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We and others have reported that ARIA is predominantly expressed in ECs (24Ikeda K. Nakano R. Uraoka M. Nakagawa Y. Koide M. Katsume A. Minamino K. Yamada E. Yamada H. Quertermous T. Matsubara H.

When the tissue distribution of ARIA in mice was assessed, it was noticed that ARIA was highly expressed in the heart relative to other tissues including well vascularized tissues such as the liver and kidney (Fig. 1A). We, therefore, investigated the expression of ARIA in cardiomyocytes and found that isolated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes express ARIA at the levels comparable with those in ECs (Fig. 1B). In contrast, rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts and rat cardiac muscle cell line H9c2 demonstrated a modest and minimal expression of ARIA, respectively (Fig. 1B). To investigate the potential role of ARIA in the regulation of cardiomyocyte functions, we generated two lines of H9c2 cells that stably express ARIA at levels similar to those of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (H9c2/ARIA; Fig. 1, B–D). Because ARIA negatively regulates EC apoptosis, we first examined their susceptibility to apoptosis. When challenged with DOX, H9c2/ARIA cells exhibited reduced survival and increased apoptosis compared with control cells stably expressing GFP, but stable expression of ARIA did not enhance the oxidative stress (Fig. 1, E–H). This suggests that ARIA plays a role in the determination of stress-induced cardiomyocyte death in a cell-autonomous fashion. Because ARIA binds to PTEN and enhances its antagonism to PI3K in EC, we investigated whether ARIA modifies the PTEN/PI3K signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes. H9c2/ARIA cells showed enhanced levels of membrane-associated PTEN despite having expression levels of PTEN similar to control cells (Fig. 2A). Consistent with increased PTEN activity, H9c2/ARIA cells exhibited reduced membrane phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate contents compared with control cells (Fig. 2B). As a result, H9c2/ARIA cells showed reduced Akt phosphorylation compared with control cells (Fig. 2C). Bad is a downstream target of Akt, and its phosphorylation promotes binding to 14-3-3 and dissociation from anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, leading to the inhibition of its pro-apoptotic function (17del Peso L.

Pim kinases phosphorylate multiple sites on Bad and promote 14-3-3 binding and dissociation from Bcl-XL.BMC Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with reduced Akt activity, H9c2/ARIA cells showed reduced Bad phosphorylation and thus enhanced proapoptotic properties (Fig. 2C). Because the Akt/Bad axis is important for stress-induced cardiomyocyte death (12Chen B. Peng X. Pentassuglia L. Lim C.C. Sawyer D.B.

Res. 2008; 103: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we examined whether this pathway plays a significant role in the ARIA-mediated modification of cardiomyocyte death. Gene silencing of Bad was successfully achieved using siRNA (Fig. 2D). Silencing of Bad completely abolished the enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis of H9c2/ARIA cells, suggesting that ARIA regulates the cardiomyocyte death via modification of the Akt/Bad axis (Fig. 2, E–G). In addition, we explored whether ARIA modifies other Akt downstream targets than Bad. mTOR executes the most critical functions of Akt with regard to cell growth and proliferation (31Hay N. The Akt-mTOR tango and its relevance to cancer.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 179-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ARIA also reduced the phosphorylation of mTOR in H9c2 cells (Fig. 2H), suggesting that ARIA modifies the overall Akt activity in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we examined the effects of ARIA overexpression on myocyte death using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We confirmed the purity of isolated cardiomyocytes and successful transfection of GFP into cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3A). When apoptosis was induced by oxidative stress, cardiomyocytes overexpressing ARIA exhibited enhanced apoptosis compared with MOCK-control cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 3, B and C). Of note, proapoptotic effects of ARIA overexpression disappeared when cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 3D). These collectively reveal a previously undescribed pathway in the regulation of cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling by ARIA and suggest that this ARIA-mediated modification of PI3K/Akt signaling regulates the cardiomyocyte death. Consistent with the data above, genetic deletion of ARIA caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of Akt, Bad, and mTOR in the heart in vivo (Fig. 4A). There was no significant change in the heart weight and size between ARIA−/− and wild type (WT) mice (Table 2 and Fig. 4B). We next analyzed whether ARIA-mediated modification of cardiac PI3K/Akt signaling plays a role in the pathophysiology of myocardial death and heart failure in vivo by using DOX-induced cardiomyopathy model.TABLE 2Heart weight of WT or ARIA-deficient miceWT (n = 7)ARIA-KO (n = 7)Heart weight (mg)112 ± 5.7114 ± 17LV weight (mg)85.3 ± 5.585.4 ± 12Body weight (g)26.6 ± 1.127.6 ± 2.8Tibial length (mm)17.3 ± 0.2517.1 ± 0.46HW/BW (mg/g)4.20 ± 0.164.12 ± 0.37LVW/BW (mg/g)3.20 ± 0.203.09 ± 0.31HW/TL (mg/mm)6.47 ± 0.296.67 ± 1.0LVW/TL (mg/mm)4.93 ± 0.285.00 ± 0.73 Open table in a new tab Treatment with DOX induced a significant cardiac dysfunction accompanied by the ventricular wall thinning in WT mice (Table 3 and Fig. 4C).

https://openalex.org/W2001867695,"Structural alterations during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pose a substantial challenge to the mechanical response of cells and are supposed to be key parameters for an increased malignancy during metastasis. Herein, we report that during EMT, apical tension of the epithelial cell line NMuMG is controlled by cell-cell contacts and the architecture of the underlying actin structures reflecting the mechanistic interplay between cellular structure and mechanics. Using force spectroscopy we find that tension in NMuMG cells slightly increases 24 h after EMT induction, whereas upon reaching the final mesenchymal-like state characterized by a complete loss of intercellular junctions and a concerted down-regulation of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, the overall tension becomes similar to that of solitary adherent cells and fibroblasts. Interestingly, the contribution of the actin cytoskeleton on apical tension increases significantly upon EMT induction, most likely due to the formation of stable and highly contractile stress fibers which dominate the elastic properties of the cells after the transition. The structural alterations lead to the formation of single, highly motile cells rendering apical tension a good indicator for the cellular state during phenotype switching. In summary, our study paves the way towards a more profound understanding of cellular mechanics governing fundamental morphological programs such as the EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2088419169,"The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of obesity and related complications remain unclear. Wnt signaling plays an important role in preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. The expression of a Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), is increased in response to initial weight gain, then levels are reduced under conditions of extreme obesity in both humans and animals. Here we report that loss of Sfrp1 exacerbates weight gain, glucose homeostasis and inflammation in mice in response to diet induced obesity (DIO). Sfrp1-/- mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) exhibited an increase in body mass accompanied by increases in body fat percentage, visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and adipocyte size. Moreover, Sfrp1 deficiency increases the mRNA levels of key de novo lipid synthesis genes (Fasn, Acaca, Acly, Elovl, Scd1) and the transcription factors that regulate their expression (Lxr-α, Srebp1, Chreb, and Nr1h3) in WAT. Fasting glucose levels are elevated, glucose clearance is impaired, hepatic gluconeogenesis regulators are aberrantly upregulated (G6pc and Pck1), and glucose transporters are repressed (Slc2a2 and Slc2a4) in Sfrp1-/- mice fed a HFD. Additionally, we observed increased steatosis in the livers of Sfrp1-/- mice. When there is an expansion of adipose tissue there is a sustained inflammatory response accompanied by adipokine dysregulation, which leads to chronic subclinical inflammation. Thus, we assessed the inflammatory state of different tissues and revealed that Sfrp1-/- mice fed a HFD exhibited increased macrophage infiltration and expression of pro-inflammatory markers including IL-6, Nmnat, Tgf-β2, and SerpinE1. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of Sfrp1 is a critical factor required for maintaining appropriate cellular signaling in response to the onset of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2029246947,"ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) controls pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling events by promoting ectodomain shedding of cytokine precursors and cytokine receptors. Despite the well documented substrate repertoire of ADAM17, little is known about regulatory mechanisms, leading to substrate recognition and catalytic activation. Here we report a direct interaction of the acidophilic kinase Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as SNK) with the cytoplasmic portion of ADAM17 through the C-terminal noncatalytic region of PLK2 containing the Polo box domains. PLK2 activity leads to ADAM17 phosphorylation at serine 794, which represents a novel phosphorylation site. Activation of ADAM17 by PLK2 results in the release of pro-TNFα and TNF receptors from the cell surface, and pharmacological inhibition of PLK2 leads to down-regulation of LPS-induced ADAM17-mediated shedding on primary macrophages and dendritic cells. Importantly, PLK2 expression is up-regulated during inflammatory conditions increasing ADAM17-mediated proteolytic events. Our findings suggest a new role for PLK2 in the regulation of inflammatory diseases by modulating ADAM17 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1975526639,"Triglycerides and cholesterol are essential for life in most organisms. Triglycerides serve as the principal energy storage depot and, where vascular systems exist, as a means of energy transport. Cholesterol is essential for the functional integrity of all cellular membrane systems. The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of secretory lipoprotein production and de novo cholesterol synthesis, yet little is known about how these activities are coordinated with each other or with the activity of the COPII machinery, which transports endoplasmic reticulum cargo to the Golgi. The Sar1B component of this machinery is mutated in chylomicron retention disorder, indicating that this Sar1 isoform secures delivery of dietary lipids into the circulation. However, it is not known why some patients with chylomicron retention disorder develop hepatic steatosis, despite impaired intestinal fat malabsorption, and why very severe hypocholesterolemia develops in this condition. Here, we show that Sar1B also promotes hepatic apolipoprotein (apo) B lipoprotein secretion and that this promoting activity is coordinated with the processes regulating apoB expression and the transfer of triglycerides/cholesterol moieties onto this large lipid transport protein. We also show that although Sar1A antagonizes the lipoprotein secretion-promoting activity of Sar1B, both isoforms modulate the expression of genes encoding cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes and the synthesis of cholesterol de novo. These results not only establish that Sar1B promotes the secretion of hepatic lipids but also adds regulation of cholesterol synthesis to Sar1B's repertoire of transport functions."

The long-range allosteric communication between the ECD and the TMD is mediated by the interfacial region between the two domains. The ECD-TMD interface is characterized by three main players: a network of interfacial loops, lipid molecules closely associated with the TMD, and water vestibules that extend from the ECD-TMD interface into the protein core. The interfacial loops consist of β1-β2, β6-β7, and β8-β9 segments (within the ECD) and the pre-M1, M2-M3 linker and the C-terminal end of M4 (within the TMD) (Fig. 1, A and B). The functional consequences of mutational perturbations in these loops have been investigated extensively (Refs. 15Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

The strategic location of the ECD-TMD interface also makes this region a likely target for lipid-mediated effects on channel function (22daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E.

GLIC crystal structures also reveal associated lipid molecules, suggesting a tight interaction between the two (3Hilf R.J. Dutzler R.

The packing of helical bundles within the TMD supports distinct water pockets, referred to as the intrasubunit and intersubunit cavities. These water vestibules form the binding site for several allosteric ligands and therapeutic agents (11Nury H. Van Renterghem C. Weng Y. Tran A. Baaden M. Dufresne V. Changeux J.P. Sonner J.M.

Although these independent pieces of information point toward the indisputable role of the ECD-TMD region in allosteric mechanisms of gating and modulation, the mechanistic details of the interplay between each of these components are unknown. A comparison of GLIC and ELIC structures shows small differences in the relative positioning of their interfacial loops (Fig. 1A). Such small changes in conformation are unexpected, given the dramatic functional impact of perturbations in this region in other members of the family (Refs. 15Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

Interestingly, an overlap of GLIC structure with the nAChR model highlights large scale differences in the ECD-TMD interface between the two structures (Fig. 1B) despite a very similar M2 conformation (3Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Structure of a potentially open state of a proton-activated pentameric ligand-gated ion channel.Nature. 2009; 457: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 4Bocquet N. Nury H.

X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel in an apparently open conformation.Nature. 2009; 457: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, loops in the GLIC and ELIC crystal structures may be altered by the lack of a membrane environment. The dynamic nature of the interaction between these loops and water vestibules makes it difficult to draw direct conclusions about their gating motion. We showed recently that EPR spectroscopy, in combination with functional measurements, is a powerful approach to elucidate protein motions that govern key gating transitions in GLIC. Membrane-reconstituted GLIC undergoes rapid pH-dependent activation, followed by transitions to a stable desensitized state (9Velisetty P. Chakrapani S. Desensitization mechanism in prokaryotic ligand-gated ion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18467-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). EPR measurements under steady-state conditions, therefore, conveniently allow us to probe the two end-state conformations: the closed state and the desensitized state. Structurally, at the level of M2, this transition involves a major conformational change at the extracellular end of M2. This change involves an outward translational movement leading to an increase in the pore diameter, whereas the intracellular end remains relatively immobile. In addition, the polar residues in the middle of M2 may contribute to desensitization by moving closer and occluding ion permeation (28Velisetty P. Chalamalasetti S.V. Chakrapani S. Conformational transitions underlying pore opening and desensitization in membrane-embedded Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 36864-36872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the structural changes at the ECD and TMD interface during transition to the desensitized state. We analyze these findings in the light of available gating models on the basis of x-ray structures and electron micrographs. The GLIC gene cloned into a modified pET26b vector was expressed as a fusion construct with N-terminal maltose binding protein as described previously (3Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Structure of a potentially open state of a proton-activated pentameric ligand-gated ion channel.Nature. 2009; 457: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 4Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Delarue M. Corringer P.J. X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel in an apparently open conformation.Nature. 2009; 457: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells transformed with the construct were grown in terrific broth medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to A600 of 1.0. Cells were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 20 °C. Membranes were prepared by homogenizing the cells in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris base (pH 7.4)) with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Membranes were solubilized in buffer A using 40 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (Anatrace) at 4 °C. GLIC was purified by binding to amylose resin and eluting with 20 mm maltose. The maltose binding protein tag was cleaved with human rhinovirus 3C protease (GE Healthcare), and the GLIC protein was separated using size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 20/200 column (GE Healthcare). Electrophysiological measurements were made by patch clamp recordings in channel-reconstituted liposomes prepared as described earlier (9Velisetty P. Chakrapani S. Desensitization mechanism in prokaryotic ligand-gated ion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18467-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Macroscopic currents for Cys mutants in this study were made in the absence of a spin label. However, it is likely that gating kinetics are further altered in the presence of the spin label. Purified protein was reconstituted into preformed asolectin vesicles by diluting in reconstitution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0)). Detergent was removed by incubating the proteoliposome suspension with Biobeads (Bio-Rad). The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in reconstitution buffer. A drop of the proteoliposome was placed on a glass slide and dried overnight in a desiccator at 4 °C. The sample was then rehydrated with 20 μl of buffer, which yielded giant liposomes. GLIC was reconstituted in 1:20,000 protein:lipid (molar ratio) for macroscopic currents. Currents were measured using an inside-out patch clamp of proteoliposomes in symmetrical NaCl. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Recording pipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass, heat-polished to a resistance of 1.5–2 mΩ, and filled with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). Low pH was obtained using 10 mm sodium citrate buffer. Currents were elicited in response to pH jumps (8.0 to 2.5) using an RCS-200 fast solution exchanger (switch time, 2 ms) fed by gravity (Biologic). Currents were measured using Axopatch 200B, digitized at a 10-kHz sampling frequency, and analyzed using Clampfit 10.2. The native Cys (Cys-27) was mutated to Ser, and single Cys mutants in M2 were generated using the Cys-free construct (C27S) as the template. Purified protein was labeled with a methanethiosulfonate spin probe (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-3-yl) methyl methanethiosulfonate) (Toronto Research) at a 10:1 label:protein molar ratio. Mutants exhibiting dipolar coupling were underlabeled by protocols, as described previously (30Amadi S.T. Koteiche H.A. Mishra S. McHaourab H.S. Structure, dynamics, and substrate-induced conformational changes of the multidrug transporter EmrE in liposomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26710-26718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutants were labeled with a 0.5 molar excess of methanethiosulfonate label and incubated on ice for 30 min, after which a 20-fold molar excess of diamagnetic spin label (1-acetoxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methane thiosulfonate was added and incubated for 2 h. The labeled protein was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 20/200 column (GE Healthcare). Spin-labeled samples were reconstituted at a 1:3000 protein:lipid molar ratio in a mixture of asolectin, incubated with Biobeads, and centrifuged to obtain a pellet of the proteoliposomes. To determine the position of interfacial residues, a mixture of asolectin:DOGS-NTA[Ni(II)] lipids in a 3:1 molar ratio was used (31Gross A. Hubbell W.L. Identification of protein side chains near the membrane-aqueous interface: a site-directed spin labeling study of KcsA.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). EPR measurements were made for the closed and desensitized states at pH 8.0 and 2.5, respectively. The pH changes were made by equilibrating the liposomes at 42 °C with appropriate buffers in a water bath. The sample was centrifuged, and the process was repeated multiple times to ensure complete buffer exchange. Reversibility of structural changes was ensured by switching back to pH 8.0. Continuous wave EPR measurements were performed at room temperature on a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer equipped with a dielectric resonator and a gas-permeable TPX plastic capillary. First derivative absorption spectra were recorded at an incident microwave power of 2.0 milliwatt, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 1.0 gauss. Our analyses were centered on three types of dynamic EPR structural information (32Farahbakhsh Z.T. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Spin labeled cysteines as sensors for protein-lipid interaction and conformation in rhodopsin.Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Altenbach C. Froncisz W. Hemker R. McHaourab H. Hubbell W.L. Accessibility of nitroxide side chains. Absolute Heisenberg exchange rates from power saturation EPR.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2103-2112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The first is the mobility of the spin probe, calculated as the inverse of the central line width of the first derivative absorption spectra (ΔHo−1). This parameter is governed both by the local steric contacts in the immediate vicinity of the probe and by the flexibility of the backbone to which it is attached (34Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Motion of spin-labeled side chains in T4 lysozyme. Correlation with protein structure and dynamics.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). As the frequency of nitroxide rotational motion is reduced, as witnessed during the formation of tertiary or quaternary contacts, the ΔHo−1 value decreases for any particular motional geometry. On the contrary, structural motions leading to an increase in the freedom of movement of the probe is reflected as an increase in ΔHo−1. The second is the proximity between intersubunit spins, estimated from amplitudes of the EPR signal. The spectral line shapes and the amplitudes of the signal are affected by the extent of through-space, short-range, spin-spin dipolar coupling between spin labels within the multimeric protein. The third is spin probe solvent accessibility, evaluated by collisional relaxation methods. Here, nonpolar molecular oxygen (ΠO2) serves as a contrast agent to evaluate membrane accessibility, whereas polar Ni(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid (ΠNiEdda) reports the extent of aqueous exposure (31Gross A.

Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The accessibility to NiEdda (50 mm) for the desensitized state was measured at pH 3.0 instead of 2.5 because of the instability of the complex at very acidic pH. The accessibility parameter (Π) is estimated from power saturation experiments in which the vertical peak-to-peak amplitude of the central line of the first derivative EPR spectra is measured as a function of increasing incident microwave power (32Farahbakhsh Z.T. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Spin labeled cysteines as sensors for protein-lipid interaction and conformation in rhodopsin.Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Single Cys mutations (on a Cys-free background, C27S) were generated along the entire length of β1-β2, β4-β5, β6-β7, and β8-β9 loops; the pre-M1 segment; the M2-M3 linker; and the C-terminal end of M4. The vast majority of Cys mutations (69 mutants) were well tolerated and did not alter protein folding, the oligomeric state, or the hydrodynamic property of the channel. All of the analyzed mutants in this study were stable, monodisperse pentameric populations with similar profiles to the WT on size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). Functional activities of the Cys mutations at several positions in each of the loops were confirmed by patch clamp measurements in proteoliposomes (Fig. 2B). As is expected of perturbations to key gating regions, some of the mutants altered the kinetics of activation and desensitization. Because our EPR measurements were carried out under steady-state conditions, they are less likely to be impacted by differences in the fast transitions. The Cys mutants were reacted with a thiol-specific nitroxide spin probe (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-3-yl) methyl methanethiosulfonate) and reconstituted in asolectin liposomes. EPR environmental parameters were determined for both the closed and pH-activated desensitized conformations (referred to as the desensitized state from here on). Changes in probe dynamics were evaluated from line shape differences (the inverse of the width of the central resonant line, ΔHo−1), and the accessibility to either membrane soluble molecular O2 (ΠO2) or water-soluble NiEdda (ΠNiEdda) was determined from power saturation experiments (31Gross A.

https://openalex.org/W2087506675,"Introduction A reliable diagnostic biomarker of iron status is required for severely anemic children living in malarious areas because presumptive treatment with iron may increase their infection risk if they are not iron deficient. Current biomarkers are limited because they are altered by host inflammation. In this study hepcidin concentrations were assessed in severely anemic children living in a highly malarious area of Malawi and evaluated against bone marrow iron in order to determine the usefulness of hepcidin as a point of care test. Methods 207 severely anemic children were assessed for levels of hepcidin, ferritin, serum transferrin receptor, erythropoietin, hematological indices, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, malaria parasites and HIV infection. Deficiency of bone marrow iron stores was graded and erythroblast iron incorporation estimated. Interaction of covariates was assessed by structural-equation-modeling. Results and Conclusion Hepcidin was a poor predictor of bone marrow iron deficiency (sensitivity 66.7%; specificity 48.5%), and of iron incorporation (sensitivity 54.2%; specificity 61.8%), and therefore would have limitations as a point of care test in this category of children. As upregulation of hepcidin by inflammation and iron status was blunted by erythropoietin in this population, enhanced iron absorption through the low hepcidin values may increase infection risk. Current recommendations to treat all severely anemic children living in malarious areas with iron should therefore be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2071959428,"We recently identified a series of mitotically acting piperazine-based compounds that potently increase the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to apoptotic ligands. Here we describe a structure-activity relationship study on this compound class and identify a highly active derivative ((4-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)(2-ethoxyphenyl)methanone), referred to as AK301, the activity of which is governed by the positioning of functional groups on the phenyl and benzoyl rings. AK301 induced mitotic arrest in HT29 human colon cancer cells with an ED50 of ≈115 nm. Although AK301 inhibited growth of normal lung fibroblast cells, mitotic arrest was more pronounced in the colon cancer cells (50% versus 10%). Cells arrested by AK301 showed the formation of multiple microtubule organizing centers with Aurora kinase A and γ-tubulin. Employing in vitro and in vivo assays, tubulin polymerization was found to be slowed (but not abolished) by AK301. In silico molecular docking suggests that AK301 binds to the colchicine-binding domain on β-tubulin, but in a novel orientation. Cells arrested by AK301 expressed elevated levels of TNFR1 on their surface and more readily activated caspases-8, -9, and -3 in the presence of TNF. Relative to other microtubule destabilizers, AK301 was the most active TNF-sensitizing agent and also stimulated Fas- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In summary, we report a new class of mitosis-targeting agents that effectively sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic ligands. These compounds should help illuminate the role of microtubules in regulating apoptotic ligand sensitivity and may ultimately be useful for developing agents that augment the anti-cancer activities of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2076855339,"Vinculin localizes to membrane adhesion junctions in smooth muscle tissues, where its head domain binds to talin and its tail domain binds to filamentous actin, thus linking actin filaments to the extracellular matrix. Vinculin can assume a closed conformation, in which the head and tail domains bind to each other and mask the binding sites for actin and talin, and an open activated conformation that exposes the binding sites for talin and actin. Acetylcholine stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle tissues induces the recruitment of vinculin to the cell membrane and its interaction with talin and actin, which is required for active tension development. Vinculin phosphorylation at Tyr(1065) on its C terminus increases concurrently with tension development in tracheal smooth muscle tissues. In the present study, the role of vinculin phosphorylation at Tyr(1065) in regulating the conformation and function of vinculin during airway smooth muscle contraction was evaluated. Vinculin constructs with point mutations at Tyr(1065) (vinculin Y1065F and vinculin Y1065E) and vinculin conformation-sensitive FRET probes were expressed in smooth muscle tissues to determine how Tyr(1065) phosphorylation affects smooth muscle contraction and the conformation and cellular functions of vinculin. The results show that vinculin phosphorylation at tyrosine 1065 is required for normal tension generation in airway smooth muscle during contractile stimulation and that Tyr(1065) phosphorylation regulates the conformation and scaffolding activity of the vinculin molecule. We conclude that the phosphorylation of vinculin at tyrosine 1065 provides a mechanism for regulating the function of vinculin in airway smooth muscle in response to contractile stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2093308768,"Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein expression is closely related to the progression of human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the according context of a signaling pathway for PLZF to suppress prostate tumorigenesis remains greatly unknown. Here we report that PLZF is a downstream mediator of the PTEN signaling pathway in PCa. We found that PLZF expression is closely correlated with PTEN expression in a cohort of prostate cancer specimens. Interestingly, both PTEN rescue and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 treatment increase the PLZF expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Further, luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate that FOXO3a, a transcriptional factor phosphorylated by PI3K/AKT, could directly bind to the promoter of PLZF gene. These results indicate that PTEN regulates PLZF expression by AKT/FOXO3a. Moreover, our animal experiments also demonstrate that PLZF is capable of inhibiting prostate tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, our study defines a PTEN/PLZF pathway and would shed new lights for developing therapeutic strategy of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1968622224,"Objective This study systematically investigated the effect of chronic mild stress and response to antidepressant treatment in the lateral habenula at the whole genome level. Methods Rat whole genome expression chips (Affymetrix) were used to detect gene expression regulations in the lateral habenula of rats subjected to chronic mild stress (mild stressors exchanged twice a day for 8 weeks). Some rats received antidepressant treatment during fifth to eights week of CMS. The lateral habenula gene expression profile was studied through the gene ontology and signal pathway analyses using bioinformatics. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray results and determine the expression of the Fcrla, Eif3k, Sec3l1, Ubr5, Abca8a, Ankrd49, Cyp2j10, Frs3, Syn2, and Znf503 genes in the lateral habenula tissue. Results In particular we found that stress and antidepressant treatment affected intracellular cascades like growth factor receptor signaling, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, and Wnt signaling – processes involved in the neuroplastic changes observed during the progression of depression and antidepressant treatment. Conclusion The present study suggests an important role of the lateral habenula in the development of depression-like conditions and correlates to previous studies demonstrating a significant role of the lateral habenula in depressive-like conditions and antidepressant treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2031939272,"The chemokine Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are widely used indicators of glial activation and neuroinflammation and are up-regulated in many brain disorders. These inflammatory mediators have been widely studied in rodent models of brain disorders, but less work has been undertaken using human brain cells. In this study we investigate the regulation of HLA and IP-10, as well as other cytokines and chemokines, in microglia, astrocytes, pericytes, and meningeal fibroblasts derived from biopsy and autopsy adult human brain, using immunocytochemistry and a Cytometric Bead Array. Interferonγ (IFNγ) increased microglial HLA expression, but contrary to data in rodents, the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) did not inhibit this increase in HLA, nor did TGFβ1 affect basal microglial HLA expression or IFNγ-induced astrocytic HLA expression. In contrast, IFNγ-induced and basal microglial HLA expression, but not IFNγ-induced astrocytic HLA expression, were strongly inhibited by macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). IFNγ also strongly induced HLA expression in pericytes and meningeal fibroblasts, which do not basally express HLA, and this induction was completely blocked by TGFβ1, but not affected by M-CSF. In contrast, TGFβ1 did not block the IFNγ-induced increase in IP-10 in pericytes and meningeal fibroblasts. These results show that IFNγ, TGFβ1 and M-CSF have species- and cell type-specific effects on human brain cells that may have implications for their roles in adult human brain inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2054066367,"The complement system can be activated spontaneously for immune surveillance or induced to clear invading pathogens, in which the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) plays a critical role. CD59 is the sole membrane complement regulatory protein (mCRP) that restricts MAC assembly. CD59, therefore, protects innocent host cells from attacks by the complement system, and host cells require the constitutive and inducible expression of CD59 to protect themselves from deleterious destruction by complement. However, the mechanisms that underlie CD59 regulation remain largely unknown. In this study we demonstrate that the widely expressed transcription factor Sp1 may regulate the constitutive expression of CD59, whereas CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 bridge NF-κB and CREB, which surprisingly functions as an enhancer-binding protein to induce the up-regulation of CD59 during in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered complement activation, thus conferring host defense against further MAC-mediated destruction. Moreover, individual treatment with LPS, TNF-α, and the complement activation products (sublytic MAC (SC5b-9) and C5a) could increase the expression of CD59 mainly by activating NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways. Together, our findings identify a novel gene regulation mechanism involving CBP/p300, NF-κB, and CREB; this mechanism suggests potential drug targets for controlling various complement-related human diseases."

We employed combined proteomic technologies including mass spectrometry and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification peptide tagging to analyze protein profiles of surgically resected human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues. We identified a protein, dihydropyrimidinase-like 3, as highly expressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues as well as pancreatic cancer cell lines. Characterization of the roles of dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 in relation to cancer cell adhesion and migration in vitro, and metastasis in vivo was performed using a series of functional analyses, including those employing multiple reaction monitoring proteomic analysis. Furthermore, dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 was found to interact with Ezrin, which has important roles in cell adhesion, motility, and invasion, while that interaction promoted stabilization of an adhesion complex consisting of Ezrin, c-Src, focal adhesion kinase, and Talin1. We also found that exogenous expression of dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 induced activating phosphorylation of Ezrin and c-Src, leading to up-regulation of the signaling pathway. Taken together, the present results indicate successful application of combined proteomic approaches to identify a novel key player, dihydropyrimidinase-like 3, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis, which may serve as an important biomarker and/or drug target to improve therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1998184476,"Although the asymmetry in the upward and downward bending of insect wings is well known, the structural origin of this asymmetry is not yet clearly understood. Some researchers have suggested that based on experimental results, the bending asymmetry of insect wings appears to be a consequence of the camber inherent in the wings. Although an experimental approach can reveal this phenomenon, another method is required to reveal the underlying theory behind the experimental results. The finite element method (FEM) is a powerful tool for evaluating experimental measurements and is useful for studying the bending asymmetry of insect wings. Therefore, in this study, the asymmetric bending of the Allomyrina dichotoma beetle's hind wing was investigated through FEM analyses rather than through an experimental approach. The results demonstrated that both the stressed stiffening of the membrane and the camber of the wing affect the bending asymmetry of insect wings. In particular, the chordwise camber increased the rigidity of the wing when a load was applied to the ventral side, while the spanwise camber increased the rigidity of the wing when a load was applied to the dorsal side. These results provide an appropriate explanation of the mechanical behavior of cambered insect wings, including the bending asymmetry behavior, and suggest an appropriate approach for analyzing the structural behavior of insect wings."
https://openalex.org/W2001001316,"Background General practitioners (GPs) have a key role to play in suicide prevention, but the rates at which they question patients with depression about suicidal thoughts and plans are rather low. Little is known about GPs' characteristics associated with such inquiries. Our objectives were to describe GPs' attitudes, perceived barriers, and self-reported practices in this questioning of these patients and to analyze factors associated with these practices. Methodology This cross-sectional survey was conducted among participants in a panel of randomly selected French GPs (1249/1431 participated: 87.3%). GPs were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire covering their professional and personal characteristics, attitudes, and practices in exploring the suicide risk of their patients with depression. We built a suicide inquiry score by summing the responses to 5 items and used a multiple linear regression analysis to explore the characteristics associated with this score. Principal Findings Most GPs reported inquiring about the presence of suicidal ideation often or very often; less than 30% reported that they frequently explored signs of a specific suicide plan. The mean suicide inquiry score was 12.4 (SD, 2.9; range, 5–20). False ideas, such as thinking that patients who report suicidal ideas do not often commit suicide, were frequent (42.3%). Previous continuing medical education on suicide, participation in a formal mental health network, and patients who committed suicide in the past 5 years were associated with a higher score. Reluctance to question patients about suicide and perception of insufficient skill were associated with a lower score. Conclusions/Significance This study showed great variability in French GPs' practices in exploring suicide risk in patients with depression. Interventions aiming at improving GPs' initial training and continuing medical education in suicide and/or depression, and their collaboration with mental health specialists should be developed, and their impacts assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2023947090,"Estimation of variance components by Monte Carlo (MC) expectation maximization (EM) restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is computationally efficient for large data sets and complex linear mixed effects models. However, efficiency may be lost due to the need for a large number of iterations of the EM algorithm. To decrease the computing time we explored the use of faster converging Newton-type algorithms within MC REML implementations. The implemented algorithms were: MC Newton-Raphson (NR), where the information matrix was generated via sampling; MC average information(AI), where the information was computed as an average of observed and expected information; and MC Broyden's method, where the zero of the gradient was searched using a quasi-Newton-type algorithm. Performance of these algorithms was evaluated using simulated data. The final estimates were in good agreement with corresponding analytical ones. MC NR REML and MC AI REML enhanced convergence compared to MC EM REML and gave standard errors for the estimates as a by-product. MC NR REML required a larger number of MC samples, while each MC AI REML iteration demanded extra solving of mixed model equations by the number of parameters to be estimated. MC Broyden's method required the largest number of MC samples with our small data and did not give standard errors for the parameters directly. We studied the performance of three different convergence criteria for the MC AI REML algorithm. Our results indicate the importance of defining a suitable convergence criterion and critical value in order to obtain an efficient Newton-type method utilizing a MC algorithm. Overall, use of a MC algorithm with Newton-type methods proved feasible and the results encourage testing of these methods with different kinds of large-scale problem settings."
https://openalex.org/W2036583370,"Mammalian haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type phosphatases are an emerging family of phosphatases with important functions in physiology and disease, yet little is known about the basis of their substrate specificity. Here, we characterize a previously unexplored HAD family member (gene annotation, phosphoglycolate phosphatase), which we termed AUM, for aspartate-based, ubiquitous, Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatase. AUM is a tyrosine-specific paralog of the serine/threonine-specific protein and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-directed HAD phosphatase chronophin. Comparative evolutionary and biochemical analyses reveal that a single, differently conserved residue in the cap domain of either AUM or chronophin is crucial for phosphatase specificity. We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the AUM cap fused to the catalytic core of chronophin to 2.65 Å resolution and present a detailed view of the catalytic clefts of AUM and chronophin that explains their substrate preferences. Our findings identify a small number of cap domain residues that encode the different substrate specificities of AUM and chronophin."
https://openalex.org/W1974368306,"Bone morphogenetic protein receptor I B (BMPR1B) is a transmembrane receptor mediating TGF-β signal transduction. Recent studies indicate a tumor suppressor role for BMPR1B in ovarian cancer. Polymorphism at BMPR1B 3'UTR within the miR-125b binding site alters its binding affinity toward the miRNA, which may result in insufficient post-transcriptional repression.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1970801, rs1434536, and rs11097457 near the miR-125b binding site in BMPR1B were genotyped by Taqman assay on 193 endometriosis patients and 202 healthy controls. BMPR1B and CA125 levels in ectopic endometrial tissues were evaluated by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized to verify regulatory roles of BMPR1B 3'UTR with allelic variants of rs1434536 in a cell line model. Cell proliferation and migration were recorded, while expression of BMPR1B, CA125, glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR) and IL-1β were measured by quantitative PCR in endometrial cells transfected with wild-type or mutated miR-125b.This study found two endometriosis-associated SNPs, rs1434536 (P = 0.010) and rs1970801 (P = 0.0087), located within and next to a miR-125b binding site on BMPR1B. Interestingly, patients with homozygous variant alleles at rs1434536 showed significantly lower serum CA125 levels. Immunohistochemistry staining further confirmed inverse correlation between BMPR1B and CA125 levels in three rs1434536 genotypes. Cell assays demonstrated the variant allele of rs1434536 up-regulating BMPR1B at both mRNA and protein levels, which negatively correlated with CA125 and IL-1β levels. Disruption of the binding between miR-125b and BMPR1B hampered abnormal cell proliferation.SNPs of BMPR1B within and next to the miR-125b binding site manifested strong correlation with endometriosis development in a Taiwanese cohort. Disrupting the binding of miR-125b toward BMPR1B would increase protein expression, diminishing abnormal cell proliferation as well as serum and cellular CA125 levels. Genetic variation at the miR-125b binding site may play functional roles to protect against endometriosis progression."
https://openalex.org/W2052410731,"Dendritic cells (DCs) constitute an attractive target for specific delivery of nanovaccines for immunotherapeutic applications. Here we tested nano-sized dextran (DEX) particles to serve as a DC-addressing nanocarrier platform. Non-functionalized DEX particles had no immunomodulatory effect on bone marrow (BM)-derived murine DCs in vitro. However, when adsorbed with ovalbumine (OVA), DEX particles were efficiently engulfed by BM-DCs in a mannose receptor-dependent manner. A DEX-based nanovaccine containing OVA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a DC stimulus induced strong OVA peptide-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation both in vitro and upon systemic application in mice, as well as a robust OVA-specific humoral immune response (IgG1>IgG2a) in vivo. Accordingly, this nanovaccine also raised both a more pronounced delayed-type hypersensitivity response and a stronger induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells than obtained upon administration of OVA and LPS in soluble form. Therefore, DEX-based nanoparticles constitute a potent, versatile and easy to prepare nanovaccine platform for immunotherapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2115460243,"To form extracellular aggregates, amyloidogenic proteins bypass the intracellular quality control, which normally targets unfolded/aggregated polypeptides. Human D76N β2-microglobulin (β2m) variant is the prototype of unstable and amyloidogenic protein that forms abundant extracellular fibrillar deposits. Here we focus on the role of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) in the intracellular stabilization of D76N β2m. Using biophysical and structural approaches, we show that the MHCI containing D76N β2m (MHCI76) displays stability, dissociation patterns, and crystal structure comparable with those of the MHCI with wild type β2m. Conversely, limited proteolysis experiments show a reduced protease susceptibility for D76N β2m within the MHCI76 as compared with the free variant, suggesting that the MHCI has a chaperone-like activity in preventing D76N β2m degradation within the cell. Accordingly, D76N β2m is normally assembled in the MHCI and circulates as free plasma species in a transgenic mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W1983944684,"Pancreastatin (PST), a chromogranin A-derived peptide, is a potent physiological inhibitor of glucose-induced insulin secretion. PST also triggers glycogenolysis in liver and reduces glucose uptake in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Here, we probed for genetic variations in PST sequence and identified two variants within its functionally important carboxyl terminus domain: E287K and G297S. To understand functional implications of these amino acid substitutions, we tested the effects of wild-type (PST-WT), PST-287K, and PST-297S peptides on various cellular processes/events. The rank order of efficacy to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was: PST-297S > PST-287K > PST-WT. The PST peptides also displayed the same order of efficacy for enhancing intracellular nitric oxide and Ca(2+) levels in various cell types. In addition, PST peptides activated gluconeogenic genes in the following order: PST-297S ≈ PST-287K > PST-WT. Consistent with these in vitro results, the common PST variant allele Ser-297 was associated with significantly higher (by ∼17 mg/dl, as compared with the wild-type Gly-297 allele) plasma glucose level in our study population (n = 410). Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations predicted the following rank order of α-helical content: PST-297S > PST-287K > PST-WT. Corroboratively, circular dichroism analysis of PST peptides revealed significant differences in global structures (e.g. the order of propensity to form α-helix was: PST-297S ≈ PST-287K > PST-WT). This study provides a molecular basis for enhanced potencies/efficacies of human PST variants (likely to occur in ∼300 million people worldwide) and has quantitative implications for inter-individual variations in glucose/insulin homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2019375685,"The C terminus of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is important for G protein-coupling and activation; in addition, sorting motifs have been identified in the C termini of several GPCRs that facilitate correct trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. The C terminus of the GPCR TGR5 lacks any known sorting motif such that other factors must determine its trafficking. Here, we investigate deletion and substitution variants of the membrane-proximal C terminus of TGR5 with respect to plasma membrane localization and function using immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and luciferase assays. Peptides of the membrane-proximal C-terminal variants are subjected to molecular dynamics simulations and analyzed with respect to their secondary structure. Our results reveal that TGR5 plasma membrane localization and responsiveness to extracellular ligands is fostered by a long (≥ 9 residues) α-helical stretch at the C terminus, whereas the presence of β-strands or only a short α-helical stretch leads to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and a loss of function.

Based on the naturally occurring TGR5 truncation mutation Q296X and guided by secondary structure predictions from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we generated further deletion and substitution variants within the membrane-proximal C terminus to identify the amino acid motifs/structural determinants that facilitate PM localization of this bile acid receptor. Using these variants and three chimeras of TGR5 with the membrane proximal C terminus of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1), or the κ-type opioid receptor (κOR), we demonstrate that the formation of a membrane-proximal α-helix (helix 8) is essential for anterograde trafficking of TGR5 from the ER to the PM and thus for receptor function.

Here we report that the nuclear import factor Srp1 (also known as importin α or karyopherin α) is required for ubiquitin-independent cotranslational degradation of the transcription factor Rpn4. We further demonstrate that cotranslational protein degradation is generally impaired in the srp1–49 mutant. Srp1 binds nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome. The association of proteasomes with polysomes is weakened in srp1–49. The interaction between Srp1 and the proteasome is mediated by Sts1, a multicopy suppressor of srp1–49. The srp1–49 and sts1–2 mutants are hypersensitive to stressors that promote protein misfolding, underscoring the physiological function of Srp1 and Sts1 in degradation of misfolded nascent polypeptides.

Objectives We determined if the presence of an IPT register was associated with an increase in the number of child contacts identified per infectious case and the proportion of identified children who were started on IPT. Design We reviewed routine programme data on IPT delivery to children during two time periods (May 2008–October 2008 and May 2011–October 2011), before and after the implementation of an IPT register used by routine clinic personnel. Results Adult TB case demographic and clinical characteristics from the two observation periods were similar. During the post-register period, more child contacts per adult case were identified (0.7 (54 children) vs. 0.3 (24 children)), more of the identified children were started on IPT (54 vs. 4) and 37% of those who started, completed six months of treatment compared to the pre-register period where no adherence information was recorded. Conclusions After pilot implementation of an IPT register, documented identification of child contacts, IPT initiation and IPT adherence documentation in TB exposed children was improved. Our findings support further exploration of the potential impact of using standardised IPT recording and reporting in routine clinics in high-burden TB settings to improve TB prevention efforts targeted at young children. Future efforts to improve IPT delivery should be systematic and comprehensive in order to support a change in current operational IPT delivery practices in TB programs."
https://openalex.org/W2130768139,"Substantial effort in recent years has been devoted to analyzing data based large-scale biological networks, which provide valuable insight into the topologies of complex biological networks but are rarely context specific and cannot be used to predict the responses of cell signaling proteins to specific ligands or compounds. In this work, we proposed a novel strategy to investigate kinase inhibitor induced pathway signatures by integrating multiplex data in Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), e.g. KINOMEscan data and cell proliferation/mitosis imaging data. Using this strategy, we first established a PC9 cell line specific pathway model to investigate the pathway signatures in PC9 cell line when perturbed by a small molecule kinase inhibitor GW843682. This specific pathway revealed the role of PI3K/AKT in modulating the cell proliferation process and the absence of two anti-proliferation links, which indicated a potential mechanism of abnormal expansion in PC9 cell number. Incorporating the pathway model for side effects on primary human hepatocytes, it was used to screen 27 kinase inhibitors in LINCS database and PF02341066, known as Crizotinib, was finally suggested with an optimal concentration 4.6 uM to suppress PC9 cancer cell expansion while avoiding severe damage to primary human hepatocytes. Drug combination analysis revealed that the synergistic effect region can be predicted straightforwardly based on a threshold which is an inherent property of each kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, this integration strategy can be easily extended to other specific cell lines to be a powerful tool for drug screen before clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2030105417,"C3PO plays a key role in promoting RNA-induced gene silencing. C3PO consists of two subunits of the endonuclease translin-associated factor X (TRAX) and six subunits of the nucleotide-binding protein translin. We have found that TRAX binds strongly to phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), which transmits G protein signals from many hormones and sensory inputs. The association between PLCβ and TRAX is thought to underlie the ability of PLCβ to reverse gene silencing by small interfering RNAs. However, this reversal only occurs for some genes (e.g. GAPDH and LDH) but not others (e.g. Hsp90 and cyclophilin A). To understand this specificity, we carried out studies using fluorescence-based methods. In cells, we find that PLCβ, TRAX, and their complexes are identically distributed through the cytosol suggesting that selectivity is not due to large scale sequestration of either the free or complexed proteins. Using purified proteins, we find that PLCβ binds ∼5-fold more weakly to translin than to TRAX but ∼2-fold more strongly to C3PO. PLCβ does not alter TRAX-translin assembly to C3PO, and brightness studies suggest one PLCβ binds to one C3PO octamer without a change in the number of TRAX/translin molecules suggesting that PLCβ binds to an external site. Functionally, we find that C3PO hydrolyzes siRNA(GAPDH) at a faster rate than siRNA(Hsp90). However, when PLCβ is bound to C3PO, the hydrolysis rate of siRNA(GAPDH) becomes comparable with siRNA(Hsp90). Our results show that the selectivity of PLCβ toward certain genes lies in the rate at which the RNA is hydrolyzed by C3PO."
https://openalex.org/W2067385835,"Glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification, which determines the function of proteins and important processes such as inflammation. β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (βGalT1) is a key enzyme involved in the addition of galactose moieties to glycoproteins. Intestinal mucins are glycoproteins that protect the gut barrier against invading pathogens and determine the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Proper glycosylation of mucus is important in this regard. By using ubiquitously expressing βGalT1 transgenic mice, we found that this enzyme led to strong galactosylation of mucus proteins, isolated from the gut of mice. This galactosylation was associated with a drastic change in composition of gut microbiota, as TG mice had a significantly higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. TG mice were strongly protected against TNF-induced systemic inflammation and lethality. Moreover, βGalT1 transgenic mice were protected in a model of DSS-induced colitis, at the level of clinical score, loss of body weight, colon length and gut permeability. These studies put βGalT1 forward as an essential protective player in exacerbated intestinal inflammation. Optimal galactosylation of N-glycans of mucus proteins, determining the bacterial composition of the gut, is a likely mechanism of this function."

Previous two-dimensional proteomics studies using C3H10T1/2 murine mesenchymal pluripotent stem cells revealed that prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD) levels significantly increased during rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation (RIAD). In this study, we investigated the functional role played by PHD during RIAD. Three PHD isoforms (PHD1, 2, and 3) were found to be up-regulated in C3H10T1/2 cells during RIAD, whereas PHD knockdown and treatment with PHD inhibitors (dimethyloxalyl glycine or ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) blocked RIAD. PHD inhibition was found to be associated with increases in the levels of anti-adipogenic proteins such as GATA-3, KLF-2, and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ), with their reduced ubiquitination, suggesting that PHDs evoke the ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation of anti-adipogenic proteins. On the other hand, MG-132 (a proteasomal inhibitor) prevented the degradation of anti-adipogenic proteins and retarded RIAD. PPARγ antagonists (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether or GW9662) blunted the effects of rosiglitazone on PHD regulation. Furthermore, putative PPARγ binding sites were identified in the promoter region of PHDs by ChIP-PCR, implying that rosiglitazone may induce PHD up-regulation directly by PPARγ activation. Consistent with in vitro results, oral administration of rosiglitazone to ob/ob mice for 2 weeks increased adipose PHD levels and decreased anti-adipogenic protein levels by increasing their ubiquitination. These results suggest that rosiglitazone increases PHD expression in a PPARγ-dependent manner and that this leads to the commitment of anti-adipogenic proteins to the ubiquitination-proteasomal pathway and to the subsequent induction of adipocyte differentiation.

Originally, PHD was considered a regulator of HIF-1α, but recent reports suggest that it participates in differentiation independently of hypoxic status and in cellular homeostasis. For example, under normoxic conditions, all three PHDs increased throughout adipogenesis, and pharmacological inhibition of PHD activity abrogated adipocyte differentiation and reduced the expressions of all three PHDs (13Floyd Z.E. Kilroy G. Wu X. Gimble J.M. Effects of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors on adipogenesis and hypoxia inducible factor 1 α levels under normoxic conditions.J.

We previously described a new PPARγ agonist, KR-62980, with partial agonistic activity (16Kim K.R. Lee J.H. Kim S.J. Rhee S.D. Jung W.H. Yang S.D. Kim S.S. Ahn J.H. Cheon H.G. KR-62980. A novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist with weak adipogenic effects.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More specifically, KR-62980 increased insulin sensitivity but displayed a weak adipogenic potential relative to rosiglitazone. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for their different effects in adipocyte differentiation, we performed a two-dimensional proteomics analysis after treating C3H10T1/2 cells with rosiglitazone or KR-62980 and identified PHD as one potential target expressed differentially that increased significantly upon RIAD. In this study, we investigated the functional role played by PHD in RIAD using C3H10T1/2 cells, and modulation of PHD was accomplished by PHD shRNAs and PHD inhibitors. DMEM, FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Rosiglitazone, MG-132, DMOG, ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB), Oil Red O, BADGE, GW9662, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Antibodies against PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 were from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Antibodies against PPARγ, GATA-3, KLF-2, and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against TAZ, ubiquitin, and actin were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). C57BL/6J-Lepob leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob mice, 9 weeks old, male) were bred at the Korean Research Institute of Chemical Technology (Taejeon). Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in an air-conditioned room at 23 ± 2 °C. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. All mice were randomly allocated to control and treatment groups. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Gachon University. After treatment, adipose tissues were isolated, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until required. C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. To induce adipocyte differentiation, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml, 12-well plates) were grown to 70–80% confluency. Differentiation was induced 2 days later by adding 10 μm of rosiglitazone in adipogenesis-inducing medium containing 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutyl-methylxantine, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, and 10% FBS in DMEM. After 72 h, the medium was changed every other day for adipogenesis-inducing medium containing insulin (0.01 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone. Cultivation was continued for up to 10 days after induction. Lipid accumulation was evaluated by staining with Oil Red O as described previously (17Yagi K. Kondo D. Okazaki Y. Kano K. A novel preadipocyte cell line established from mouse adult mature adipocytes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin in PBS for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and stained with filtered Oil Red O solution (120 mg of Oil Red O dissolved in 40 ml of isopropyl alcohol) for 1 h. Lipid accumulation was observed by light phase-contrast microscopy. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (8 m urea containing 10% (v/v) 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.02 m EDTA, 0.05 m DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 6% (v/v) ampholytes (Resolyte (pH 3.5–10, Merck-BDH), 2% (v/v) CHAPS, 0.2 mg/ml RNase, and 0.2 mg/ml DNase). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (80 μg of protein) was applied to 13 cm of immobilized pH gradient gels (Immobiline DryStrip 3–10 NL, Amersham Biosciences). Strips were rehydrated for 12 h at 50 V, followed by focusing for 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and 10 h at 8000 V on an IPGPhor (Amersham Biosciences). The immobilized pH gradient strips were then equilibrated in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (w/v) SDS) containing 1% (w/v) DTT for 30 min, followed by a further 30 min of incubation in the same buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide in place of the DTT. The equilibrated immobilized pH gradient strips were rinsed gently with distilled water and then applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (18 × 16 cm). The second-dimension separation was performed at 150 V for 5 h. For analytical gels, the proteins were detected by silver staining using the Plus-OneTM silver kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The stained gels were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer (Amersham Biosciences) at 50-μm resolution to generate 8-bit images. These images were transferred to Phoretix 2DTM analytical software, version 6.01c (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). All image analyses and comparisons were carried out using this software. Selected spots were cut from stained gels and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Protein identification by MALDI-TOF or electrospray ionization quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometry of the MS/MS analysis was performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Taejeon, Korea). The transfection of shRNAs (100 ng of each/well) against PHD1, PHD2, PHD3, or control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) into C3H10T1/2 cells (5 × 105 cells/well, 70–80% confluent) was accomplished using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS, and cells were treated with or without rosiglitazone. PHD inhibitors (1 mm DMOG or 100 μm EDHB, 1 μl/ml in medium) were added to C3H10T1/2 cells at induction and were maintained in medium during medium changes (the medium was changed every other day). C3H10T1/2 cells were first pretreated with inhibitors for 2 h before rosiglitazone was added. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a solvent for both inhibitors, and the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide present (0.1%) had no effect. PPARγ antagonists (20 μm BADGE or 10 μm GW9662, 1 μl/ml in media) were added to C3H10T1/2 cells at induction and maintained in medium during medium changes on alternate days. Antagonists were pretreated for 2 h before rosiglitazone was added. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a solvent for GW9662 and BADGE. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the easy-BLUE total RNA extraction kit (iNtRON Inc., Korea). Reverse transcription of total RNA (1 μg) was performed using AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer Inc. Korea). PCR primers for the amplifications of PHD1, 2, and 3; PPARγ; aP2; and GAPDH (the internal standard) were as follows: PHD1, 5′-GAG GAT ACC ACT CCC AAC AGA CC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAG GAT ACC ACT CCC AAC AGA CC-3′ (reverse); PHD2, 5′-ATG AGC ACA GAA AGC ATG ATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAC AGG CTT GTC ACT CGA ATT-3′ (reverse); PHD3, 5′-TTG CTA ACC TGA CAC CCT TTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGG TGC AGG TTG AGC ATG TA-3′ (reverse); PPARγ, 5′-TTT TCA AGG GTG CCA GTT TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAT CCT TGG CCC TCT GAG AT-3′ (reverse); aP2, 5′-TGG AAG CTT GTC TCC AGT GA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT CTT CAC CTT CCT GTC GT-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH, 5′-TTC ACC ACC ATG GAG AAG GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC ATG GAC TGT GGT CAT GA-3′ (reverse). Reverse transcription PCR was conducted using 35 amplification cycles (denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min), followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. PCR reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV light after Gel Red (Elpis Biotech, Seoul, Korea) staining. Relative abundances of mRNA are expressed versus GAPDH mRNA. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Na fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and subsequent denaturation, 50 μg of whole cell lysates was subjected to 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blocked membranes were then incubated with anti-PHD1, PHD2, or PHD3 and blotted with secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP. For immunoprecipitation, precleared lysates (100 μg of extracts) were incubated with polyubiquitinated antibody or negative control normal mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 °C, and then protein A/G plus-agarose beads (50 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with constant agitation, immunoprecipitated materials were eluted using SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated for 5 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences Life Science), and band densities were quantified using UN-SCAN-IT Gel 5.1 software (Silk Scientific, Inc., Orem, UT) and normalized versus β-actin. The protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (18Cha J.Y. Repa J.J. The liver X receptor (LXR) and hepatic lipogenesis. The carbohydrate-response element-binding protein is a target gene of LXR.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 743-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Briefly, C3H10T1/2 cells (1 × 107 cells) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and kept on ice for 10 min in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Nuclei were collected and resuspended in sonication buffer for 60 min on ice and sonicated on ice to an average length of 200 bp using a tissue lyser set at 50% amplitude. After sonication, the chromatin solution (500 μg) was incubated with Dynabeads protein A (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of rabbit anti-PPARγ (Cell Signaling Technology) or 5 μg of rabbit normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. Antibody-bound complexes were obtained, and DNA fragments extricated from these complexes were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Shanghai, China). The purified ChIPed DNA samples were analyzed by conventional PCR. Primers for PCR were as follows: PHD2, 5′-GTTCCGGTTCGAGACCTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCTGCGTCTCAAGACAAC-3′ (reverse); PHD3, 5′-AGCATCTGGGTGAGCTCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAGAGAGGTGACTAGCCCA-3′ (reverse). Ob/ob mice were orally administered rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg/day, n = 10) or vehicle (an equivalent volume of saline, n = 10) for 2 weeks. Tail blood glucose concentrations (Accu-Check; Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and body weights were measured weekly. After 2 weeks of rosiglitazone administration, adipose tissues were removed and immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until required for assay. For protein analyses, adipose tissues were homogenized and lysed with Prep-sol (iNtRON Inc., Korea). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to determine statistical significances. Statistical significance was accepted for p values < 0.05. To examine the differential expression profiles of proteins between control, KR-62980-treated, and rosiglitazone-treated cells, we carried out two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 shows the two-dimensional gel images of proteins from treated cells. From gel-to-gel comparison, protein spots whose normalized spot volume changed more than 2-fold in rosiglitazone-treated cells (relative to KR-62980-treated cells) were excised from the gels, in-gel-digested with trypsin, and then their proteins were identified. Of 32 proteins identified, PHD2 showed up-regulation in rosiglitazone-treated cells (Fig. 1C, circle) and was subjected to further study of its role during RIAD. To confirm rosiglitazone-induced PHD2 up-regulation observed from two-dimensional proteomic analysis, expression patterns of PHD2 as well as the other isoforms (PHD1 and PHD3) were examined during RIAD. As expected, three PHD isoforms, PHD1, 2, and 3, were induced significantly during RIAD at the mRNA (Figs. 2B and 3B) and protein levels (Figs. 2C and 3C). PHD expression was found to be correlated with the extent of adipocyte differentiation as assessed by Oil Red O staining (Figs. 2A and 3A) and by PPARγ and aP2 mRNA levels (representative markers of adipocyte differentiation), implying that PHD induction is related to the extent of adipocyte differentiation by rosiglitazone.FIGURE 3Concentration-dependent PHD induction by rosiglitazone. C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of rosiglitazone for 10 days, and the extent of adipocyte differentiation was determined by Oil Red O staining (A), RT-PCR (B), and Western blotting (C). Experiments were conducted three times, and representative results are shown. Densitometric analysis was conducted using UN-SCAN-IT Gel version 5.1 software (Silk Scientific). C, control; R, rosiglitazone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether induction of three PHD isoforms by rosiglitazone is mediated by PPARγ activation, we examined the effects of PPARγ antagonists on PHD expression. As shown in Fig. 4, BADGE (20 μm) or GW9662 (10 μm) (two well known PPARγ antagonists) prevented increases in PHD mRNA levels (B) and inhibited RIAD (A), indicating that rosiglitazone up-regulated PHD expression in a PPARγ-dependent manner. To further examine whether PPARγ directly regulates the expression of PHDs, we performed a ChIP assay. NURBS, a database for ChIP-Seq-determined nuclear receptor binding sites, revealed several PPARγ binding regions on each PHD gene (19Fang Y. Liu H.X. Zhang N. Guo G.L. Wan Y.J. Fang J. NURBS. A database of experimental and predicted nuclear receptor binding sites of mouse.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Consistent with the finding that PHD2 and PHD3 were identified to have PPARγ binding regions on their proximal promoter by genome-wide ChIP-chip, we found the PPARγ binding on PHD2 and PHD3 promoter using ChIP-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4C, PPARγ enrichment over IgG was greater in rosiglitazone-treated differentiated cells than in undifferentiated cells, suggesting that PPARγ may directly regulate the transcription of PHDs via its binding to the promoter regions of each PHD. To ascertain the involvement of PHD in RIAD, two well known PHD inhibitors, DMOG (1 mm) or EDHB (100 μm), were cotreated with rosiglitazone, and the extent of adipocyte differentiation was monitored by Oil Red O staining. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and C), both inhibitors attenuated RIAD, which was accompanied by reduced mRNA levels of aP2 and PPARγ (B and D), suggesting that PHD plays an important role in RIAD. Consistent with results reported previously (13Floyd Z.E. Kilroy G. Wu X. Gimble J.M. Effects of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors on adipogenesis and hypoxia inducible factor 1 α levels under normoxic conditions.J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 101: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the mRNA expressions of PHD isoforms were reduced by PHD inhibitors. Dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%) had no effect on RIAD. Because PHDs are known to cause the hydroxylation of proline residues of several proteins and, thus, to cause the ubiquitination and degradation of these proteins, we examined the effects of rosiglitazone in the presence or absence of PHD inhibitors on the expression levels of anti-adipogenic proteins; that is, GATA-3, KLF-2, and TAZ. The protein levels of GATA-3, KLF-2, and TAZ were reduced by rosiglitazone concentration-dependently (Fig. 6A), and this was prevented by cotreatment with PHD inhibitors (Fig. 6B). To confirm whether PHD isoforms indeed bind to anti-adipogenic proteins to induce their prolyl hydroxylation, subsequent to ubiquitination, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments. As expected, rosiglitazone treatment increased anti-adipogenic proteins coimmunoprecipitated by each PHD antibody (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that rosiglitazone-induced PHDs bind to anti-adipogenic proteins, subsequently leading to their ubiquitination. To further confirm that PHD induces the ubiquitination of anti-adipogenic proteins, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-polyubiquitin antibody, and this was followed by immunoblotting with anti-GATA-3, KLF-2, or TAZ antibodies. The levels of anti-adipogenic proteins in whole cell extracts were decreased by rosiglitazone, but the levels of the polyubiquitinated forms of these proteins were increased (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, these increased levels of the ubiquitinated forms of GATA-3, KLF-2, and TAZ by rosiglitazone were prevented by cotreatment with PHD inhibitors (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that PHDs promote the ubiquitination and, thus, the degradation of anti-adipogenic proteins during RIAD and that PHDs play a key role in PPARγ-mediated adipocyte differentiation by modulating the stabilities of anti-adipogenic proteins. To determine whether the effects of PHDs on anti-adipogenic proteins are indeed mediated by proteasomal degradation, cells were cotreated with rosiglitazone and MG-132 (5 μm), a widely used proteasomal inhibitor. MG-132 maintained the levels of anti-adipogenic proteins at the control level (Fig. 7C), further confirming the function of PHDs during the proteasomal degradation of GATA-3, KLF-2, and TAZ. To define the PHD isoforms involved in the effect of rosiglitazone, shRNAs specific for each PHD isoform were transfected into C3H10T1/2 cells at days 0 and 4 twice with a 4-day interval. PHD shRNAs efficiently decreased PHD expression (68.5% by PHD1 knockdown, 51.6% by PHD2 knockdown, and 76.1% by PHD3 knockdown) (Fig. 8A). Concomitantly, each shRNA attenuated RIAD to similar extents, as determined by Oil Red O staining (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2025072299,"Mammalian phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily have emerged as important regulators of physiology and disease. Many of these enzymes are stable homodimers; however, the role of their dimerization is largely unknown. Here, we explore the function of the obligatory homodimerization of chronophin, a mammalian HAD phosphatase known to dephosphorylate pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and serine/threonine-phosphorylated proteins. The exchange of two residues in the murine chronophin homodimerization interface (chronophin(A194K,A195K)) yields a constitutive monomer both in vitro and in cells. The catalytic activity of monomeric chronophin toward PLP is strongly impaired. X-ray crystallographic studies of chronophin(A194K,A195K) revealed that dimer formation is essential for an intermolecular arginine-arginine-tryptophan stacking interaction that positions a critical histidine residue in the substrate specificity loop of chronophin for PLP coordination. Analysis of all available crystal structures of HAD hydrolases that are grouped together with chronophin in the C2a-type structural subfamily uncovered a highly conserved mode of dimerization that results in intermolecular contacts involving the substrate specificity loop. Our results explain how the dimerization of HAD hydrolases contributes to their catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2078158589,"We investigate the rate-length scaling law of protein folding, a key undetermined scaling law in the analytical theory of protein folding. We demonstrate that chain length is a dominant factor determining folding times, and that the unambiguous determination of the way chain length corre- lates with folding times could provide key mechanistic insight into the folding process. Four specific proposed laws (power law, exponential, and two stretched exponentials) are tested against one an- other, and it is found that the power law best explains the data. At the same time, the fit power law results in rates that are very fast, nearly unreasonably so in a biological context. We show that any of the proposed forms are viable, conclude that more data is necessary to unequivocally infer the rate-length law, and that such data could be obtained through a small number of protein folding experiments on large protein domains."
https://openalex.org/W2085435220,"Cardiolipin (CL), a membrane phospholipid in bacteria and mitochondria, has been hypothesized to facilitate movement of protons on the outer surface of membranes in support of respiration-dependent ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). If so, the high levels of membrane CL found in alkaliphilic bacteria, such as Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, might facilitate its robust OXPHOS at pH 10.5, where the bulk protonmotive (PMF) force is low. To address the role of CL in Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, we studied strains in which genes (cls) potentially encoding a CL synthase (CLs) were deleted: three single (ΔclsA, ΔclsB, and ΔclsC), one double (ΔclsA/B), and one triple (ΔclsA/B/C) mutant. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatography analyses of lipid extracts from 32P-labeled strains showed that the wild-type CL content was 15% of total phospholipids at pH 10.5 versus 3% at pH 7.5 during log phase. The % CL was higher (28–33%) at both pH values during stationary phase. The clsA gene plays a major role in CL biosynthesis as no detectable CL was found in ΔclsA-containing mutants, whereas the CL precursor phosphatidylglycerol was elevated. The ΔclsB mutant exhibited no significant reduction in CL, but clsB expression was up-regulated and appeared to support growth at pH 7.5. In the absence of detectable CL, the alkaliphile showed no significant deficits in non-fermentative growth, respiration-dependent ATP synthesis, or salt tolerance. Minor deficits in respiration and ATP synthase assembly were noted in individual mutants. In long term survival experiments, significant growth defects were found in ΔclsA strains and the ΔclsC strain at pH 10.5.

Two-dimensional thin layer chromatography analyses of lipid extracts from 32P-labeled strains showed that the wild-type CL content was 15% of total phospholipids at pH 10.5 versus 3% at pH 7.5 during log phase. The % CL was higher (28–33%) at both pH values during stationary phase. The clsA gene plays a major role in CL biosynthesis as no detectable CL was found in ΔclsA-containing mutants, whereas the CL precursor phosphatidylglycerol was elevated. The ΔclsB mutant exhibited no significant reduction in CL, but clsB expression was up-regulated and appeared to support growth at pH 7.5. In the absence of detectable CL, the alkaliphile showed no significant deficits in non-fermentative growth, respiration-dependent ATP synthesis, or salt tolerance. Minor deficits in respiration and ATP synthase assembly were noted in individual mutants. In long term survival experiments, significant growth defects were found in ΔclsA strains and the ΔclsC strain at pH 10.5. Cardiolipin (CL) 2The abbreviations used are: CLcardiolipinClscardiolipin synthaseOXPHOSoxidative phosphorylationPGphosphatidylglycerolPMFprotonmotive forceTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamineMYEmalate-yeast extractGYEglucose-yeast extractqPCRquantitative PCR. is an anionic glycerophospholipid with four acyl chains. The presence of CL is primarily associated with membranes of bacteria and mitochondria that carry out F1F0-ATP synthase-dependent synthesis of ATP that is energized by electrochemical ion gradients generated by respiratory chain activity, i.e. OXPHOS. CL is linked to Barth syndrome, a human metabolic disorder in which mutations in taffazin lead to reduced CL, increased lyso-CL, and associated deficits in mitochondrial function in OXPHOS (1Barth P.G.

Recently, it has also been shown that CL loss in yeast leads to defects in cellular iron homeostasis (4Patil V.A. Fox J.L. Gohil V.M. Winge D.R. Greenberg M.L.

Chem. 2013; 288: 1696-1705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which may reflect the importance of the energy status for this function. Similarly, the greater sensitivity to high salinity reported in CL-deficient mutants of Bacillus subtilis and a deficit in managing prolonged salinity in Staphylococcus aureus (5Lopez C.S. Alice A.F.

The specific CL roles most frequently reported in connection with OXPHOS-related deficits are roles in stabilizing respiratory complexes and supercomplexes in both eukaryote mitochondria and bacteria (7Zhang M.

Although CL is integral to the structural organization of individual mitochondrial respiratory complexes (12Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Lipids in membrane protein structures.Biochim. Biophys.

However, higher order organization of the respiratory chain into supercomplexes is highly dependent on CL (10Bazán S. Mileykovskaya E. Mallampalli V.K. Heacock P. Sparagna G.C. Dowhan W.

However, bound CL in a Rhodobacter cytochrome c oxidase complex has been shown to be replaceable with other lipids without an impact on structure or function (24Zhang X. Hiser C. Tamot B. Benning C.

In both E. coli and B. subtilis, CL has been shown to be dispensable (26Kikuchi S. Shibuya I. Matsumoto K.

One of the goals of this study was to test a hypothesis developed by Haines and Dencher (28Haines T.H. Anionic lipid headgroups as a proton-conducting pathway along the surface of membranes.

Acta. 2009; 1788: 1997-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that CL could play a direct role in proton translocation on the membrane surface during OXPHOS by acting as a proton sink. Peter Mitchell's (31Mitchell P. Coupling of phosphorylation to electron and hydrogen transfer by a chemi-osmotic type of mechanism.Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar) ground-breaking chemiosmotic hypothesis posited that during generation of a protonmotive force (PMF) by proton-pumping respiratory chain complexes, pumped protons equilibrate with the bulk liquid phase outside the coupling membrane and are then re-captured for entry into the ATP synthase during OXPHOS. However, recent experimental and computational data have indicated that pumped protons can move rapidly on the membrane surface or near the membrane surface and reach the ATP synthase before their full equilibration, thus making the effective PMF larger than the PMF calculated using the bulk phase proton concentration to calculate the pH gradient component (32Mulkidjanian A.Y.

There is not yet a complete consensus on how the protons move on the surface and the roles of various variables in “trapping” them near the surface, e.g. whether CL or other specific charged molecules at the surface are involved. A major model system in which robust OXPHOS occurs under conditions of low bulk PMF, is alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, a genetically tractable alkaliphile that carries out OXPHOS more effectively at an external pH of 10.5 than at 7.5, although the bulk PMF during growth in media at pH 10.5 is much lower than at pH 7.5 because the cytoplasmic pH is 8.3 under those conditions. As a consequence, this organism provides a setting in which to test whether CL is a likely participant in the near-surface proton translocation that is expected to be crucial for alkaliphile OXPHOS (36Krulwich T.A.

If this is a key mechanism, mutational loss of the three Cls enzymes identified in the B. pseudofirmus OF4 genome (39Janto B. Ahmed A. Ito M. Liu J. Hicks D.B. Pagni S. Fackelmayer O.J. Smith T.A.

Study of the individual and collective roles of the Cls enzymes is also of general interest to explore in an alkaliphile that grows well, both fermentatively and non-fermentatively, in a pH range from 7.5 to >11.2. The three paralogous Cls enzymes may well have distinct roles at different pH values, and may reveal roles apart from OXPHOS for the high CL content that is found in B. pseudofirmus OF4 (40Clejan S.

The primers used in this study are available on request. The wild-type (WT) strain is an alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus 811M strain (41Clejan S. Guffanti A.A. Cohen M.A. Krulwich T.A.

The cls deletion mutants, including three single deletion mutants, one double mutant (deletion of clsA and clsB), and one triple mutant (deletion of clsA, clsB, and clsC), were constructed in the native alkaliphile host as described (42Liu J.

Briefly, to construct the ΔclsA strain, an upstream and a downstream flanking region about 1000 bp of the clsA gene were amplified with B. pseudofirmus 811M genomic DNA as the template, and cloned into pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega) and pG+host4 (Appligene, Pleasanton, CA) sequentially. The resulting pG+host4 construct was transformed into B. pseudofirmus 811M strain. The ΔclsA strain was constructed after a single crossover step and a double crossover recombination step. The deletion region was verified by DNA sequencing performed by Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). The ΔclsB and ΔclsC strains were constructed in a similar way except that the amplified clsC upstream and downstream fragments were ligated with low copy plasmid pMW118 (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) instead of pGEM3Zf(+) to avoid mutation. The double ΔclsA/B strain was constructed by deleting the clsB gene in the ΔclsA strain and the triple ΔclsA/B/C strain was constructed by deleting the clsC gene in the ΔclsA/B strain.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidPropertiesRef.B. pseudofirmus 811MWild type, 811MA methionine auxotroph of B. pseudofirmus OF441Clejan S.

A His-tagged pBAD-Bp-ClsC-His construct was prepared to check clsC gene expression after it failed to show complementation in E. coli BKT12. Two types of media were used: both were buffered at pH 7.5 or 10.5 for particular experiments. The carbon source was either malate (to 50 mm) to support non-fermentative growth or glucose (to 50 mm) to support fermentative growth. The semi-defined medium with the above respective carbon sources are referred to as MYE (malate-yeast extract) and GYE (glucose-yeast extract) medium (44Wang Z. Hicks D.B. Guffanti A.A. Baldwin K.

A defined medium in which glutamine and alanine provided the nitrogen source (QA) was also used at pH 7.5 or 10.5 and contained either 50 mm malate (M-QA) or glucose (G-QA) (45Wei Y. Southworth T.W.

Growth curve experiments were conducted in the media and at the pH values specified in the legends for the particular experiments. The pre-cultures, unless specified, were grown in the same media in which they would ultimately be grown overnight and then diluted to an A600 of 0.2 with fresh medium; then 10 μl of the diluted culture was inoculated into 190 μl of medium in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-one, Germany). The plate was incubated with shaking at 30 °C in a PowerWave XS2 microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Inc.), and the A600 was recorded hourly. For long term survival growth tests, the WT strain and cls deletion strains were pre-grown overnight in MYE or M-QA media at pH 7.5 or 10.5. Ten μl of each pre-culture (A600 ∼ 2) was diluted into 2 ml of fresh corresponding media in a 15-ml tube. The tubes were incubated at either 30 or 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Growth was monitored by recording the A600 in a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer at the indicated time. Appropriate dilutions were made so that the A600 was within the range of 0.3 to 0.5. For growth on the MYE medium, a strain deleted in F0 genes of the ATP synthase operon (ΔF0), which does not grow non-fermentatively, was included as a control and the pre-culture was grown in GYE medium at pH 7.5. The modest growth exhibited by the ΔF0 mutant on malate was subtracted from the raw A600 data to calculate the non-fermentative growth. For determinations of phospholipid composition, cells were grown in the presence of 5 μCi/ml of 32PO4, which was added either during overnight growth or after dilution of an overnight culture to an A600 of 0.05 to initiate logarithmic growth. Uniformly labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and phospholipids were extracted as described previously (43Tan B.K. Bogdanov M. Zhao J. Dowhan W. Raetz C.R. Guan Z.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 16504-16509Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Analyses of the phospholipids were carried out either by silica gel one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC), using chloroform/methanol/water/NH4OH (60:37.5:3:1, v/v/v/v) as solvent 1 (46Fine J.B. Sprecher H. Unidimensional thin-layer chromatography of phospholipids on boric acid-impregnated plates.J.

For two-dimensional TLC, 20 × 20-cm TLC plates of Merck Kiesel Gel 60 (0.25 mm) were used. Radiolabeled lipids were visualized and quantified using a Personal Molecular ImagerTM FX (Bio-Rad). Stored images were processed and quantified using Quantity One software for scanning and analysis of the captured PhosphorImages (Bio-Rad). Phospholipid content is expressed as mol % of total phospholipid, after correcting for two phosphates per molecule of CL, and is based on the intensity of the captured signal generating a latent image of the radiolabeled spot on the Phosphorscreen. The results presented are representative of two or more independent determinations. The WT and cls deletion strains were grown on MYE medium at pH 10.5 and the ΔF0 strain was grown on GYE medium at pH 10.5. The cells were harvested at 4–5 h when A600 was around 1.5.

https://openalex.org/W1980580055,"Molecular entities work in concert as a system and mediate phenotypic outcomes and disease states. There has been recent interest in modelling the associations between molecular entities from their observed expression profiles as networks using a battery of algorithms. These networks have proven to be useful abstractions of the underlying pathways and signalling mechanisms. Noise is ubiquitous in molecular data and can have a pronounced effect on the inferred network. Noise can be an outcome of several factors including: inherent stochastic mechanisms at the molecular level, variation in the abundance of molecules, heterogeneity, sensitivity of the biological assay or measurement artefacts prevalent especially in high-throughput settings. The present study investigates the impact of discrepancies in noise variance on pair-wise dependencies, conditional dependencies and constraint-based Bayesian network structure learning algorithms that incorporate conditional independence tests as a part of the learning process. Popular network motifs and fundamental connections, namely: (a) common-effect, (b) three-chain, and (c) coherent type-I feed-forward loop (FFL) are investigated. The choice of these elementary networks can be attributed to their prevalence across more complex networks. Analytical expressions elucidating the impact of discrepancies in noise variance on pairwise dependencies and conditional dependencies for special cases of these motifs are presented. Subsequently, the impact of noise on two popular constraint-based Bayesian network structure learning algorithms such as Grow-Shrink (GS) and Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) that implicitly incorporate tests for conditional independence is investigated. Finally, the impact of noise on networks inferred from publicly available single cell molecular expression profiles is investigated. While discrepancies in noise variance are overlooked in routine molecular network inference, the results presented clearly elucidate their non-trivial impact on the conclusions that in turn can challenge the biological significance of the findings. The analytical treatment and arguments presented are generic and not restricted to molecular data sets."
https://openalex.org/W1981650139,"Mammalian cells encode three closely related Ras proteins, H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras. Oncogenic K-Ras mutations frequently occur in human cancers, which lead to dysregulated cell proliferation and genomic instability. However, mechanistic role of the Ras isoform regulation have remained largely unknown. Furthermore, the dynamics and function of negative regulation of GTP-loaded K-Ras have not been fully investigated. Here, we demonstrate RasG, the Dictyostelium orthologue of K-Ras, is targeted for degradation by polyubiquitination. Both ubiquitination and degradation of RasG were strictly associated with RasG activity. High resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis indicated that RasG ubiquitination occurs at C-terminal lysines equivalent to lysines found in human K-Ras but not in H-Ras and N-Ras homologues. Substitution of these lysine residues with arginines (4KR-RasG) diminished RasG ubiquitination and increased RasG protein stability. Cells expressing 4KR-RasG failed to undergo proper cytokinesis and resulted in multinucleated cells. Ectopically expressed human K-Ras undergoes polyubiquitin-mediated degradation in Dictyostelium, whereas human H-Ras and a Dictyostelium H-Ras homologue (RasC) are refractory to ubiquitination. Our results indicate the existence of GTP-loaded K-Ras orthologue-specific degradation system in Dictyostelium, and further identification of the responsible E3-ligase may provide a novel therapeutic approach against K-Ras-mutated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2028302435,"This work describes an approach inspired by the primary visual cortex using the stimulus response of the receptive field profiles of binocular cells for disparity computation. Using the energy model based on the mechanism of log-Gabor filters for disparity encodings, we propose a suitable model to consistently represent the complex cells by computing the wide bandwidths of the cortical cells. This way, the model ensures the general neurophysiological findings in the visual cortex (V1), emphasizing the physical disparities and providing a simple selection method for the complex cell response. The results suggest that our proposed approach can achieve better results than a hybrid model with phase-shift and position-shift using position disparity alone."
https://openalex.org/W2045324695,"Enveloped viruses contain glycoproteins protruding from the viral membrane. These proteins play a crucial role in the extra-cellular steps of the virus life cycle, namely attachment to and entry into cells. Their role during the intracellular late phase of virus multiplication has been less appreciated, overlooked by the documented central organizer role of the matrix M protein. Sendai virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, expresses two trans-membrane proteins on its surface, HN and F. In previous work, we have shown that suppression of F in the context of an infection, results in about 70% reduction of virus particle production, a reduction similar to that observed upon suppression of the matrix M protein. Moreover, a TYTLE motif present in F cytoplasmic tail has been proposed essential for virus particle production. In the present work, using original alternate conditional siRNA suppression systems, we generated a double F gene recombinant Sendai virus expressing wt-F and a nonviable mutated TYTLE/5A F protein (F5A). Suppression of the wild type F gene expression in cells infected with this virus allowed the analysis of F5A properties in the context of the infection. Coupling confocal imaging analysis to biochemical characterization, we found that F5A i) was not expressed at the cell surface but restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, ii) was still capable of interaction with M and iii) had profound effect on M and HN cellular distribution. On the basis of these data, we propose a model for SeV particle formation based on an M/F complex that would serve as nucleation site for virus particle assembly at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2047782484,"The Gp59 protein of bacteriophage T4 promotes DNA replication by loading the replicative helicase, Gp41, onto replication forks and recombination intermediates. Gp59 also blocks DNA synthesis by Gp43 polymerase until Gp41 is loaded, ensuring that synthesis is tightly coupled to unwinding. The distinct polymerase blocking and helicase loading activities of Gp59 likely involve different binding interactions with DNA and protein partners. Here, we investigate how interactions of Gp59 with DNA and Gp32, the T4 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, are related to these activities. A previously characterized mutant, Gp59-I87A, exhibits markedly reduced affinity for ssDNA and pseudo-fork DNA substrates. We demonstrate that on Gp32-covered ssDNA, the DNA binding defect of Gp59-I87A is not detrimental to helicase loading and translocation. In contrast, on pseudo-fork DNA the I87A mutation is detrimental to helicase loading and unwinding in the presence or absence of Gp32. Other results indicate that Gp32 binding to lagging strand ssDNA relieves the blockage of Gp43 polymerase activity by Gp59, whereas the inhibition of Gp43 exonuclease activity is maintained. Our findings suggest that Gp59-Gp32 and Gp59-DNA interactions perform separate but complementary roles in T4 DNA metabolism; Gp59-Gp32 interactions are needed to load Gp41 onto D-loops, and other nucleoprotein structures containing clusters of Gp32. Gp59-DNA interactions are needed to load Gp41 onto nascent or collapsed replication forks lacking clusters of Gp32 and to coordinate bidirectional replication from T4 origins. The dual functionalities of Gp59 allow it to promote the initiation or re-start of DNA replication from a wide variety of recombination and replication intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2089686027,"We are concerned with the complexity reduction of a stochastic system of differential equations governing the dynamics of a neuronal circuit describing a decision-making task. This reduction is based on the slow-fast behavior of the problem and holds on the whole phase space and not only locally around the spontaneous state. Macroscopic quantities, such as performance and reaction times, computed applying this reduction are in agreement with previous works in which the complexity reduction is locally performed at the spontaneous point by means of a Taylor expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1972017530,"We address the question why papers dealing with the ecology of primates are so sparsely represented in the general ecological literature. A literature analyses based on entries in Web of Science and PrimateLit reveals that despite a large number of papers published on primates in general and on the ecology of primates, only a very small fraction of these papers is published in high-ranking international ecological journals. We discuss a number of potential reasons for the disproportion and highlight the problems associated with experimental research on wild primates and constraints on sample size as major issues."
