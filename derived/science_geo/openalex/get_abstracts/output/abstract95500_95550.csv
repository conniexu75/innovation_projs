https://openalex.org/W1513215086,"The proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins, phenolic polymers which are synthesized by many plants, characteristically bind and precipitate proteins. The specificity of the interaction was investigated using a competitive binding assay to compare directly the affinities of various proteins and synthetic polymers for the tannin obtained from Sorghum bicolor (Lin.) Moench. At pH 4.9, the relative affinities range over more than 4 orders of magnitude, indicating that this proanthocyanidin interacts quite selectively with protein and protein-like polymers. The affinity for tannins is an inverse function of the size of the polymer, and peptides with less than six residues interact very weakly with tannin. Proteins are precipitated by proanthocyanidins most efficiently at pH values near their isoelectric points. Proline-rich proteins and polymers have very high affinities for tannin. Tightly coiled globular proteins have much lower affinities for tannin than conformationally loose proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1537290919,"The complete denaturation and subsequent renaturation and reconstitution of a polytopic integral membrane protein are demonstrated. Delipidated bacteriorhodopsin (Huang, K.-S., Bayley, H., and Khorana, H. G. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 323-327) is completely denatured when transferred into 88% formic acid or anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid as shown by NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy. When ethanol is added to a solution of the denatured protein, helical structure is largely reformed. After neutralization of the acid with ammonia and dialysis against a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate a substantial amount of this structure is retained. Complete renaturation, characterized by the formation of the chromophore, occurs when phospholipids, cholate, and retinal are added to the sodium dodecyl sulfate solution of the protein. After dialysis of the solution to remove the detergents, the bacteriorhodopsin assembles into vesicles that are fully active in light-driven proton translocation. We also show that two chymotryptic fragments of bacteriorhodopsin (residues 1-71 and 72-248), separated under denaturing conditions, can be made to reassociate and form active vesicles with phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1497013369,"Biliverdin reductase in a stable form was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. The purified enzyme showed 3700-fold increase in specific activity when compared with the crude preparation, and the extent of recovery was 30-35%. The molecular weight was estimated at 34,000-36,000. The amino acid analysis of the purified preparation revealed the presence of 3 cysteine residues/mol of enzyme. The reductase utilized NADPH and NADH as electron donors. The NADPH-dependent biliverdin reductase activity was extremely sensitive to SH reagents, including 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and iodoacetamide. However, the pretreatment of the enzyme with NADPH and biliverdin fully protected the reductase from inactivation by these reagents. The enzyme activity was irreversibly inhibited by HgCl2. The addition of dithiothreitol to the enzyme inhibited by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) promoted the full reversal of inhibition. The enzyme exhibited different pH optima for activity with NADPH (pH 8.7) and NADH (pH 7.0). The apparent Km for biliverdin was established to be 5.0 microM with NADH and 3.0 microM with NADPH. The apparent Km for NADPH was 3.0 microM, while that of NADH was 270 microM. The enzyme activity was inhibited by the substrate when the concentration exceeded 4.0-5.0 microM. The product, bilirubin, inhibited the enzyme activity in a competitive manner. In addition, the reductase was inhibited by hematin and zinc-protoporphyrin. Dilution produced instability in the enzyme, but the presence of exogenous proteins, such as serum albumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and lysozyme, stabilized the enzyme protein."
https://openalex.org/W2058092842,"Genomic exchange of a mammalian cell has been attempted by entirely replacing the nuclear genome of the mouse egg with a nucleus from an embryonic cell via nuclear transplantation. Its biological applicability to experimental embryology has first been probed on the mouse blastocyst. After mechanical isolation of the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) from LT/Sv or CBA/H-T6 blastocysts and subsequent dissociation into single cells, their nuclei were transplanted singly into fertilized C57BL/6 eggs from which the female and male pronucleus were removed after nuclear injection. Of the 179 eggs injected with TE nuclei, 68 (38%) survived microsurgery and 34 cleaved, but most of them became arrested during early preimplantation development. Biochemical analysis of 25 TE nuclear-transplant embryos showed that nuclei from TE cells were not capable of initiating nor supporting development beyond preimplantation without participation of the egg genome. Of the 363 eggs injected with ICM nuclei, 142 (39%) survived micromanipulation and were cultured in vitro. From the 96 cleaving eggs, 48 embryos reached the late preimplantation stage. Biochemical or karyotypic analyses of 54 ICM nuclear-transplant embryos at various preimplantation stages for either strain-specific variants of glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) or chromosomal markers (T6 translocation) revealed that, in most instances, the transplanted nuclei successfully promoted development of the recipient eggs. A total of 16 nuclear-transplant embryos originating from ICM nuclei were transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant ICR/Swiss females in order to allow development to term. Three liveborn mice, two females and one male, were derived exclusively from the transplanted ICM nuclei as judged by their coat color, karyotype and GPI enzyme pattern. Furthermore, in subsequent matings, two of the nuclear-transplant mice, one female and one male, gave rise to several normal progeny all of which exhibited the nuclear-donor phenotype. Our results demonstrate that nuclei from ICM cells of the mouse blastocyst are not yet restricted in their differentiation capacities but rather remain developmentally equivalent to the totipotent zygote nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1552354790,"The transport of folates by the intact intestine consists of a saturable component with a luminal pH optimum of 6.0 and a nonsaturable component which predominates at high folate concentrations and/or high luminal pH. We sought to determine whether these properties reflect the behavior of the brush border membrane, free of intracellular enzyme activities, organelles, and intercellular junctions. We have studied, therefore the transport characteristics of folic acid (PteGlu) and methotrexate in isolated brush border membrane vesicles from rat intestine. Both PteGlu and methotrexate were found to be taken up by these vesicles by a pH-dependent process with a maximum uptake at a medium pH near 5.0. Studies at pH 5.5 demonstrated both saturable and nonsaturable components for the uptake of methotrexate and PteGlu. For methotrexate, Km, corrected for the nonsaturable component, was 1.5 microM and Vmax = 3.08 pmol/mg of protein/0.5 min. For PteGlu, the Km was 0.42 microM and Vmax = 0.67 pmol/mg of protein/0.5 min. Methotrexate uptake was competitively inhibited by PteGlu (Ki = 0.6 microM and by 5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamic acid (5-methyl-H4PteGlu; Ki = 1.35 microM). Brush border membrane vesicles exhibit folate transstimulation: those preloaded with PteGlu, 5-methyl-H4PteGlu or unlabeled methotrexate took up tritium labeled methotrexate at more rapid rates than did control vesicles. The data presented are consistent with a pH-dependent, structure-specific carrier or channel for folate transport across the luminal membrane of the intestinal cell shared by the three folate derivatives tested."
https://openalex.org/W1542584079,"A series of phosphoglycerides containing the same structural unit, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, was prepared with the following polar head groups: -3-phosphoric acid (AGEPA), -3-phosphorylethanol (AGEPEt), -3-phosphorylethanolamine (AGEPE), -3-phosphoryl-N-monomethylethanolamine (AGEPMME), -3-phosphoryl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine (AGEPDME), and -3-phosphorylcholine (AGEPC). These compounds were synthesized primarily by phospholipase D modification of AGEPC. The characterization of these derivatives was achieved through thin layer chromatography, infrared spectrometry, gas-liquid chromatography, and combined gas-liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Their ability to induce irreversible aggregation and 50% secretion of serotonin from washed rabbit platelets was investigated. The latter secretory activity, expressed on a molar basis (60 s following platelet stimulation) was shown to be particularly sensitive to the nature of the polar head group as follows: AGEPA, 8.3 X 10(-7) M; AGEPE, 6.8 X 10(-7) M; AGEPEt, 4.0 x 10(-7) M; AGEPMME, 3.7 X 10(-9) M; AGEPDME, 4.5 X 10(-10) M; and AGEPC, 1.8 X 10(-10) M. It was concluded that the polar head group of the various acetyl glyceryl ether phosphoglycerides had an important role in expressing the biological activity of this unique type of phosphoglyceride towards platelets. It appears likely that the polar head group of the various acetyl glyceryl ether phosphoglycerides had an important role in expressing the biological activity of this unique type of phosphoglyceride towards platelets. It appears likely that the recognition site (receptor site) on platelets is more reactive to the dimethylethanolamine or teh quaternary ammonium base, choline, than to any of the other polar head groups under consideration."
https://openalex.org/W1481088618,"Tropomyosin, present in various types of chick embryo muscle, has been characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In skeletal muscle, it was found that both the alpha and beta subunits exist as two variants, alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 1, beta 2. The most acidic variants (alpha 2 and beta 2) could be demonstrated to be phosphorylated and, based upon the facts that 1) after phosphatase treatment alpha 2 and beta 2 co-migrate with alpha 1 and beta 1 and 2) in vitro translation of skeletal muscle mRNA produces only alpha 1 and beta 1, we suggest that alpha 2 and beta 2 merely represent the phosphorylated forms of alpha 1 and beta 1. A similar situation is found in differentiated muscle cultures in vitro. In cardiac muscle or in cardiocytes, in culture, the only subunit of tropomyosin which is present (the alpha subunit) is also phosphorylated. However, in smooth muscle, none of the tropomyosin subunits is phosphorylated. The use of various modifications in the second dimension of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has allowed us to separate completely the alpha subunits of slow and fast muscle tropomyosin and to show that: 1) the cardiac alpha subunit is distinct from either the slow alpha or the fast alpha subunit and 2) in vitro differentiated cells synthesize a tropomyosin which, by co-migration under various conditions, is identical with fast muscle tropomyosin."

https://openalex.org/W1643871962,"The prosthetic heme of cytochrome P-450 is converted during the metabolism of ethylene into an abnormal hepatic porphyrin. This porphyrin has been isolated, purified, and characterized by field desorption mass spectrometry and 360-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It has been unambiguously identified as one of the four possible isomers of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)protoporphyrin IX (isolated as the dimethyl ester). The isomer which is obtained bears the N-alkyl group on one of the two propionic acid-substituted pyrrole rings in the porphyrin. Strong support is provided by the structure of this porphyrin for our contention that the prosthetic heme of cytochrome P-450 is alkylated during attempted transfer of the catalytically-activated oxygen to the pi-bond of destructive unsaturated substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1496328360,"The structure of the 7Fe ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii has been solved from a 3.0-A multiple isomorphous replacement map. The crystals belong to space group P43212 with a = 55.22, c = 95.20 A, and Z = 1. Heavy-atom derivatives were prepared with K2PtCl4,K2[OsO2(OH)4], and Na3RhCl6. Anomalous scattering data were collected for native (Fe) and Pt derivative crystals. The figure of merit for 3,322 reflections to 3.0 A is 0.74. The structure consists of an NH2-terminal core of residues 1-50 which form the Fe-S cluster sites, and a COOH-terminal chain of residues 51-107 which wraps around this core. The [3Fe-3S] cluster is ligated by cysteines 8, 11, 16, 20, and 49 and a sixth ligand which is either glutamic acid 18 or an exogenous small molecule. The [4Fe-4S] cluster is ligated by cysteines 24, 39, 42, and 45. The coordination of both Fe-S centers has been confirmed by fitting of the cluster atoms and residues 1-50 to unbiased 2Fo-Fc Fourier maps at 2.5-A resolution. The structure of the 3Fe center has also been confirmed with anomalous scattering difference Fourier maps using both isomorphous replacement and refined phases. The partially refined structure at 2.5 A (3,490 reflections, 6.0 sigma(F)) has R = 35%."
https://openalex.org/W1492744764,"Association constants for the binding of methyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside (methyl alpha-D-Galp) and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (methyl alpha-D-GalNAcp) to three Bandeiraea simplicifolia isolectins (A4, A2B2, B4) were determined by equilibrium dialysis and fluorescence enhancement measurements. The a and B subunits appear to have approximately the same Kassoc for methyl alpha-D-Galp: 1.45 X 10(4), 1.98 X 10(4), and 2.06 X 10(4) M-1 for A4, A2B2, and B4, respectively, as determined by equilibrium dialysis. Fluorescence enhancement measurements on B4 gave an association constant of 2.07 X 10(4) M-1 for methyl alpha-D-Galp and 1.87 X 10(3) M-1 for methyl beta-D-galp. By equilibrium dialysis, we were able to detect 3.3 (theory, 4.0) methyl alpha-D-GalNAcp binding sites for A4 (Kassoc = 1.87 X 10(5) M-1), 1.9 for A2B2 (Kassoc = 1.19 X 10(5) M-1), and were unable to detect any methyl alpha-D-GalNAcp binding sites for B4. However, four very weak methyl alpha-D-GalNAc binding sites for B4 were detected by fluorescence enhancement measurement (Kassoc = 1.26 X 10(2) M-1). Thus, the A subunit has an affinity for methyl alpha-D-GalNAc 3 orders of magnitude greater than the B subunit. Precipitation and hapten inhibition data are in accord with these binding measurements. Toward guaran and type B blood group substance, all isolectins precipitated the same amount of biopolymer. However, AB3, A2B2, and A3B, which are mono-, di-, and trivalent for alpha-D-GalNAcp, were differentially precipitated by type A blood group substance which contains alpha-D-GalNAcp-end groups. A3B precipitated the most, A2B2 less, and AB3 no type A substance. These isolectins should prove useful in studies evaluating the effect of valence on lectin-cell interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1532432868,"We have developed methods for the rapid immunoprecipitation of acetylcholine receptor from the clonal mouse cell line BC3H-1. One antiserum, anti-alpha-bungarotoxin, precipitates receptors to which alpha-bungarotoxin is bound. A second antiserum prepared against sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured receptor precipitates receptor polypeptides independent of toxin binding activity. We have used these sera to analyze the products of synthesis in vivo after short pulses of [35S]methionine. Acetylcholine receptor polypeptides of synthesized during a 5-min pulse require 15 min before they become fully active for alpha-bungarotoxin binding. These experiments identify an early step in the assembly of functional acetylcholine receptor and suggest a novel mechanism by which receptor synthesis may be controlled post-translationally."
https://openalex.org/W1568009785,"The relationship between adenylate cyclase activity in the synaptic membrane fraction (M1) of rat brain and lipid peroxidation of these membranes was examined. In the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 to 10 microM Fe/+ activated adenylate cyclase 2- to 4-fold. Of several metal ions, Fe2+ was the most effective. Other enzymes in M1, such as Mg2+-ATPase, (Na+-K+)-ATPase, 5'-nucleotidase, acetylcholinesterase, and phosphodiesterase, were not activated by Fe2+ plus DTT. Activation of adenylate cyclase by Fe2+ plus DTT was accompanied by production of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation. Formation of malondialdehyde was completely parallel with enzyme activation. Ascorbic acid or a NADPH system also stimulated enzyme activity and caused lipid peroxidation. Activation of the enzyme and lipid peroxidation induced by Fe2+ plus DTT, ascorbic acid, or NADPH was completely prevented by simultaneous addition of N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. This inhibitor also prevented the decrease in turbidity of the enzyme preparation induced by Fe2+ plus DTT. The stimulatory effects of NaF, guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate and calmodulin, respectively, and that of Fe2+ plus DTT on the enzyme activity were additive. Activation of adenylate cyclase by Fe2+ plus DTT was only observed in brain synaptic membranes, not in erythrocyte ghosts, liver plasma membranes, or cardiac sarcolemma. These results indicate that lipid peroxidation of synaptic membranes was accompanied by specific stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1506656143,"The influence of external Na+ and Ca2+ on the efflux of Ca2+ from highly purified sarcolemmal vesicles isolated from dog ventricles is examined. Na+-Ca2+ exchange is used to initially load the vesicles with Ca2+. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ efflux is activated if a monovalent cation is also present in the efflux medium. The order of potency of monovalent cations in stimulating Ca2+-induced CA2+ efflux is K+ approximately Li+ greater than choline+. Ca2+-induced CA2+ efflux is half-maximal at [Ca2+] = 10 microM and [K+] = 10 mM. Na+ can activate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ efflux, but this is difficult to quantitate as Na+ also induces CA2+ efflux by itself. Na+-induced CA2+ efflux (in the absence of Ca02+) is half-maximal at [Na+] = 12.5 mM. The curve describing the dependence of Ca2+ efflux on [Na+] is sigmoid suggesting the participation of at least 2 Na+ in this process. Unlike Ca2+-induced CA2+ efflux, Na+-induced Ca2+ efflux is independent of the presence of other monovalent cations. The maximal Na+- and CA2+-induced CA2+ effluxes are comparable. Na+ and Ca2+ appear to compete for binding sites which result in induced Ca2+ efflux. The relevance of these findings to Ca2+ efflux studies in intact cardiac tissue is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1532043255,"The present data show that the carboxyl terminal end of the membrane binding segment (nonpolar peptide) of cytochrome b5 is present on the same side of phospholipid bilayers as the hydrophilic, heme-containing, NH2-terminal segment. This orientation was determined by observing rapid ionization of both tyrosyl residues at positions 5 and 8 from the carboxyl terminus upon addition of sodium hydroxide to the outer aqueous phase of vesicle preparations, and the reaction of one of these residues with a polar, impermeant reagent, diazotized sulfanilic acid. The rate of ionization of both aromatic residues occurred at least 1 order of magnitude faster than ionization of indigo trisulfonate trapped in the inner aqueous compartment of the vesicles. These data and consideration of our earlier characterization of cytochrome b5 structure and binding to membranes support a model for the membrane binding segment that is highly structured, penetrates to the middle of the bilayer, and loops back to the outer surface to place both the NH2 and the carboxyl termini on the same surface of the bilayer."

A comparison of the 13C NMR spectra of ribonuclease B and of the model compounds Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man alpha 1 leads to 6 (Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to Asn (Compound A) and Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to Asn (Compound B) indicates that the (Man)5(GlcNAc)2 configuration of Compound A is present as a core structure in ribonuclease B and that only up to about 30% of our sample of ribonuclease B has the (Man)6(GlcNAc)2 structure of Compound B. Spin-lattice relaxation times, nuclear Overhauser enhancements, and linewidths of the carbohydrate carbon resonances of ribonuclease Bm indicate that the mannose residue and the N-acetylglucosamine linked to mannose are undergoing fast internal rotation (at least as fast as the rate of overall molecular tumbling). The terminal mannose residues of ribonuclease B also exhibit fast internal rotation. A comparison of the chemical shifts of the nonprotonated aromatic carbons of ribonuclease B and ribonuclease A strongly suggests that the carbohydrate side chain of ribonuclease B has a negligible effect (overall or localized) on the conformation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1622609979,"We have obtained the first deuterium NMR spectra of an individual membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin in the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium R1. Biosynthetic isotopic enrichment with [gamma-2H6]valine and high field Fourier transform operation permitted rapid data acquisition on intact membranes, including measurement of relaxation times. At some temperatures high quality spectra could be obtained in less than 1 s. [U-14C]Valine tracer studies indicate that less than or equal to 2% of valine added to the growth medium is broken down and incorporated into other membrane constituents. The NMR results indicate that the valine side chain is a rather rigid structure. Motion about C alpha-C beta is slow (less than 10(5) s-1) at growth temperature, While motion about C beta-C gamma is as expected fast (much greater than 10(5) s-1) at all accessible temperatures. The activation energy for methyl group rotation from spin-lattice relaxation data between -75 and 53 degrees C is approximately 2.4 kcal/mol, in good agreement with previous 1H NMR studies on solid alkanes. Preliminary data on [gamma-2H6]valine-labeled Acholeplasma laidlawii B (PG9) cell membranes are also presented. Our results strongly suggest that it should now be possible to observe in great detail the motions of any type of amino acid side chain in membrane proteins, including the effects of lipid composition on protein dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1482411236,"The henny feathering trait in chickens leads to a marked increase in the conversion of androgen to estrogen in skin and other peripheral tissues with the result that feathers of affected males are feminized. To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for this increased estrogen synthesis, we studied the conversion of testosterone to estrogen in fibroblasts cultured from the skin of control chickens and from two breeds carrying the henny feathering trait, the Sebright bantam and the Campine. Estrogen synthesis was measured in suspensions of intact fibroblasts and in cell-free fibroblast extracts by two assays: 1) direct measurement of 17 beta-estradiol formation from [1,2,6,7-3H]testosterone, and 2) assessment of 3H2O release from [1 beta-3H]testosterone. Both assays gave comparable results. Estrogen formation was as much as several hundred-fold higher in fibroblasts cultured from skin of chickens carrying the henny feathering trait compared to that observed in fibroblasts from skin of control chickens. The current data indicate that increased estrogen formation in skin of chickens with the henny feathering trait is due to an enhanced activity of the aromatase complex of enzymes responsible for estrogen synthesis. The molecular basis for this increased activity is unclear."

These results confirm the validity of the NMR approach in determining values of polymer fraction. We have also found that the thermodynamic theory, that successfully describes gelation in sickle erythrocytes, does not predict the experimental results for sickle trait erythrocytes and must be refined."

Phenyl retinal binds at the same site as retinal and supports light-dependent transmembrane proton translocation in phospholipid vesicles that contain bacterio-opsin. This result allows us to rule out proton abstraction from the beta-ionone ring of retinal as a step in the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, phenyl retinal, a planar molecule, binds to the apomembrane more rapidly than retinal, which suggests that the rate-determining step in the binding of retinal itself may be the attainment of a planar molecular configuration. The new chromophore undergoes a pH-dependent spectral shift that is not observed in the native membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1499960285,"Differential scanning calorimetry has been applied to study factors affecting the thermally induced denaturation of cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferase, a dimeric pyridoxal enzyme. The consequences of binding of coenzyme and substrate derivatives to both the apo and holo forms of the enzyme were investigated and are interpreted in terms of the stabilization of the native form of the enzyme. The binding of pyridoxal phosphate coenzyme increases the thermal stability of the apoenzyme by approximately 27 kcal mol-1 as judged by the change in free energy differences between the native and denatured states of the protein. The stabilization produced by coenzyme binding to the apoprotein appears to be primarily due to the Schiff's base and phosphoryl moieties of the coenzyme; association of the pyridine ring component is without significant structural consequence. Pyridoxal phosphate binding to the subunits of the dimer occurs in a noncooperative fashion as judged by the appearance of transitions unique to the apo, holo, and intermediate enzyme forms in a calorimetric titration. Holoenzyme stability depends on the chemical nature of the catalytically significant group occupying the C-4' position of the bound coenzyme. The stabilization afforded by binding of the aldehyde form (pyridoxal phosphate) which exists as an internal Schiff's base with Lys 258 is diminished when this bond is chemically reduced or when the aldehyde is replaced by an amine (pyridoxamine phosphate). Apoenzyme is also shown to be stabilized by the presence of substrates in the absence of coenzyme. The differential scanning calorimetry results thus confirm previous findings derived from nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the ability of apoenzyme to bind substrates (Martinez-Carrion, M. Cheng, S., and Relimpio, A. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2153-2160). Substrates and their analogues perturb the holoenzyme stability and the order of increasing influence on the pyridoxal form of the holoenzyme is aspartate, erythro-hydroxyaspartate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and alpha-methylaspartate. While all these compounds form stable binary enzyme-substrate complexes (Jenkins, W.T., and D'Ari, L. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 541, 5667-5674), the complex with alpha-methylaspartate produces anomalous changes in the protein structure which are reflected in the calorimetric parameters. This suggests that caution be exercised in the use of analogues as substrate substitutes in crystallographic work. Differential scanning calorimetry also appears as a sensitive method with which to study the stereochemical dependence of ligand binding on enzyme-induced thermal stabilization. This is illustrated by the use of 4-carbon dicarboxylic acids where only those in the conformation favorable for binding are effective in stabilizing the holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1591061315,"D-Amino acid transaminase from Bacillus sphaericus shows a deuterium kinetic isotope effect (VH/VD) between 2 and 3 in the transamination of alpha-protio- or alpha-deuterio-D-alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate, suggesting that alpha-proton abstraction is at least partially rate-limiting for this reaction. This transaminase also catalyzes a beta-elimination reaction with substrates such as beta-fluoroalanine with no detectable deuterium isotope effect (VH/BD = 1). These results, taken together with previous work (Soper, T. S., and Manning, J. M. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 3377-3384) suggest that the rate-limiting step in the beta-elimination reaction is solvolysis of an alpha-aminoacrylate-pyridoxal-P Schiff's base intermediate. D-Cycloserine is an active site titrant of D-amino acid transaminase. Inactivation by cycloserine can be completely reversed by dialysis against pyridoxal phosphate at neutral pH. Gabaculine is also an efficient inhibitor of this enzyme and possesses some antibacterial activity. The latter two inhibitors probably act by sequestration of the coenzyme rather than by alkylation of the protein as with the beta-halo derivatives of D-alanine."
https://openalex.org/W1527339772,"Pulse-chase experiments measuring the rates of incorporation of radiolabeled glucosamine and galactose into intracellular vitellogenin show that glycosylation of this multicomponent protein occurs in a Golgi-enriched fraction isolated from homogenized liver slices. No apparent role of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in this process was demonstrable. Kinetics of the intracellular translocation of glycosylated vitellogenin indicate that the galactosylated intermediate is secreted more rapidly than the glucosamine-labeled precursor. This was corroborated by measuring the rates of accumulation of various pulse-labeled forms of vitellogenin in the chase medium. In addition, a negligible amount of mannose was incorporated into intracellular or secreted vitellogenin. The antibiotic tunicamycin was shown to inhibit [3H] glucosamine incorporation into microsomal vitellogenin by 70%, without any significant effect on the synthesis of the protein backbone. In addition, nonglycosylated vitellogenin showed normal secretion kinetics. After suitable pretreatment with the antibiotic followed by a labeling period in tunicamycin-free medium, mannose was still not incorporated into vitellogenin, whereas glucosamine behaved in a typical manner. In contrast to this finding, gas-liquid chromatography of the alditol acetate derivatives of the neutral hexoses of vitellogenin showed that mannose was indeed a major component of the vitellogenin oligosaccharide side chain. These preliminary results indicate that the oligosaccharide component of vitellogenin in Xenopus laevis is a complex type of carbohydrate unit which is linked via an N-glycosidic bond between an asparagine residue and N-acetylglucosamine. With respect to the subcellular localization of glycoprotein assembly in Xenopus liver, there is a significant departure from currently accepted models of glycoprotein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1616798128,"Two fluorescent cholesteryl esters, cholesteryl cis-parinarate and cholestatrienyl oleate, have been incorporated into human serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) by two alternative procedures. The core location of the incorporated cholesterol esters and the surface location of cis-parinaric acid and cholestatrienol are verified by fluorescence energy transfer. In these LDL preparations, the incorporated cholesteryl esters exhibit a temperature-dependent induced circular dichroic spectrum at the absorption wavelengths of the chromophore with a temperature range which is similar to the calorimetrically determined thermal transition of LDL. We also examined the induced circular dichroism which arises when cholestatrienyl oleate is dissolved in pure cholesteryl oleate and observed a temperature dependence of the sign and magnitude of the circular dichroic spectrum which correlated with the temperature range of the calorimetric phase transitions. On the basis of these studies, we conclude that below the calorimetric transition, the cholesteryl esters of low density lipoprotein have an organization which is intermediate between isotropic and cholesteric, while above the transition, the organization is more nearly isotropic. Residual environmental chirality experienced by cholesteryl ester acyl chains (cholesteryl parinarate) in the particle core and free sterol (cholestatrienol) in the particle surface could represent specific lipid-protein interactions. These results are discussed in terms of the organization of low density lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1590497363,"Previous work has shown that the predominant native form of the acetylcholine receptor from the electric tissue of Torpedo californica is a dimer of Mr = 500,000, cross-linked by a disulfide bond between the largest (delta) of the five chains (alpha 2 beta gamma delta) that comprise the monomer. Small-angle neutron scattering of purified receptor dimer in Triton X-100 solution containing 18% D2O, in which the Triton X-100 is contrast-matched, yields a radius of gyration of the dimer of 66 A. Based on the assumptions that the dimer is symmetrical and that the radius of gyration of the monomer does not change in forming dimer, this value, together with the radius of gyration of the receptor monomer (46 A), determined previously, allows the calculation of the distance separating the centers of neutron scattering density of monomers in a dimer; the result is 96 A. Electron microscopy of negatively stained dimers permits an independent measurement of the distance between the apparent centers of mass of the monomers; the average is 96 A, in agreement with the result of the neutron scattering analysis. The electron micrographs of dimer also permit the location of the delta chains at the region of contact of the monomers. A model for the receptor dimer consistent with all available structural information is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1501044949,"Sympathetic neurons in dissociated cell culture release 16-18 soluble proteins into the medium, which appear to be distinct from the cell membrane glycoproteins. The released proteins are major cellular products, comprising 2-3% of the newly synthesized protein. They turn over with a half-life of approximately 9 h. Their release is spontaneous and does not correlate with the release of neurotransmitter. Release occurs from distal axon regions and possibly from cell bodies and dendrites as well. Sympathetic neurons are adrenergic in culture, but become cholinergic if grown in medium conditioned by certain types of non-neuronal cells but not others (Patterson, P. H. (1978) Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1, 1-17). Those conditioned media which induce cholinergic development also dramatically alter the expression of 4 of the 18 released proteins, suggesting a correlation between the expression of these secreted proteins and neurotransmitter choice. Such extracellular proteins may play a part in intercellular communication during the development of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1531285343,"Comparative kinetics studies of ligand dissociation and D2O enhancement were performed with both heterogeneous and homogeneous anti-fluorescyl immunoglobulin G antibodies. Heterogeneous rabbit and homogeneous mouse (monoclonal) antibody preparations were purified by immunoadsorption and found to be pure IgG by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis. Relatively high affinities of all liganded antibody preparations were determined by dissociation rate studies, demonstrating comparatively long lifetimes for the dissociation of bound fluorescein. In addition, rabbit anti-fluorescyl preparations were found to display marked heterogeneity of off-rates while mouse monoclonal anti-fluorescyl preparations exhibited a single off-rate indicating homogeneity. D2O fluorescence enhancement studies showed that heterogeneous kinetics was observed with both heterogeneous and homogeneous antibody active sites. Temperature studies of ligand D2O enhancement and dissociation rates using homogeneous anti-fluorescyl antibodies revealed similar, yet different activation energies (22.7 +/- 0.8 cal and 20.2 +/- 0.3 cal, respectively) for both phenomena. The studies demonstrated that the anti-fluorescein antibody active site consists of both solvent accessible and relatively inaccessible components, and that the binding of ligand involves both exchangeable hydrogen atoms and other as yet unresolved interactions. The mechanism of D2O fluorescence enhancement is discussed in terms of its complexity involving heterogeneous rate mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1527847022,"Ethanol (0.21-0.84 M) added to rabbit reticulocyte lysates results in a 42-89% decrease of polypeptide synthesis following a 60-min incubation at 30 degrees C. The onset of inhibition is preceded by a 5-15-min lag. Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF-2) (85% pure, 0.42-4.2 micrograms added/30-microliters assay) or high concentrations of cAMP, MgGTP, and glucose 6-phosphate (0.55-5.0 mM) partially reverse the inhibition was observed with fructose 6-phosphate (0.55 mM). Ethanol was also shown to directly inhibit ternary complex formation between eIF-2, GTP, and initiator Met-tRNA (50% inhibition with 0.5 M ethanol). The inhibitory effect of ethanol on polypeptide synthesis, however, appears to be independent of its effect on ternary complex formation, and may be related to the activation of a translational inhibitor. This tentative conclusions is based on the following results. First, when the postribosomal supernatant or unfractionated lysate is incubated with ethanol, the supernatant or lysate becomes inhibitory to polypeptide synthesis following a 60-min incubation with ethanol at 30 degrees C. Second, when ethanol-treated postribosomal supernatant is chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose, an inhibitory activity is observed. The peak of inhibition coincides with the elution position of a translational inhibitor termed heme-controlled repressor. Third, pro-heme-controlled repressor becomes more inhibitory to protein synthesis when incubated with ethanol. These findings suggest that ethanol may activate a translational inhibitor by affecting the proper conformational change of a dormant inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W34356235,"Proton NMR spectra at 250 MHz of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, a tetrameric protein of molecular weight 237,000, were obtained with 16 bit A/D conversion in order to study the roles of the histidine residues in catalysis. Six of the 14 histidine residues/subunit gave detectable C-2 proton signals, and three gave C-4 proton signals. Analysis of the upfield shifts of these resonances with increasing pH by least squares computer fitting indicated these signals to arise from single histidines with the following pK' values at 25 C in the presence of the activating monovalent (K+) and divalent (Mg?+) cations: His-1,6.7; His-2,6.3; His-3,6.2; His4, 6.0; His-5, 5.9; and His-6, 5.6. The presence of a saturating level of the substrate P-enolpyruvate resulted in a 0.4 unit decrease in the pK' of His-3 to a value of 5.8, but no significant change in any of the other pK' values. Titration with P-enolpyruvate at a constant pH* (5.8) measuring the upfield shift of the His-3 resonance yielded a dissociation constant for Penolpyruvate (74 2 7 a~) consistent with kinetic and other binding data, indicating active site binding. Both the monovalent (K+) and divalent (M&+) cation activators were found to be essential for the full P-enolpyruvate induced upfield shift. No effects of P-enolpyruvate were noted in the absence of both cations and only small effects of P-enolpyruvate were noted in the presence of either cation activator alone. The metal activators themselves induced smaller upfield shifts of the His-3 resonance. These findings indicate that the decrease in pK' of His-3 induced by the binding of Penolpyruvate results directly from a stronger interaction of the metal ion activators with His-3, in the enzyme-substrate complex, or indirectly from a P-enolpyruvate induced conformational change in the environment of His-3."
https://openalex.org/W1651928788,"In the presence of NADH and O2, 2-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-5-carboxylate oxygenase (EC 1.14.12.4) from Pseudomonas sp. MA-1 catalyzes reductive oxygenation of 2-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-5-carboxylate (Cpd I) to yield alpha-N-(acetylaminomethylene)succinic acid (Cpd A). Steady state kinetic data and studies with alternate substrates are consistent only with an ordered mechanism in which Cpd I binds first, followed by NADH; the first product, NAD+, is then released. This event is followed by oxygen binding, and finally release of the oxygenated and reduced cleavage product, Cpd A. This kinetic mechanism was confirmed by studying inhibition by NAD+, which binds competitively with oxygen, but not with NADH. The kinetic mechanism of this reaction resembles that proposed for bacterial flavin monooxygenases that catalyze hydroxylation of aromatic homocyclic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1490547568,"The nature and accessibility of Tyr 82 were studied by fluorimetry and ultraviolet spectroscopy. A strongly emitting residue was indicated by the fluorescence yield measurement. Lowering of fluorescence yield in the presence of guanidine may be suggestive of the location of the tyrosine residue in a helical environment. The addition of external quenchers, Cs+, I-, and phosphate, to adrenodoxin lowered its fluorescence intensity showing the accessibility of Tyr 82. For solvent perturbation studies using ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol as perturbants, spectral changes were induced in adrenodoxin which gave rise to difference spectra attributable to the tyrosine residue. In addition, the spectrophotometric titration of tyrosine in adrenodoxin showed a normal titration curve with an estimated pK of 10.4. These results can be explained in terms of an accessible tyrosine residue that is partially blocked from solute and solvent perturbation. The secondary structure of adrenodoxin was studied by the method of Chou and Fasman (Chou, P. Y., and Fasman, G. D. (1978) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 47, 251-276) for the empirical predictions of protein conformations. The prediction shows a protein with moderately high amount of ordered structures (25% alpha-helix and 37% beta-sheet) and the tyrosine residue at position 82 in a helical environment."

https://openalex.org/W1540194296,"Equilibrium sedimentation experiments of the native acid phosphatase indicate a dimer-tetramer dissociating nonequilibrating system with a dimer Mr = 180,000 g/mol. The hydrolysis of nitrophenylphosphate was used to determine the sedimentation coefficient of the active species. The s20,w value for the species which degrades nitrophenylphosphate is 13.52 +/- 0.46 S in 1% sucrose and 13.72 +/- 0.11 S in 1.3 M sodium chloride, corresponding to the Svedberg value of the tetramer species. Several lines of evidence are presented which, together with previous data, indicate that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe nonspecific acid phosphatase is composed of 4 identical or nearly identical polypeptide chains: a, equilibrium sedimentation analysis of the enzyme in denaturing agents indicates the presence of homogeneous material having Mr = 90,800 g/mol; b, digestion with carboxypeptidase A releases 0.82 mol of tyrosine/monomer molecular weight. Concomitant phosphatase inactivation occurred during the splitting off of the tyrosyl terminal residue. Furthermore, a unique NH2-terminal residue (histidine) was determined."

https://openalex.org/W1591451893,"We have analyzed the alterations that occur in the patterns of protein synthesis of Tetrahymena thermophila cells when these cells are exposed to a sublethal heat treatment. At least 11 major polypeptides, ranging in size from 97,000 to 27,000 daltons, are produced when the incubation temperature of Tetrahymena cultures is raised from 29 to 41 degrees C. The kinetics of appearance and disappearance appears to differ for each one of these heat-induced polypeptides, suggesting that elaborate mechanisms might operate in the regulation of the expression of this group of genes."

The enzyme can first be detected in 2-day-old embryos, at approximately the same time as the first detectable embryonic immunoglobulin and well before the appearance of the thymus. Xenopus TdT has been partially purified and some of its properties have been investigated. The partially purified enzyme is 68,000 daltons in size, as measured by gel filtration, and cross-reacts immunologically with anti-calf thymus TdT."
https://openalex.org/W1962965340,"Met-192 forms part of the binding crevice of alpha-chymotrypsin. The aim of this investigation was to find a nucleophile that would displace a methyl group from the sulfonium cation of [S-[13C]methylmethionine-192]-alpha-chymotrypsin without disrupting the five disulfide bridges of the protein, thereby producing [[epsilon-13C]methionine-192]-alpha-chymotrypsin, an isotopically enriched version of the native enzyme desirable for 13C NMR studies. Treatment of [S-methylmethionine-192]-alpha-chymotrypsin with mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol failed to produce the latter protein, as deduced from elution profiles of reaction mixtures chromatographed on affinity columns of immobilized lima bean trypsin inhibitor. In contrast, when [S-methylmethionine-192]-alpha-chymotrypsin was incubated in a 3.0 mM solution of the active site-directed reagent 2-mercaptoacetyl-4'-methoxyanilide at pH 8.6 and 5 degrees C for 48 h, affinity chromatograms indicated the presence of a protein corresponding to native alpha-chymotrypsin. Upon repeating the experiment with [S-[13C]methylmethionine-192]-alpha chymotrypsin, we isolated in 40% yield a protein which was identified as [[epsilon-13C]methionine-192]-alpha-chymotrypsin by a combination of 13C NMR and chemical criteria. This work represents the first active site-directed demethylation of an S-[13C]methylmethionine residue at the binding site of an enzyme."
