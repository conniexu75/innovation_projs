https://openalex.org/W1996884853,"The term ""Hoabinhian"" has been applied to ""mesolithic"" assemblages from all parts of mainland Southeast Asia. Recent excavation in north Thailand has yielded the first associated carbon-14 dates and provided evidence for the early (about 7000 B. C.) domestication of plants in Southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2073424122,"Meteorological satellites have provided the first complete data on energy exchange between earth and space. The planetary albedo is 29 percent for the mean annual case, and the entire earth-atmosphere system is in near radiative equilibrium. More energy is absorbed in tropical regions than previously believed, and major energy source and sink regions exist within latitude belts."
https://openalex.org/W2096561524,"Many intact axial units, with attached basal plates, are found in spermatozoa of Childia groenlandica negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid. Electron micrographs show a total of nine doublet microtubules, confirming observations on sectioned material, where nine peripheral doublets, but no single central ones, occurred. Living spermatozoa move by waves progressing along a double undulating membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2113904782,A mycelium with clamp connections and chlamydospores has been discovered within the wood of a Middle Pennsylvanian fern. This suggests that forms extant in the middle of the Pennsylvanian had life cycles conparable to some modern Basidiomnycetes.
https://openalex.org/W2028738245,"Marine paleotemperatures, determined by oxygen isotope measurement, show that Australasian Tertiary penguins, including giant forms, lived in warm to tropical environments. Evolution from smaller species also occurred in warm environments. Mid-Tertiary fluctuations of sea temperature were controlled by alternating uplift and erosion of ""Tasmantis,"" an unstable meridional landmass occupying and extending beyond the present position of New Zealand."

https://openalex.org/W2015766529,"A nondimensional number called the Jeffreys number, which represents the ratio of the Reynolds number to the Froude number, is useful in geophysical problems related to the motion of viscous masses under gravity. The Jetireys number is used to show that it is impossible for the lunar maria to be underlain by a layer of material 1 kilometer thick having the plastic properties of ice."
