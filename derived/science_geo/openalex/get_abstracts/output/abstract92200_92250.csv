https://openalex.org/W2074563618,"We have screened a cDNA library for gene sequences that are regulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in BALB/c-3T3 cells. Of 8000 clones screened, less than 14 independent PDGF-inducible sequences were found. Two of these (KC and JE) were studied in detail. By hybrid-selection and translation the KC and JE mRNAs encode 10,000 and 19,000 dalton polypeptides, respectively. In the absence of PDGF, the JE and KC sequences correspond to low abundance mRNAs. One hour after addition of PDGF their abundance level can be increased 10- to 20-fold. Within 4 hr, a 60-fold induction of JE can be attained. Nanogram per ml quantities of pure PDGF regulate these sequences whereas microgram/ml quantities of chemically unrelated mitogens (EGF, insulin, or platelet-poor plasma) have either a weak or an undetectable effect. Inhibitors of protein synthesis block the progression of quiescent 3T3 cells through G1 into S phase; however these drugs do not block the induction of KC and JE by PDGF. This result indicates that these sequences correspond to ""early genes"" which are not induced as a consequence of cell growth, but rather are directly regulated by PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W2056135328,"The responses of superior colliculus cells to a given sensory stimulus were influenced by the presence or absence of other sensory cues. By pooling sensory inputs, many superior colliculus cells seem to amplify the effects of subtle environmental cues in certain conditions, whereas in others, responses to normally effective stimuli can be blocked. The observations illustrate the dynamic, interactive nature of the multisensory inputs which characterize the deeper laminae of the superior colliculus."
https://openalex.org/W2092216600,"The adenovirus type 5 E1A transcriptional control region contains an element with enhancer properties located between -141 and -305 relative to the E1A cap site at +1. The enhancer element is located at or very close to a sequence required in cis for packaging of viral DNA. Deletion of the element reduces both the rate of transcription and steady-state levels of E1A mRNAs in virus-infected cells. Such deletions also cause a modest reduction in activity of the E1B transcription unit, which is located immediately downstream of the E1A unit. The enhancer element includes repeated core sequences. Function is retained when the element is moved to the 3' side of the E1A gene in either possible orientation, and the E1A enhancer functions in cis to enhance transformation by the herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene in both mouse and human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069218764,A decreased noradrenaline turnover in the hypothalami of rats was observed at the peak of the immune response to sheep red blood cells. The decrease in noradrenergic neuronal activity was mimicked by injection of soluble r mediators released by immunological cells activated in vitro. Noradrenaline also tended to decrease in the brainstem but not in the residual brain. It is suggested that products released from activated immunological cells during the immune response may induce the previously described autonomic and endocrine mechanisms that contribute to immunoregulation.
https://openalex.org/W2071780639,"Mammalian neurons can synthesize choline by methylating phosphatidylethanolamine and hydrolyzing the resulting phosphatidylcholine. This process is stimulated by catecholamines. The phosphatidylethanolamine is synthesized in part from phosphatidylserine; hence the amino acids methionine (acting after conversion to S-adenosylmethionine) and serine can be the ultimate precursors of choline. Brain choline concentrations are generally higher than plasma concentrations, but depend on plasma concentrations because of the kinetic characteristics of the blood-brain-barrier transport system. When cholinergic neurons are activated, acetylcholine release can be enhanced by treatments that increase plasma choline (for example, consumption of certain foods)."
https://openalex.org/W2008478368,"Placental and fetal tissues from 46 human pregnancies were cultured and cytogenetically analyzed in an attempt to document the existence of chromosomal mosaicism confined strictly to tissues of extraembryonic origin. In two gestations in which chromosomal mosaicism was found, it was expressed exclusively in placental chorionic cells and was not detected in cells derived from the embryo proper. This demonstration of confined chorionic mosaicism may have implications for the understanding of the fetoplacental unit and for prenatal diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2065082965,"Memory may fail in a variety of ways. Patients with Korsakoff's syndrome demonstrate global memory deficits similar to those seen in patients with early progressive dementia. Korsakoff's patients, however, may recall rules and principles for organizing information and can gain access to their previously acquired knowledge (semantic memory), whereas recent memory may be grossly impaired. In contrast, dementia patients may have little access to previously acquired knowledge and therefore have great difficulty in organizing and encoding ongoing events. These contrasting forms of memory failure have implications for understanding the structure and mechanisms of memory and learning, particularly the relationship between episodic and semantic memory, as well as the development of therapeutic strategies for cognitive impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2140964058,"We have used electric dichroism to study the arrangement of nucleosomes in 30 nm chromatin solenoidal fibers prepared from a variety of sources (CHO cells, HeLa cells, rat liver, chicken erythrocytes, and sea urchin sperm) in which the nucleosome spacer length varies from ∼10 to ∼80 bp. Field-free relaxation times are consistent only with structures containing 6 ± 1 nucleosomes for every 11 nm of solenoidal length. With very few assumptions about the arrangement of the spacer DNA, our dichroism data are consistent with the same orientation of the chromatosomes for every chromatin sample examined. This orientation, which maintains the faces of the radially arranged chromatosomes inclined at an angle between 20°–33° to the solenoid axis, thus appears to be a general structural feature of the higher order chromatin fiber."
https://openalex.org/W2144241955,"Cruciform formation in a pBR322 derivative containing a 68 base pair perfect palindromic sequence has been studied. In relaxed DNA the cruciform is unstable by about 17 kcal mole-1 in free energy. In a supercoiled DNA with a negative specific linking difference (superhelical density) of 0.03 or higher, however, the cruciform becomes the stable species. Nevertheless, even at native superhelical densities (typically around -0.06), cruciform formation is extremely slow, unless the DNA is subjected to conditions that destabilize base pairing. When precautions are taken to avoid artificial triggering of cruciform formation, the 68 bp perfect palindrome-containing plasmid isolated from cells is devoid of the cruciform. The rate of disappearance of the cruciform in linear DNA and the deletion of the palindromic sequence in vivo have also been examined."
https://openalex.org/W2118805711,"Optical transforms were used to compute the power spectra of rhesus cones treated as arrays of image sampling points. Spectra were obtained for the central fovea, parafovea, periphery, and far periphery. All were consistent with a novel spatial sampling principle that introduces minimal noise for spatial frequencies below the Nyquist limits implied by local receptor densities, while frequencies above the nominal Nyquist limits are not converted into conspicuous moire patterns, but instead are scattered into broadband noise. This sampling scheme allows the visual system to escape aliasing distortion despite a large mismatch between retinal image bandwidth and the Nyquist limits implied by extrafoveal cone densities."
https://openalex.org/W2080977352,"Naltrexone, an opiate antagonist, had both stimulatory and inhibitory effects, depending on the dosage, on the growth of S20Y neuroblastoma in A/Jax mice. Daily injections of 0.1 milligram of naltrexone per kilogram of body weight, which blocked morphine-induced analgesia for 4 to 6 hours per day, resulted in a 33 percent tumor incidence, a 98 percent delay in the time before tumor appearance, and a 36 percent increase in survival time. Neuroblastoma-inoculated mice receiving 10 milligrams of naltrexone per kilogram, which blocked morphine-induced analgesia for 24 hours per day, had a 100 percent tumor incidence, a 27 percent reduction in the time before tumor appearance, and a 19 percent decrease in survival time. Inoculation of neuroblastoma cells in control subjects resulted in 100 percent tumor incidence within 29 days. These results show that naltrexone can modulate tumor response and suggest a role for the endorphin-opiate receptor system in neuro-oncogenic events."
https://openalex.org/W1998385486,"At early times after adenovirus infection, transcription from all early viral promoters requires the expression of a 289 amino acid phosphoprotein encoded in the pre-early transcription unit E1A. Mutations in E1A result in a marked delay in the induction of early viral transcription. To distinguish between possible models that could account for this delayed transcription, superinfection experiments were performed. Cells were first infected with one E1A mutant, incubated until viral transcription was detectable, and then superinfected with a second E1A mutant with distinguishable transcripts from early region 3 (E3). We found that the second virus to infect the cell recapitulated the delayed transcription induction of E3. Therefore, the delayed expression of early regions after infection with E1A mutants is the result of a time-dependent cis-acting modification of the template. Models which can account for these observations and for the function of E1A protein are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2021065971,"Since it has been postulated that liver hepatocytes may become infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vivo through direct contact with infected macrophages, the possibility that a circulating cell of hematopoietic origin might be susceptible to infection with HBV was investigated. Cells positive for HBV surface antigen were identified in aspirates of bone marrow cells from people infected with HBV. These cells were used to prepare a lymphoblastoid suspension culture that contains HBV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965735681,"Isolated umbilical arteries and veins, obtained from normal women at the end of pregnancy, were incubated in krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution and exposed to magnesium at concentrations ranging from 0 to 9.6 millimoles per liter. The basal tension of the vessels increased when magnesium was withdrawn and decreased when the concentration of magnesium was raised. Absence of magnesium in the medium significantly potentiated the contractile response of the vessels to bradykinin, angiotensin II, serotonin, and prostaglandin F2 alpha. It appears that magnesium deficiency may be responsible for spasms of umbilical and placental vasculature. Our findings may provide a rationale for why magnesium sulfate is an effective therapy in preeclamptic syndromes in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W1997702748,"Stress development depended on calcium-stimulated myosin phosphorylation in an arterial smooth muscle preparation in which the concentration of calcium was controlled. However, developed stress was maintained at a concentration of calcium that did not support phosphorylation. These results, in conjunction with other evidence, suggest that the interaction of two regulatory mechanisms with different calcium sensitivities regulate both stress and the rate and energetics of contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1585616250,"We have previously shown that cultured macrophages secrete lipoprotein lipase (LPL) into the culture medium. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the role of LPL in the uptake of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Both J774 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages took up and degraded normotriglyceridemic VLDL in a saturable manner. Uptake of VLDL was effectively competed for by rabbit beta-VLDL, human VLDL, but not by native LDL or acetyl LDL. LPL activity accelerated saturable uptake of VLDL but was not a prerequisite for it. This was most clearly seen in experiments with apo-C-II-deficient VLDL. Although no hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride occurred, saturable uptake and degradation of the C-II-deficient lipoprotein occurred. However, addition of apo-C-II enhanced saturable uptake. Normal VLDL also promoted cellular accumulation of both triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Accumulation of triglyceride occurred by uptake of intact VLDL particles, by uptake of a triglyceride-depleted particle produced by the action of LPL, and by the direct uptake of free fatty acids generated by the activity of LPL. In turn, the latter process was influenced by the amount of albumin in the medium capable of being an acceptor for free fatty acids. Finally, we have shown that when albumin is present in the medium, the macrophage is capable of mobilizing most of its stored triglyceride over 24 h, even as its cholesteryl ester content remains constant. These studies may be relevant to the ability of VLDL to promote macrophage accumulation of cholesteryl ester, even as triglyceride accumulation is minimized."
https://openalex.org/W2041860136,Young deaf children who were unable to acquire oral language naturally and who had not been exposed to a conventional manual language were found to use spontaneously a gesture system that has some of the structural characteristics of early child language. The structural aspects of this gesture system appeared to be neither modeled for the child by the gestures of an adult nor shaped by the responses of an adult. These findings suggest that the child may contribute to structural aspects of the system.

https://openalex.org/W1509841066,"A series of seven hemeproteins, cytochromes P-450LM2, P-450LM4, and P-420LM2, horseradish peroxidase, chloroperoxidase, catalase, and metmyoglobin, as well as hemin were tested for their ability to catalyze a set of five oxidative reactions. These reactions were a typical peroxidative reaction (oxidation of pyrogallol to purpurogallin) and three characteristic P-450 reactions (aliphatic hydroxylation, aromatic hydroxylation, and olefinic epoxidation). In addition, the ability to decarboxylate a peroxyacid was measured. All hemeproteins were able to carry out peroxidation, but three (horseradish peroxidase, chloroperoxidase, and catalase) were much better catalysts than the others. Only the P-450 enzymes were competent catalysts for the hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions. Furthermore, the decarboxylation reaction was strictly limited to the P-450 enzymes, establishing it as a new, unique P-450 activity. Since the decarboxylation of peroxyacids is diagnostic of peroxide homolysis, these results indicate a fundamentally different manner of processing of peroxides by cytochrome P-450 than by the peroxidases. Thus, the possibility of close similarity of reactive oxygen intermediates in the two series is called into question."
https://openalex.org/W2035475711,"Adenovirus 2 large plaque (lp) mutants produce large clear plaques on human KB cells. These mutants are shown to be defective in inducing transformation of the established rat embryo cell line 3Y1. The lp mutation was localized within one of the two transforming early gene blocks, E1b (map position 4.5 to 11.2) which codes for two major T antigens of 53 kd and 19 kd by marker transfer. The mutational defects in mutants lp3 and lp5 were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis and by analysis of viral E1 proteins. These results reveal that lp3 and lp5 mutations map within the 19 kd tumor antigen coding region. Mutant lp3 has a single base pair change at the N terminus of 19 kd polypeptide, resulting in the substitution of valine for alanine. Mutant lp5 has two mutational changes, one of which results in the substitution of tyrosine for aspartic acid near the N-terminal region. The second mutation changes the termination codon into a leucine codon, increasing the size of the 19 kd tumor antigen. These results provide direct genetic evidence for an essential role of the 19 kd tumor antigen in cell transformation and indicate that the N-terminal region of the 19 kd tumor antigen is an essential functional domain for the induction of cell transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2045914711,"Pregnant rats received 2-[14C]deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) intravenously on the last day of gestation, and their fetuses were delivered 1 hour later by cesarean section. Fetal brains showed high 2DG uptake spread throughout the accessory olfactory bulb and little or no differential uptake in the main olfactory bulb. These findings demonstrate that functional activity occurs in the accessory olfactory bulb in utero and suggest that the accessory olfactory system may be the pathway by which fetal rats detect the odor quality of their intrauterine milieu."
https://openalex.org/W2000464328,"Local cerebral blood flow was measured in rats by the 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine technique with quantitative autoradiography during the processing of environmental stimuli. Presentation of a tone increased blood flow in the auditory but not the visual pathway. When the animal had previously been conditioned to fear the tone, blood flow additionally increased in the hypothalamus and amygdala. Local cerebral blood flow can thus be used to detect patterns of cerebral excitation associated with transient (30- to 40-second) mental events in experimental animals."
https://openalex.org/W1559493624,"Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis by 3-aminobenzamide in various human and hamster cells influenced the responses to DNA damage from methyl methanesulfonate, but not from ultraviolet light. After exposure to methyl methanesulfonate, 3-aminobenzamide increased the strand break frequency in all cell types studied, but only stimulated repair replication in lymphoid and HeLa cells, suggesting these are independent effects. 3-Aminobenzamide also inhibited the pathway for de novo synthesis of DNA purines, suggesting that some of its effects may be due to disturbance of precursor pathways and irrelevant to the role of poly(ADP-ribose) in repair. Previous claims that 3-aminobenzamide stimulates repair synthesis after exposure to UV light are probably artifacts, because the stimulations are only observed in lymphocytes in the presence of a high concentration of hydroxyurea that itself inhibits repair. The initial inhibition of semiconservative DNA synthesis and the excision of the major alkylation products and pyrimidine dimers were unaffected by 3-aminobenzamide. In general poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis appears to be uniquely involved in regulating the ligation stage of repair of alkylation damage but not ultraviolet damage. By regulating the ligation efficiency, poly(ADP-ribosylation) modulates the dynamic balance between incision and ligation, so as to minimize the frequency of DNA breaks. The ligation stage of repair of UV damage appears different and is not regulated by poly(ADP-ribosylation)."
https://openalex.org/W1514327970,"Active transport of aspartate by neuronal synapses has been studied using preparations of synaptosomes from rat forebrain. The maximal accumulation of labeled D-aspartate [( Asp]i/[Asp]o) was observed to increase as the second power of the transmembrane electrical potential (measured by the potassium ion concentration gradient [( K+]i/[K+]o], which indicates that aspartate is transported with a net charge of +2. The aspartate gradient also increased as the second power of the sodium ion gradient, indicating that two Na+ are transported inward with each aspartate. Measurement of total intra- and extrasynaptosomal aspartate (L-aspartate) and the specific activities of each after adding labeled D-aspartate shows the presence of two intrasynaptosomal pools, a rapidly exchanging pool in which the L-aspartate is dependent on [Na+] and [K+] in the same manner as described for D-aspartate and a slowly exchanging pool essentially insensitive to [Na+] and [K+]. Maximal activation of uptake with 50 microM aspartate causes an alkalinization of the external medium which suggests that H+ is taken up with the aspartate (or OH- is ejected) to neutralize the negative charge of aspartate at physiological pH values. The data are consistent with the transport process being: Asp- + H+ + 2Na+ o = Asp- + H+ + 2Nai+. These stoichiometries can explain the energetics of both in vitro and in vivo uptake of aspartate by the high affinity, [Na+]- and [K+]-dependent system."
https://openalex.org/W1981437143,A neuron's competence to form electrical synapses depends on its growth status. Experiments in situ and in cell culture with identified neurons of the snail Helisoma demonstrate that active neurite outgrowth from both potential partners must be spatially and temporally coincident for electrical synapse formation to occur.
https://openalex.org/W2004242458,The short wavelength color mechanism in the human visual system can distinguish gratings from uniform fields of the same average radiance at spatial frequencies that are twice as high as the highest at which it can resolve bars in the grating. This discrimination above the resolution limit is associated with a splotchy or mottled appearance of the grating similar to two-dimensional noise. The most plausible explanation for the mottled pattern is that it is a moiré pattern produced by aliasing (spatial undersampling) by an irregular and sparse mosaic of short wavelength cones.
https://openalex.org/W1968054528,"Of 76 cutaneously activated neurons recorded from the ventral posterior thalamus of awake, behaving monkeys, nine were weakly excited by innocuous skin stimulation and responded maximally only when noxious mechanical cutaneous stimuli were delivered within small, contralateral receptive fields. These results show that neurons capable of encoding the spatial and temporal features of noxious stimuli are located in the ventral posterior thalamus of the awake primate."
https://openalex.org/W2033857808,"Female macaque monkeys self-administered high doses of alcohol (2.9 to 4.4 grams per kilogram per day) for 3 to 6½ months. Amenorrhea, atrophy of the uterus, decreased ovarian mass, and significant depression of luteinizing hormone levels were associated with chronic alcohol intoxication. Reproductive system failure in female primates following self-induced dependence on alcohol parallels the results of clinical studies of alcoholic women."
https://openalex.org/W1517412176,"We have addressed the question of the possible presence of calcium-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (Ca2+-PL protein kinase) activity in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells, and if this activity might be altered during differentiation to a parietal endoderm cell type. Undifferentiated nullipotent F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, as well as differentiated parietal endoderm cells (PYS-2), were utilized. Using an in vitro assay with histone H1 as phosphate acceptor, Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity could not be found in the 100,000 X g supernatant prepared from either cell type. However, passage of 100,000 X g supernatant from PYS cells over a DEAE-cellulose column revealed Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity which eluted with 0.045 M NaCl. The partially purified PYS enzyme has an approximate Mr = 70,000 as determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, and exhibits an apparent Ka for Ca2+ of 32 microM. The PYS Ca2+-PL protein kinase also exhibits a requirement for Mg2+, with maximal activity noted at 10 mM Mg2+. This enzyme is stimulated by acidic phospholipids, while neutral phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine have little effect. Diacylglycerol markedly increased histone H1 phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid. Unlike that of PYS cells, when the 100,000 X g supernatant prepared from F9 cells was passed over a DEAE-cellulose column no Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity could be found in the eluted fractions. Previously it has been reported that exposure of F9 cells to all-trans-retinoic acid induces differentiation to a parietal endoderm cell type. Treatment of F9 cells with 0.1 microM retinoic acid provoked a time-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity as measured after DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the 100,000 X g supernatant. This increase in Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity correlates with differentiation to the parietal endoderm cell type. These findings indicate that cytosolic Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity is very low, or nonexistent, in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma stem cells. With differentiation to a parietal endoderm cell type there is a marked increase in soluble Ca2+-PL protein kinase activity which exhibits properties similar to those described for this enzyme in other differentiated tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1557514180,"Rabbit liver cytochrome b5 was reconstituted into vesicles containing dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the radioactively labeled photoactivatable 1-palmitoyl-2-omega-(m-diazirinophenoxy)undecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC-I) by the cholate-gel filtration method. The cytochrome inserted predominantly in the nontransferable form (Preparation I). In addition, reconstituted vesicles containing asymmetrically distributed radioactively labeled PC-I were prepared by the use of the phosphatidylcholine transfer protein. This preparation (Preparation II) contained [14C]PC-I in the outer leaflet and [3H]PC-I predominantly in the inner leaflet. Following photolysis of the labeled vesicle preparations, the purified cross-linked products were analyzed for the distribution of the sites of cross-links. In Preparation I, a broad distribution (Asn-105 to Met-130) was found, similar to that observed with the transferable form. On the other hand, the peptide fragments obtained from the asymmetrically labeled preparation II showed 14C/3H ratios which decreased in going from Asn-105 to Met-130. We conclude that the membrane-embedded segment in the nontransferable form of cytochrome b5 spans the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1988974352,"Double-stranded cDNA from the maturation (or A2) protein gene of the RNA bacteriophage Q beta has been cloned such that its expression is regulated by the E. coli lac promoter/operator. Induction of the A2 clone is lethal to the host. The basis of this lethality is cell lysis, which is correlated with synthesis of the A2 protein. No other major proteins appear to be made from the A2 gene when inducer is added. Plasmid-derived A2 protein specifically complements infecting Q beta A2 amber mutants. Lysis activity is abolished in clones that synthesize truncated or internally deleted A2 polypeptides ranging from 10% to 95% of the length of wild-type protein. We conclude that host lysis is promoted by the maturation protein itself, rather than by a separate lysis protein. The A2 protein probably allows for the release of progeny Q beta phage particles following normal infection."
https://openalex.org/W1987904181,"The major histone gene repeat (h22) of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris is transiently expressed for several hours during early embryonic development. Several major alterations in chromatin structure coincide with changes in the pattern of early histone gene expression and are reversed later. During the early (128-cell) blastula stages when h22 DNA is maximally expressed, promoter regions of all five histone genes are sensitive to both micrococcal nuclease and DNAase I. Hypersensitivity to micrococcal nuclease remains the same throughout the early hours of development, but disappears abruptly at hatching blastula stage when transcription has completely ceased. Some sequences near the 3' end of active histone genes are very resistant to micrococcal nuclease cutting and map just downstream of the inverted DNA repeats essential for generating faithful 3' ends of histone mRNAs. These same histone DNA sequences are readily cut in free DNA or when histone genes are transcriptionally inactive."
https://openalex.org/W2031670682,"Sex in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is normally determined by a genic balance mechanism1, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, so that XX animals are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and X0 animals are males2,3. However, recessive mutations of the autosomal gene tra-1 III cause both XX and X0 animals to develop into males4, and a linked dominant mutation causes both XX and X0 animals to develop into females5. Here I show that these two kinds of mutation are allelic, and that stable mutant strains can be constructed in which sex is determined not by X-chromosome dosage but by the presence or absence of a single active gene. In these strains the autosomes carrying the tra-1 locus are in effect homomorphic Z and W sex chromosomes, and the sexes are homogametic ZZ males and heterogametic ZW females, in contrast to the wild-type arrangement of homogametic XX hermaphrodites and heterogametic X0 males."

This experiment demonstrated that the rate at which synapses were replaced by sprouting after a lesion declined dramatically from 35 to 90 days of age. Thus, the juvenile period of the rat's life is marked by a considerable change in neuronal plasticity. This may be related to age-dependent effects in recovery from brain damage."

https://openalex.org/W2007265434,"We have previously identified T4 late promoters governing the in vivo expression of T4 late genes 23 and 24 (P23 and P24). T4 late transcription in vivo is known to involve the binding of at least five phage-coded proteins to the bacterial RNA polymerase and normally requires concurrent DNA replication for DNA template activation. We show here that in vitro transcription, primarily of plasmids carrying T4 genes 23 and 24, by RNA polymerase purified from Escherichia coli at late times after T4 infection allows specific initiation at P23 and P24 in the absence of DNA replication. These promoters are not utilized by E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme, by RNA polymerase core, or by T4-modified RNA polymerase purified from cells infected with a T4 gene 55 mutant (gene 55 codes for an RNA polymerase binding protein required for late transcription). The utilization of P23 and P24 in vitro is sharply inhibited by NaCl concentrations greater than 100 mM, and this inhibition is partly reversed by the addition of 10% DMSO. Relaxation of plasmid DNA containing P23 (with topoisomerase I) reduces P23 utilization at low salt (50 mM Na+) and nearly abolishes it at high salt (250 mM Na+). P23 utilization is discernible in linear, glucosylated hydroxymethylcytosine-containing T4 virion DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1558206557,"The cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus H were found to contain mannosamine in an amount (28.1 nmol/mg) comparable to the content of muramic acid 6-phosphate. The acidic polymer fraction obtained by heating the cell walls at pH 2.5 was shown to contain mannosamine and glycerol in addition to the components of ribitol teichoic acid. Mild alkali treatment of this polymer fraction followed by gel filtration resulted in separation of a disaccharide N-acetylmannosaminyl(1 leads to 4)N-acetylglucosamine and the ribitol teichoic acid moiety that contained glycerol. Smith degradation of the reduction product from the same polymer fraction gave a fragment characterized as (1,2-ethylene-diol phosphate)-(glycerol phosphate)3-N-acetylmannosaminyl(1 leads to 4)N-acetylxylosaminitol. Thus, the ribitol teichoic acid chain in the cell walls is probably linked to peptidoglycan through a linkage unit, (glycerol phosphate)3-N-acetylmannosaminyl(1 leads to 4)N-acetylglucosamine."

https://openalex.org/W1532147221,"The fatty acid specificity of the bile salt-activated lipase purified from human milk was studied using C12 to C54 (total acyl carbon) saturated and the C54 unsaturated triacylglycerols. Kinetic studies indicated that the short chain triacylglycerols were hydrolyzed more readily than the long chain triacylglycerols, and that the long chain unsaturated triacylglycerols were attacked more readily than the long chain saturated triacylglycerols. This fatty acid specificity was also apparent intramolecularly, both short chain and unsaturated fatty acids being released at higher rates than the saturated long chain acids. The enzyme possessed neither positional specificity nor stereospecificity as indicated by the nearly simultaneous appearance of the sn-1,2-, sn-2,3-, and sn-1,3-dioleoylglycerols from trioleoylglycerol. The hydrolyses of these three ester bonds were approximately at their anticipated chemical reactivities. Synthetic rac-1-monooleoylglycerols were hydrolyzed about 2 times faster than the sn-2-monooleoylglycerols. It is concluded that the bile salt-activated lipase may possess a special potential for a rapid release of short chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids from dietary triacylglycerols in the intestinal lumen of infants."

This suggests that administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan could be used as the basis of a clinical test of pineal function and that melatonin might mediate some clinical effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan.
https://openalex.org/W1493825085,"Reduced thyroglobulins from several animal species contain hormone-rich iodopeptides of 20,000-26,000 and 15,000-18,000 daltons. The present study has investigated the role of iodination in their production. Experimental approaches have included: iodination in vitro of thyroglobulin from rabbit thyroid slices incubated with [3H]leucine and subsequent analysis of 3H distribution by gel electrophoresis; iodination in vitro of low iodine thyroglobulin from a human goiter, followed by isolation of the major iodopeptides and quantitation of their peptide content; and injection of iodine-deficient rats with Na125I and assessment of the distribution of isotope among the iodopeptides at successive time intervals. From these experiments the following general pattern has emerged: 1) at low levels of iodine (less than 5 atoms/molecule of thyroglobulin) in vitro or at short time intervals after iodine administration in vivo (less than 4 h), the principal iodinated component of reduced thyroglobulin is a approximately 230,000-dalton peptide; 2) with moderate increases in iodine (5-40 atoms/molecule) or longer time intervals after administration (greater than or equal to 4 h) there is less of the 230,000-dalton iodopeptide, and an iodothyronine-rich approximately 20,000- to 26,000-dalton iodopeptide appears; 3) at higher levels of iodine (greater than 40 atoms/molecule) the amount of approximately 230,000-dalton iodopeptide decreases further, the amount of 20,000- to 26,000-dalton iodopeptides may decrease, and an iodothyronine-rich 15,000- to 18,000-dalton peptide appears. Progressive iodination gives the same changes in distribution of peptide material among these iodopeptides as it does in iodine distribution, and the changes seen with iodination in vitro are similar to those occurring over time in vivo. We conclude that during the process of iodination discrete peptide bonds of thyroglobulin are cleaved to produce the hormone-rich iodopeptides. This is probably a normal part of thyroglobulin maturation in vivo and may be a necessary event preceding hormone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2142833009,"Fracture-label, a method that permits the cytochemical characterization of faces produced by freezefracture, was used to determine the partition and distribution of a glycolipid on membrane fracture faces of Acanthamoeba castellanii cells. After treatment with concanavalin A (Con A), the glycolipid (a lipophosphonoglycan, LPG) was labeled with colloidal gold coated with horseradish peroxidase. The label was abundant over exoplasmic fracture faces (face E) of plasma membranes, but absent from protoplasmic fracture faces (face P). We conclude that, in A. castellanii, glycolipid molecules are restricted to the outer half of the plasma membrane. This conclusion is confirmed by experiments with cells disrupted by freezing and thawing, where access of label to the cell interior did not result in labeling of the inner surface. Our results establish the exclusive localization of a glycolipid to the outer half of a plasma membrane. Fracture-label is proposed as a new technique to investigate the distribution and partition of glycolipids in plasma and intracellular membrane halves."
https://openalex.org/W1992835484,"Nucleotide sequencing has demonstrated that the Small genome segment of Bunyaviruses contains the genetic information for two viral proteins (N and NSs) in overlapping reading frames (Akashi and Bishop, 1983; Cabradilla et al., in press). Using 3' end-labeled genome probes, La Crosse virus (LAC) infected cells were shown to contain three leader RNAs, which start at position 1 and terminate at approximate positions 74, 95, and 115 from the 3' end of the genome. Primer extension and S1 mapping studies have shown that LAC-infected cells contain seven mRNAs, five of which initiate at positions 1, 74, 101, 117, and 123 and two more which initiate at approximate positions 147 and 159 from the 3' end of the Small genome segment. The existence of multiple leader RNAs and mRNAs from the Small genome segment may allow access to both overlapping reading frames by ribosomes that still initiate only at 5' proximal AUGs, without the need to splice the mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1501652628,"The effects of tunicamycin on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and cholesterol biosynthesis have been studied in cultured C-6 glial cells. Depending on culture conditions, exposure to tunicamycin caused either a marked inhibition of induction of HMG-CoA reductase activity or, under steady state conditions, a marked reduction in enzymatic activity. Incorporation of [14 C]acetate into sterols was affected similarly. After a 24-h exposure, a 50% reduction in reductase activity was observed with a concentration of 0.05 micrograms/ml, and a maximal, 65-70% reduction occurred with 0.10 micrograms/ml of the drug. The effect of tunicamycin on reductase activity and on sterol synthesis was apparent 4 h after addition of the drug and nearly maximal after 6 h. The relative specificity of the effect of tunicamycin was indicated by the finding of no change in the activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or fatty acid synthetase, in incorporation of [3H]leucine into total protein, or in the rate of increase in cellular protein and phospholipid at concentrations of tunicamycin that caused the marked effect on HMG-CoA reductase. The reversibility of the effect of tunicamycin was shown by observing total recovery of reductase activity within 24 h after removal of the drug following a 24-h exposure. That the effect of tunicamycin on reductase is related to the drug's effect on glycoprotein synthesis was shown in two ways. First, the range of concentrations over which tunicamycin led to the decrease in reductase activity was essentially identical with the range over which the drug led to a decrease in incorporation of [3H]mannose into protein. Second, incubation of C-6 cells with N-acetylglucosamine simultaneously with tunicamycin was accompanied by prevention of the drug's effect on both HMG-CoA reductase and glycoprotein synthesis. These data suggest that glycoprotein synthesis is necessary for the expression of HMG-CoA reductase activity and, thereby, cholesterol synthesis in glial cells. Moreover, a link between glycoprotein and cholesterol biosynthesis could play a role in the mediation of certain maturational events in cells of neural origin."
https://openalex.org/W2035648415,"Recessive lethal mutations in the T/t-complex of the mouse characteristically show defective genetic complementation, even when they affect very different stages of embryogenesis and are known to be nonallelic. To address the question of their genetic or functional relationship, we have applied the cis-trans test, using several well defined recombinant t-chromosomes that carry two or more lethal mutations, and others that are devoid of specific lethals. We show here that the defective complementation that occurs between different t-lethals is a specific result of the trans configuration; thus these genes, which may map as much as 15 cM apart, constitute a functional unit. Some speculations are presented to interpret this enigma in terms of DNA plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1535957685,"Using the two lectins from lima bean, we have tested the model for mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes proposed by Prujansky et al. (Prujansky, A., Ravid, A., and Sharon, N. (1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 508, 137-146). The lectins used, a tetramer with two saccharide-binding sites and an octamer with four binding sites, are specific for N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Our results show that cooperative binding may not be a prerequisite for mitogenicity of all lectins. We found that neither the weakly mitogenic tetramer nor the potently mitogenic octamer bound cooperatively to bovine lymphocytes. The strong mitogen bound with a higher affinity than the weak mitogen and fewer mitogen molecules bound to the lymphocyte surface at saturation. Competitive binding experiments indicated that both lectins bound to the same receptors. Our results suggest that the mitogenic lectin is able to bind and cross-link more membrane receptors. We have also studied the binding of the lima bean lectins to human red blood cells of types A, AB, B, and O. Both lectins bound cooperatively to type A and type AB cells and our data indicate that the lima bean lectins bind predominantly to the type A determinant."
https://openalex.org/W2100827811,"Because of the prospect of a serious decline in the nation's biomedical research capacity owing to diminished federal appropriations, temporary measures should be initiated promptly by the National Institutes of Health to preserve the stability of resources and diversity of research required for future productivity. It is recommended that the available funds be distributed in such a way as to permit some support for 50 percent of competing grant applications approved by the National Institutes of Health study sections. Measures proposed for consideration are a sliding scale for funding, a greater across-the-board reduction, a limit on support for an individual laboratory, and a review of indirect costs."
