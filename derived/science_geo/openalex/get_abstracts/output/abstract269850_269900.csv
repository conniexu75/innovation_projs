Sixty-three experimental mice were observed to have an incidence of 41 per cent. Thirty-six mice received unfiltered or untreated material and have had an incidence of 67 per cent. Many of the mice of each group are still living. Previous studies indicated that the active milk-influence would not become inactive following desiccation.(4) Following ultracentrifugation the active influence appeared in traces, if at all, in the fat fraction and in the final supernatant fluid, and it is possible that the active agent is a colloid of high molecular weight.(5)."

Reflection during the growing season is proportionally lower because of greater light absorption by the vegetation. Photosynthesis is a negligible quantity, although in relation to visible radiation during the growing season it nearly equals reflection."

Politicians are more likely to abuse it by calling on it to advance their special causes than they are to ignore it. In this predicament, scientists cannot protect their essential interests in government by setting themselves apart in a separate status or separate department. They used to be content with the control of particular bureaus or programs. Today, in the White House Office or the lobbies of the Capitol, they are obliged, by the nature of the system they helped create, to play a responsible role in all aspects of national policy, and in the development of a new pattern of relationships between public and private institutions in our society."

https://openalex.org/W1983907230,"These requirements have been such, at least up to the time of the recent modifications, that it has been practically impossible to meet them in any satisfactory manner in schools in which, as is the case for instance in the free high schools of Wisconsin, the subject is almost universally a required one. Even the new requirements are still so largely quantitative in their spirit that there is great room for doubt as to the advisability of attempting to prepare for college unless the doubtful practice, so commonly being adopted, of making the college preparatory an elective course is to prevail. This would mean that if pupils are to be given to any adequate extent the wider view of life and its relations, with a permanent interest in the natural phenomena about them, separate classes must be formed whose work will not count as a preparation for study in a higher school. The results up to this time of the attempts to give to all students a general course which would meet the two purposes have been far from satisfactory from the standpoint of either life or the college. Neither interest nor ability has as a rule been developed. Even in schools having special preparatory classes the subject is elected by comparatively few, and those taking it because they really like it are much fewer still. On the other hand, the attempt to make the general class meet the requirements has resulted in very imperfect ideas coupled too often with"

Irradiation by the sun would produce excited trapped radicals, which would radiate in ways consistent with the observed behavior of the particles."

The final product, containing 0.58 per cent. dissolved material which is apparently composed of urates and sulfates, is not unpleasant in taste and is not expected to cause toxic effects if used as drinking water."
