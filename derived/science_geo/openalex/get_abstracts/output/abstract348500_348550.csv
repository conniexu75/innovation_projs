https://openalex.org/W2050547995,"Viable tumour-derived epithelial cells (circulating tumour cells or CTCs) have been identified in peripheral blood from cancer patients and are probably the origin of intractable metastatic disease. Although extremely rare, CTCs represent a potential alternative to invasive biopsies as a source of tumour tissue for the detection, characterization and monitoring of non-haematologic cancers. The ability to identify, isolate, propagate and molecularly characterize CTC subpopulations could further the discovery of cancer stem cell biomarkers and expand the understanding of the biology of metastasis. Current strategies for isolating CTCs are limited to complex analytic approaches that generate very low yield and purity. Here we describe the development of a unique microfluidic platform (the 'CTC-chip') capable of efficient and selective separation of viable CTCs from peripheral whole blood samples, mediated by the interaction of target CTCs with antibody (EpCAM)-coated microposts under precisely controlled laminar flow conditions, and without requisite pre-labelling or processing of samples. The CTC-chip successfully identified CTCs in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic lung, prostate, pancreatic, breast and colon cancer in 115 of 116 (99%) samples, with a range of 5-1,281 CTCs per ml and approximately 50% purity. In addition, CTCs were isolated in 7/7 patients with early-stage prostate cancer. Given the high sensitivity and specificity of the CTC-chip, we tested its potential utility in monitoring response to anti-cancer therapy. In a small cohort of patients with metastatic cancer undergoing systemic treatment, temporal changes in CTC numbers correlated reasonably well with the clinical course of disease as measured by standard radiographic methods. Thus, the CTC-chip provides a new and effective tool for accurate identification and measurement of CTCs in patients with cancer. It has broad implications in advancing both cancer biology research and clinical cancer management, including the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of cancer."

Since their inception frequency combs have triggered major advances in optical frequency metrology and precision measurements and in applications such as broadband laser-based gas sensing8 and molecular fingerprinting. Early work generated frequency combs by intra-cavity phase modulation while to date frequency combs are generated utilizing the comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized. Here, we report an entirely novel approach in which equally spaced frequency markers are generated from a continuous wave (CW) pump laser of a known frequency interacting with the modes of a monolithic high-Q microresonator13 via the Kerr nonlinearity. The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain enables the generation of discrete comb modes over a 500 nm wide span (ca. 70 THz) around 1550 nm without relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based measurements reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb, overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3*10(-18)."

https://openalex.org/W1976435105,"Synaptic boutons, the points of communication between nerve cells, are so tiny that it has been impossible to record their electrical activity without slicing the brain. In a technical tour de force, Rancz et al. provide the first intracellular recordings from presynaptic boutons in the intact mammalian brain. Their results contradict the prevailing views — derived from in vitro work — on how the cerebellum integrates sensory information to control movement, by revealing an unexpected sensitivity of single brain connections to stimuli from the environment. The first intracellular recordings from presynaptic boutons in the intact mammalian brain are presented. These results contradict the prevailing views (derived from in vitro work) on how the cerebellum integrates sensory information to control movement, by revealing a hitherto unexpected sensitivity of single brain connections to stimuli from the environment. Understanding the transmission of sensory information at individual synaptic connections requires knowledge of the properties of presynaptic terminals and their patterns of firing evoked by sensory stimuli. Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch-clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons—the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex1,2—that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies (more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre–granule cell synapse exhibits high-fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory-evoked response of granule cells3 can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a ‘detonator’ fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information."

https://openalex.org/W1985490516,"RNAs fold into three-dimensional (3D) structures that subsequently undergo large, functionally important, conformational transitions in response to a variety of cellular signals. RNA structures are believed to encode spatially tuned flexibility that can direct transitions along specific conformational pathways. However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to examine directly because atomic movements in complex biomolecules cannot be visualized in 3D by using current experimental methods. Here we report the successful implementation of a strategy using NMR that has allowed us to visualize, with complete 3D rotational sensitivity, the dynamics between two RNA helices that are linked by a functionally important trinucleotide bulge over timescales extending up to milliseconds. The key to our approach is to anchor NMR frames of reference onto each helix and thereby directly measure their dynamics, one relative to the other, using 'relativistic' sets of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). Using this approach, we uncovered super-large amplitude helix motions that trace out a surprisingly structured and spatially correlated 3D dynamic trajectory. The two helices twist around their individual axes by approximately 53 degrees and 110 degrees in a highly correlated manner (R = 0.97) while simultaneously (R = 0.81-0.92) bending by about 94 degrees. Remarkably, the 3D dynamic trajectory is dotted at various positions by seven distinct ligand-bound conformations of the RNA. Thus even partly unstructured RNAs can undergo structured dynamics that directs ligand-induced transitions along specific predefined conformational pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2082573868,"Shear-wave splitting measurements above the mantle wedge of the Mariana1 and southern Andean2,3 subduction zones show trench-parallel seismically fast directions close to the trench and abrupt rotations to trench-perpendicular anisotropy in the back arc. These patterns of seismic anisotropy may be caused by three-dimensional flow associated with along-strike variations in slab geometry1,2,3,4,5. The Mariana and Andean subduction systems are associated with the largest along-strike variations of slab geometry observed on Earth6,7 and are ideal for testing the link between slab geometry and solid-state creep processes in the mantle. Here we show, with fully three-dimensional non-newtonian subduction zone models, that the strong curvature of the Mariana slab and the transition to shallow slab dip in the Southern Andes give rise to strong trench-parallel stretching in the warm-arc and warm-back-arc mantle and to abrupt rotations in stretching directions that are accompanied by strong trench-parallel stretching. These models show that the patterns of shear-wave splitting observed in the Mariana and southern Andean systems may be caused by significant three-dimensional flow induced by along-strike variations in slab geometry."

https://openalex.org/W176424309,"The present study is concerned with the inhibition of growth of the pyrimidine-deficient Neurospora mutant, No. 1298, by the naturally occurring purine ribonucleotides and ribonucleosides. This experimentally produced strain, unlike the wild type, is unable to synthesize the pyrimidine ribonucleosides on a medium containing inorganic salts, carbohydrate, and biotin. Normal growth takes place, however, when the medium is supplemented with either cytidine or uridine or the corresponding nucleotides. It has been found that adenosine and adenosine-3-phosphate (yeast adenylic acid) inhibit the utilization of the pyrimidine compounds to a varying degree. An amount of adenine nucleoside which is sufficient to inhibit growth completely on the quantity of cytidine used has no inhibitory effect on an equivalent amount of uridine. The addition of an equimolar amount of uridine to a mixture of cytidine and adenosine in which no growth takes place results in the elimination of the antagonism. In contrast to the effect of adenosine and adenylic acid on this mutant strain of Neurospora, adenine shows no inhibitory properties at comparable concentrations. A similar inhibitory effect on the utilization of the pyrimidine nucleosides was found for guanosine and guanylic acid, but larger amounts of these compounds were required to produce inhibition under the same conditions. Guanine like adenine failed to cause inhibition at moderate concentrations."
