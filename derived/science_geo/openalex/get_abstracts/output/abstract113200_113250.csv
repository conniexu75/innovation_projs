https://openalex.org/W1997643531,"Eukaryotic cells become committed to proliferate during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In budding yeast, commitment occurs when the catalytic subunit of a protein kinase, encoded by the CDC28 gene (the homolog of the fission yeast cdc2+ gene), binds to a positively acting regulatory subunit, a cyclin. Related kinases are also required for progression through the G1 phase in higher eukaryotes. The role of cyclins in controlling G1 progression in mammalian cells was tested by construction of fibroblasts that constitutively overexpress human cyclin E. This was found to shorten the duration of G1, decrease cell size, and diminish the serum requirement for the transition from G1 to S phase. These observations show that cyclin levels can be rate-limiting for G1 progression in mammalian cells and suggest that cyclin synthesis may be the target of physiological signals that control cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2067623205,"Many metalloenzymes exhibit distinctive spectral features that are now becoming well understood. These reflect active site electronic structures that can make significant contributions to catalysis. Copper proteins provide well-characterized examples in which the unusual electronic structures of their active sites contribute to rapid, long-range electron transfer reactivity, oxygen binding and activation, and the multielectron reduction of dioxygen to water."
https://openalex.org/W2039911916,"Glucagon and the glucagon receptor are a primary source of control over blood glucose concentrations and are especially important to studies of diabetes in which the loss of control over blood glucose concentrations clinically defines the disease. A complementary DNA clone for the glucagon receptor was isolated by an expression cloning strategy, and the receptor protein was expressed in several kidney cell lines. The cloned receptor bound glucagon and caused an increase in the intracellular concentration of adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). The cloned glucagon receptor also transduced a signal that led to an increased concentration of intracellular calcium. The glucagon receptor is similar to the calcitonin and parathyroid hormone receptors. It can transduce signals leading to the accumulation of two different second messengers, cAMP and calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1965815102,"One of the hallmarks of long-term memory in both vertebrates and invertebrates is the requirement for new protein synthesis. In sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, this requirement can be studied on the cellular level. Here, long-term but not short-term facilitation of the monosynaptic connections between the sensory and motor neurons requires new protein synthesis and is reflected in an altered level of expression of specific proteins regulated through the cAMP second-messenger pathway. Using gene transfer into individual sensory neurons of Aplysia, we find that serotonin (5-HT) induces transcriptional activation of a lacZ reporter gene driven by the cAMP response element (CRE) and that this induction requires CRE-binding proteins (CREBs). The induction by 5-HT does not occur following a single pulse, but becomes progressively more effective following two or more pulses. Moreover, expression of GAL4-CREB fusion genes shows that 5-HT induction requires phosphorylation of CREB on Ser119 by protein kinase A. These data provide direct evidence for CREB-modulated transcriptional activation with long-term facilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2035760322,"Differentiated skeletal muscle cells cease dividing and sustain expression of a battery of tissue-specific genes. To identify regulators of growth and differentiation, we used a genetic complementation approach. Following introduction of a cDNA expression library into a differentiation-defective myoblast mutant (NMU2), cDNAs were isolated that activated muscle-specific promoters. The complementing cDNAs were identified as muscle structural genes, troponin I, tropomyosin, and α-cardiac actin, and their activity was mapped to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). The 3′UTRs augmented the differentiation of wild-type muscle cells. Upon expression in 10T fibroblasts, proliferation was suppressed, indicating that the effects of the 3′UTRs are not limited to myogenic cells. These data suggest that 3′UTRs of certain differentiation-specific RNAs are trans-acting regulators in a feedback loop that inhibits cell division and promotes differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1479814947,"Abstract In cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II (AII) treatment led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins with apparent molecular masses of 42, 44, 75, and 120 kDa, respectively, as assessed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed within 1 min of AII addition and was maximal by 30 min. The overall pattern of AII-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was distinct from that observed following treatment of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Specific antibodies were used to identify the AII-stimulated 42- and 44-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as the mitogen-activated protein p42mapk and p44mapk, respectively. Raf-1, a 70-74-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to AII but was found to be hyperphosphorylated as evidenced by retarded protein mobility in SDS gel analysis. Taken together, these data indicate that AII binding to vascular smooth muscle cells leads to rapid activation of a complex cascade of protein kinases, including protein kinase C, Raf-1, MAP kinases, and an undefined intracellular protein tyrosine kinase(s) that may be coordinately involved in signal transduction leading to cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2016498953,"The RecBCD enzyme is a multifunctional enzyme that is essential for homologous recombination in E. coli. In vitro, the RecBCD enzyme degrades linear double-stranded DNA nonspecifically during the process of unwinding the double-stranded DNA. Here we demonstrate that this DNA degradation is asymmetric, with the strand that is 3' terminal at the entry site of RecBCD enzyme being degraded much more vigorously than the 5' terminal strand. Furthermore, interaction with the recombination hotspot chi causes an attenuation of the nuclease activity but not of the helicase activity and is accompanied by a pause of RecBCD enzyme at the chi site. These results demonstrate that chi is a unique regulatory element that acts by controlling the degradative function of RecBCD enzyme and, thereby, enhancing its recombination function."
https://openalex.org/W1536827165,"The erd2 protein is the receptor responsible for recycling proteins bearing the carboxyl-terminal sequence KDEL (single-letter amino acid code) to the endoplasmic reticulum, following their loss from that organelle by the process of forward transport. To study the interaction of erd2p with the sequence KDEL we have reconstituted binding of erd2p to its ligand in vitro. Binding in vitro exhibits the same sequence specificity as retention of lumenal proteins in vivo and is strikingly sensitive to pH. Our results raise the possibility that erd2p-mediated sorting of lumenal endoplasmic reticulum proteins is facilitated by the pH differences between compartments of the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2051584218,"One of the major mediators of calcium action in neurons is the multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase), an enzyme with the capability of directly regulating its own activity by autophosphorylation. To assess the involvement of CaM kinase in experience-dependent behavior in an intact animal, we have designed a specific peptide inhibitor of CaM kinase and made transgenic Drosophila that express it under control of an inducible promoter. These flies fail to learn normally in two behavioral plasticity paradigms: acoustic priming, a nonassociative measure of sensitization, and courtship conditioning, a measure of associative learning. The magnitude of the learning defect in the associative paradigm appears to be proportional to the level of expression of the peptide gene in the two transgenic lines and can be increased by heat shock induction of gene expression. These results suggest that CaM kinase activity is required for plastic behaviors in an intact animal."

https://openalex.org/W1985197728,"We have reconstituted the transposition of the bacterial transposon Tn7 into its specific insertion site attTn7 with four purified Tn7-encoded proteins, TnsA+TnsB+TnsC+TnsD, and ATP. TnsA+TnsB+TnsC form a ""core"" recombination machine that recognizes the transposon ends and executes DNA breakage and joining; TnsD specifically recognizes attTn7. TnsA+TnsB+TnsC are specifically targeted to attTn7 through the TnsD-dependent interaction of TnsC, a nonspecific DNA-binding protein, with attTn7. Recombination appears to be activated by the assembly of a nucleoprotein complex containing the DNA substrates and Tns proteins. We suggest that TnsC plays a central role in communication between the transposon and the target DNA, particularly in directing insertion away from DNAs already containing a copy of Tn7."
https://openalex.org/W1607148144,"The liver regulates the supply of amino acids required for protein synthesis and intermediary metabolism between feeding and fasting in mammals. The flux of amino acids between the liver and other tissues is determined, in part, by the activity of specific carrier proteins. We have identified a carrier of the cationic amino acids arginine, lysine, and ornithine in mouse liver that is closely related to a previously identified transporter with the same substrate specificity expressed in nonhepatic tissues. Uptake studies were performed in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding these proteins. The comparison of the two transporters in these studies demonstrated that, unlike the widely-expressed transporter, arginine uptake mediated by the liver carrier is significant only at substrate concentrations that exceed systemic plasma levels and is less dependent on the intracellular concentration of cationic amino acids. These properties enable hepatocytes expressing this carrier to remove excess cationic amino acids from the blood without interfering with their uptake by nonhepatic tissues that express the related transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2029082240,"The localization of topoisomerase II (topo II) in vivo was studied by recording time-lapse, three-dimensional data sets of living Drosophila melanogaster embryos injected with rhodamine-labeled topo II. These images show that topo II is concentrated at specific sites within the interphase nucleus and that this localization is temporally regulated. The enzyme is not restricted to a central chromosome axis, but is distributed uniformly throughout the chromosome. During mitosis, the enzyme present in the early prophase chromosome is lost in two stages, following prophase and following anaphase. Overall, 70% of the enzyme leaves the nucleus and diffuses into the cytoplasm. The localization of the enzyme thus correlates with its role in chromosome condensation and segregation. Rather than being solely a structural protein, topo II appears to localize at the sites on the chromosome where it is required."

https://openalex.org/W1600605923,"The DNA upstream of the dioxin-inducible CYP1A1 gene contains six distinct sites to which the liganded Ah receptor binds in intact mouse hepatoma cells. Here, we have analyzed these six bona fide receptor-binding sites in order to study the relationships between DNA sequence, receptor binding, and dioxin responsiveness. Gel retardation studies reveal that the sites vary by about 7-fold in their relative affinities for the liganded receptor. Within this range, there is no obvious association between the strength of receptor binding and the degree of dioxin responsiveness, as measured in transfection experiments. In fact, one site binds the receptor well but fails to respond to dioxin. This observation implies that the receptor-DNA binding event per se is not sufficient to confer dioxin responsiveness upon a linked gene. Comparison of the DNA sequences of the six receptor-binding sites permits the derivation of a functional consensus recognition sequence, which is more extended in length than the core-binding sequence previously described. In corroboration of these results, protein-DNA cross-linking studies indicate that the liganded receptor contacts base pairs beyond the core sequence. Our observations also indicate that the liganded receptor can tolerate limited sequence heterogeneity at its DNA-binding site and still elicit a response to dioxin. This finding might reflect corresponding heterogeneity in the amino acid sequence of the liganded receptor's DNA-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1533598873,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns-3-kinase) is thought to participate in the transductional cascade used by several tyrosine kinase receptors including the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor and the insulin receptor. The major insulin receptor cellular substrate IRS-1 (pp185) has been proposed as a possible link between the insulin receptor and PtdIns-3-kinase. In this study we show that both insulin and IGF-I treatment of murine fibroblasts transfected with insulin or IGF-I receptors increase PtdIns-3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the 85-kDa subunit of PtdIns-3-kinase. Whereas only a small amount of PtdIns-3-kinase is found associated with the insulin and IGF-I receptor, a considerable PtdIns-3-kinase activity is immunoprecipitated by an antibody raised against IRS-1. Additionally, insulin and IGF-I stimulation of murine fibroblasts expressing insulin or IGF-I receptors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with PtdIns-3-kinase. Since IRS-1 seems to be the connection between PtdIns-3-kinase and insulin or IGF-I receptor, we used reconstitution experiments to characterize the implication of IRS-1 in the activation of PtdIns-3-kinase. We show that immunoaffinity-purified IRS-1 can be phosphorylated by ligand-stimulated insulin and IGF-I receptors and that this phosphorylation allows the association of IRS-1 with PtdIns-3-kinase. The interaction between PtdIns-3-kinase and IRS-1 phosphorylated by the insulin or the IGF-I receptor results in the activation of PtdIns-3-kinase. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that IRS-1 is a key component in the signal transduction pathway of PtdIns-3-kinase activation induced by insulin and IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W1568020570,"Mouse T-lymphoma cells contain a unique type of internal vesicle which bands at the relatively light density of 1.07 g/cc. These vesicles do not contain any detectable Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, or lysosomal marker protein activities. Binding of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to these internal vesicles reveals the presence of a single, high affinity class of IP3 receptor with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.6 +/- 0.3 nM. Using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against IP3 receptor, we have established that the IP3 receptor (approximately 260 kDa) displays immunological cross-reactivity with the rat brain IP3 receptor. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of first-strand cDNAs from both mouse T-lymphoma cells and rat brain tissues reveals that the IP3 receptor transcript in mouse T-lymphoma cells belongs to the short form (non-neuronal form) and not the long form (neuronal form) detected in rat brain tissue. Scatchard plot analysis shows that high affinity binding occurs between ankyrin and the IP3 receptor with a Kd of 0.2 nM. Most importantly, the binding of ankyrin to the light density vesicles significantly inhibits IP3 binding and IP3-induced internal Ca2+ release. These findings suggest that the cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in the regulation of IP3 receptor-mediated internal Ca2+ release during lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1578255732,"Incubation of either purified rat forebrain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or the purified recombinant, baculovirus-expressed mouse alpha subunit of CaMKII (Brickey, D. A., Colbran, R. J., Fong, Y.-L., and Soderling, T. R. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 173, 578-584) with EGTA, magnesium acetate, and [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the incorporation of up to 1.0 mol of 32PO4/mol of subunit within 60 min at 30 degrees C; both serine and threonine residues became autophosphorylated. The Vmax for this basal autophosphorylation was 0.051 +/- 0.005 mol of 32PO4/mol of subunit/min, and the Km(ATP) was 145 +/- 8 microM. Vmax and Km(ATP) values for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation were determined to be 1.3 +/- 0.4 mol/mol/min and 19 +/- 2 microM, respectively. Basal autophosphorylation resulted in inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity toward exogenous peptide substrate; there was no measurable increase in Ca(2+)-independent CaMKII activity. Inactivation was not observed following preincubation with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs in place of ATP. CaMKII that had been inactivated by basal autophosphorylation could be fully re-activated by incubation with the purified catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Following basal autophosphorylation, the calmodulin-binding ability of CaMKII was also reduced, presumably accounting for the observed inactivation. Both the inactivation and the decrease in calmodulin-binding that resulted from basal autophosphorylation were abrogated by mutation of threonine 306 to alanine, but not by mutation of threonine 305 to alanine. Furthermore, mutation of threonine 306, but not threonine 305, to alanine reduced the extent of basal autophosphorylation at threonine residues. Thus, basal autophosphorylation at threonine 306 blocks calmodulin binding, resulting in inactivation of CaMKII."
https://openalex.org/W1559595070,"Increased intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ levels can activate transcription of a number of eukaryotic genes through a common promoter element, the cAMP/Ca2+ response element. This element is the binding site for activating transcription factor (ATF)/CREB proteins, an extensive transcription factor family. Here we report that one member of this family, ATF-1, can mediate both Ca2+ and cAMP transcriptional responses, but that the responses to the two pathways differ in magnitude. In contrast, another family member, CREB, has been shown to mediate Ca2+ and cAMP responses to similar levels. Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism that allows cells to integrate and differentiate gene regulation by cAMP and Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1496559683,"Rat cerebellar membranes sedimenting at 10,000 x g contain significantly greater amounts of [3H]D-myo inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- (IP3) binding sites that are resistant to extraction by Triton X-100 than membranes sedimenting at 100,000 x g. Scatchard analysis of the Triton X-100-resistant binding site revealed the presence of a single binding site with an 8-fold higher affinity for IP3 than present in 10,000 x g membranes. The Triton X-100-resistant binding site displayed high specificity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and was sensitive to inhibition by both heparin and calcium. A polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) and biotinylated concanavalin A recognized the same 235 kDa band in Western blots of membrane and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. The ligand binding activity of the IP3R could be measured in immunoprecipitates obtained from detergent-soluble extracts treated with IP3R antibody. An antibody to chick erythrocyte ankyrin also immunoprecipitated [3H]IP3-binding sites and immunoreactive IP3R protein. These effects of ankyrin antibody were prevented by preadsorption to erythrocyte ghosts and were not reproduced by spectrin antibodies. Cross-reactivity of the ankyrin antibody with the IP3R was excluded by the demonstration of selective loss of immunoreactive ankyrin protein when IP3R antibody immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS buffers or when membranes were alkali-treated. These results suggest that a population of IP3R in brain may be attached to an isoform of ankyrin. This may mediate interactions of the IP3R with the cytoskeleton and account for observations regarding the detergent insolubility of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2036499722,"Single-channel recordings show that functionally different L-type Ca2+ channels coexist in rat cerebellar granules. Besides two different dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive gating patterns with properties similar to those of cardiac L-type channels, cerebellar granules contain a third DHP-sensitive gating pattern with unusual voltage-dependent properties and slightly different conductance. This “anomalous gating” is characterized, on one hand, by rare, short openings with very low open probability even at high positive voltages and, on the other hand, by long openings with high open probability at negative voltages after a predepolarization. L-type channels with anomalous gating appear suited to generate a surge of Ca2+ influx following strong neuronal activity. The anomalous gating can be explained by a model in which voltage controls the equilibrium between two gating modes."
https://openalex.org/W1628490849,"The human 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (hVDR), like other members of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, has been observed to undergo rapid phosphorylation. We report here that the hVDR is a substrate for casein kinase II (CK-II), a regulatory enzyme of significance in the function of nuclear proteins. Intact hVDRs produced by in vitro transcription/translation or in a baculovirus overexpression system served as efficient substrates for purified bovine CK-II, and the magnitude of this phosphorylation was not affected by the addition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. CK-II-catalyzed phosphorylation of truncated hVDRs suggested that phosphorylated residues may occur between Arg121 and Asp232, including the region of hVDR which we have previously demonstrated to contain a major site(s) of phosphorylation in intact cells (Jones, B.B., Jurutka, P.W., Haussler, C.A., Haussler, M.R., and Whitfield, G.K. (1991) Mol. Endocrinol. 5, 1137-1146). Site-directed mutagenesis of serine/threonine residues in this region now reveals a site of phosphorylation at Ser208 contained within the sequence -S208 (P)EEDSDD-, a classic CK-II consensus recognition site. Mutation of this serine to a glycine drastically reduces phosphorylation of hVDR by CK-II, in vitro. The Ser208 mutant receptor also shows a dramatic decrease in [32P]orthophosphate incorporation when transfected into COS-7 cells. We therefore propose that phosphorylation of hVDR at Ser208 in target cells is mediated by casein kinase II or a similar enzyme, and that this quantitatively significant post-translational modification is a potential mechanism for the modulation of the activity of hVDR in controlling gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1520598173,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are cytokines that give rise to an identical set of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins upon addition to responsive cells. One of these proteins is the interleukin-6 signal-transducing molecule gp130, which is required for signal transduction by both CNTF and LIF. Here we identify another prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein as LIF receptor (LIFR) beta, which was originally cloned as a LIF-binding protein. Cross-linking experiments with iodinated factors were carried out on a cell line responsive to CNTF and LIF, as well as on COS cells that were cotransfected with various combinations of gp130, LIFR beta, and CNTF receptor (CNTFR) alpha, the previously cloned CNTF-binding protein. These experiments reveal that LIF cross-links to LIFR beta alone, as well as to gp130 when it is coexpressed with LIFR beta. However, cross-linking of CNTF to LIFR beta and gp130 is only observed in the presence of CNTFR alpha. These and other data show that the two known LIF receptor components are recruited by CNTF and CNTFR alpha to form a trimeric CNTF receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1915140677,"Previous observations have led to the speculation that activation of a growth hormone (GH) receptor-associated tyrosine kinase is an early, perhaps initiating, event in transmembrane signaling by GH. To test this hypothesis further, a Western blotting assay employing antibodies to phosphotyrosine was used to determine whether proteins other than the GH receptor might serve as substrates of the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase. The ability of inhibitors of the GH receptor-associated kinase to block actions of GH was also investigated. Over a physiologically relevant range of concentrations, GH was found to promote, in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, rapid changes in the level of tyrosyl phosphorylation of more than 13 proteins. At the highest GH concentration employed (500 ng/ml), increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of two proteins, pp121 and pp97, was clearly visible at 1 min, the earliest time tested. Increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of a number of other proteins (pp250, pps160-180, pps140-160, pp130, pp90, pp75, pp45, pp42, pp39, and pp36) and decreased tyrosyl phosphorylation of a 140-kDa protein were apparent after 5-10 min of incubation with GH. Staurosporine, herbimycin A, and tyrphostin were identified as inhibitors of the GH receptor-associated kinase. When added to anti-GH antibody immunoprecipitates from GH-treated cells, they inhibited incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into tyrosyl residues in GH receptor complexes. When added to cells, all three inhibitors blocked all GH-dependent increases in tyrosyl phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Inhibitors of the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase also abolished GH-dependent activation of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase. Consistent with these inhibitors inhibiting the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, they had little or no effect on activation of MAP kinase by epidermal growth factor. In contrast, genistein and hydroxy-(2-naphthyl)-methylphosphonic acid, tyrosine kinase inhibitors lacking specificity for the GH receptor-associated kinase, decreased GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of only a subset of GH-responsive bands and partially blocked GH-dependent activation of MAP kinase. These data show that increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins is a very rapid response to the binding of GH by the cell and most likely involves multiple tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, inhibition of the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase blocks at least two actions of GH, the stimulation of tyrosyl phosphorylation of multiple proteins and MAP kinase activation. These results are consistent with the GH receptor-associated kinase playing an important, perhaps initiating, role in trans-membrane signaling by GH."

https://openalex.org/W1515043048,"Vaccinia virus RNA capping enzyme, a heterodimer of 95- and 31-kDa subunits, catalyzes transfer of GMP from GTP to the 5'-diphosphate terminus of RNA via a covalent enzyme-guanylate intermediate. The GMP residue is attached to the 95-kDa subunit through a phosphoamide bond to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. The amino acid sequence of the large subunit includes a lysine-containing motif, Tyr-X-X-X-Lys260-Thr-Asp-Gly, that is conserved in the RNA guanylyltransferases encoded by Shope fibroma virus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The KXDG motif is also encountered at the sites of covalent adenylylation of bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase and mammalian DNA ligase I (Thogerson, H. C., Morris, H. R., Rand, K. N., and Gait, M. J. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 147, 325-329; Tomkinson, A. E., Totty, N. F., Ginsburg, M., and Lindahl, T. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 400-404). We find that conservative amino acid substitutions at three out of four positions within the KTDG sequence of vaccinia capping enzyme either prevent or strongly inhibit enzyme-guanylate formation. The conserved motif is therefore an essential component of the guanylyltransferase domain. Lys260 is implicated as the active site. Comparison of the sequences of capping enzymes and polynucleotide ligases from diverse sources suggests that KX(D/N)G may be a signature element for covalent catalysis in nucleotidyl transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1526250277,"We have shown previously that insulin stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the alpha-type 85-kDa subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in vitro and in vivo. In the present work, we identified the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the alpha-type p85 by the insulin receptor. [32P]Phosphopeptides obtained from lysylendopeptidase digestion of phosphorylated alpha-type p85 in intact cells after insulin treatment were analyzed using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer electrophoresis. The tyrosine phosphorylation sites of alpha-type p85 in vivo were assigned to three major phosphopeptides, designated p1, p2, and p3. Highly purified insulin receptor also phosphorylated the purified p85 of PI 3-kinase from the bovine thymus at p1. The purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p85 (alpha-type) fusion protein and its truncated proteins from Escherichia coli were also phosphorylated by the purified insulin receptor at p1, p2, and p3 in vitro. Analysis of [32P]phosphopeptide of the truncated GST-p85 (alpha-type) fusion proteins and radiosequence analysis revealed that the p1, p2, and p3 phosphopeptides were phosphorylated at tyrosines 607, 580, and 368, respectively. In addition, phenylalanine substitutions at tyrosine 607 and 580 reduced the p1 and p2 phosphopeptides in vivo, respectively. We conclude that the alpha-type p85 of PI 3-kinase was phosphorylated at tyrosines 368, 580, and 607 by the insulin receptor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1506108353,"alpha 1B-Adrenergic receptor mRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes, resulting in a norepinephrine-evoked Cl- current. The response was proportional to norepinephrine concentration, blocked by prazosin, and dependent on intracellular Ca2+ derived from inositol trisphosphate-sensitive stores. Oocytes treated with 2 micrograms/ml pertussis toxin showed a time-dependent decrease of the norepinephrine response, taking up to 72 h to show an 80% decrease. Overnight treatment with 10 micrograms/ml pertussis toxin also resulted in 80% reduction. Responses to two other cloned receptors (M1-muscarinic and serotonin-1c) expressed in oocytes were also reduced 50% or more by 72 h of pertussis toxin treatment. Pertussis toxin labeling of the cloned Xenopus alpha o-subunit translated in vitro showed that it was a significantly poorer substrate for pertussis toxin than the two mammalian alpha o-subunits expressed and assayed under identical conditions. This unexpected biochemical behavior of the Xenopus alpha o-subunit is in agreement with the rather unusual treatment conditions required to observe the effects of pertussis toxin on the receptor-evoked Cl- current in the oocyte. Injection of mammalian heterotrimeric G(o) but not Gi3 significantly enhanced the norepinephrine-evoked Cl- current in oocytes. Injection of mixtures of anti-sense oligonucleotides to the Xenopus alpha o-subunit reduced the norepinephrine-evoked Cl- current by 60% within 24 h, compared with oocytes injected with the oligonucleotides encoding sense sequences. These studies indicate that the expressed alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor, like the native muscarinic receptor, utilizes G(o) to couple to the phospholipase C-mediated Cl- current in Xenopus oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W67190290,"The TRG1/PDI1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for growth and encodes a lumenal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoprotein that is structurally related to thioredoxin and is involved in the secretory pathway. We have tested whether the yeast Trg1/Pdi1 protein can be replaced in vivo by three members of the mammalian thioredoxin-related protein family, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp72, and ERp61. Multicopy plasmids containing galactose-inducible rodent PDI and ERp72 genes support germination and growth of haploid trg1 null mutants in galactose-containing media, whereas the ERp61 gene is inactive. Strains expressing PDI or ERp72 instead of Trg1 are thermosensitive. An overproduced mutant Trg1 protein lacking the HDEL retention signal supports growth, whereas a truncated version of the protein containing only one thioredoxin-like domain is inactive. The mammalian proteins were localized to both the soluble and microsomal membrane fraction of yeast cells. Our observations indicate that the two unglycosylated mammalian proteins PDI and ERp72 are capable of replacing at least some of the critical functions of Trg1, in spite of the fact that the three proteins diverge considerably in sequences surrounding the thioredoxin-related domains."
https://openalex.org/W1489832252,"Abstract RNA turnover in eukaryotes is thought to require 3'-exonuclease activity but so far no RNase with that specificity has been isolated from a eukaryote. We report here on the purification and characterization of a 3'-exoribonuclease isolated from the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro the purified enzyme displayed an absolute requirement of NTPs for activity. Each of the eight standard ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides supported activity with Km values ranging from 20 to 90 microM. The enzyme also displayed RNA-stimulated NTPase activity. The NTP-dependent enzyme cofractionated with three polypeptides of molecular masses 75,000, 90,000, and 110,000 daltons, although the native enzyme appears to have a molecular mass of 160,000 daltons predicted from the Stokes radius. The possible functions of this enzyme in vivo in the regulated decay of mitochondrial RNAs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546455391,"The properties of site-directed mutants as to the putative hydrophilic loop region between hydrophobic segments 2 and 3 in the transposon Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (TET) were reported in our previous paper (Yamaguchi, A., Someya, Y., and Sawai, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19155-19162). The loop between hydrophobic segments 8 and 9 contains a conserved sequence motif, GXXXXKXGEK, which is a derivative of the sequence motif, GXXXXRXGRR, in loop2-3. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on loop8-9 revealed that the two loops exhibit significant structural resemblance, that is, 1) when the Gly residue at the eighth position in each loop was replaced by various amino acid residues, the residual activity of the resultant mutants corresponded well to the beta-turn propensity of the substituent, 2) the Cys mutant as to the fourth position in each loop was most profoundly inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide among 10 Cys mutants as to each loop, and 3) the reactivity of a Cys residue introduced at the third position in loop8-9 with N-ethylmaleimide was lower than that in the case of the other Cys mutants, probably due to the residue being partially cryptic as to the attack of the reagent, similar to in the case of the corresponding residue in loop2-3, the latter being entirely cryptic. The Gly at the first position in loop8-9 is less important than the corresponding Gly in loop2-3, however, since the TET protein suffered a loss of activity when a bulky side chain was introduced at the first position in loop8-9 as well as in loop2-3, the structural roles of the 2 glycines are likely to be similar. These findings suggested that loop2-3 and loop8-9 may occupy similar positions in the three-dimensional structure of the TET protein. On the other hand, the two loops showed a significant functional difference; the negative charge of Asp66 and the positive charge of Arg70 in loop2-3 were essential for the transport function, but, in contrast, there was no functionally essential residue in loop8-9, indicating that loop2-3 may form an active leaflet in the TET protein, while loop8-9 may be a silent counterpart."

https://openalex.org/W1592199818,"The biological activity of interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) is dependent on the functional coupling of IL-2R beta molecules to intracellular enzymes such as protein tyrosine kinase. The serine-rich, S-domain within the cytosolic portion of IL-2R beta plays an essential role in transduction of the IL-2 proliferative signal. Cells bearing either wild type IL-2R beta (Baf alpha/beta) or deletions within the S-domain (Baf alpha/beta SD1) were used to evaluate the importance of the S-domain in linking ligand binding to protein tyrosine kinase induction. Multiparameter, side by side comparisons showed that only those cells that expressed wild type IL-2R beta responded to IL-2 by increased cellular proliferation, accumulation of the c-myc proto-oncogene, and activation of protein tyrosine kinase. Activation of protein tyrosine kinase was, in turn, linked to increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. These findings indicate that the S-domain of the IL-2R beta chain is an essential component in the signal transduction cascade that links IL-2 binding to tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2115298698,"We have observed that soluble extracts from the extreme acidothermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus contained protein phosphatase activity that was greatly stimulated by the divalent metal ions Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, or Co2+. This activity apparently arose from a single enzyme since (a) stimulation by these divalent metal ions was not additive and (b) protein phosphatase activity eluted as a single peak from both a DE52 ion-exchange column and a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column. Its apparent molecular mass was approximately 28,000 daltons. The enzyme dephosphorylated a variety of phosphoserine-containing substrates including casein, histone H2a, phosphorylase kinase, or glycogen phosphorylase. The enzyme would not dephosphorylate either histone H1 or a number of phosphotyrosine-containing compounds. It removed only half the phosphate bound to histone H2b, which is phosphorylated at two sites by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Protein phosphatase activity was inhibited by EDTA, Cu2+, Zn2+, NaF, inorganic phosphate, or pyrophosphate; but was unaffected by other potential activators and inhibitors such as microcystin, okadaic acid, vanadate, polyamines, or sulfhydryl modifying reagents. This enzyme represents the first protein phosphatase to be identified in any member of the third and oldest phylogenetic kingdom in nature, the archaebacteria."

https://openalex.org/W1581618262,"Nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells results in the rapid activation of MAP kinases. These enzymes are activated through interaction with a protein activator. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activator has been partially purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The activator has an apparent molecular mass of 50-60 kDa. The MAP kinase activator is rapidly generated in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) and can be detected within 30 s of exposure, reaching maximal levels within 2 min and then declining to near basal levels by 15-20 min. The activation of MAP kinase is dependent upon the time of incubation with the activator and on activator concentration. The MAP kinase activator is itself a protein kinase that phosphorylates MAP kinases and mediates their activation. The NGF-stimulated MAP kinase activator phosphorylates MAP kinase on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, establishing this enzyme as dual specific kinase. The MAP kinase activator is itself a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation on tyrosine residues is stimulated upon NGF treatment of the cells. The enzyme activity of MAP kinase activator is abolished by treatment with both the tyrosine-specific phosphatase PTP-1 and the serine/threonine-specific phosphatase PP2A. The activator is produced in response to NGF, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor. The protein kinase inhibitor K252a selectively inhibits the ability of NGF to generate MAP kinase activator activity. These data suggest that the upstream events governing MAP kinase activation involve the regulated phosphorylation of dual specificity MAP kinase activator as an immediate consequence of receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W87434055,"Recently we have identified two novel phosphorylated metabolites in the lenses of diabetic rats as sorbitol 3-phosphate (Sor-3-P) and fructose 3-phosphate (Fru-3-P). The latter compound is of particular interest since it is a potent glycating agent, which could account, at least in part, for the increased protein cross-linking and cataract formation in the lens of the diabetic rat. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of formation of these compounds, 31P NMR spectra of rat, pig, and rabbit lenses, perfused with media supplemented with glucose, fructose, or sorbitol, were acquired. Perfusion with fructose-supplemented media resulted in the production of Fru-3-P in all three species. This compound was not produced upon perfusion with fructose-deficient media. The identification of the newly synthesized material as Fru-3-P was confirmed by spiking perchloric acid extracts of the perfused lenses with synthetic Fru-3-P. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of a fructose-3-phosphokinase in mammalian lenses. If this enzyme is present in human lenses as well, it will reinforce the hypothesis that this enzyme and its product, Fru-3-P, may play a role in diabetic cataractogenesis and that lenticular fructose-3-phosphokinase may provide another therapeutic target in the prevention and alleviation of diabetic cataracts."

https://openalex.org/W1532903931,"Two mammalian genes for the Ca(2+)-binding regulatory subunit of the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase (calcineurin) were identified recently, suggesting unique associations with tissue-specific catalytic subunits. The murine brain (beta 1) and testis (beta 2) isoforms of the regulatory subunit were expressed with poly-histidine carboxyl termini and purified by Ni(2+)-chelate chromatography, each exhibiting high affinity Ca2+ binding on nitrocellulose overlays. Using chromatographic methods to assess complex formation, the beta 1 and beta 2 isoforms appeared indistinguishable in their binding to bacterially expressed forms of the murine brain (alpha 1) or testis (alpha 3) catalytic subunits; this suggests that multiple heterodimeric forms may be present in some tissues. Furthermore, both beta 1 and beta 2 formed complexes with the recombinant catalytic subunit from Neurospora crassa. For this catalytically active fungal enzyme, stoichiometric amounts of mammalian regulatory subunit increased calmodulin-dependent activity without affecting that stimulated by Mn2+ alone. Maximal hydrolysis of rho-nitrophenyl phosphate by the N. crassa catalytic subunit was stimulated 80-120% with the beta 1 isoform and 30-50% by beta 2. Significantly, the incubation time at 4 degrees C required for optimal activation (6-8 h) was much greater than that for association (1 h), indicating that the catalytic subunit undergoes a slow transition to an activated conformation after binding the regulatory subunit. The production of functional heterodimers of mammalian and fungal proteins implies highly conserved interaction domains on the catalytic and regulatory subunits of this phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W152525552,"6-Phospholysine phosphatase (30 kDa) and 3-phosphohistidine/6-phospholysine phosphatase (150 kDa) were purified partially from rat brain cytosol. The former hydrolyzed 6-phospholysine to inorganic phosphate and lysine, and the Km value was 0.83 mM. The latter hydrolyzed 6-phospholysine or 3-phosphohistidine to inorganic phosphate and lysine or histidine, and the Km values were 0.78 and 0.37 mM for 6-phospholysine and 3-phosphohistidine, respectively. Moreover, the latter enzyme preparation dephosphorylated AMP, GMP, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Substrate specificities of both enzymes were distinct from those of N omega-phosphoarginine phosphatase (Kuba, M., Ohmori, H., and Kumon, A. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 208, 747-752) and phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1), indicating that there are phosphatases corresponding to N-phosphorylated basic amino acids. The possibility that these enzymes work in vivo as protein phosphatases to regulate the level of N-phosphorylated proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599947702,"The leukotriene (LT)D4 receptor has been defined as a G-protein-coupled receptor. In order to characterize this receptor, an iodinated, photoactivatable azido derivative of LTD4 (125I-azido-LTD4) has been synthesized for use as a photoaffinity probe. The characteristics of 125I-azido-LTD4 specific binding to guinea pig lung membranes were directly comparable to those of [3H]LTD4 specific binding to this tissue. 125I-Azido-LTD4 specific binding was saturable and of high affinity, enhanced by divalent cations and inhibited by sodium ions, but not potassium ions. 125I-Azido-LTD4 specific binding was also strongly inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP gamma S, with ATP gamma S being 100-fold less potent, suggesting this inhibition was due to selective interaction with a G-protein. The cysteinyl leukotrienes competed for 125I-azido-LTD4 specific binding to guinea pig lung membranes with the following rank order of potency: LTD4 > LTE4 > LTC4, while the non-cysteinyl LTB4 was virtually inactive. Two structurally different LTD4 receptor antagonists, MK-571 and ICI 204,219, also competed for 125I-azido-LTD4 specific binding with nanomolar potency, whereas the leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, MK-886, was 10,000-fold less active. These data are in agreement with 125I-azido-LTD4 binding specifically to a G-protein-coupled LTD4 receptor. Photolysis of 125I-azido-LTD4 under equilibrium binding conditions resulted in the selective radiolabeling of a 45-kDa guinea pig lung membrane protein. The photolabeling of this 45-kDa protein was saturable, modulated by cations and inhibited by nucleotide analogs in an analogous way to 125I-azido-LTD4 specific binding. In addition, the photolabeling of this protein was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by all competing ligands, with the same rank order of potency and IC50 values as determined in the 125I-azido-LTD4 binding assay. It is proposed, therefore, that this novel 45-kDa protein is the guinea pig lung LTD4 receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1493181951,"The identification of amino acid substitutions in the alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase that alter cardiac glycoside sensitivity provides a unique opportunity to examine the role these residues play in binding to the structural domains of these drugs. Substitution of a residue(s) involved in binding to the sugar moiety of cardiac glycosides would be expected to yield similar affinities for ouabain and its aglycone, ouabagenin. Sheep Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit amino acid substitutions previously shown to influence ouabain sensitivity were tested for activity in the presence of ouabain and ouabagenin. These substitutions included both transmembrane and extracellular regions: C104F, D121E, N122D, Q111K, N122K, and Q111R, A112S. Na,K-ATPase activity versus drug concentration curves yielded I50 values over a 1000-fold range for wild type HeLa and HeLa transfectants. Interestingly, the I50 ratio for ouabagenin to ouabain in all mutants tested indicated a 19-24-fold lower affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for ouabagenin. This constant ratio among all mutations tested implies that the first transmembrane region and the first extracellular loop (H1-H2) do not participate in the binding of the sugar moiety of cardiac glycosides."
https://openalex.org/W1517340965,"We have found that synthesis of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, GRP78, was increased following glucocorticoid treatment of S49 and W7MG1 mouse lymphoma cell lines. These lines synthesized a 74-kDa mouse mammary tumor virus envelope glycoprotein precursor, Pr74, both constitutively and in response to glucocorticoid treatment. In these cell lines, nascent Pr74 was not processed normally but was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum where it was bound stably by GRP78. GRP78 synthesis was not increased following glucocorticoid treatment of the W7.2 mouse lymphoma cell line, which does not synthesize Pr74, suggesting that the increase in GRP78 synthesis following glucocorticoid treatment of S49 and W7MG1 cells was secondary to the glucocorticoid-induced increase in Pr74 synthesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, the glucocorticoid-induced increase in Pr74 synthesis preceded the increase in GRP78 synthesis. Also, there was a direct correlation between the level of GRP78 synthesis and the level of Pr74 synthesis among multiple subclones of the W7-ENV/N line. This line was derived from the W7.2 line by retroviral mediated transfer of a constitutively expressed sequence encoding a defective form of Pr74 that was bound stably by GRP78 within the endoplasmic reticulum. An elevation in the steady state level of GRP78 mRNA was not detected either in glucocorticoid-treated S49 cells and W7MG1 cells or in subclones of the W7-ENV/N line that have an increased level of GRP78 synthesis. Therefore, it appears that the binding of Pr74 to GRP78 induces an increase in GRP78 synthesis that is regulated at a translational level, rather than at a transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1566205764,"4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of 4-aminobutyrate to succinic semialdehyde, is a key enzyme of the 4-aminobutyrate shunt. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA sequence shows that the precursor protein consists of the mature enzyme of 473 amino acid residues and an amino-terminal segment of 27 amino acids (Kwon, O. S., Park, J., and Churchich, J. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7215-7216). A recombinant 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase has been expressed in Escherichia coli using pETIId as expression vector. The protein has been purified and characterized as a dimer (2 x 55 kDa). NH2-terminal sequence analysis has revealed the presence of an extra amino-terminal segment (signal peptide) predicted from the cDNA sequence. The isolated precursor of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase contains pyridoxal 5-phosphate and exhibits catalytic activity (18 units/mg) comparable to that of the mature enzyme (20 units/mg). The presequence peptide of the precursor of mitochondrial 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase does not interfere with the folding and functional properties of the mature moiety of the aminotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1493640649,"Actinomycin synthetase I, which activates the precursor of the chromophore of actinomycin, has been purified nearly 1000-fold from extracts of Streptomyces antibioticus. The enzyme has an M(r) of 45,000 and appears to function as a single polypeptide chain. The formation of the enzyme is repressed when S. antibioticus mycelium is grown on glucose as a carbon source. Several benzoic acid derivatives, including intermediates in the putative pathway for actinomycin biosynthesis, were capable of supporting ATP-pyrophosphate exchange catalyzed by actinomycin synthetase I. Interestingly, three synthetic phenoxaziones also functioned as substrates in the exchange reaction. It proved possible to purify a second enzyme involved in actinomycin biosynthesis, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 4-methyltransferase, from the same extracts prepared for the purification of actinomycin synthetase I and by similar procedures. Streptomyces lividans, previously shown to contain a silent gene for the enzyme phenoxazione synthase, apparently does not contain a silent pathway for the complete synthesis of actinomycin since neither actinomycin synthetase I nor the methyltransferase could be detected in strains containing a cloned sequence that activates phenoxazione synthase expression."
https://openalex.org/W1933327792,"The molecular events that lead from the interaction of insulin with its receptor to the activation of protein serine/threonine kinases are still unknown. In this study, we have examined the role of GTP-binding proteins in this signaling pathway using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes permeabilized with alpha-toxin from Staphylococcus aureus. Addition of GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) or insulin to such permeabilized cells markedly increases protein kinase activities in cell lysates using the microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase substrate peptide KRELVE-PLTPSGEAPNQALLR, which contains the threonine 669 phosphorylation site on the epidermal growth factor receptor. Similar stimulations of protein kinase activity by these agents are observed using the peptide KRRRLASLAA, which is selectively phosphorylated by ribosomal protein S6 kinases. The effects of insulin and GTP gamma S are not additive. Importantly, the GTP-binding protein antagonist GDP beta S (guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)) inhibits the activation of the protein kinase activities by insulin in permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of Ras or other GTP-binding proteins is a key element of the signaling mechanism whereby insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activates the microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase cascade."
