https://openalex.org/W2033177883,"A method is presented by which hundreds of haploid plants of various species of Nicotiana can be raised from pollen grains. Stamens should be excised when pollen grains have been individualized, but are still uninucleate and free of starch. When grown in vitro on a relatively simple medium, some pollen grains proliferate into embryo-like structures which develop in stages similar to those of zygotic embryos. The plantlets mature and flower profusely, but do not set seed."
https://openalex.org/W1976912867,"Maximum species diversity occurs at abyssal depths of greater than 2500 meters. Other diversity peaks occur at depths of 35 to 45 meters and 100 to 200 meters. The peak at 35 to 45 meters is due to species equitability, whereas the other two peaks correspond to an increase in the number of species."
https://openalex.org/W2024801401,"Individually marked male elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, observed on an island off central California participate in a social hierarchy resembling the peck order of domestic chickens. Individuals achieve status by fighting and maintain it by stereotyped threat displays. The higher the status of a male, the more readily he approaches and copulates with females. Four percent of the males inseminated 85 percent of the females."
https://openalex.org/W2064626048,"Troops of the black and white colobus Colobus guereza in the Budongo Forest, Uganda, average eight animals with a typical composition of one adult male, four adult females, two subadults, one juvenile, and one infant. Solitary males and small all-male groups also occur. Troops of mixed sexes have well-defined territories which coincide roughly with the home range. Territories of five groups averaged 0.062 square mile (0.137 km2) in area, agreeing closely with territory-sizes of Asian Colobine monkeys. Adult males have a roar that is concerned with maintaining territorial spacing, but not with actual territorial defense. The territories of these arboreal, forest animals are much smaller than the home ranges of more terrestrial and nonterritorial open-country primates."
https://openalex.org/W2025059706,A deep-towed magnetometer profile made across the East Pacific Rise crest shows many anomalies with about 1000-gamma amplitudes and 500-meter wavelengths and has larger amplitude changes corresponding to magnetic field reversals. This profile across contacts between normal and reversely magnetized crustal blocks is interpreted to place an upper limit of 4700 years on the time required for field reversals and an upper limit of 280 meters on the width of the intrusion center at the rise crest. This intrusion center may occasionally shift several kilometers laterally with respect to the rise axis. The magnetometer records are compatible with the hypothesis that the magnetic field has undergone many fluctuations of short period and small intensity in the past 2 million years. Sediment accumulation increases from less than 2 meters at the rise crest axis to about 20 meters at the western end and 10 meters at the eastern end of the profile. This increase in accumulation appears to be the result of ocean-floor spreading.
https://openalex.org/W2058585939,A bunsen flame rotated under a cylindrical annulus filled with liquid mercury forces the liquid mercury to rotate in a direction counter to that of the rotating flame. The rate of rotation of the liquid is several times greater than that of the flame. This observation may provide an explanation for the high velocities of apparent cloud formations in the upper atmosphere of Venus.

A fourth type of policy, under which the government attempts to ""pick winners"" in commercial applied R & D, has been a clear-cut failure."

The ages obtained are in agreement with the ages previously obtained from other deep-sea cores from the same area. Because of their greater precision, the new dates provide a more accurate time scale for the past 170,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W2052204715,"Leaves of two subgenera of Panicum differ in photosynthetic physiology and bundle sheath characteristics. Species of the subgenus Eupanicum, like other tropical grasses, had high phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (E.C.4.1.1.31) activity, had specialized chloroplasts within the parenchyma bundle sheath cells, and lacked phatorespiration. The pattern for the temperate subgenus Dichanthelium was opposite."
https://openalex.org/W2076450771,"expansion of urban populations now makes it necessary for zoos to educate the generations growing up without any natural contact with wild creatures. Except at the zoo, the opportunities to know or even to become interested in wild creatures are largely vicarious for most city dwellers. Yet, the opinions of these urbanites may ultimately shape the future policies of conserv-ation in this country. Seen in this light, the educational challenges to the naturalist and the conservationist are identical. educational functions and methods of zoos (as of museums) are not those of the classroom, although zoos do collaborate with schools to supplement classroom education. Departments of education at several zoos, such as those in London, San Diego, and New York, supply programs, lectures, and tours for the local schools. education departments of the San Diego and Bronx zoos now send lecturers with living animals to nearby elementary and secondary schools, operate an inservice teachers' course on the use of the zoo, conduct special summer courses, give tours, and manage an educational film program. In Philadelphia and Chicago, zoo mobiles, each containing animal exhibits and a lecturer, visit schools and playgrounds. Zoos and universities located close to each other often establish joint programs. Subjects that might be taught in zoos include geography, evolution, and an appreciation of the term renewable resoruces. At the 1967 annual conference of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, in a symposium entitled The use of zoos and aquaria in teaching animal behavior, A. W. Stokes remarked that"
https://openalex.org/W2040640685,"THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF GROSSLY DEFORMED SOLIDS WAS MEASURED BY TWO TECHNIQUES: EXTRUSION AND OPPOSED-ANVILS. IN EXTRUSION THE SHEAR STRENGTH IS DETERMINED BY MEASUREMENT OF THE LOAD REQUIRED TO FORCE A SAMPLE OF THE MATERIAL THROUGH A CONSTRICTION, WHEREAS IN AN OPPOSED-ANVIL APPARATUS THE SHEAR IS CALCULATED FROM THE TORQUE REQUIRED TO SHEAR A THIN WAFER OF THE SAMPLE MATERIAL WHILE IT IS COMPRESSED BETWEEN FLAT, CIRCULAR ANVILS. THESE EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES ARE DESCRIBED. BOTH TECHNIQUES ARE SUITED TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE SHEAR STRENGTH ONLY AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT EXTRUSION PROCESSES ARE MOST CONVENIENT FOR STRENGTH MEASUREMENTS ON SOFT MATERIALS AT RELATIVELY LOW PRESSURES. THE OPPOSED-ANVIL TECHNIQUE IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR MEASUREMENTS ON STRONG SOLIDS AT VERY HIGH PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES. AN EMPIRICAL SHEAR STRENGTH FORMULA WAS DEVELOPED TO REPRESENT THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF SOLIDS. INVESTIGATIONS OF THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE ON GROSSLY DEFORMED SOLIDS CAN BE USED TO STUDY THE PHASE DIAGRAMS OF SOILDS, TO SEARCH FOR POLYMORPHIC FORMS, AND TO ASSIST IN THE SYNTHESIS OF PARTICULAR COMPOUNDS. SOLID FILM LUBRICANTS ARE FINDING EXTENSIVE APPLICATIONS IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE CONVENTIONAL OILS BREAK DOWN OR ARE INCONVENIENT TO USE. SOLIDS CAN FUNCTION AS LUBRICANTS WHEN THEIR RESISTANCE TO SHEAR IS SMALL. SINCE THE LOCALIZED PRESSURES BETWEEN CONTACTING PARTS CAN BE QUITE HIGH, A NEED EXISTS FOR DATA ON THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF SOLID LUBRICANTS."

https://openalex.org/W2054183837,"The two Viking spacecraft launched to Mars in 1975 were designed for 90 days of intense observations followed by an extended mission phase to end in 1978. Because the spacecraft were still operating so well in 1978, three more mission phases were added and the project was not officially terminated until 1980. During these last three mission phases delays in controlling the orbiters from the earth increased. The spacecraft were kept functional and the length of the Viking mission was extended because the ground crew, over a period of 2 years, gradually made the orbiters autonomous."
