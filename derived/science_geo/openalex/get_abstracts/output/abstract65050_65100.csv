Its polarity is the same as that of the dorsal root potential elicited by stimulation of the A-fibers (A-DRP), thus probably providing presynaptic inhibition of primary afferents. The size of the C-DRP increases in proportion to the size of the C-volley. A preceding A-DRP reduces the C-DRP."

With 5-(14)C-labeled compound, a biphasic incorporation into sensitive cells occurs, but the inhibition of cell multiplication is manifest much later than the rapid phase of incorporation of the analog."

https://openalex.org/W1968560644,"Studies of a child with glycogenosis revealed an increased concentration of glycogen and low phosphorylase activity in her liver. Using mixtures of homogenates of the patient's liver and of normal liver, we found the low phosphorylase activity to be caused by a deficiency of phosphorylase kinase and not of hepatic phosphorylase. The fact that phosphorylase activity was restored to normal values by the addition of phosphorylase b kinase from rabbit muscle substantiates this conclusion."

https://openalex.org/W2028548189,"In a serine-deficient medium, cells from humangt chronic granulocytic leukemia and normal human bone marrow exhibited a marked inhibition of incorporation of-radioactive precursors of DNA, RNA, and protein into an acid insoluble cell fraction. Normal diploid human fibroblasts did not exhibit inhibition without serine. Chronic granulocytic leukemia and normal marrow cells were essentially unable to synthesize C(14)-serine from C(14)-glucose, while human diploid fibroblasts were highly capable of this synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2019755069,"WE report here an experiment which seems to provide definite proof that the hypothalamic feeding mechanism contains glucoreceptors controlling satiety. That such glucoreceptors exist, and are different metabolically from other brain tissue, had been suggested indirectly by studies relating hunger and gastric contractions to the utilization of glucose1 and by work on goldthioglucose. Single injections of this compound cause lesions in the ventromedial area of the hypothalamus2. The action is specific chemically: glucose and not similar metabolites has to be a part of the molecule3. It is specific anatomically: induced weakness of the blood–brain barrier in other cerebral areas does not increase permeability to this compound4. Goldthioglucose destroys cells the axons of which connect the ventromedial area to the lateral area5, and cells at the origin of Schultze's bundle—a structure which links the hypothalamus to the roots of the vagus4. The former gives an anatomical basis for the known physiological relation between the “satiety” area and the “feeding” area, the latter for the physiological role of the ventromedial area in inhibition of gastric contractions by glucagon6 and stimulation of gastric secretion by insulin7. The action of goldthioglucose is blocked by analogues of glucose8 and by alloxan diabetes9, the latter confirming the postulated dependency of the glucoreceptors on insulin. Anand has also shown that the electrical activity of the ventromedial area is increased when the utilization of glucose is increased and vice versa, while the lateral area shows the opposite pattern10."

https://openalex.org/W2085033428,The incidences of lung tumors and thymic lymphomas were increased in young adult male RF mice receiving 30 milligrams of methyl meth anesulfonate per kilogram of body weight daily in the drinking water throughout life. Differences in oncogenicity between treatment with methyl methanesulfonate and with dimethylnitrosamine or diethylnitrosamine suggest a qualitative difference between the site (or sites) of alkylation by methyl methanesulfonate and by dimethylnitrosamine or diethylnitrosamine within the nucleic acids.
https://openalex.org/W1998317656,"In a study of 41 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia, two were found to have the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase heterozygous phenotype A-B, and two had the phenotype characteristic of Pd(B) homozygosity. Since one of the two with Pd(B) homozygosity was the mother of two children with the A phenotype, it was presumed that she carried a Pd(A) gene not expressed in her blood cells. his was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of her fibroblasts, which had the A-B phenotypic pattern. Gene deletion is considered to be the most likely explanation."

The phosphatases in similarly prepared extracts of leukemia cells differed from the normal isozymes in electrophoretic. mobility. A single variant was detected in one case of untreated leukemia; a similar component and three additional ones were seen in leukemia treated with 6-mercaptopurine."

https://openalex.org/W1591202698,"Abstract 5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (dIUTP) was synthesized in 30% yield from 5-iodo-2'-deoxycytidylate; and the allosteric nature of the inhibition by dIUTP of deoxycytidylate deaminase, derived from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and L5178Y murine lymphoblastic cells, was compared to that produced by dTTP. The inhibition produced by the halogenated triphosphate derivative was found to be qualitatively similar to deoxythymidine triphosphate over a range of pH, temperature, and substrate concentrations; however, 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate was quantitatively more inhibitory. A reversible competitive relationship was observed between the activator effect of deoxycytidine triphosphate and the inhibitory effect of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate when the concentration of the substrate, deoxycytidylate, was not rate-limiting. At low substrate concentrations the reaction velocity of deoxycytidylate deaminase was greatest at about 25°, and the rate of deamination decreased with deviation from this temperature in either direction."

https://openalex.org/W1507901497,"Abstract The specific activities of 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase, and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase in extracts of Lactobacillus casei increase during the period of logarithmic growth of the culture and decrease during the stationary phase. The rise in specific activities may indicate a rapid rate of synthesis since it is prevented by actinomycin D and chloramphenicol. The decrease in activity in the extracts of cells harvested during the stationary phase does not appear to result from the occurrence of proteolytic activity or from incomplete liberation. Variations in the concentration of folate in the growth medium have two effects on the specific activities of the enzymes. Extracts of organisms grown in the presence of 1.4 x 10-9 m folate have higher specific activities of 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase, and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase than extracts from organisms grown in media containing lower levels of folate. This difference may be related to alterations in the growth rate of the bacteria, since other changes in incubation conditions which decreased the growth rate (lower temperature, low thymine levels) also resulted in lower specific activities of these enzymes. When the concentrations of folate present in the growth medium exceed 1.4 x 10-9 m, the specific activity of 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate synthetase and dihydrofolate reductase is decreased, possibly through repression of the enzyme. This effect, which may be of importance in the regulation of 1-carbon intermediates, was not observed for 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase or for enzymes not involved in folate metabolism."

Prior treatment with various severe stressors (spinal-cord transection, prolonged restraint, quadriplegia due to transection of motor nerves, forced exercise, or cold baths), as well as systemic injection of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or chlorpromazine, offers virtually complete protection against this form of topical tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W1988280162,"AFTER the discovery of the experimental tumour-inducing effect of isonicotinic acid hydrazide1 several later investigations verified that this compound showed carcinogenic effects in white mice of different inbred strains when administered intraperitoneally or orally over a long period2–8. According to Mori et al.9, the carbamyl group is responsible for the cancerogenic effect of isonicotinic acid hydrazide. On the other hand, Biancifiori et al.3 are of the opinion that the hydrazine radical10 detached from the compound during the metabolic process plays a part in producing tumours. They found in their experiments that the frequency of tumours in mice of BALB/c strain caused by isonicotinic acid hydrazide or hydrazine sulphate was very high, while isonicotinic acid alone showed no carcinogenic effect."
