https://openalex.org/W2034758576,"Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances of single biomolecules. However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of approximately 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations of organic fluorophores, and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation by a distinct color change in bulk experiments. Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These ""plasmon rulers"" allowed us to continuously monitor separations of up to 70 nm for >3,000 s."

https://openalex.org/W1974950833,"Regulation of neuronal gene expression is critical to central nervous system development. Here, we show that REST regulates the transitions from pluripotent to neural stem/progenitor cell and from progenitor to mature neuron. In the transition to progenitor cell, REST is degraded to levels just sufficient to maintain neuronal gene chromatin in an inactive state that is nonetheless poised for expression. As progenitors differentiate into neurons, REST and its co-repressors dissociate from the RE1 site, triggering activation of neuronal genes. In some genes, the level of expression is adjusted further in neurons by CoREST/MeCP2 repressor complexes that remain bound to a site of methylated DNA distinct from the RE1 site. Expression profiling based on this mechanism indicates that REST defines a gene set subject to plasticity in mature neurons. Thus, a multistage repressor mechanism controls the orderly expression of genes during development while still permitting fine tuning in response to specific stimuli."

PCD must be restricted to infection sites to prevent the HR from playing a pathologic rather than protective role. Here we show that plant BECLIN 1, an ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy gene ATG6/VPS30/beclin 1, functions to restrict HR PCD to infection sites. Initiation of HR PCD is normal in BECLIN 1-deficient plants, but remarkably, healthy uninfected tissue adjacent to HR lesions and leaves distal to the inoculated leaf undergo unrestricted PCD. In the HR PCD response, autophagy is induced in both pathogen-infected cells and distal uninfected cells; this is reduced in BECLIN 1-deficient plants. The restriction of HR PCD also requires orthologs of other autophagy-related genes including PI3K/VPS34, ATG3, and ATG7. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved autophagy pathway plays an essential role in plant innate immunity and negatively regulates PCD.

Thus, the evolutionarily conserved autophagy pathway plays an essential role in plant innate immunity and negatively regulates PCD. Plants mount numerous defense responses to survive pathogen attack. One of these is the hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, a form of programmed cell death (PCD), which is characterized by the rapid death of plant cells at the site of pathogen infection (Lam, 2004Lam E. Controlled cell death, plant survival and development.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). HR PCD is typically triggered upon recognition of a pathogen-encoded avirulence (Avr) protein by a cognate plant resistance (R) protein (Martin et al., 2003Martin G.B. Bogdanove A.J. Sessa G. Understanding the functions of plant disease resistance proteins.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In addition to R gene-mediated cell death, plants also induce cell death in response to general elicitors produced by pathogens (Boller, 1995Boller T. Chemoperception of microbial signals in plant cells.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). HR PCD typically precedes changes in ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and nitric oxide (NO), cell wall strengthening, and activation of various defense-related genes (McDowell and Dangl, 2000McDowell J.M. Dangl J.L. Signal transduction in the plant immune response.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 79-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Collectively, these defense responses are thought to prevent the spread of the pathogen from infection sites into healthy adjacent tissue. Considerable effort has been made to understand regulators of HR PCD, yet little is known about the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the restriction of HR PCD to pathogen infection sites. The interaction between Nicotiana plants that carry the N resistance gene and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is one of the classic model systems for studying plant innate immune responses (Marathe et al., 2002Marathe R. Anandalakshmi R. Liu Y. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. The tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene, N.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2002; 3: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The N protein belongs to a class of R proteins that contains a toll/interlukin-1 receptor homology domain, a nucleotide binding site, and a leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NB-LRR) (Martin et al., 2003Martin G.B. Bogdanove A.J. Sessa G. Understanding the functions of plant disease resistance proteins.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The N protein is hypothesized to specifically recognize the 50 kDa helicase domain (TMV-p50) of the TMV replicase protein to trigger induction of HR PCD and restriction of virus spread (Erickson et al., 1999Erickson F.L. Holzberg S. Calderon-Urrea A. Handley V. Axtell M. Corr C. Baker B. The helicase domain of the TMV replicase proteins induces the N-mediated defense response in tobacco.Plant J. 1999; 18: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, several laboratories including ours have successfully used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in forward and reverse genetics screens to identify components of the N signaling pathway (Burch-Smith et al., 2004Burch-Smith T.M. Anderson J.C. Martin G.B. Dinesh-Kumar S.P.

Martin-Hernandez A.M. Peart J.R. Malcuit I. Baulcombe D.C. Virus-induced gene silencing in plants.Methods. 2003; 30: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To identify novel genes that affect initiation, execution, or restriction of TMV-induced HR PCD, we performed a high-throughput VIGS screen. We found that silencing of the putative plant autophagy gene, BECLIN 1, alters the HR PCD phenotype observed in plants undergoing a defense response to TMV infection. Autophagy is a highly regulated process during which cytoplasmic materials are enclosed in double-membrane bound vesicles that are then targeted to the vacuole or lysosome for degradation (Levine and Klionsky, 2004Levine B.

Genetic analysis in yeast has identified at least 16 autophagy-related (ATG) genes that encode components of the autophagy machinery (Klionsky et al., 2003Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A.

Mutations in some of these ATG genes affect yeast sporulation and survival during nutrient starvation (Thumm et al., 1994Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H.

Although ATG genes are conserved in higher eukaryotes, there have been few studies examining the role of autophagy in the whole organism. In Drosophila, autophagy is induced during starvation (Rusten et al., 2004Rusten T.E. Lindmo K. Juhasz G. Sass M. Seglen P.O. Brech A. Stenmark H.

Steroid regulation of autophagic programmed cell death during development.Development. 2001; 128: 1443-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In C. elegans, autophagy is involved in dauer development and life span extension (Melendez et al., 2003Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Autophagy genes are essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). In mammals, autophagy regulates survival during neonatal starvation, embryonic development, and tumorogenesis (Kuma et al., 2004Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T.

USA. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular functions of ATG orthologs in plants. Recently, it has been shown that mutations in Arabidopsis ATG4 genes block formation of autophagic bodies and cause developmental arrest of root growth under nutrient starvation (Yoshimoto et al., 2004Yoshimoto K. Hanaoka H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Processing of ATG8s, ubiquitin-like proteins, and their deconjugation by ATG4s are essential for plant autophagy.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2967-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Mutations in Arabidopsis ATG7, ATG9, and VTI12 result in accelerated leaf senescence even under nutrient-rich conditions (Doelling et al., 2002Doelling J.H. Walker J.M. Friedman E.M. Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. The APG8/12-activating enzyme APG7 is required for proper nutrient recycling and senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.J. Biol.

Murphy A. et al.The VTI family of SNARE proteins is necessary for plant viability and mediates different protein transport pathways.Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2885-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the roles of ATG genes and autophagy in other plant processes have not been examined. Here we report that plant BECLIN 1 is an ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy gene ATG6/VPS30/beclin 1. We find that autophagy is induced during N-mediated defense against TMV and that BECLIN 1 is required for this induction. Plants deficient in the autophagy genes BECLIN 1, PI3K/VPS34, ATG3, and ATG7 exhibit unrestricted HR PCD in response to pathogen infection. These findings suggest that evolutionarily conserved autophagy genes and the autophagy pathway play an important role in the regulation of PCD induced during plant innate immune responses. To identify novel genes that affect initiation, execution, or restriction of N-mediated HR PCD, we performed a high-throughput VIGS screen using N gene-containing Nicotiana benthamiana plants (referred to as NN, Liu et al., 2002bLiu Y. Schiff M. Marathe R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Tobacco Rar1, EDS1 and NPR1/NIM1 like genes are required for N-mediated resistance to tobacco mosaic virus.Plant J. 2002; 30: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures for details). From 1500 cDNAs that were silenced, we found that suppression of the cDNA clone 92 (cDNA92) resulted in an altered HR PCD phenotype in response to TMV infection (see below). Sequence analysis of cDNA92 revealed significant homology to human beclin 1 (Hsbeclin 1) and yeast ATG6/VPS30 (ScATG6/VPS30) (Kametaka et al., 1998Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Apg14p and Apg6/Vps30p form a protein complex essential for autophagy in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Induction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by beclin 1.Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). We used RT-PCR to clone the full-length N. benthamiana BECLIN 1 (NbBECLIN 1), which encodes a predicted 527 amino acid coiled-coil protein that shares 69% identity and 79% similarity with Arabidopsis BECLIN 1 (AtBECLIN 1; GenBank accession NM_116036), 36% identity and 52% similarity with Hsbeclin 1 (Liang et al., 1999Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Induction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by beclin 1.Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar), and 24% identity and 44% similarity with ScATG6/VPS30 (Figure 1A ; Kametaka et al., 1998Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Apg14p and Apg6/Vps30p form a protein complex essential for autophagy in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To test if plant BECLIN 1 can function in autophagy, we assayed its ability to rescue autophagy-defective ATG6/VPS30-deficient (Δatg6/vps30) yeast. Δatg6/vps30 yeast transformed with plant BECLIN 1 were able to induce autophagy after nitrogen starvation in a manner similar to wild-type yeast and Δatg6/vps30 yeast transformed with Hsbeclin 1 or ScATG6/VPS30 (Figure 1B). Thus, plant BECLIN 1 is an ortholog of yeast ATG6/VPS30 and can functionally complement autophagy in Δatg6/vps30 yeast. One known function of the Arabidopsis autophagy genes ATG7 and ATG9 and the autophagy-related gene VTI12 is delaying leaf senescence (Doelling et al., 2002Doelling J.H. Walker J.M. Friedman E.M. Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. The APG8/12-activating enzyme APG7 is required for proper nutrient recycling and senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33105-33114Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, Hanaoka et al., 2002Hanaoka H. Noda T. Shirano Y. Kato T. Hayashi H. Shibata D. Tabata S. Ohsumi Y. Leaf senescence and starvation-induced chlorosis are accelerated by the disruption of an Arabidopsis autophagy gene.Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Surpin et al., 2003Surpin M.

Murphy A. et al.The VTI family of SNARE proteins is necessary for plant viability and mediates different protein transport pathways.Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2885-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the function of BECLIN 1 in leaves artificially induced to senesce. The detached leaves from the BECLIN 1-silenced plants show accelerated senescence compared to detached leaves from control plants (Figure 1C). In addition, expression of the senescence-associated marker gene SEN1 (AB026439) is significantly induced in BECLIN 1-silenced plants (data not shown). Thus, plant BECLIN 1 is required to prevent premature senescence. This result, together with the complementation of the yeast autophagy mutant, is consistent with a role for plant BECLIN 1 in autophagy. Since we had identified plant BECLIN 1 from its effect on HR PCD, we wanted to determine if the levels of BECLIN 1 RNA/protein level changed during this resistance response. For this, we examined the BECLIN 1 levels during TMV-induced HR PCD in NN plants. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses indicate that BECLIN 1 mRNA and protein levels increase rapidly in leaves in the early stages of TMV-induced HR cell death (Figure 2A ). To elucidate the role of BECLIN 1 in TMV-induced HR cell death, we infected BECLIN 1-silenced and nonsilenced NN plants with GFP-tagged TMV (TMV-GFP). The TMV-GFP allows us to easily follow the spread of the virus over the course of infections and hence determine how resistance response has been affected. BECLIN 1-silenced plants did not display any gross phenotypic abnormalities before infection with TMV-GFP (data not shown). In nonsilenced NN control plants infected with TMV-GFP, HR cell death was restricted to infection sites as expected (Figure 2B). In contrast, in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants infected with TMV-GFP, HR cell death lesions were larger than those in control plants (Figure 2B). In these plants, HR lesions were visible and fully developed by 2 days postinfection (dpi), compared to 3–4 dpi in nonsilenced plants. Interestingly, in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants, cell death extended beyond the site of infection into the uninfected tissues (Figure 2B). This unrestricted cell death resulted in the death of the TMV-GFP-inoculated leaf by 12 dpi (Figure 2B). Pathogen infection is necessary to induce cell death in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants since mock infection of these plants fails to initiate HR cell death (Figure 2B). In the TMV-infected BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants, unrestricted cell death was not limited to the TMV-inoculated leaf since some of the upper uninoculated leaves also died (Figure 2C). These results suggest that BECLIN 1 is required to restrict cell death to the infection site in plants undergoing HR PCD induced upon pathogen infection. Although the boundary of cell death expanded beyond the initial infection sites in BECLIN 1-silenced plants, TMV-GFP remained confined to these initial sites of infection, suggesting that the death of the uninfected tissues was independent of virus movement (Figure 2B). Moreover, death of the upper uninoculated leaves in BECLIN 1-silenced plant was not due to the spread of TMV-GFP from the inoculated leaf since no TMV-GFP was detected in the healthy tissues of upper uninoculated leaves either by UV illumination (Figure 2C) or by RT-PCR (Figure 2D). To confirm that the cell death occurring throughout the plant in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants is not due to the movement of the virus, we transiently expressed the N gene elicitor protein, TMV-p50, using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression method (Agro-infiltration). With this method, the protein of interest (in this case TMV-p50) is expressed only in the infiltrated area, as Agrobacterium cannot move into surrounding tissue. As expected, the expression of TMV-p50 induced cell death only in the Agro-infiltrated area of the nonsilenced NN control plants (Figure 3A , left panels). However, in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants, cell death initially induced in the Agro-infiltrated area spread beyond the area of infiltration, killing the entire leaf by 13 days (Figure 3A, right panels) and eventually the uninfiltrated upper leaves (Figure 3B, right panels). Therefore, HR PCD initiated by TMV-p50 protein alone is sufficient to induce spreading cell death in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants. Since plant BECLIN 1 is required for limiting genetically programmed HR PCD, we examined whether it is also required for the restriction of nonspecific cell death. We induced nonspecific cell death by treating plants with methanol. In BECLIN 1-silenced and nonsilenced plants, nonspecific cell death occurred at similar rates in the methanol-infiltrated area and the cell death was restricted to the infiltrated tissue (Figure 3C). These results suggest that during the N-mediated response, BECLIN 1 is required to limit the spread of cell death from pathogen-infected cells into adjacent uninfected tissues. However, general “poisoning” death (i.e., non-PCD) cannot direct such signal(s) from the cell death sites to cause spread of death to the adjacent tissue even in the absence of BECLIN 1. Since BECLIN 1 is required for limiting HR PCD, we speculated that the loss of PCD restriction was due to the loss of autophagy. We therefore looked for autophagic activity in BECLIN 1-silenced and nonsilenced control plants before and after infection with TMV-GFP. We used LysoTracker Red dye as a probe to indicate the formation of autolysosome-like structures. This dye has been widely used as a probe to indicate autophagic activity in live tissues of various organisms because it labels acidic organelles such as autolysosomes (Moriyasu et al., 2003Moriyasu Y.

Before infection with TMV, cells from nonsilenced control and BECLIN 1-silenced plants do not incorporate LysoTracker dye (Figures 4A and 4B ). However, after infection with TMV, we observed strong punctate LysoTracker-stained autolysosomes in the cells of nonsilenced NN control plants (Figures 4A and 4C). In contrast, these structures were rarely observed in the cells of BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants (Figures 4B and 4C). Thus, LysoTracker-stained autolysosomes are induced at the site of TMV infection during HR PCD, and BECLIN 1 is required for this induction. We next examined the uninfected cells surrounding the tissue undergoing HR PCD for autophagic activity. Unexpectedly, in nonsilenced NN control plants, a number of LysoTracker-stained autolysosomes were observed in these cells (Figure 4D). Additionally, we also examined upper uninfected leaves of nonsilenced NN plants and also found a number of LysoTracker-stained autolysosomes (Figure 4E). In contrast, in BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants, very few cells surrounding the infection site and in systemic tissue contained LysoTracker-stained autolysosomes (Figures 4D and 4E). To confirm that the LysoTracker-stained structures represent autolysosomes, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In infected nonsilenced NN plants, we observed a number of autolysosomes containing electron-dense material in the cytoplasm and vacuole of uninfected tissue surrounding sites of HR PCD (Figures 5A , panels 2–4, and 5D). In a few samples, we observed fusion of autolysosome structures with the vacuole (Figure 5A, panel 3). In addition, we occasionally observed double-membrane vesicles containing cytoplasmic materials and organelles; in other words, stereotypical autophagosomes (Figure 5C). In BECLIN 1-silenced NN plants, we observed reduced numbers of autolysosomes in the cytoplasm and vacuole (Figures 5B, panels 2–4, and 5D). These TEM data, together with our LysoTracker observations, indicate that autophagy is induced during the N-mediated defense response to TMV, both in the infection site and in uninfected adjacent tissue or systemic tissue. Since plant BECLIN 1 is needed to contain N-mediated HR PCD to the infection site, we hypothesized that BECLIN 1 might play a general role in the containment of HR PCD induced by other R genes as well as general elicitors. We tested the role of BECLIN 1 in regulating HR PCD after coexpression of the bacterial resistance gene Pto and its cognate Avr gene, AvrPto (Pedley and Martin, 2003Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Molecular basis of Pto-mediated resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and also after coexpression of the fungal resistance gene Cf9 and its cognate Avr gene, Avr9 (Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D. Plant disease resistance genes.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). We also tested whether cell death responses to general pathogen elicitors are affected by loss of BECLIN 1 by expressing INF1 from Phytophthora infestans and by infecting plants with the bacteria P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. As expected, HR cell death induced by these treatments in the nonsilenced control plants is confined to the infiltrated area even after 11 days (Figure 6). However, in BECLIN 1-silenced plants, cell death spread beyond the infiltrated area, killing the entire leaf by 11 days (Figure 6). In addition, death was observed in systemic upper uninfected leaves of these plants (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that BECLIN 1 is not only required to limit the spread of R gene-mediated HR PCD triggered by viruses but also that triggered by bacteria and fungi and general elicitors. In yeast and mammals, the Atg6/Vps30/Beclin 1 protein physically associates with class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Vps34, which is also required for autophagy (Eskelinen et al., 2002Eskelinen E.L.

Ohsumi M. et al.A ubiquitin-like system mediates protein lipidation.Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the involvement of PI3K/VPS34, ATG3, and ATG7 in TMV-induced HR PCD. Silencing these genes in NN plants produced a similar phenotype to that observed in BECLIN 1-silenced plants: although TMV-GFP was confined to the infection site, cell death was not limited to the TMV infection site and uninfected healthy tissues eventually died (Figure 7). Thus, multiple different autophagy genes function to limit the extent of spread of TMV-induced HR PCD. Our observation of infection sites in ATG-silenced plants indicate that, independently of the spreading cell death phenotype, the ATG genes play a role in controlling TMV replication and/or cell-to-cell movement. In BECLIN 1-, PI3K/VPS34-, ATG3-, and ATG7-deficient plants, there is increased accumulation of TMV as observed by GFP fluorescence at the site of infection (Figure 2, Figure 7). This increased accumulation of TMV is not due to increased spread because GFP fluorescence is confined only to the infection site in these plants. Furthermore, we also observed increased accumulation of TMV RNA in BECLIN 1-silenced plants as detected by RT-PCR (Figure 2D). This is not due to the increased spread of the virus because TMV-GFP is not detected using RT-PCR analysis in systemic uninfected upper leaves in BECLIN 1-silenced plants (Figure 2D). Together these results suggest that BECLIN 1, PI3K/VPS34, ATG3, and ATG7 function not only to limit the spread of HR cell death, but also independently, to limit virus replication and/or movement.

Sclerosteosis shares remarkable similarities with “high bone mass” diseases caused by “gain-of-function” mutations in the LRP5 gene, which encodes a coreceptor for Wnt signaling proteins. We show here that SOST antagonizes Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos and mammalian cells by binding to the extracellular domain of the Wnt coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 and disrupting Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP complex formation. Our findings suggest that SOST is an antagonist for Wnt signaling and that the loss of SOST function likely leads to the hyperactivation of Wnt signaling that underlies bone overgrowth seen in sclerosteosis patients.

The increased rate of bone formation and elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in SOST mutation carriers suggest that excessive bone accumulation is most likely due to an increase in osteoblast activity upon the loss or decrease of SOST expression (5Brunkow M.E.

SOST induces apoptosis of human osteoblastic cells, an activity that other BMP antagonists such as Noggin, Chordin, and Gremlin do not possess (12Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Turcott E. Skonier J.E. Winkler D.G. Latham J.A. Bone. 2004; 35: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite the ability of SOST to antagonize osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP, SOST does not inhibit BMP-induced SMAD protein phosphorylation or luciferase reporters driven by BMP-responsive elements (10van Bezooijen R.L. Roelen B.A. Visser A. van der Wee-Pals L. de Wilt E. Karperien M. Hamersma H. Papapoulos S.E. ten Dijke P. Lowik C.W. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These data suggest that SOST may affect other signaling pathways that complement or mediate the effect of BMP on osteoblasts. Sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease share a remarkable similarity with the “high bone mass” (HBM) phenotype, as these diseases are all caused by an increase of osteogenic activity of osteoblasts and osteocytes and are classified as “craniotubular hyperostoses” (13Johnson M.L. Harnish K. Nusse R. Van Hul W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HBM is associated with “activating” mutations in the LRP5 gene (14Boyden L.M.

Thus, a lack of SOST function exhibits phenotypes related to excessive LRP5 function, implying the possibility that SOST may antagonize LRP5 function. Interestingly, SOST is related to WISE, a secreted protein that binds to the Wnt coreceptor LRP6 and modulates (activates or inhibits) Wnt signaling in a cell context-dependent manner (20Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development. 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Here we show that SOST binds to both LRP5 and LRP6 and inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway. Our results suggest that sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease may be a result of hyperactive Wnt signaling.

TOPflash reporter assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of SuperTOPflash reporter plasmid (31Veeman M.T. Slusarski D.C. Kaykas A. Louie S.H. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and 10 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) with other plasmids as indicated in the experiment descriptions using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). DNA amounts were balanced with pcDNA3.1+ plasmid. Cell extracts were prepared 36 h after transfection and assayed sequentially for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. Firefly luciferase readings were normalized against Renilla luciferase. Xenopus axis duplication assay provides a sensitive and reliable way to test Wnt stimulatory and Wnt inhibitory activities (32Harland R. Gerhart J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 611-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Injection of 5 pg of Xwnt8 or 50 pg of LRP6ΔN mRNA (an constitutively active mutant LRP6) into the ventral marginal zone of a four-cell Xenopus embryo caused ectopic axis formation in >80% of injected embryos (Fig. 1A). SOST mRNA ventral injection alone did not induce ectopic axis formation even when injected at a high dose (2000 pg/embryo). However, SOST mRNA efficiently blocked axis duplication by Xwnt8 mRNA (Fig. 1A). Thus, SOST antagonizes Xwnt8 activity. LRP6ΔN activated Wnt signaling in a Wnt-independent manner and was not inhibited by SOST (Fig. 1A). Two versions of SOST, an untagged SOST and a SOST with a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag, showed the same activity in antagonizing Wnt signaling in this assay (Fig. 1A). To ensure that SOST directly antagonizes Wnt signaling, we examined the ability of SOST to inhibit Xenopus nodal-related 3 (Xnr3) induction by Wnt8 in animal pole explants, because Xnr3 is a directly downstream target of Wnt signaling (32Harland R. Gerhart J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 611-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). SOST blocked Xnr3 activation by Xwnt8 but not by LRP6ΔN (Fig. 1B). SOST mRNA injection alone did not induce Xnr3 expression (Fig. 1B). We also examined whether SOST possesses anti-BMP activity in Xenopus embryos (33Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 34Suzuki A. Thies R.S. Yamaji N. Song J.J. Wozney J.M. Murakami K. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10255-10259Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Injection ventrally of 250 pg of truncated BMP receptor mRNA efficiently blocked BMP signaling in developing Xenopus embryos and caused trunk duplication in >80% of injected embryos. By contrast, SOST mRNA injection even at 2000 pg could not induce trunk axis duplication (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, dorsal injection of SOST mRNA (2000 pg/embryo) at the four-cell stage resulted in exaggerated anterior development such as enlargement of the cement gland (not shown), a phenotype similar to that observed by the injection of other Wnt antagonists (33Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Thus, SOST shows potent anti-Wnt activity and does not exhibit anti-BMP activity in Xenopus embryos. To test the ability of SOST to inhibit Wnt signaling in mammalian cells, we employed the SuperTOPflash reporter (31Veeman M.T. Slusarski D.C. Kaykas A. Louie S.H. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 35Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar), which is driven by T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-binding elements and is responsive to Wnt signaling. The SuperTOPflash reporter was readily activated in HEK293T cells transfected with a Wnt1-expressing plasmid. Co-expression of a SOST expression plasmid inhibited Wnt signaling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To further study the SOST protein biochemically, we generated CM from HEK293T cells transfected with the SOST-Myc plasmid. We found that the majority of the SOST protein remains cell-associated (Fig. 2B). The major SOST isoform associated with cells and in the CM had an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa as compared with the calculated molecular mass of 33 kDa. In addition, SOST isoforms with apparent molecular masses from 40 to 50 kDa and from 70 to 110 kDa were also detected in the CM (Fig. 2B). These higher molecular mass isoforms may be attributed to post-translational modifications, because SOST has two predicted sites for N-glycosylation at Asn-53 and Asn-175 (www.w.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) and one site for O-linked glycosylation at Thr-55 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) (36Julenius K. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). We tested SOST CM for inhibition of Wnt signaling. Indeed, SOST CM inhibited cytosolic β-catenin accumulation induced by Wnt-1 CM in Rat2 cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, secreted SOST directly antagonizes Wnt1 activity extracellularly. Similarities between sclerosteosis (associated with the loss of SOST function) and HBM disease linked to hyperactive LRP5 signaling suggest that SOST may antagonize Wnt signaling via direct binding to LRP5. To test the binding between SOST and LRP5 as well as LRP6, we produced CM containing a SOST-IgG fusion protein, which tags SOST with the constant region of immunoglobulin heavy chain, and the extracellular portion of LRP5 and LRP6 tagged with the Myc epitope (LRP5N-Myc and LRP6N-Myc). We found that SOST showed specific interactions with LRP5 and LRP6 but not with a similarly tagged low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLRN-Myc) (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, when LDLRN-Myc was mixed in large excess together with LRP5N-Myc and LRP6N-Myc, SOST specifically bound to LRP5 and LRP6 (Fig. 3A). As an additional control for the binding specificity, we used Fz8CRD-IgG, which has a similar molecular mass to that of SOST-IgG. Despite much higher abundance in the CM, Fz8CRD-IgG was unable to precipitate any detectable amount of LRP5 or LRP6 protein (Fig. 3A). To further demonstrate SOST-LRP5 and SOST-LRP6 interaction functionally, we examined whether SOST could inhibit LRP5 or LRP6 signaling activities. Although LRP5 and LRP6 overexpression alone showed little activation of Wnt signaling in the SuperTOPflash assay, LRP5 or LRP6 synergized robustly with Wnt1 (Fig. 3B). SOST efficiently inhibited signaling activated by Wnt1 plus LRP5 or Wnt1 plus LRP6 (Fig. 3B), showing that SOST functionally antagonizes signaling by LRP5 and LRP6. Formation of complexes between LRP5 or LRP6 and Frizzled (Fz) proteins in the presence of Wnt proteins has been proposed to be an initial step in Wnt signaling activation (19Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). As we showed previously (19Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), Fz8CRD-IgG showed no interaction with the extracellular domain of LRP6 (Figs. 3A and 4A), but the addition of Wnt1 CM induced the formation of complexes between Fz8 and LRP6 (Fig. 4A). The addition of CM containing either untagged or Myc-tagged SOST efficiently blocked such complex formation. CM containing alkaline phosphatase, used as a negative control, had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 4A). Thus, SOST appears to be able to disrupt Wnt-induced Fz-LRP6 complex formation. We have shown that another Wnt antagonist, DKK1, also interacts with LRP5 and LRP6 and prevents Wnt-induced complex formation between LRP5/6 and Fz proteins (24Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The anti-Wnt activity of DKK1 can be greatly enhanced by Kremen proteins, which also bind DKK1 (22Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). We thus compared the relationship between Kremen and SOST or DKK1 in Wnt signaling inhibition. We activated Wnt signaling by co-transfecting Wnt1 plus LRP5 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B) and used a suboptimal amount of SOST or DKK1 that exhibited slight inhibition of Wnt effect (Fig. 4B). Expression of Kremen2 down-regulated Wnt signaling activity by ∼40% in cells expressing LRP5 with Wnt1 (this was likely due to endogenous DKK1 gene induction by activated Wnt signaling) (37Chamorro M.N. Schwartz D.R. Vonica A. Brivanlou A.H. Cho K.R. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although DKK1 plus Kremen2 resulted in strong Wnt signaling inhibition, SOST and Kremen2 did not exhibit synergy in antagonizing Wnt signaling (Fig. 4B). Thus, unlike DKK1, SOST does not cooperate with Kremen2 in Wnt signaling inhibition. In this study we demonstrated that SOST, the product of the gene mutated in sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease, is an antagonistic ligand for the Wnt coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 and an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in both mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. These findings not only expand the repertoire of secreted antagonistic ligands that bind to the Wnt coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 but also have implications for our understanding of sclerosteosis, Van Buchem disease, and bone density diseases associated with LRP5 mutations such as HBM syndrome and osteoporosis. It has become evident that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediated by LRP5 and LRP6 plays a central role in mammalian bone density regulation (13Johnson M.L. Harnish K. Nusse R. Van Hul W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations of LRP5 are associated with the recessive familial osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (38Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M. Wang H. Cundy T.

Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 15Little R.D. Carulli J.P. Del Mastro R.G.

Genet. 2002; 70: 11-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, all known LRP5 mutations from HBM families are single amino acid substitutions clustered in the first so-called YWTD β-propeller of the LRP5 extracellular domain (16Van Wesenbeeck L. Cleiren E. Gram J. Beals R.K. Benichou O. Scopelliti D. Key L. Renton T. Bartels C. Gong Y. Warman M.L. De Vernejoul M.C. Bollerslev J. Van Hul W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 763-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which these mutations cause the increase of LRP5/β-catenin signaling during bone growth remains unclear. For one particular LRP5 mutation, G171V (glycine 171 mutated to valine), decreased inhibition of LRP5 by DKK1 was suggested to account for increased LRP5 signaling (14Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 39Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because SOST is highly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, and because a loss or down-regulation of SOST function in sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease exhibits increased bone growth, SOST appears to be an endogenous negative regulator of bone growth, likely through the inhibition of LRP5 and LRP6 function. It will be interesting to examine whether LRP5 mutations associated with HBM disease result in compromised SOST inhibition of LRP5 function. SOST shares 36% identity with WISE, which was shown to bind LRP6 and to activate or inhibit Wnt signaling in a context-dependent manner (20Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development. 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These two closely related proteins share the “cysteine knot” domain that occupies the central part of proteins. One noticeable difference between SOST and WISE is that whereas SOST behaves exclusively as an antagonist for Wnt/LRP5/6 signaling in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos, WISE alone can function as a weak agonist that activates β-catenin signaling to a limited extent (20Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development. 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The mechanism and function of this Wnt agonist activity of WISE remains unclear. It is also of interest to compare SOST with the prototypic LRP5/6 antagonist DKK1 (33Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), which does not show any amino acid sequence similarity with SOST. Like DKK1 (24Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), SOST has the ability to disrupt Wnt1-induced Fz8-LRP6 complex formation in an in vitro assay, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed SOST action. However, unlike DKK1, SOST inhibition of Wnt signaling is insensitive to the presence of Kremen2, a transmembrane protein that binds to DKK1 (22Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Thus, although both are LRP5/6 ligands, the anti-Wnt activities of DKK1 and SOST can be differently modulated by other co-factors. Some studies suggest that SOST and WISE can bind BMP proteins and act as BMP antagonists (8Kusu N. Laurikkala J. Imanishi M. Usui H. Konishi M. Miyake A. Thesleff I. Itoh N. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 264: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, in Xenopus embryo experiments neither SOST nor WISE exhibits any detectable antagonist activities toward BMP, although both strongly affect Wnt signaling. Indeed, whereas prototypic BMP antagonists such as Noggin and Chordin induce neural tissue and trunk formation (via inhibition of BMP signaling), SOST and WISE failed to do so even when they were expressed at high levels (Fig. 1C) (20Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development. 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, SOST and WISE may at best have weak BMP antagonist activities. Consistent with this notion, the binding affinities of SOST and WISE for BMPs are significantly weaker than those of Noggin and Chordin (8Kusu N. Laurikkala J. Imanishi M. Usui H. Konishi M.

Further studies will be required to clarify whether SOST and WISE only function as Wnt/LRP5/6 antagonists or whether they function as antagonists for both Wnt and BMP signaling. Nonetheless, given the specific bone growth phenotypes of loss of SOST function and LRP5 mutations, modulating SOST and LRP5 interaction may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bone density diseases such as osteoporosis.

https://openalex.org/W2073952925,"β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that mediates Wnt signaling by binding to members of the T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors. Here, we report an evolutionarily conserved interaction of β-catenin with FOXO transcription factors, which are regulated by insulin and oxidative stress signaling. β-Catenin binds directly to FOXO and enhances FOXO transcriptional activity in mammalian cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans , loss of the β-catenin BAR-1 reduces the activity of the FOXO ortholog DAF-16 in dauer formation and life span. Association of β-catenin with FOXO was enhanced in cells exposed to oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAR-1 was required for the oxidative stress–induced expression of the DAF-16 target gene sod-3 and for resistance to oxidative damage. These results demonstrate a role for β-catenin in regulating FOXO function that is particularly important under conditions of oxidative stress."

Here we show that the murine postnatal cerebellum contains multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs). These cells can be prospectively isolated based on their expression of the NSC marker prominin-1 (CD133) and their lack of markers of neuronal and glial lineages (lin−). Purified prominin+lin− cells form self-renewing neurospheres and can differentiate into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons in vitro. Moreover, they can generate each of these lineages after transplantation into the cerebellum. Identification of cerebellar stem cells has important implications for the understanding of cerebellar development and the origins of medulloblastoma."

To investigate the molecular pathogenesis of porencephaly, we studied a mouse mutant that develops porencephaly secondary to focal disruptions of vascular basement membranes. Half of the mutant mice died with cerebral hemorrhage within a day of birth, and ∼18% of survivors had porencephaly. We show that vascular defects are caused by a semidominant mutation in the procollagen type IV α 1 gene ( Col4a1 ) in mice, which inhibits the secretion of mutant and normal type IV collagen. We also show that COL4A1 mutations segregate with porencephaly in human families. Because not all mutant mice develop porencephaly, we propose that Col4a1 mutations conspire with environmental trauma in causing the disease."

We show that CCPs are highly dynamic and can produce multiple vesicles in succession. Using alternating evanescent field and epifluorescence illumination, we show that CCP invagination and scission are tightly coupled, with scission coinciding with maximal displacement of CCPs from the plasma membrane and with peak recruitment of cortactin-DsRed, a dynamin and F-actin binding protein. Finally, perturbing actin polymerization with latrunculin-B drastically reduces the efficiency of membrane scission and affects many aspects of CCP dynamics. We propose that CCP invagination, actin polymerization, and CCV formation are highly coordinated for efficient endocytosis."

In this paper, we show that rabbit and medakafish embryos also exhibit a leftward fluid flow in their ventral nodes. In all cases, primary monocilia present a clockwise rotational-like motion. Observations of defective ciliary dynamics in mutant mouse embryos support the idea that the posterior tilt of the cilia during rotational-like beating can explain the leftward fluid flow. Moreover, we show that this leftward flow may produce asymmetric distribution of exogenously introduced proteins, suggesting morphogen gradients as a subsequent mechanism of left-right axis determination. Finally, we experimentally and theoretically characterize under which conditions a morphogen gradient can arise from the flow."

Transcriptional dysregulation occurred in all 12 insertion sites analyzed. These findings have major implications for diagnostic gene marking and the discovery of genes regulating stem cell turnover.

The protein is only required in neurons, colocalizes with markers for synaptic vesicles as well as active zones, and interacts with t-SNAREs. Loss of vha100-1 leads to vesicle accumulation in synaptic terminals, suggesting a deficit in release. The amplitude of spontaneous release events and release with hypertonic stimulation indicate normal levels of neurotransmitter loading, yet mutant embryos display severe defects in evoked synaptic transmission and FM1-43 uptake.

We generated ""knockin"" mice expressing a mutant Cyt c (KA allele), which retains normal electron transfer function but fails to activate Apaf-1. Most KA/KA mice displayed embryonic or perinatal lethality caused by defects in the central nervous system, and surviving mice exhibited impaired lymphocyte homeostasis. Although fibroblasts from the KA/KA mice were resistant to apoptosis, their thymocytes were markedly more sensitive to death stimuli than Apaf-1(-/-) thymocytes. Upon treatment with gamma irradiation, procaspases were efficiently activated in apoptotic KA/KA thymocytes, but Apaf-1 oligomerization was not observed.

https://openalex.org/W2037104460,"Assembly of silent chromatin domains in budding yeast involves the deacetylation of histone tails by Sir2 and the association of the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins with hypoacetylated histone tails. Sir2 couples deacetylation to NAD hydrolysis and the synthesis of a metabolite, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (AAR), but the functional significance of NAD hydrolysis or AAR, if any, is unknown. Here we examine the association of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 proteins with each other and histone tails. Our analysis reveals that deacetylation of histone H4-lysine 16 (K16), which is critical for silencing in vivo, is also critical for the binding of Sir3 and Sir4 to histone H4 peptides in vitro. Moreover, AAR itself promotes the association of multiple copies of Sir3 with Sir2/Sir4 and induces a dramatic structural rearrangement in the SIR complex. These results suggest that Sir2 activity modulates the assembly of the SIR complex through both histone deacetylation and AAR synthesis."

Recently, we reported that binding of receptor-recognized forms of the proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) to GRP78 on the cell surface of 1-LN human prostate cancer cells induces mitogenic signaling and cellular proliferation. In the current study, we have examined the ability of α2M* to activate PAK-1 and PAK-2. Exposure of 1-LN cells to α2M* caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in phosphorylated PAK-2 and a similar increase in its kinase activity toward myelin basic protein. By contrast, the phosphorylation of PAK-1 was only negligibly affected. Silencing the expression of the GRP78 gene, using either of two different mRNA sequences, greatly attenuated the appearance of phosphorylated PAK-2 in α2M*-stimulated cells.

In addition to increased activation of signaling pathways that promote cellular proliferation and/or suppression of apoptosis, increased motility is often seen in malignantly transformed cells. This increase in motility, along with increased secretion of proteinases, especially matrix metalloproteinases, enables highly metastatic cancer cells to penetrate surrounding basement membranes and invade blood vessels and lymphatics. One mechanism that promotes increased motility of malignant cells is activation of members of the 21-kDa activated kinase (PAK) family.These proteins are Ser/Thr kinases that mediate Rac and Cdc42 GTPase-dependent signaling (see reviews in Refs. 5Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

PAK-1 is tissue-specific in its expression, whereas PAK-2 is ubiquitously expressed. The catalytic activity of PAKs is regulated by the binding of active GTPases to the conserved p21 binding motif in the NH2-terminal domain leading to the relief of autoinhibitory interactions with the COOH-terminal catalytic domain (5Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

PAK-1 mediates signals from the Ras/MAPK and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways to promote cell transformation. PAKs also play important roles in modulating the ability of cancer cells to move and metastasize (5Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

A number of highly metastatic human breast cancer lines exhibit constitutively elevated PAK-1 or PAK-2 activity (12Salh B. Marrota A. Wagey R. Sayed M. Pelech S. Int. J.

As a consequence of these events, α2M* up-regulates DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation (17Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Cell.

Based on these and other observations, we hypothesized that α2M* functions like a growth factor, and its receptor functions as a growth factor receptor (13Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 was identified in the 1990s as an α2M* receptor. Subsequent studies in our laboratory suggested that a receptor distinct from low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 must account for α2M*-dependent signal transduction (14Misra U.K. Chu C.T.

These events require the presence of a small number of sites (∼1500/cells) demonstrating very high ligand affinity (Kd 50–100 pm) for cellular binding of α2M* or its receptor binding domain. This second receptor, initially termed the α2M* signaling receptor, was later isolated from murine peritoneal macrophages and 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and identified as cell surface-associated GPR78, a heat shock protein of the HSP70 family (20Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M.

An increased expression of GPR78 is a part of the unfolded protein response required to alleviate ER stress, maintain ER function, and protect cells against cell death (21Kaufman R.J.

GRP78 is constitutively expressed, but its synthesis can be up-regulated by a variety of stressful conditions (21Kaufman R.J.

Poorly vascularized solid tumors demonstrate both hypoxia and acidosis, and these cells may be viewed as highly stressed.The presence of GRP78 on the cell surface has only recently been appreciated. Constitutive cell surface expression on normal cells is low, but various treatments up-regulate its cell surface expression (18Asplin I.R. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, we have demonstrated in vivo up-regulation of GRP78 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells when mice are exposed to various stimuli (27Bhattarcharjee G. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Cianciolo G. Pizzo S.V. J. Cell Biochem. 2001; 82: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These events appear to have consequences with respect to α2M*-mediated antigen presentation (28Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S. Chernoff B.J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Normal fibroblasts do not show cell surface expression of GRP78, and α2M* treatment does not trigger signaling responses by these cells. Rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, however, express GRP78 on their cell surface and signal briskly when exposed to α2M* (16Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 497-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GRP78 also is expressed to a high degree on the surface of a number of cancer cells, including the highly metastatic 1-LN human prostate cancer cell line (29Hart J.P. Gunn M.D. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By contrast, GRP78 cell surface localization and α2M*-dependent signal transduction do not occur with PC-3 cells, a cell line of low malignant potential, and the parent line for the 1-LN cell line (see, for example, Refs. 17Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Asplin I.R. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem.

Signal. 2004; 16: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated antibodies against GRP78 in the sera of prostate cancer patients, and the presence of these antibodies is highly correlated with increased metastatic potential and a poor prognosis (30Mintz P.J. Kim J. Do K.-A. Wang X. Zinner R.G. Cristofanilli M. Arap A.M. Hong W.K. Troncoso P. Logothetis C.J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The appearance of the normally cryptic GRP78 protein on the cell surface in high concentration may be a critical factor in the development of autoantibodies to GRP78.The circulating concentration of α2M is 1–5 μm, and α2M* comprises about 200–500 nm of this pool (32Pizzo S.V. Wu S.M. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thromboses. Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 4th. Ed. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD2000: 367-386Google Scholar). It has been estimated that about 1 g of α2M turns over daily (32Pizzo S.V. Wu S.M. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thromboses. Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 4th. Ed. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD2000: 367-386Google Scholar). Prostate cancer cells also produce prostate cancer-specific antigen, a proteinase that binds readily to α2M (33Otto A. Bar J. Bienmeier G. J. Urol. 1998; 159: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Zhang W.-M. Finne P. Leinonen J. Vesalainen S. Nordling S. Rannikko S. Stenman U.-H. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus highly aggressive prostate cancer may secrete prostate cancer-specific antigen, which by binding to α2M generates α2M* further increasing the concentration of α2M* in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, tumors may be viewed as existing under ER stress and tumors protect themselves from ER stress by expressing unfolded protein response, of which enhanced GRP78 synthesis is a biomarker (13Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 14Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem.

A small pool of newly synthesized GRP78 translocates to cell surface from the ER in association with MTJ-1 (35Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be envisaged that, under these conditions, a substantial amount of α2M* would be available to bind to cell surface GRP78 thus triggering the activation of mitogenic signaling-dependent cell proliferation.

Here we demonstrated that α2M* mediates PAK-2 activation in 1-LN cells, but PAK-1 is only negligibly affected. We then examined the effect of treating 1-LN cells with α2M* on the mechanism of activation of PAK-2, Rac-1, LIMK, and cofilin. We report that exposure of 1-LN cells to α2M* induces autophosphorylation of PAK-2, activation of the kinase activity of PAK-2 toward myelin basic protein in a tyrosine kinase and PI 3-kinase-dependent manner, and recruitment of PAK-2 to plasma membrane via the adaptor protein NCK. Rac-1 is also activated. We further demonstrate activation of LIMK and cofilin, which are essential for regulating cytoskeletal organization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies against PAK-1, PAK-2, and Bad, as well as the phosphorylated forms of PAK-1, PAK-2, LIMK, cofilin, and Bad (Ser112 or Ser136), were procured from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Myelin basic protein and actin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-GRP78 antibodies were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada). [γ-33P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The sources for the inhibitors used have been described previously. α2M* was prepared as described previously. Other reagents used in the study were of analytical reagent quality and were procured locally.Effect of α2M* Stimulation on Activation of PAK-1 and PAK-2 in 1-LN Cells—The highly metastatic human prostate carcinoma cell line 1-LN, derived from less metastatic PC-3 cells, was a kind gift from Dr. Philip Walther (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Confluent 1-LN cells obtained after overnight incubation in 6-well plates (4 × 106 cells/well) were washed twice with HBSS, with a volume of the HBSS added to the monolayers. One set of cells was stimulated with different concentrations of α2M*, and cells were incubated as above for different time periods. The other set of cells was stimulated with different concentrations of α2M* for 10 min. At the end of incubation, medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.6), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice. The DNA strands were broken by passing the lysates through a 27-gauge needle and syringe several times. The lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, and their protein contents were determined (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1987644757,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a common feature of many vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia and is perpendicular to their apical/basal (A/B) polarity axis. While apical localization of PCP determinants such as Frizzled (Fz1) is critical for their function, the link between A/B polarity and PCP is poorly understood. Here, we describe a direct molecular link between A/B determinants and Fz1-mediated PCP establishment in the Drosophila eye. We demonstrate that dPatj binds the cytoplasmic tail of Fz1 and propose that it recruits aPKC, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits Fz1. Accordingly, components of the aPKC complex and dPatj produce PCP defects in the eye. We also show that during PCP signaling, aPKC and dPatj are downregulated, while Bazooka is upregulated, suggesting an antagonistic effect of Bazooka on dPatj/aPKC. We propose a model whereby the dPatj/aPKC complex regulates PCP by inhibiting Fz1 in cells where it should not be active."
https://openalex.org/W2020527412,"The Ro 60 kDa autoantigen is a major target of the immune response in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. In vertebrate cells, Ro binds misfolded small RNAs and likely functions in RNA quality control. In eukaryotes and bacteria, Ro also associates with small RNAs called Y RNAs. We present structures of unliganded Ro and Ro complexed with two RNAs at 1.95 and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. Ro consists of a von Willebrand factor A domain and a doughnut-shaped domain composed of HEAT repeats. In the complex, a fragment of Y RNA binds on the outer surface of the HEAT-repeat ring, and single-stranded RNA binds in the toroid hole. Mutagenesis supports a binding site for misfolded RNAs that encompasses both sites, with a single-stranded end inserted into the toroid cavity. Our experiments suggest that one role of Y RNAs may be to regulate access of other RNAs to Ro."

https://openalex.org/W2108412857,"Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of adults and one of the most lethal cancers. The secreted growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) promotes glioblastoma migration and proliferation, initiating its oncogenic activities through two cell surface receptors, the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor ζ (PTPRZ1) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), respectively. Here, we report on the presence and purification of two naturally occurring forms of PTN (18 and 15 kDa) that differentially promote glioblastoma migration and proliferation. Using a panel of glioblastoma cell lines, including low passage patient-derived cultures, we demonstrate that PTN15 promotes glioblastoma proliferation in an ALK-dependent fashion, whereas immobilized PTN18 promotes haptotactic migration of glioblastoma cells in a PTPRZ1-dependent fashion. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that PTN15 differs from PTN18 by processing of 12 C-terminal amino acids. To demonstrate clinical relevance, we show that PTN15, PTN18, and PTPRZ1 are significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma relative to normal brain at both mRNA and protein levels using microarray, Western blot, and tissue microarray analyses on human tumors. These results indicate that the PTN18-PTPRZ1 and the PTN15-ALK signaling pathways represent potentially important therapeutic targets for glioblastoma invasion and growth.

Glioblastoma is the most frequent and lethal primary brain tumor of adults, with a median survival time of 12 months from the time of diagnosis despite aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Although refractory to standard treatments, glioblastomas are well suited for targeted molecular therapies (1Mischel P.S. Cloughesy T.F.

A variety of biological activities have been attributed to PTN including mitogenesis, angiogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and cell migration (12Deuel T.F. Zhang N. Yeh H.J. Silos-Santiago I. Wang Z.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). PTN promotes glioblastoma growth via the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK in a process that can be mediated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAPK signaling pathways (13Powers C. Aigner A.

PTN also engages a second receptor, the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRZ1 (also termed RPTPβ and PTPζ) (15Maeda N. Noda M. J.

To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying PTN-mediated invasion and proliferation through these receptors have yet to be fully elucidated. Because the two receptor pathways have not been closely studied together, it remains unclear whether their signaling cascades converge or act independently to promote glioblastoma progression, especially because they share the same ligand yet have seemingly antagonistic enzymatic functions. Furthermore, recent work suggests that differences in cellular processing or post-translational modification of PTN may be responsible for some of its different functional effects (12Deuel T.F. Zhang N. Yeh H.J. Silos-Santiago I. Wang Z.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We now describe the isolation and characterization of two naturally occurring forms of PTN with migratory masses of 18 and 15 kDa. We show that PTN15 specifically promotes glioblastoma proliferation in an ALK-dependent fashion, whereas PTN18 promotes glioblastoma migration in a PTPRZ1-dependent fashion, and that the two forms differ by post-translational processing of 12 C-terminal amino acids. Finally, we demonstrate that PTN15, PTN18, and PTPRZ1 are highly and consistently overexpressed in glioblastoma patient tumors, suggesting critical roles for PTN15-ALK and PTN18-PTPRZ1 signaling in promoting glioblastoma proliferation and invasion. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—The human glioblastoma cell lines LN229, T98G, U87MG, and U138MG were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). U373MG was provided by the European Collection of Cell Cultures through Sigma. Low passage (<15) primary human glioblastoma lines were derived from resected patient tumors as described previously (22Wang Y. Zhu S. Cloughesy T.F. Liau L.M. Mischel P.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were a kind gift from Dr. M. Teitell (UCLA). All cells were routinely maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine solution (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. For cell stimulation experiments, seeded cells were allowed to adhere overnight before serum starvation for 48 h. Cells were then treated with purified PTN (described below) or commercial PTN (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at the indicated amounts and times or challenged with serum-containing medium for 10 min. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed as described previously (23Lu K.V. Jong K.A. Rajasekaran A.K. Cloughesy T.F. Mischel P.S. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, first-strand cDNA was generated by reverse transcribing 2 μg of total RNA that was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μlof cDNA was then used as template in a 50 μl PCR containing Platinum Taq Hi Fidelity polymerase and the PCRx Enhancer System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Primers (IDT DNA, Coralville, IA) spanning the entire open reading frame were as follows: for PTN, 5′-GAGCGCCAGAGAGGACGTTT-3′ and 5′-TCCTGTTTGCTGATGTCCTTTT-3′; for PTPRZ1, 5′-ACCGTCTGGAAATGCGAA-3′ and 5′-AACTAGACTGATTTTCCTGCC-3′; and for ALK, 5′-GGCCCGGAGAGCAGTGTAAA-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCTGGTTCATGCTATT-3′. 5 μl of each reaction was then run on 2% (PTN) or 1% (PTPRZ1 and ALK) agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride), homogenized through an 18-gauge needle five times each, and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and usually 20 μg of each protein sample was loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) and polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), as well as rabbit polyclonal ALK antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), were used at 1:000 dilution. Monoclonal anti-PTPRZ1 (RPTPβ) antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories) were used at 1:500 dilution, whereas monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Sigma) and anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution. After washing blots in TBST, the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:2000 were added for 1 h at room temperature, and bands were detected with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of PTN expression, 15 μl of each media sample conditioned for 48 h was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels, the proteins were transferred as described above, and the blots were blocked in 2% horse serum in TBST. Goat anti-PTN antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were diluted 1:500 in 2% horse serum and incubated overnight. For immunoprecipitation, 0.5–1.5 mg of protein lysate was incubated overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C with a mixture of goat polyclonal (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) anti-ALK antibodies diluted at 1:150 each. A 50:50 mixture of protein A-agarose and protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) was then added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed in lysis buffer five times and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were boiled and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies (P-Tyr-100; Cell Signaling Technology). PTN Clones and Transfection—Full-length wild type PTN cDNA was generated by RT-PCR from U87MG total RNA as described above and then cloned into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was designated pcDNA3.1-PTN18. Other PTN construct variants were generated by directional cloning of PCR products into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pcDNA3.1-PTN18-V5 was created by PCR-amplifying a full-length PTN cDNA lacking the endogenous stop codon and fused in-frame with the 3′ V5-His epitope tag. pcDNA3.1-PTN15 was engineered using a PCR primer to insert a stop codon 36 bases upstream of the endogenous stop codon, translating into a 3′ truncation of 12 amino acids. pcDNA3.1-PTN15-V5 was generated in the same manner, except the artificial stop codon was omitted, and the truncated cDNA was directly cloned in-frame with the 3′ V5-His tag. Orientation and sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the various PTN constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of PTN from Conditioned Media—Approximately 2 liters of conditioned media was collected from HEK 293T cells 72 h after being transfected with pcDNA3.1-PTN18 or pcDNA3.1-PTN15 and purified according to Ref. 24Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, with modifications. After adjusting the media to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl and clearing the media through a 0.2 μm filter, the media were loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin HP column and washed with 80 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and the bound proteins were eluted with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl. The eluate was then equilibrated to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl; concentrated down to 400 μl; and then further fractionated by injecting 200-μl volumes into a TosoHaas (Montgomeryville, PA) TSK-gel SP-5PW sulfopropyl HPLC column (7.5 mm × 7.5 cm) on an HP-1090 HPLC system (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a ChemStation and a diode array detector. Separation was achieved using a linear gradient from 0.45 m NaCl to 2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions under chromatographic peaks were collected and stored at -20 °C until further analysis. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell growth was measured using the WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2500–5000 cells (depending on cell line) per well were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate, allowed to adhere overnight, and then serum-starved for 48 h before treatment with the indicated amounts of PTN. Cells were then incubated for an additional 48 h before measuring growth. Haptotactic and Chemotactic Assays—For haptotactic assays, 6-well Transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts with 8.0-μm pores (CoStar, Cambridge, MA) were coated from the bottom with 5 μg/ml PTN or 50 μg/ml BSA control diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. After adding serum-free minimum essential medium to the lower compartments, 5 × 105 cells in serum-free minimum essential medium/BSA (5 mg/ml) were seeded onto the upper chambers and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Non-migrated cells on the upper surface were then removed with cotton swabs, and the remaining migrated cells on the lower surface were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.25% crystal violet. Migrated cells were quantitated by imaging 5 random fields/filter on an Olympus BX61 microscope at ×40 magnification and then counting the number of cells from each photomicrograph using the particle separator and colorimetric detection features of the accompanying Olympus MicroSuite software. For chemotactic assays, the filters were left uncoated, but instead, PTN was added into the serum-free media of the lower compartment. Cells were then seeded and incubated, and filters were fixed, stained, and counted as described for the haptotactic assays. N-terminal Sequence and Mass Spectrometric Analyses—For protein sequence analysis, an aliquot of each sample was run on 15% SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After staining and destaining with Coomassie Blue, protein bands were cut out and directly loaded for N-terminal sequence analysis on a Procise 494 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). MALDI-MS and electrospray LC-MS analyses were performed as described previously (25Lu K.V. Rohde M.F. Thomason A.R. Kenney W.C. Lu H.S. Biochem.

For MALDI-MS, an aliquot of each protein sample was mixed with matrix (sinapinic acid; Sigma) for analysis on a Voyager DE-PRO work station (Applied Biosystems). For LC-MS, purified PTN fractions were injected into a reverse phase HPLC column on an HP-1090 system directly connected on-line to an LCQ electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Oligonucleotide Microarrays—Gene expression profiling with Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide microarrays was performed and analyzed as described previously (27Mischel P.S. Shai R. Shi T. Horvath S. Lu K.V. Choe G. Seligson D. Kremen T.J. Palotie A. Liau L.M. Cloughesy T.F. Nelson S.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2361-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Freije W.A.

Microarrays were scanned in the Genearray Scanner (Hewlett Packard) to a normalized target intensity of 2500. Microarray Suite 5.0 was used to define absent/present calls and generate cel files using the default settings. All grid placements and microarrays were visually reviewed for accuracy and array defects. Data files (cel) were uploaded into the dCHIP program (www.dchip.org/) and normalized to the median intensity array. Quantification was performed using model-based expression and the perfect match minus mismatch method implemented in dCHIP (29Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). Patient Tumor Lysates and Tissue Microarray—Protein lysates from frozen tumor samples were prepared as described previously (30Choe G. Horvath S. Cloughesy T.F. Crosby K. Seligson D. Palotie A. Inge L. Smith B.L. Sawyers C.L. Mischel P.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2742-2746PubMed Google Scholar), and 30 μg of each sample was run on 15% SDS-PAGE for PTN immunoblotting as described above. The tissue microarray was generated and immunohistochemically stained as described previously (30Choe G. Horvath S. Cloughesy T.F. Crosby K. Seligson D. Palotie A. Inge L. Smith B.L. Sawyers C.L. Mischel P.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2742-2746PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a tissue array consisting of three representative 0.6-mm cores from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor and corresponding normal brain blocks from each of 48 glioblastomas was constructed. Deparaffinized sections were immersed in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6, for 30 min in a pressure cooker for antigen retrieval. Peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide in water, and primary antibodies were diluted (PTN, 1:500; PTPRZ1, 1:100) in normal horse serum (PTPRZ1 and PTN) or normal goat serum (ALK) and applied for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h and avidin-biotin complex (Elite ABC; Vector) for 1 h. Negative control slides received normal mouse serum (DAKO) as the primary antibody. Vector NovaRed (Vector) was used to visualize specific antibody localization, and slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. Staining intensity was scored by a neuropathologist (K. Y.) based on a scale of 0–2, in which negatively stained specimens were graded 0, weakly positive samples were graded 1, and strongly positive spots were graded 2. PTN, PTPRZ1, and ALK Expression—To better understand the mechanisms by which PTN and its receptors contribute to glioblastoma pathogenesis, we assembled a panel of five established glioblastoma cell lines and three low passage primary glioblastoma cultures derived from patient tumors and determined PTN, PTPRZ1, and ALK expression. All eight glioblastoma cell lines expressed and secreted PTN into conditioned media, as detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, in addition to the expected 18-kDa PTN band, we also observed a second band migrating at 15 kDa that was immunodetected by anti-PTN antibodies in several cell lines. Two cell lines were strongly positive for PTPRZ1 expression (LN229 and U373MG), whereas the cell lines U87MG, GM2313, and GM97 exhibited low to intermediate PTPRZ1 expression (Fig. 1B). Similarly, ALK expression was strong in three glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG, U138MG, and GM1600), whereas GM97 demonstrated weaker protein expression (Fig. 1C). Altogether, the cells in this panel represent strategic combinations in which to test the role of these receptors in PTN signaling, as summarized in Fig. 1D. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human PTN from HEK 293T Cells—Because commercially available PTN expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells lacks mitogenic activity (31Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (described by manufacturers; data not shown), we produced recombinant human PTN by transfecting HEK 293T cells with a cloned full-length human PTN cDNA. Like conditioned media from the glioblastoma cell lines, Western blotting showed that two forms of PTN were secreted into HEK 293T conditioned media: one at the expected full-length size of 18 kDa, and the other migrating at 15 kDa (Fig. 2A, inset). PTN from ∼2 liters of transfected cell conditioned media was purified in two successive chromatography steps. Media were first applied onto a heparin-Sepharose column, and then the resulting eluate was further fractionated by cation exchange chromatography using a sulfopropyl column on HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2A, elution with a NaCl gradient in HPLC resulted in a chromatogram with two main peaks (peaks 1 and 4) surrounding two minor peaks (peaks 2 and 3). Immunoblotting of the main fractions with an anti-PTN antibody revealed bands with apparent molecular masses of 18 and 15 kDa corresponding to full-length PTN (peak 1) and the smaller form of PTN (peak 4), respectively (Fig. 2B). Edman sequencing of these two fractions after SDS-PAGE and polyvinylidene difluoride transfer resulted in identical N-terminal sequences of GKKEKPEKKVKK, further confirming their identities as PTN and suggesting that the 15-kDa form may be C-terminally modified. Silver staining revealed >95% purity in these fractions, as shown in Fig. 2C. Analysis of the two minor peaks showed weaker bands with similar molecular masses of 18 kDa (fraction 2) and 15 kDa (fraction 3) by Western blot, and these bands are most likely due to carryover from the main peaks. Because their band intensities were much lower and barely detectable by silver staining, they were not studied any further. PTN from fractions 1 and 4, designated PTN18 and PTN15, respectively, was used in all subsequent experiments. PTN15 Stimulates Akt and MAPK Activation and Promotes Proliferation in ALK-expressing Glioblastoma Cells—The mitogenic activity of purified PTN18 and PTN15 proteins was tested on serum-starved glioblastoma cells. Whereas stimulation of glioblastoma cells with increasing doses of PTN18 did not induce either Akt or MAPK phosphorylation in any of the different cell lines, treatment with PTN15 induced phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) in ALK-expressing glioblastoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). PTN15-induced Akt and MAPK phosphorylation could be detected after 5 min of treatment and was maintained for at least 30 min, although the activation kinetics were slightly different for each responsive line (data not shown). The signaling activities of PTN15 appeared to be dependent on ALK because each of the responsive cell lines (U138MG and GM1600, Fig. 3A; U87MG, data not shown) was ALK-positive (as shown in Fig. 1C), whereas none of the lines lacking ALK expression demonstrated Akt or MAPK activation (LN229 and T98G, Fig. 3A; U373MG, data not shown). Commercial PTN, which is full length and migrates at 18 kDa like purified PTN18, likewise did not exhibit mitogenic effects on any of the cell lines (data not shown). These results suggest that the mitogenic activity of PTN in glioblastoma cells is primarily dependent on the smaller PTN15 form and not on the full-length PTN18 protein. This is in agreement with a previous study that identified and associated a C-terminally truncated form of PTN with mitogenic activities involving stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAPK pathways (24Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In parallel with Akt and MAPK activation studies, the ability of PTN18 and PTN15 to stimulate glioblastoma cell proliferation was also characterized. Similar to the results obtained in pathway activation analyses, varying doses of PTN18 were unable to induce a growth response in any of the cell lines. However, PTN15 was effective in increasing proliferation roughly 2-fold at higher doses in ALK-expressing glioblastoma cells, but not in cells lacking ALK expression (Fig. 3B). To next examine ALK tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PTN 15, U138MG and GM1600 ALK-expressing cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PTN15, and their protein lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ALK antibodies followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3C, a basal level of ALK tyrosine phosphorylation is detectable in control untreated cells; however, ALK tyrosine phosphorylation is markedly increased upon PTN15 treatment. In contrast, PTN18 did not promote tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in these cell lines (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that PTN15 signaling through ALK is specifically responsible for the growth-promoting activities of PTN. PTN18 Promotes Haptotactic Migration of PTPRZ1-expressing Glioblastoma Cells—PTN has been shown to stimulate migration of embryonic neurons in the developing central nervous system as well as glioma cells through the receptor PTPRZ1 (15M"

Impairment of the p53 pathway results in tumor cells with endogenous overexpression of Mdm2 via a naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mdm2 gene at position 309. Here we report that in mdm2 SNP309 cells, inactivation of p53 results in a chromatin-associated Mdm2-p53 complex without clearance of p53 by protein degradation. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein in mdm2 SNP309 cells results after 6 h of camptothecin, etoposide, or mitomycin C treatment, with the p53 protein phosphorylated at Ser15. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated p53 and Mdm2 bound to p53 responsive elements. Interestingly, although the p53 protein was able to bind to DNA, quantitative PCR showed compromised transcription of endogenous target genes. Additionally, exogenously introduced p53 was incapable of activating transcription from p53 responsive elements in SNP309 cells, confirming the trans-acting nature of the inhibitor. Inhibition of Mdm2 by siRNA resulted in transcriptional activation of these p53 targets. Our data suggest that overproduction of Mdm2, resulting from a naturally occurring SNP, inhibits chromatin-bound p53 from activating the transcription of its target genes.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a central role in the prevention of cancer development by causing growth arrest and/or apoptosis during stress (1Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). When the p53 pathway is inhibited, tumorigenesis is accelerated. Often p53 is inhibited by mutations within the DNA binding domain of p53 that lead to loss of the p53 tumor suppressor activity (2Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Additionally, p53 protein function is inhibited when oncoproteins bind to p53. The Mdm2 oncoprotein binds to p53 and inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor activity (4Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Mdm2 protein is part of a negative feedback loop with p53; p53 activates mdm2 transcription, and then the Mdm2 protein inhibits p53 function. The Mdm2 protein functions to inactivate p53 in at least two ways. Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and targets the tumor suppressor for degradation by the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway (5Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 6Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Kung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The p53 protein is maintained at low levels in normally dividing cells in part through its interaction with Mdm2 (7Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3769) Google Scholar). This protein-protein interaction also blocks the p53 trans-activation domain and thereby inhibits p53 transcriptional activity (8Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). In addition, under certain situations the overexpression of Mdm2 results in p53-Mdm2 complexes that fail to bind tightly to DNA (11Zauberman A. Barak Y. Ragimov N. Levy N. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and thus causes subsequent inhibition of p53 activity. Many cancer cells have high levels of the oncogenic Mdm2 protein because of either increased expression (12Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss 3rd, J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar) or amplification of the mdm2 gene (13Momand J. Jung D. Wilczynski S. Niland J.

Cell. 2004; 119: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In cells homozygous for SNP309 the p53 pathway is compromised. In an effort to closely examine the compromised signaling from p53 in cells homozygous for mdm2 SNP309, DNA damage was used to activate the checkpoint pathway and p53 functional activities were monitored. In doing so we found that p53 in cell lines homozygous for SNP309 could be significantly stabilized after 6 h of DNA damage treatment with different drugs. This p53 remained associated with the cellular Mdm2 protein in the nucleus and was not sequestered to the nucleolus. Importantly, this p53 bound to chromatin in conjunction with Mdm2 and was unable to activate transcription of downstream target genes. As discussed herein, we addressed the inhibitory actions of Mdm2 by showing that a DNA-bound form of p53 is blocked for trans-activation activity in the presence of high levels of Mdm2. Reagents—Camptothecin (CPT), propidium iodide, calpain inhibitor, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al (LLnL/ALLN), etoposide (ETOP), and anti-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. provided mitomycin C (MC). TRIzol was purchased from Invitrogen. The p53 phosphospecific antibody Ser15 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The monoclonal PARP antibody was purchased from PharMingen. The p53 antibodies 240, 1801, 421, and the Mdm2 antibody 2A10 were from monoclonal supernatants as described previously (15Chen J.

The p53 antibody 6 (Ab6) was purchased from Calbiochem, and the p53 polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Mdm2 antibodies SMP14 and D7 are also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p53 cDNA Sequencing—RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 5 μg of RNA were then incubated with 250 pmol of oligo(dT) primers for 10 min at 65 °C, and then subjected to a reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction. The RT reaction contained AMV, 5× buffer, DTT, dNTP (25 mm), and RNase inhibitor. 2 μl of cDNA were then used for PCR reactions. The PCR program carried out was as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, continuing for 30 cycles. PCR products were then run on a 1% agarose gel and excised using a scalpel. Excised products were purified using the Qiagen QiaQuick gel purification protocol per the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used for sequencing of the complete p53 gene: primer set 1: 5′-GGAATTCCACACCCCCGCCCG-3′,5′-GGAATTCATGCCGCCCATGCA-3′, primer set 2: 5′-GAATTCTGACTGTACCACCATCC-3′, 5′-GAATTCTCCATCCAGTGGTTTC-3′, primer set 3: 5′-GAATTCCACGACGTGACACG-3′, 5′-GAATCGTGTAGAGCTGCTCG-3′, primer set 4: 5′-GAATTCCCAACAACACCAGCTCC-3′, 5′-GAATTCAAAATGCAGGAG-3′ (16Baker S.J.

Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Paraskeva C. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Hamilton S. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7717-7722PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing was done at the Rockefeller Protein and DNA Technology Center.

A875 cells were a generous gift from the Levine laboratory. H1299 cells were a generous gift from C. Prives laboratory. All cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini), RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech) and 5% CO2. The medium was supplemented with 100 μg of penicillin per ml and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml. Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105, and exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. DNA-damaging Agents—DNA-damaging agents and the proteasome inhibitor LLnL were added to the medium of exponentially growing cell cultures. The cells were treated at a concentration of 5 × 105 to 6 × 105 cells per ml. The following concentrations were used throughout the study: CPT, 0.5 μm; ETOP, 8 μm; MC, 5 μm; and LLnL, 20 μm. Flow Cytometry—FACS analysis was carried out on a BD Biosciences FACS scan. Cells were spun down at 2000 rpm for 7 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3. Cells were then fixed in 30% ethanol. Propidium iodide staining and RNase treatment were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min prior to analysis. Nuclear Extracts—Cells were pelleted at 2000 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C and washed 2× with ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.3). Cells were then washed 1× in 5 packed cell volumes with Buffer A (Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm; MgCl2, 1.5 mm; KCl, 10 mm; PMSF, 0.5 mm; DTT, 0.5 mm; leupeptin, 2 μg/ml; and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma)). After washing, cells were resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of Buffer A and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation (10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C) the supernatant was removed to give the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was then resuspended in Buffer C (Hepes pH 7.9 20 mm; glycerol, 25%; NaCl, 420 mm; MgCl2, 1.5 mm; EDTA, 0.2 mm; PMSF, 0.5 mm; DTT, 0.5 mm; leupeptin, 2 μg/ml; and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I. Cells were resuspended with a 20-gauge needle to a concentration of 40 million cells/120 μl. The cell suspension was rocked for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was the nuclear fraction, which was stored at –80 °C. Western Blotting Analysis—Nuclear extracts, whole cell extracts, or immunoprecipitated samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following p53 antibodies were used: 421, 1801, and 240 (supernatant antibodies), Ser15, and the p53 polyclonal antibody. The following Mdm2 antibodies were used: 2A10 (supernatant antibody), SMP14, and D7. For p21/Waf1 detection, we used Ab-1 from Oncogene Research Science. For PARP cleavage we used anti-mouse monoclonal antibody from PharMingen. For nucleolin detection we used the antibody MS-3 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For actin detection we used a rabbit polyclonal purchased from Sigma. The signals were visualized after incubation with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) using ECL solutions. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated onto glass coverslips using poly-l-lysine (Sigma), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and then permeabilized with Triton X-100 1% for 5 min at –20 °C. After washing three times with PBS-FBS, 1%, fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mouse anti-human p53 Ab6 from Calbiochem (ML-1 cells) or rabbit anti-human polyclonal p53 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (MANCA and A875 cells) 1:200 dilution in PBS-FBS, 1%. Cells were washed three times with PBS-FBS, 1% and then incubated for 30 min with secondary Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:400 dilution in PBS-FBS, 1%. Coverslips were then mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories) and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Quantitative RT-PCR—For each sample, 5 μg of RNA were obtained using the Qiagen RNeasy kit, per the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was then diluted up to 50 μl with water. The samples were then incubated with reagents from the cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems). The mixture contained RT buffer, dNTP mix, random primers, and multiscribe RT. The 2× RT Master Mix, along with the cDNA, was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 2 h. cDNA was stored at –20 °C. For PCR, the program was as follows: one cycle of 50 °C UNG incubation for 2 min, and one cycle of 95 °C priming for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C denaturation for 15 s and 60 °C annealing for 1 min. This reaction was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 5700 Prism Spectrofluorometric Thermal Cycler. Fluorescence was measured during the annealing step and plotted automatically for each sample.

The total amount of DNA transfected into each sample was normalized with a carrier plasmid, pGL2. The transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were harvested and analyzed using the Luciferase Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's indications. Luciferase activity was read using a Luminoskan reader, and the results were normalized to total protein values. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 30 min then quenched with glycine to 125 mm. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected into 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The cell pellet was resuspended (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, washed (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF) and resuspended in the same buffer without NaCl. Samples were sonicated (10×, 10 s each), centrifuged, and 0.10 volume of 10× precipitation buffer (10% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1.4 m NaCl) was added to the supernatants. One-fifth of each sample was saved and designated as “Input.” Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight with 2 μg of Mdm2-specific antibody (SMP14), 2 μg of p53-specific antibody Ab6, or 1:200 dilution of p53-Ser15 phosphospecific antibody. The next day protein A plus G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for 2 h with rocking at 4 °C. The subsequent washes were as described (19Burakov D. Crofts L.A. Chang C.P.

The washed resin was resuspended in 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and reverse cross-linked at 65 °C overnight. DNA fragments were purified (QiaQuick spin kit) and PCR-amplified using primers designed to amplify the p53 binding sites in the mdm2 gene (forward primer: 5′-CGGGAGTTCAGGGTAAAGGT-3′, reverse primer: 5′-AGCAAGTCGGTGCTTACCTG-3′) or p21/waf1 gene (forward primer: 5′-GTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTTCTG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-CTGAAAACAGGCAGCCCAAG-3′). [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the PCR reaction. Amplified products were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried for 1 h at 55 °C, and autoradiography was performed. Quantitative PCR using ChIP samples was carried out on a PE5700 PCR machine using a TaqMan Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCR cycles were: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, then cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min repeated 40 times. The fold change in the specific binding was normalized to GAPDH and Mock IP values. The probe and primer sequences are given below. Primers are in italics, TaqMan probe is in bold, and the p53 binding site is underlined: p21/waf1:GTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTTCTGGCCATCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAGCTCTGGCATAGAAGAGGCTGGTGGCTATTTTGTCCTTGGGCTGCCTGTTTTCAG. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Custom oligonucleotides for DNA binding analysis were ordered from Operon Technologies and for SCS and RGC mutant as described (20Molina M.P. Cain C. Bargonetti J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 151-170PubMed Google Scholar). The superconsensus site (SCS) contained three adjacent p53 half sites. The sequence of the oligonucleotide was: Top, 5′-TCGAGCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTC-3′; and Bottom, 5′-TCGAGACATGCCCGGACATGCCCGGACATGCCCGGC-3′. Labeling of the oligo was performed using the large fragment of DNA polymerase and [32P]dCTP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out in reaction mixtures with 150 pmol of 32P oligonucleotide. 10 μg of nuclear extract was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. In the case of competition, unlabeled competitor in 50–100× fold-excess was added into the incubation. mdm2, fas, and a mutant oligo were used for competition studies. The sequences of the oligos were as follows: mdm2: Top, 5′-CCGGGCTGGTCAAGTTCAGACACGTTCCGAAACTGCAGTAAAAGGAGTTAAGTCCTGACTTGTCTCCC-3′; and Bottom, 5′-CCGGGGGAGACAAGTCAGGACTTAACTCCTTTTACTGCAGTTTCGGAACGTGTCTGAACTTGACCAGC-3′; fas: Top, 5′-CCGGGCTCCTGGACAAGCCCTGACAAGCCAAGCCAC-3′, and Bottom, 5′-CCGGGTGGCTTGGCTTGTCAGGGCTTGTCCAGGAGC-3′; mutant: Top, 5′-TCGAGTTTAATGGACTTTAATGGCCTTTAATTTTC-3′, and Bottom: 5′-TCGAGAAAATTAAAGGCCATTAAAGTCCATTAAAC-3′. Reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of 421 antibody as indicated. Samples were separated by 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (gels were prerun at 100 V for 15 min at 4 °C) at 200 V for 3–3.5 h. Gels were dried for 1 h at 55 °C and autoradiography was performed. Immunoprecipitations—Reactions were carried out using 250 μg of nuclear extracts. Nuclear protein was incubated with Buffer C (Hepes pH 7.9, 20 mm; glycerol, 25%; NaCl, 420 mm; MgCl2, 1.5 mm; EDTA, 0.2 mm; PMSF, 0.5 mm; DTT, 0.5 mm; leupeptin, 2 μg/ml; aprotinin; and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I), and 2 μg of purified antibodies overnight at 4 °C while rocking. The next day protein A plus G-Sepharose beads were added for 2 h with rocking at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times in BC buffer (Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.9; glycerol, 10%; PMSF, 0.5 mm; KCl, 400 mm; leupeptin, 2 μg/ml; aprotinin, and Nonidet P-40 0.05%). 6× protein sample buffer was then added, and the samples were boiled and loaded onto a 10% gel to be separated by electrophoresis as previously described. siRNA—Mdm2 expression was lowered using mdm2 siRNA (Darmacon, SmartPool- a mixture of 4 different mdm2 siRNA, catalog M-003279-02). 200-pmol siRNA was transfected into cells at 70–80% confluency using oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control siRNA (Darmacon, SmartPool, catalog D-001206-13-05) has no known target in mammalian genomes. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and protein levels of Mdm2, p53, p21/Waf1, and actin were analyzed. Total RNA was also extracted from transfected cells using the RNeasy kit, per the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed by quantitative PCR as described above. Cells were also retransfected with 2 μg of the reporter constructs mentioned above 24 h after siRNA transfection and grown for an additional 24 h. Lysates were prepared for luciferase analysis as described previously. Endogenous Overexpression of Mdm2 via a Naturally Occurring SNP Inhibits Apoptosis following Chemotherapeutic Drug Treatment—We previously documented induced p53 stabilization and subsequent apoptosis in ML-1 cells treated for 6 h with CPT, ETOP, or MC, and no apoptosis induction in the p53-deficient human cell line K562 treated with the same drugs (21Abbas T.

A naturally occurring SNP at position 309 in the promoter 2 region of the mdm2 gene (Fig. 1A) results in overexpression of Mdm2 protein, and inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis occurs in homozygous mdm2 SNP309-containing cell lines MANCA and A875 (14Bond G.L.

Cell. 2004; 119: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Both cell lines overexpress Mdm2 at the protein and RNA levels, which results in the attenuation of p53 stabilization in the first 3 h after ETOP treatment (14Bond G.L. Hu W. Bond E.E. Robins H. Lutzker S.G. Arva N.C. Bargonetti J. Bartel F. Taubert H. Wuerl P. Onel K. Yip L. Hwang S.J. Strong L.C. Lozano G. Levine A.J. Cell. 2004; 119: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). To closely examine the compromised molecular signaling, we compared p53 and Mdm2 protein levels in ML-1, MANCA, and A875 cell lines after 6 h of drug treatment with expression of the proteins in the documented wild-type p53-expressing cell line ML-1 (which is homozygous wild-type for mdm2) (14Bond G.L. Hu W. Bond E.E. Robins H. Lutzker S.G. Arva N.C. Bargonetti J. Bartel F. Taubert H. Wuerl P. Onel K. Yip L. Hwang S.J. Strong L.C. Lozano G. Levine A.J.

Cells were treated with chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging drugs or were left untreated, and extracts were analyzed by Western blot for p53 and Mdm2 proteins (Fig. 1B). The drugs CPT, ETOP, and MC increased the level of p53 in ML-1 cells as well as in MANCA and A875 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–12), whereas no p53 was expressed in the p53-negative control cell line K562 (Fig. 1B, lanes 13–16). We reproducibly noted that the level of p53 protein in MANCA cells before drug treatment was high relative to other cell lines examined, and we do not have an explanation for this increased basal p53 in MANCA cells at this time. The p53 in MANCA and A875 is wild-type (14Bond G.L. Hu W. Bond E.E. Robins H. Lutzker S.G. Arva N.C. Bargonetti J. Bartel F. Taubert H. Wuerl P. Onel K. Yip L. Hwang S.J. Strong L.C. Lozano G.

Western blot analysis demonstrated PARP cleavage in ML-1 cells after 6 h of CPT and ETOP treatment and slight cleavage of PARP after 6 h of MC treatment but no PARP cleavage was detected in the other cell lines when they were treated with the drugs (Fig. 2A). FACS analysis demonstrated an increased sub-G1 population (indicated by the M1 gate) up to 55% only in the ML-1 cells treated with drugs and not in any of the other drug-treated cell lines (Fig. 2, B and C). p53 Protein Is Phosphorylated at Ser15 in Cells with mdm2 SNP309—The signal transduction pathway toward p53 involves a critical phosphorylation event at Ser15, which helps not only to stabilize the p53 but also to activate the transcriptional activity of the protein (22Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To examine kinase signaling to the p53 protein in the cell lines examined, Western blot analysis with antibody specifically recognizing Ser15-phosphorylated p53 was carried out. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in the MANCA and A875 cells was reproducibly detected (Fig. 3A). We examined the ability of the p53 protein to be phosphorylated in MANCA and A875 cells after 6 h of chemotherapeutic treatment because we knew p53 activation in ML-1 cells occurred at this time point (21Abbas T.

Interestingly, we observed significant p53 phosphorylation in cell lines homozygous for the mdm2 SNP309 after CPT, ETOP, and MC treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–12). In response to drug treatments the level of p53 phosphorylation in the ML-1 cell line increased as previously described (21Abbas T. Olivier M. Lopez J. Houser S. Xiao G. Kumar G.S. Tomasz M. Bargonetti J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40513-40519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and MANCA and A875 cells demonstrated p53 phosphorylation greater than ML-1 cells (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1–4 to lanes 5–12). The p53 stabilization was not greater in MANCA and A875 cells, as shown in Fig. 1. p53 localized to the nucleus in both wild-type and SNP309 homozygous cells, as seen in immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 4). Additionally, immunofluorescence studies indicated that the nuclear p53 levels increased following drug treatment of ML-1, MANCA, and A875 cells (Fig. 4). The p53 Protein Is Compromised for Activating Downstream Target Genes in MANCA or A875 Cells—The p53 protein induces the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21/Waf1 (23el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). As one indicator of checkpoint activation after DNA damage, we examined the levels of p21/Waf1 protein. As expected, treatment of the ML-1 cells with CPT, ETOP, and MC resulted in an increase in p21/Waf1 protein, whereas in K562 cells the absence of p53 resulted in no p21/Waf1 increase (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4 and lanes 13–16). p2"

NPC1 contains a pentahelical region that is evolutionarily related to sterol-sensing domains found in other polytopic proteins involved in sterol interactions or sterol metabolism, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. To gain insight into the role of the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1, we examined the effect of point mutations in the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain on the trafficking of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and sphingolipids. We show that an NPC1 P692S loss of function mutation results in decreased cholesterol delivery to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. By contrast, NPC1 proteins carrying a L657F or D787N point mutation, which correspond to the activating SCAP L315F and D443N mutations, respectively, exhibit a gain of function phenotype. Specifically, cell lines expressing the NPC1 L657F or D787N mutations show a nearly 2-fold increase in the rates of low density lipoprotein cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane and to the endoplasmic reticulum, and more rapid suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-dependent gene expression. Trafficking of sphingolipids is intact in the D787N and L657F cell lines. Our finding that D787N and L657F are activating NPC1 mutations provide evidence for a conserved mechanism for the sterol-sensing domain among cholesterol homeostatic proteins.

Cholesterol overload delays retroendocytic clearance of fluid-phase markers and alters the rate of cholesterol movement along this pathway (6.Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M.

Whereas the mechanism by which cholesterol regulates NPC1 function is not known, recent studies of homologous proteins (HMG-CoA reductase, SCAP, and Patched) indicate that the sterol-sensing domain is involved in regulating sterol-dependent protein-protein interactions. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, and SCAP regulates the activity of the SREBP transcription factors. In both HMG-CoA reductase and SCAP, the sterol-sensing domains modulate sterol-dependent interactions with the resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, Insig-1 and Insig-2 (16.Sever N.

Sterol-stimulated binding of the Insig proteins to HMG-CoA reductase results in its ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation. Similarly, Insig proteins bind to SCAP in the presence of cholesterol, leading to retention of SCAP-SREBP complexes in the ER, thereby preventing proteolytic processing of SREBPs and expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis (17.Yabe D.

The role of the sterol-sensing domain of Patched, a morphogen that binds members of the hedgehog family of signaling proteins and regulates the activity of the Smoothened seven-pass membrane protein, has not been fully elucidated, but recent studies suggest that it may function to regulate the vesicular trafficking of Patched between the PM and endosomes (19.Martin V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).The role of the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1 in intracellular cholesterol trafficking is not yet understood. Expression of the P691S point mutant in human NPC1 (P692S in the murine ortholog) results in an NPC1 protein that is properly targeted to the late endosome, but fails to correct the sterol trafficking defect (23.Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Watari M. Neufeld E.B. Patel S. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21861-21866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24.Ko D.C. Gordon M.D. Jin J.Y. Scott M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The P692S loss of function mutant also exhibits severely reduced labeling with a photoactivatable cholesterol (25.Ohgami N. Ko D.C. Thomas M. Scott M.P. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 101: 12473-12478Google Scholar). These findings indicate that an intact sterol-sensing domain is required for cholesterol binding and NPC1 protein function. In the present study, we examined the effects of point mutations in the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain on the trafficking of LDL-derived cholesterol and sphingolipids. We provide evidence that NPC1 proteins carrying point mutations corresponding to the activating SCAP L315F and D443N mutations are fully functional, and exhibit increased rates of LDL cholesterol trafficking to the PM and ER. These data demonstrate the functional importance of the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain in regulation of LDL cholesterol trafficking in mammalian cells, and are consistent with the hypothesis that this domain of NPC1 functions in a manner analogous to the homologous domains in SCAP and HMG-CoA reductase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The JL-8 GFP antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences.

A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) containing a NotI site in its multiple cloning site was used as a backbone for the ΔU3mNPC1-WT-CFP, ΔU3mNPC1-P692S-CFP, and ΔU3mNPC1-Y635C-CFP constructs. The NotI/BglII fragment (5.2 kB) was isolated from this construct and ligated to a BglII/KasI fragment (880 bp) from ΔU3mNPC1 and a KasI/NotI fragment (4 kB) from either pECFP-N3-mNPC1-6xHis WT or pECFP-N3-mNPC1-6xHis P692S (kindly provided by M.

M12 cells are mutant CHO-K1 cells that contain a deletion of the NPC1 locus, and CHO/NPC1 cells are CHO-K1 cells that overexpress human NPC1 (10.Millard E.E. Srivastava K. Traub L. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38445-38451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To generate the M12/NPC1-CFP and CHO/NPC1-CFP cell lines, CHO-K1 and M12 cells were infected with retrovirus prepared by transient transfection of 293GPG packaging cells with the ΔU3mNPC1-CFP constructs as previously described (26.Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). To isolate clonal cell lines, the retrovirally infected M12 cells were plated at limiting dilution and colonies were subjected to two rounds of screening. Colonies were first screened by filipin staining (described under “Fluorescence Microscopy”) and by cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fluorescence. Colonies were also screened for expression of mNPC1 by Western blotting of TNET lysates using an antibody that recognizes CFP (described under “Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis”). Colonies with similar expression levels of the wild type (WT), P692S, D787N, and L657F constructs were selected for further analysis.Cell Culture—Cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All CHO-derived cell lines were maintained in medium A (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Medium B consists of medium A in which fetal calf serum has been replaced with 5% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum. 293GPG cells were cultured as described previously (26.Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar).Preparation of Reconstituted LDL—LDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate (CL) ([3H]CL-LDL) was prepared with a specific activity of 34,000 cpm/nmol of total cholesteryl linoleate as described (27.Krieger M. Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4093-4101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Detergent lysates were prepared by washing cell monolayers twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then scraped in 400 μl of TNET+ (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml ALLN, 2.4 μg/ml Pefabloc) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Proteins in these TNET lysates were quantified using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Non-boiled samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.45 mm; Schleicher & Schuell) with a semi-dry electroblotter (Owl Scientific). Western blot analysis of CFP expression was performed using an affinity purified mouse monoclonal antibody raised against full-length GFP (BD Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:1000 and a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG at 0.04 μg/ml. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence using Renaissance reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Fluorescence Microscopy—On day 0, cells were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/well on 22-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm wells in medium A. On day 1, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and stained (and permeabilized) with 50 μg/ml filipin in PBS, 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, mounted (SlowFade, Molecular Probes), and examined by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert epifluorescence microscope. The following filter sets (Chroma) were used: for filipin, excitation filter 360/40 nm, emission filter 460/50; for CFP, excitation filter 436/20, emission filter 480/40.LDL-stimulated Cholesterol Esterification Assay—Cholesterol esterification assays were performed as described previously (28.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). On day 0, cells were seeded in triplicate (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 1, cells were washed twice with PBS and refed medium B. On day 2, cells were refed medium B containing 0-50 μg/ml LDL for 16 h, and then pulsed with [3H]oleate for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C and lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2). A chromatography recovery standard was added (30 μg of cholesteryl oleate, 0.0005 μCi of [14C]cholesteryl oleate), and the samples were dried under nitrogen. The lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on PE SIL G plates (Whatman), using heptane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90:30:1) as the solvent. Lipids were visualized using iodine. [3H]Cholesteryl oleate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in Ecoscint (National Diagnostics). After lipid extraction, protein was extracted from monolayers by incubation with 0.1 n NaOH, and protein was quantified using the MicroBCA assay (Pierce). Esterification values were normalized for total protein.25-HC-stimulated Cholesterol Esterification Assay—On day 0, cells were seeded in triplicate (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 1, cells were washed twice with PBS and refed medium B. On day 2, cells were refed medium B in the presence or absence 1 μg/ml 25-HC for 16 h, and then pulsed with [3H]oleate for 2 h. Lipids were extracted and [3H]cholesteryl oleate was quantified as described above.LDL Receptor Activity Assay—LDL receptor activity was determined as described previously (14.Frolov A.

On day 0, cells were plated at 7 × 104 cells/35-mm well in medium A. On day 1, cells were refed medium B. On day 2, cells were incubated with DiI-LDL (6 μg/ml) for 1 h and the mean fluoresence of 10,000 cells was measured by flow cytometetry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences).Cholesterol Efflux Assay—Efflux studies were performed as previously described (29.Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Du H. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27180-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. On day 0, cells were plated in triplicate (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 1, the cells were washed three times with PBS and refed medium B. On day 3, cells were refed medium B containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were subsequently refed medium B containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0-40 μg/ml [3H]CL-LDL and incubated at 16-18 °C for 4 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, refed medium B, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by a 10-min incubation with medium B containing 4% CD at 37 °C. Media was collected, cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C, and cells were extracted with 0.1 n NaOH. A recovery standard (0.0005 μCi of [14C]cholesteryl oleate, 80 μg of cholesterol, 30 μg of cholesteryl oleate) was added to media samples and lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1). Media extracts were dried under N2 and [3H]cholesterol was quantified by TLC and scintillation counting. Because there were no differences in the rate of [3H]CL hydrolysis among the cell lines studied (not shown), total 3H label in the cells was quantified by scintillation counting of NaOH cell extracts. Fractional efflux was calculated as the amount of [3H]cholesterol in the media divided by the amount of [3H]cholesterol in the media plus total 3H label in the cells.Plasma Membrane Cholesterol Measurements—On day 0, cells were plated in triplicate at 5 × 104 cells/35-mm well in medium A. On day 1, cells were washed three times with PBS and fed 1 ml of medium B containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol. Cells were labeled to equilibrium for 48 h. On day 3, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with medium B containing 4% CD for 10 min. Media was collected, cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and proteins were extracted with 0.1 n NaOH. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. [3H]Cholesterol extracted by the CD was quantified by scintillation counting of media. PM cholesterol values were normalized to total protein values.Quantification of HMG-CoA Synthase Gene Expression—On day 0, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) in medium A. On day 1, cells were washed twice with PBS and refed medium B. On day 3, cells were refed medium in the presence or absence of 40 μg/ml LDL. After 4 h cells were harvested, total RNA isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcribed to cDNA using SuperScriptII RNase H- reverse transcriptase and random heximer primers (Invitrogen). cDNA was then amplified for 40 PCR cycles using SYBR Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems) and template-specific primers (50 nm) in an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detector. Primer sequences for hamster HMG-CoA synthase (forward, 5′-CCTGGGTCACTTCCTTTGAATG-3′; reverse 5′-GATCTCAAGGGCAACGATTCC-3′) and β-actin (forward, 5′-GGCTCCCAGCACCATGAA-3′; reverse 5′-GCCACCGATCCACACAGAGT-3′) were kindly provided by David Russell (University of Texas, Southwestern). Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold (CT) method as described by the manufacturer. Changes in mRNA expression level were calculated following normalization to β-actin expression.Intracellular Trafficking of BODIPY LacCer—Sphingolipid trafficking assays were performed as described previously (30.Sun X. Marks D.L. Park W.D. Wheatley C.L. Puri V. O'Brien J.F. Kraft D.L. Lundquist P.A. Patterson M.C. Pagano R.E. Snow K. Am. J. Hum.

On day 1, cells were washed three times with DMEM, and pulsed for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with 5 μm BODIPY LacCer, 1% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. Cells were washed three times with 1% fetal bovine serum in DMEM, followed by a 60-min chase in 1% fetal bovine serum in DMEM at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were then washed twice with DMEM containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and BODIPY was back-exchanged from the cell surface by six successive 10-min incubations at 10 °C in 5% fatty acid free BSA and 15 mm HEPES in DMEM. Following back exchange, cells were fixed as described under “Fluorescence Microscopy.” Cells were permeabilized and blocked wi"

Here we show that the murine leukemia virus Gag has the unique ability to interact with all three factors. Small interfering RNAs against Tsg101 or Alix and dominant-negative forms of Nedd4 can all reduce production of virus-like particles. However, inactivating the Nedd4-binding site abolishes budding, whereas disrupting Tsg101 or Alix binding has milder effects. Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases are therefore essential, and Tsg101 and Alix play auxiliary roles. Most interestingly, overexpression of Alix can stimulate the release of Gag, and this occurs independently of most Alix partners Tsg101, Cin85, Alg-2, and endophilins. In addition, Gag mutants that do not bind Tsg101 or Alix concentrate on late endosomes and become very sensitive to dominant-negative forms of Nedd4 that do not conjugate ubiquitin. This suggests that the direct interaction of Gag with Tsg101 and Alix favors budding from the plasma membrane and relieves a requirement for ubiquitination by Nedd4.1. Other Nedd4-dependent Gag proteins also contain binding sites for Tsg101 or Alix, suggesting that this could be a common feature of retroviruses.

In the last years, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying retroviral budding has made enormous progress. It is now well appreciated that Gag proteins of many retroviruses hijack the budding machinery of multivesicular bodies (MVB), 1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; VLPs, virus-like particles; MA, matrix; MLV, murine leukemia virus; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; HTLV, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus; MPMV, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. 1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; VLPs, virus-like particles; MA, matrix; MLV, murine leukemia virus; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; HTLV, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus; MPMV, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.allowing the nascent viral particle to divert this machinery for its own use (1Garrus J. von Schwedler U.

Indeed, in the cell, MVB have the unique ability to generate intra-luminal vesicles, and this occurs with a topology identical to that of retroviral budding. Sorting of cellular proteins toward internal MVB vesicles (referred to as the MVB pathway), often requires their mono- or di-ubiquitination, and the ubiquitin moiety often constitutes an essential routing signal (9Katzmann D.

In yeast, the sorting and budding machinery of MVB is composed of more than 15 proteins that can be biochemically separated into three complexes, termed ESCRT-I, -II, and -III (9Katzmann D. Babst M. Emr S. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 11Babst M. Katzmann D. Snyder W. Wendland B. Emr S. Dev.

ESCRT-I and -II are believed to be involved in the recognition and sorting of ubiquitinated proteins and in the recruitment of ESCRT-III, which likely represents the core machinery effecting the budding and membrane fission events required for vesicle formation. In addition to these well defined complexes, several proteins that are essential for this machinery occur separately or are loosely associated with these complexes. This is the case for the yeast protein Bro1, which interacts with ESCRT-III (16Odorizzi G. Katzmann D. Babst M. Audhya A. Emr S. J.

The first are the ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family, which are involved in the ubiquitination of membrane-associated proteins to initiate their sorting toward internal MVB vesicles (10Raiborg C.

In agreement, a number of Gag proteins become mono- or di-ubiquitinated during the budding process (35Ott D. Coren L. Copeland T. Kane B. Johnson D. Sowder R.N. Yoshinaka Y. Oroszlan S. Arthur L.

The second protein is Tsg101, an essential component of ESCRT-I that has been shown to bind the Gag proteins of HIV-1, HIV-2, MPMV, and HTLV-I (1Garrus J. von Schwedler U. Pornillos O. Morham S.

In these cases, binding occurs through P(T/S)AP motifs present in Gag, which mimic the natural interaction of Tsg101 with its cellular partners (38Pornillos O. Higginson D. Stray K. Fisher R. Garrus J. Payne M. He G. Wang H. Morham S. Sundquist W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Tsg101 also binds ubiquitin through a UEV domain, and ubiquitination of Gag increases its affinity for Tsg101 (1Garrus J. von Schwedler U. Pornillos O. Morham S. Zavitz K. Wang H. Wettstein D.

Finally, and more recently, Alix has also been shown to be involved directly in HIV-1 and EIAV budding (3von Schwedler U. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D. Chung H. Morita E. Wang H. Davis T. He G.

Emr S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1893-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In mammals, it has been shown to interact with both Tsg101 and CHMP4, a core component of ESCRT-III (3von Schwedler U. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D. Chung H. Morita E. Wang H. Davis T. He G.

Gag proteins can also recruit cellular factors involved in endosomal function but not directly linked to the MVB pathway. For instance, MLV Gag has been shown to interact with endophilins (39Wang M. Kim W. Gao G. Torrey T. Morse H.I. De Camilli P. Goff S. J. Biol. 2003; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Gag also interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein complex 3 (40Dong X. Li H. Derdowski A. Ding L. Burnett A. Chen X. Peters T. Dermody T. Woodruff E. Wang J. Spearman P. Cell. 2005; 120: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and this has been shown to control its intracellular routing. It is not clear why the viral Gag proteins have selected Nedd4, Tsg101, and Alix among all other proteins of the MVB pathway. Even more puzzling, viral Gag proteins often contain several interacting motifs, and in different viruses, their respective importance can vary. For instance, HIV-1 Gag binds Tsg101 and Alix, but Tsg101 is essential, whereas Alix plays only an auxiliary role (1Garrus J. von Schwedler U. Pornillos O. Morham S. Zavitz K. Wang H. Wettstein D.

Cell. 2003; 114: 686-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 29Martin-Serrano J. Yarovoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9474-9485Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this work, we have analyzed the budding partners of MLV Gag, and we have found that, most surprisingly, it interacts with Nedd4, Tsg101, and Alix. This is the first Gag protein shown to interact with all three factors, and it gave us a unique opportunity to analyze their respective role in budding. Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and Two-hybrid Assays—Moloney MLV Gag was cloned in the donor vector of the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen), and mutagenesis was performed on this plasmid with the quickstrand mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). RSV Gag (a gift of Dr. J. L. Darlix, GenBank™ accession number M37980) was also cloned in the Gateway system. Wild-type and mutant Gag cDNAs were then cloned into two-hybrid plasmids (pACT-II and pAS2ΔΔ) and into mammalian expression vectors with and without C-terminal YFP tags. Mouse Alix was also cloned into pACT-II, and two-hybrid vectors for human Tsg101 and rat Nedd4 were gifts from Dr. W. Sundquist and Dr. D. Rotin, respectively (1Garrus J. von Schwedler U.

For the Cter-PSAP mutant, the sequence GGLPPSAPSLP was introduced in-frame at the C terminus of the MLV Gag triple mutant that binds neither Tsg101, Alix, nor Nedd4. Mouse Alix had a FLAG tag (44Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29108-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). AlixΔPGY was deleted for amino acids 802–813; Alix ΔTsg101 was deleted for amino acids 717–720; AlixΔCin85 was deleted for amino acids 739–745; and AlixΔPP14 was deleted for amino acids 748–761. Wild-type Nedd4.2, as well as wild-type and mutant Nedd4.1, were gifts of O. Staub (21Blot V. Perugi F. Gay B. Prevost M. Briant L. Tangy F. Abriel H. Staub O. Dokhelar M. Pique C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2357-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative form of Nedd4.1 was the full-length protein with cysteine 867 replaced by serine (21Blot V. Perugi F. Gay B. Prevost M. Briant L. Tangy F. Abriel H. Staub O. Dokhelar M. Pique C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2357-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Wild-type Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 were re-cloned at the C terminus of YFP. GST-Gag, GST-MAp12, and GST-Alix were generated by cloning corresponding cDNAs at the C terminus of GST, in the pDest27 plasmid (Invitrogen). CFP-TiVamp was cloned with the Gateway technology and was expressed under the control of mouse ribosomal L30 promoter. For the two-hybrid assays, plasmids were introduced into the appropriate haploid strains (CG929 or YL455), which were then crossed. Diploids were plated on double or triple selectable media (minus Leu, Trp, or minus Leu, Trp, His), and growth was assessed 3 days later. Analyses of Virus-like Particles (VLPs), Formation and Release— 293T cells cultured in standard conditions were transfected with the calcium-phosphate procedure (10 μg of plasmids for a 60-mm plate), as described previously (45Basyuk E. Galli T. Mougel M. Blanchard J. Sitbon M. Bertrand E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After 15 h, cell culture supernatants were collected and replaced by fresh media. After an additional 24 h, supernatants were collected, and cells were resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Supernatants were filtered on 0.45-μm membranes, and VLPs were then centrifuged for 2 h at 20,000 × g. VLP production was determined by Western blotting with an anti-capsid monoclonal antibody (45Basyuk E. Galli T. Mougel M. Blanchard J. Sitbon M. Bertrand E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Western blots were revealed by ECL and quantified either by densitometry scanning of the films or by the direct measurement of light with a CCD camera (GeneGnome, Ozyme). When the signals were too different to be quantified on the same membrane, dilutions of the strongest sample were prepared and reloaded with the other samples on a single gel. The signals of these samples were then compared with the dilution series. Gag signals were first quantified in cellular extracts, and normalized amounts of both cellular and VLPs extracts were then reloaded on novel Western blots and re-quantified as above.

Mass spectrometric analyses demonstrated that purified iPLA2γ hydrolyzed saturated or monounsaturated aliphatic groups readily from either the sn-1 or sn-2 positions of phospholipids. In addition, purified iPLA2γ effectively liberated arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of plasmenylcholine substrates. In contrast, incubation of iPLA2γ with 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine resulted in the rapid release of palmitic acid and the selective accumulation of 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which was not metabolized further by iPLA2γ. The putative regiospecificity of the 2-arachidonoyl LPC product was authenticated by its diagnostic fragmentation pattern during tandem mass spectrometric analysis. To identify the physiological relevance of iPLA2γ-mediated 2-arachidonoyl LPC production utilizing naturally occurring membranes, we incubated purified rat hepatic peroxisomes with iPLA2γ and similarly identified the selective accumulation of 2-arachidonoyl LPC. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that 2-arachidonoyl LPC is a natural product in human myocardium, a tissue in which iPLA2γ expression is robust. Because 2-arachidonoyl LPC represents a key branch point intermediate that can potentially lead to a variety of bioactive molecules in eicosanoid signaling (e.g. arachidonic acid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol), these results have uncovered a novel eicosanoid selective pathway through iPLA2γ-mediated 2-arachidonoyl LPC production to amplify and diversify the repertoire of biologic lipid second messengers in response to cellular stimulation. Herein, we report the heterologous expression of the human peroxisomal 63-kDa calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ) isoform in Sf9 cells, purification of the N-terminal His-tagged enzyme by affinity chromatography, and the identification of its remarkable substrate selectivity that results in the highly selective generation of 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine. Mass spectrometric analyses demonstrated that purified iPLA2γ hydrolyzed saturated or monounsaturated aliphatic groups readily from either the sn-1 or sn-2 positions of phospholipids.

Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 2Kudo I. Murakami M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 3-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Previously, a novel human calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (GenBank™ accession no. AF263613), termed iPLA2γ (also known as group VIB phospholipase A2), has been cloned from the human genome and expressed in Sf9 cells (3Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Tanaka H. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to its dual signature lipase and nucleotide binding motifs that define the iPLA2 subfamily of enzymes, the iPLA2γ polypeptide also contains a C-terminal peroxisomal tripeptide localization sequence (-SKL). The first identification of the iPLA2γ protein from non-recombinant tissues demonstrated that it was present in the peroxisomal fraction of rat liver predominantly as a 63-kDa polypeptide (5Yang J. Han X. Gross R.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Direct mass spectrometric analysis of the lipidome of hepatic peroxisomes demonstrated the high content of arachidonate-containing choline glycerophospholipid species (5Yang J. Han X. Gross R.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggested that iPLA2γ might participate in the generation of lipid second messengers through the mobilization of arachidonic acid in response to cellular stimuli. However, because iPLA2γ did not selectively cleave arachidonate directly from the sn-2 position (3Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism(s) potentially responsible for iPLA2γ-mediated release of arachidonic acid were not clear. Historically, the ability of PLA2s to selectively mobilize arachidonic acid from endogenous phospholipid storage depots has served as an important and defining characteristic in identifying enzymes contributing to eicosanoid-mediated signaling processes. It is well established that cPLA2α possesses high hydrolytic selectivity toward lipids containing arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position (6Leslie C.C. Voelker D.R. Channon J.Y. Wall M.M. Zelarney P.T.

Bull. 2004; 27: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, calcium-independent PLA2β (iPLA2β) has also been shown to participate in the release of arachidonic acid upon cellular stimulation (12Lehman J.J. Brown K.A. Ramanadham S. Turk J.

Previous consideration of arachidonate selectivity has largely focused on the PLA2-catalyzed release of arachidonic acid directly from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. This represents the simplest and most direct mechanism for the selective generation of arachidonate and initiation of eicosanoid cascades by signaling phospholipases. However, other less well characterized multistep processes for eicosanoid generation are also possible and have been reported in the literature (19Bell R.L. Kennerly D.A. Stanford N. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Detailed lipid analyses using mass spectrometry and/or reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography have identified the choline and ethanolamine phospholipid pools as the major contributors to arachidonic acid mass release in most well studied systems (20Ford D.A. Gross R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3479-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. Gross R.W. Turk J.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1585-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We considered the alternative possibility that “arachidonate selectivity” and subsequent eicosanoid second messenger generation may be partially manifest through the selective production of 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine during cellular signaling. This possibility was particularly attractive because a lysophospholipase activity that selectively deacylates arachidonoyl LPC at a rate of 70 μmol·min–1·mg–1 was purified from bovine brain by Exton and colleagues (25Pete M.J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18114-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appeared that, at least in bovine brain, a large portion of arachidonate was produced through sequential deacylation of diacyl-PC by phospholipase A1 and subsequent lysophospholipase activities (26Pete M.J. Wu D.W. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The high specific activity lysophospholipase from bovine brain was immunologically identical to human cPLA2α (25Pete M.J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18114-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is known to possess much greater lysophospholipase activity than its PLA2 activity (27de Carvalho M.G. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequential deacylation of arachidonoyl-containing phospholipids by PLA1 and lysophospholipase activity is very likely an important and effective pathway contributing to the in vivo release of arachidonic acid. Previously, 2-arachidonoylglycerol was isolated from intestine and brain as an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors (28Mechoulam R. Ben-Shabat S. Hanus L. Ligumsky M. Kaminski N.E. Schatz A.R. Gopher A. Almog S. Martin B.R. Compton D.R. Pertwee R.F. Griffin G. Bayewitch M. Barg J. Vogel Z. Biochem.

Nature. 1997; 388: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), thus revealing its biological importance as an endocannabinoid signaling molecule in mammalian tissues. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that 2-arachidonoylglycerol serves as an excellent substrate for cyclooxygenase-2 oxygenation (31Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the product, prostaglandin H2 glyceryl ester, was identified as the precursor of a wide variety of prostaglandin glyceryl ester derivatives (32Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Morrow J.D. Wang L.H. Ma Y.H. Weinander R. Jakobsson P.J. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44877-44885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with signaling potential independent of prostaglandins (33Nirodi C.S. Crews B.C. Kozak K.R. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Oxygenation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol by 15-lipoxygenase yields 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid glyceryl ester, a possible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonist (34Kozak K.R. Gupta R.A. Moody J.S. Ji C. Boeglin W.E. DuBois R.N. Brash A.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23278-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been shown that multiple pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, such as the sn-1-specific lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of 2-arachidonoyl diglyceride species, derived either from the actions of PLC (30Stella N. Schweitzer P. Piomelli D. Nature. 1997; 388: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar) or phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (35Bisogno T. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Importantly, prior studies have demonstrated the lysophospholipase C activity in mouse N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells leads to the rapid conversion of 2-arachidonoyl LPC into 2-arachidonoylglycerol (36Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Sugiura T. Waku K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies have identified 2-arachidonoyl LPC as an important branch point metabolite in eicosanoid signaling, although the identity of the phospholipase(s) A1 catalyzing the highly selective production of 2-arachidonoyl LPC have thus far remained enigmatic. Herein, we report the expression, isolation, and purification of the human 63-kDa iPLA2γ from Sf9 cells utilizing metal affinity chromatography and demonstrate its highly selective PLA1 activity toward 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC). Remarkably, iPLA2γ does not substantially hydrolyze 2-arachidonoyl LPC, thereby allowing its accumulation in vitro. Furthermore, we show that 2-arachidonoyl LPC is a natural product in human heart tissue and that 2-arachidonoyl LPC rapidly accumulates after incubation of naturally occurring peroxisomal membranes with purified recombinant iPLA2γ. Collectively, these results implicate iPLA2γ as a likely proximal mediator of the production of 2-arachidonoyl LPC in vivo, which has the potential to integrate multiple eicosanoid signaling cascades in response to cellular stimulation. Materials—Talon cobalt-charged affinity resin was purchased from BD Biosciences. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([14C]POPC) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Diacyl-phospholipids, plasmenylcholine, and phospholipid internal standards for ESI/MS were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Deuterated fatty acid (i.e. 7,7,8,8-d4–16:0 fatty acid), used as an internal standard for the quantitation of non-esterified fatty acids, was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory Inc. (Andover, MA). The ProteoProfile trypsin in-gel digestion kits were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. High-performance liquid chromatography grade organic solvents and channeled LK6D Silica Gel 60-Å thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman) were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Chloroform and methanol used for lipid extraction were purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Sf9 cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals and reagents were typically obtained from either Fisher Scientific or Sigma-Aldrich. Cloning, Expression, and Affinity Purification of 63-kDa iPLA2γ(His)6 from Sf9 Cells—The cDNA encoding the N-terminal His-tagged 63-kDa iPLA2γ was prepared as follows: sense primer (5′-AAAAGTCGACAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACTCTCAACAAAAGGAAAATGAAC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGTACCGCATGCTCACAATTTTGAAAAGAATGGAAG-3′) were paired to amplify a 1.7-kb product from a full-length iPLA2γ pFASTBac1 construct (3Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for cloning via SalI/SphI sites into vector pFASTBac1 (Invitrogen). The Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) was subsequently utilized for bacmid preparation and CellFECTIN-mediated transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells to produce baculovirus, which was amplified and titered by the Neutral Red agar overlay method. Expression of the N-terminal His-tagged iPLA2γ was initiated by infection of 300 ml of Sf9 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of ≈1. After incubation for 48 h at 27 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold Grace's insect medium without serum, and repelleted. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated (20 × 1 s bursts utilizing a Vibra-cell sonicator at 30% output), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer and saved as the membrane fraction. Recombinant iPLA2γ was purified from Sf9 cell cytosol by using Talon Co2+ affinity column chromatography (BD Biosciences) employing an imidazole gradient generated using an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system. Fractions were assayed for activity utilizing [14C]POPC as substrate as described below. Active samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Cloning, Expression, and Affinity Purification of iPLA2β(His)6 from Sf9 Cells—Sequence encoding iPLA2β with a C-terminal His tag was generated by PCR amplification of the native iPLA2β cDNA utilizing sense (5′-AAAAGTCGACGCCACCATGCAGTTCTTCGGACGCCTTGTCAACAC-3′) and antisense (5′-AAAACTCGAGTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGGCGACAGCAGCATTTGGA-3′) primers containing SalI and XhoI sites, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pFASTBac1 for preparation of recombinant baculovirus as described above for iPLA2γ(His)6. Following infection of 300 ml of Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) with baculovirus encoding iPLA2β(His)6 for 48 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (900 × g for 10 min), washed once with Grace's insect medium without serum, and resuspended in 30 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin. After lysing the cells by sonication (30 × 1-s bursts), the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosol to which NaCl was added to a final concentration of 250 mm. Recombinant iPLA2β in Sf9 cell cytosol was purified by Talon Co2+ affinity column chromatography (BD Biosciences) employing an imidazole gradient generated using an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system. Column fractions were assayed for iPLA2 activity utilizing [14C]POPC as substrate as described below, pooled, and dialyzed overnight against Buffer A (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.8 containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA). The dialyzed sample was applied to a 2.5-ml column of ATP-agarose equilibrated with Buffer A and washed with Buffer A containing 1 mm AMP and 50 mm NaCl. Bound iPLA2β(His)6 was eluted with Buffer A containing 2 mm ATP and 100 mm NaCl, and dialyzed against Buffer A (EGTA concentration was reduced to 0.1 mm) containing 50 mm NaCl. Active samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Calcium-independent Phospholipase A2 and Lysophospholipase Activity Assays—Recombinant iPLA2γ and iPLA2β were routinely assayed by incubating protein samples with 5 μm [14C]POPC, injected in 2 μl of ethanol, in 200 μl of assay buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, 4 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, for iPLA2γ, or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA for iPLA2β) for 0.5–2 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of butanol and vortexing. Products were separated by TLC using petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1) and fatty acid was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For studies employing ESI/MS, phospholipid substrates were cosonicated to homogeneity with 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (DAG) (37Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in the assay buffer. In the assay for cPLA2α, 100 mm Tris acetate containing 5mm of CaCl2, pH 8.0, was used to replace the EGTA-containing buffer. Lipid substrates were then mixed with phospholipase (0.5–1 μg of purified iPLA2γ or iPLA2β, or 70 μg of cytosolic protein of Sf9 cells expressing cPLA2α) in a total volume of 200 μl, and the final concentrations for phospholipid substrate and DAG were 30 and 10 μm, respectively. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times in the figures. Reactions were terminated by addition of 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing internal standards, followed by addition of 2 ml of 50 mm aqueous LiCl (38Han X. Gross R.W. Mass. Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 367-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) and extraction of lipid species into the chloroform layer by the Bligh and Dyer method (39Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The solvent in the lipid extracts was then evaporated using a nitrogen stream, and the samples were redissolved in chloroform and filtered with Millex-FG 0.20-μm filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Extracted lipid samples were routinely stored in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) under nitrogen at –20 °C. Hydrolysis of peroxisomal phospholipids catalyzed by iPLA2γ was examined by incubation of 500 ng of purified iPLA2γ with isolated rat liver peroxisomes (5Yang J. Han X. Gross R.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for the indicated times using identical assay conditions. Lysophospholipase activity was assayed by incubating 1 μg of enzyme (iPLA2γ or iPLA2β) with 50 μm of LPC substrate, injected in 2 μl of ethanol, in 100 μl of assay buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and the products were analyzed by ESI mass spectrometry. ESI-MS of Phospholipids—ESI-MS analysis was performed using a Thermo Electron TSQ Quantum Ultra spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ion source as previously described in detail (40Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 41Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15584-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v, ∼2 pmol/μl) prior to direct infusion into the ESI ion source at a flow rate of 2 μl/min with a 2-min period of signal averaging. Phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine molecular species were quantitated by multidimensional mass spectrometry (14:1–14:1 PC and 17:0 LPC as internal standards) after correction for 13C isotopomer differences in the positive ion mode as previously described (38Han X. Gross R.W. Mass. Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 367-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 42Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 43Han X. Gross R.W. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2005; 2: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After addition of the appropriate amount of LiOH in methanol (38Han X. Gross R.W. Mass. Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 367-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 44Han X. Gross R.W. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), fatty acid species were quantified by comparisons to the deuterated internal standard (7,7,8,8-d4–16:0 fatty acid) in the negative ion mode. Tandem mass scanning of neutral loss of 59 atomic mass units (loss of trimethylamine) was performed at a collision energy of 24 eV and a collision gas pressure of 1.0 mTorr. Product ion spectra of sodiated LPC species were acquired at a collision energy of 30 eV and a collision gas pressure of 1.0 mTorr. The determination of the regiospecificity of LPC species by product ion analysis was performed as previously described (45Han X. Gross R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 451-457Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Other Procedures—Full-length human cPLA2α cDNA was cloned into pFASTBac1 via XhoI/HindIII for bacmid and baculovirus preparation utilizing the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen), and cPLA2α was expressed in Sf9 cells. The cytosolic fraction of Sf9 cells expressing cPLA2α was isolated by sonicating the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and subsequent centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Affinity-purified anti-iPLA2γ polyclonal antibodies were generated as previously described (3Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). End-stage human heart tissue was obtained from the tissue bank of the Cardiology Division, Washington University School of Medicine, with appropriate legal and Institutional Board Review authorization. Human myocardial lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer procedure (39Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) with modification as previously described. Preparation and regiospecific separation of sn-1 and sn-2 arachidonoyl LPC was accomplished following the procedure of Creer and Gross (46Creer M.H. Gross R.W. Lipids. 1985; 20: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) utilizing bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression of the 63-kDa iPLA2γ in Sf9 Cells—Previous work demonstrated that expression of the full-length iPLA2γ utilizing a pFASTBac (pFB) promoter proximal to the ATG translation initiation site coding the 88-kDa isoform resulted in a relatively modest level of expression of only the membrane associated 77- and 63-kDa proteins (3Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, truncation of the nested transcriptional inhibitory domain in exon 5 resulted in high levels of expression of the 63-kDa peroxisomal iPLA2γ isoform (Fig. 1) (47Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Sims H.F. Cohen J.M. Yang J. Gross R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4709-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we constructed a baculovirus encoding the 63-kDa iPLA2γ with an N-terminal His tag utilizing a pFB vector and examined the level of expression in Sf9 cells. Western analysis demonstrated a strong immunoreactive band at 63-kDa in both cytosolic and membrane fractions of cells expressing recombinant 63-kDa iPLA2γ, but not in control cells infected with empty pFB vector (Fig. 2A). Other immunoreactive bands were also present, with most predominantly in the membrane fraction, indicating proteolytic degradation and/or other post-translational modifications. The cells expressing the 63-kDa isoform of iPLA2γ showed robust calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity in both cytosolic and membrane fractions in comparisons to control cell fractions (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results indicated that the 63-kDa iPLA2γ(His)6 was successfully expressed in Sf9 cells as a highly active calcium-independent phospholipase A2.Fig. 2Expression of human 63-kDa N-terminal histidine-tagged iPLA2γ in Sf9 cells.

Here, we characterize the WaaL proteins of Vibriocholerae with emphasis on structural and functional characterization of Oantigen transfer and core oligosaccharide recognition. We demonstrate that theactivity of two distantly related O antigen ligases is dependent on thepresence of N-acetylglucosamine, and substitution of an additionalsugar, i.e. galactose, alters the site specificity of the coreoligosaccharide necessitating discriminative WaaL types. Protein topologyanalysis and a conserved domain search identified two distinct conservedmotifs in the periplasmic domains of WaaL proteins. Site-directed mutagenesisof the two motifs, shown for WaaLs of V. cholerae and Salmonellaenterica, caused a loss of O antigen transfer activity.

As a polyanionic lipid, the LPS leafletacts as an effective barrier for the diffusion of lipophilic and hydrophobiccompounds. This characteristic depends on the lipid A-core OS complex (for arecent summary, see Ref. 2Nikaido H. Microb. Mol. Biol.Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). Inpathogenic bacteria O polysaccharides serve important biological functions indisease.

For the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae it is wellestablished that about 200 serogroups exist and that the O polysaccharidesplay a major role in pathogenesis and epidemiology(8Reidl J.

Compared with O1, thecore OS of two non-O1 isolates, H11(17Bock K. Vinegradov E.V. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and O22(14Knirel Y.A. Widmalm G. Senchenkova S.N. Jansson P-E. andWeintraub A. Eur. J.

Res. 1997; 304: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), revealed distinctstructural differences. In addition, genetic analysis of the wavgenes (for core OS biosynthesis) of various environmental isolates of V.cholerae shows distinct genetic variation(19Nesper J. Kraiss A. Schild S. Blass J. Klose K.E. Bockemühl J. Reidl J. Infect.Immun. 2002; 70: 2419-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, core OSvariability does exist within V. cholerae as found in Escherichiacoli (20Amor K. Heinrichs D. Frirdich E. Ziebell K. Johnson R. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Many aspects of LPS biosynthesis have been resolved, and it is clear thatlipid A serves as an acceptor for core OS synthesis. Core OS synthesis iscoordinately achieved by the interplay of highly specific heptosyl- andglycosyltransferases, which are associated with the inner side of thecytoplasmic membrane. After completion of synthesis, the lipid A-core OSmolecules are subsequently transported to the periplasmic compartment via MsbA(for recent review, see Ref.5Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). For the O polysaccharides,three different synthesis and transport systems are known, which are all basedon the transfer of capped und-PP-linked O polysaccharides, delivered to theperiplasm either by the Wzy, ABC transporters, or synthase-dependent pathways(5Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). The subsequent ligation ofO polysaccharide and lipid A-core OS takes place in the periplasm(21Mulford C.A. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The key proteinresponsible for this reaction was identified as a surface polymer:lipid A-coreligase (O antigen ligase), encoded by the waaL gene as summarizedrecently (5Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar,22Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2001; 1: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on complementationstudies in Enterobacteriaceae, it was suggested that the O antigen ligases(23MacLachlan P.R. Kadam S.K. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7151-7163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are membrane-associatedand seem to possess substrate specificity for lipid A-core OS, but they arerelaxed in their recognition of the O polysaccharides(25Whitfield C. Amor P.A. Köplin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,26Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, since the firstgenetic evidence for WaaL function(27Schmidt G. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), no direct biochemicaldata have been produced which prove that the WaaL proteins are enzymes.Therefore, the important final step in the synthesis of the LPS molecule isstill not fully understood. Using WaaL of V. cholerae andSalmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, we investigated coreOS-dependent WaaL specificity, ligase activity, and WaaL membranetopology.

The purified PCR product was either ligateddirectly into pGEM-T easy (Promega) or digested with EcoRI/BamHI and ligatedinto an EcoRI/BamHI-digested pTrc99A. To construct pGEMwavLN theN-terminal part of the gene was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotideswavL-5′-EcoRI and wavL-N-term-up and chromosomal DNA of O1 as template,then the purified PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T easy. The expression plasmids pwaaLV194 and pwaaLwavMV194were constructed by amplifying the genes using oligonucleotide pairswaaLV194-5′-SacI, waaL-V194-3′-KpnI, and wavM-V194-5′-SacI,waaLV194-3′-KpnI, using chromosomal DNA of V194 as template. The PCRproducts were treated with SacI/KpnI, then ligated into SacI/KpnI-digestedpBAD18-Kan. Digestion of pwaaLwavMV194 with XbaI and religationresulted in the plasmid pwavMV194 lacking waaL of V194.After transformation of the ligation products into XL1-blue, amprcolonies for pTrcwavL, pGEMwavL, and pGEMwavLN or kanrcolonies (in the other cases) were characterized by restriction analysis andPCR (data not shown). Complementation was observed by supplementing the mediawith 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, inthe case of pTrcwavL, pGEMwavL, and pGEMwavLN, and 0.02% arabinosefor pwaaLV194, pwaaLwavMV194, andpwavMV194. To analyze the O antigen ligase activity, the hybrid plasmids ofwaaL, phybrid-waaLO1/V194, andphybrid-waaLV194/O1, consisting of N- and C-terminal parts ofwaaL derived from V194 and O1, were constructed. N-terminal portions(N-cassettes) of waaL were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotidepairs waaL-O1-5′-NheI and waaL-O1-up-NcoI in the case of O1, andoligonucleotide pairs waaL-V194-5′-NheI and waaL-V194-up-NcoI in thecase of V194. C-terminal parts (C-cassettes) of waaL were amplifiedby PCR using oligonucleotide pairs waaL-O1-3′-KpnI and waaL-O1-down-NcoIin the case of O1, and oligonucleotide pairs waaL-V194-3′-KpnI andwaaL-V194-down-NcoI in the case of V194. PCR products containing theN-terminal portions of waaL were treated with NcoI/NheI and ligatedto C-terminal portions of waaL that had been digested with NcoI/KpnI,along with an NheI/KpnI-digested pBAD18-Kan in a three-body ligation reaction.The fusion construct of hybrid WaaLV194-WaaLO1 consistsof the N-terminal 220 amino acids of WaaLV194 fused to 186 aminoacids of the C-terminal portion of waaLO1 ligase, startingat position Val214. The connecting region of this construct alsocontains an additional Ala and Met. The other fusion construct of hybridWaaLO1-WaaLV194 consists of the N-terminal 212 aminoacids of WaaLO1 fused to 180 amino acids of the C-terminal portionof V194 ligase, starting at position Thr224. The connecting regionof this construct harbors an additional Met and Val. After transformation ofthe ligation products into XL1-blue, kanr colonies werecharacterized by restriction analysis and PCR (data not shown). Byconstructing these hybrids between N- and C-cassettes of waaLs wealso reconstructed waaLO1 and waaLV194with the NcoI restriction site and subsequently showed that they were activein O antigen ligase complementation in the respective waaL mutants(data not shown). Construction of His-tagged WavL and WavM Expression Systems—For the construction of the C-terminal His-tagged WavL and WavM plasmidspTOPOwavL and pTOPOwavM, the pCRT7 TOPO TA Expression Kit (Invitrogen) wasused. Genes were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides wavL-topo-up andwavL-topo-down and chromosomal DNA of O1 as template in the case ofwavL and wavM-topo-up and wavM-topo-down and chromosomal DNA of V194as template in the case of wavM. Purified PCR products were ligatedinto pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector according to the kit manual and transformed intoTOP10F′ E. coli cells (Invitrogen). Ampr colonieswere characterized by restriction and PCR analysis. Correct construction wasverified by DNA sequencing (data not shown). Construction of His-tagged WaaLO1—For theconstruction of the N-terminal His-tagged WaaLO1 plasmidpQE30waaLO1 the gene was amplified by PCR using theoligonucleotides waaL-start-KpnI and waaL-stop-KpnI and chromosomal DNA of O1as template. The PCR product was treated with KpnI and ligated into theKpnI-digested pQE30 (Qiagen). After transformation of the ligation productsinto XL1-blue ampR colonies were obtained, isolated, and plasmidDNA was characterized by restriction analysis (data not shown). To decreasethe expression of WaaLO1 in XL1-blue Glc (0.2%) was added into theLB medium. Correct construction was verified by sequencing (data not shown).To test the expression of WaaLO1, pQE30waaLO1 wastransformed into MO10ΔwaaL. Complementation was observed bysupplementing the media with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Expression was verifiedby immunoblot using anti-His monoclonal antibodies (Invitrogen). Construction of Amino Acid Exchanges in WaaLO1 andWaaLSARC6— Using the QuikChange site-directedmutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) defined amino acids were exchanged.According to the kit manual PCRs were carried out using pQE30waaLO1as template and the oligonucleotides waaL-R186M and waaL-R186M-antisense toswitch Arg186 to Met, waaL-H309A and waaL-H309A-antisense to switchHis309 to Ala, waaL-H311A and waaL-H311A-antisense to switchHis311 to Ala, and waaL-H309A/H311A and waaL-H309A/H311A-antisenseto switch His309 and His311 to Ala, respectively. Tolose the remaining intact plasmid template, the reaction mix was treated withDpnI, then the remaining PCR products were transformed into XL1-blue.Subsequently, ampr transformants were obtained, isolated, andplasmid DNA was prepared. The amino acids exchanges in waaL wereverified by DNA sequencing. To test for expression and complementation ofWaaLO1 -R186M, -H309A, -H311A, and -H309A/H311A, the respectiveplasmids pQE30waaLO1-R186M, -H309A, -H311A, and -H309A/H311A weretransformed into MO10ΔwaaL. For the construction of amino acidsexchange in WaaLSARC6 for Arg208 → Met andHis321 → Ala, we followed the same procedure as describedabove. There we were using plasmid pWQ322 as template and oligonucleotideswaaLSal-R208M, waaLSal-R208M-antisense, and waaLSal-H321A,waaLSal-H321A-antisense for Arg208 → Met and His321→ A exchange (Table III),respectively. Expression was verified by immunoblot using anti-His monoclonalantibodies (Invitrogen), and LPS was prepared and analyzed as describedbelow.Table IIIOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotide nameOligonucleotidesequenceaRestriction sites are underlinedwavA-SacI-intern5′-AATGAGCTCAACCTGTTTTCGACTATGTAT-3′wavA-XbaI-intern5′-TATTCTAGAGATTATTCGCTGAACCACCACT-3′wavK-SacI-intern5′-TCTATCGAGCTCAATGGCAACAA-3′wavK-XbaI-intern5′-AAATCTAGAACCTATATAAATACTTTTAGCCGGA-3′wavI-SacI-intern5′-TTAGAGCTCACTACCGGTTTACCTTAACTAT-3′wavI-XbaI-intern5′-AATTCTAGATCTCGGTATTATTTTTAATGCGA-3′wavG-SacI-intern5′-TTTGAGCTCAACTTGGCATTAAACAGTT-3′wavG-XbaI-intern5′-TTTTCTAGATATTCTAAGCGATAGGAAAT-3′wavF-SacI-intern5′-AAAGAGCTCAACTTGGCATTAAACAGTT-3′wavF-XbaI-intern5′-TTTTCTAGATTAAAGTGATAAAGCCCGGT-3′wavE-SacI-intern5′-TTAGAGCTCAGAATTATCAATTTTTGACT-3′wavE-XbaI-intern5′-TTTTCTAGAAGCGCTCAGTGACATCCAAT-3′wavL-XbaI-N-term5′-TTTTCTAGAGATAACTGGCTTAGGATTATT-3′wavM-V194-SacI-intern5′-TTGAGCTCCCCATCCACTCTTTGCCA-3′wavM-V194-XbaI-intern5′-TATCTAGAAAACAAACTACATTTACCAACTT-3′waaL-V194-SacI-intern5′-TAGAGCTCCTCGCACATCAGTCATAATAAT-3′waaL-V194-XbaI-intern5′-TATTTTATCTAGATTGATTCCTATTGT-3′wavL-SacI-intern5′5′-ATGAGCTCACTCGCAGTGG-3′wavL-BamHI-intern5′5′-AAGGATCCACTGAGTCGGCCAATGATA-3′wavL-BamHI-intern3′5′-TAGGATCCAGCAAATCCCCGCTTTGA-3′wavL-BamHI-intern1-3′5′-TTAGGATCCCTTTTTGAGTAAGCTCAGTGAAT-3′wavL-XbaI-intern3′5′-AATCTAGAGTCATGTAACGCTTTAACTT-3′wavL-5′-EcoRI5′-AAGAATTCCAAAAGAGAATATGTAAGAAA-3′wavL-3′-BamHI5′-AAGGATCCGGTGTAATTAAAAGTAGTGAGA-3′wavL-N-term-up5′-AGGAGATCTTTGAAGGTCAGAGT-3′waaL-V194-5′-SacI5′-TAGAGCTCCGAGTGCCACTTTATAGAA-3′waaL-V194-3′-KpnI5′-TAGGTACCGATAACTCAGCAGCAGCAGGCAA-3′wavM-V194-5′-SacI5′-TTGAGCTCTAATCTGACCCAGTTTGATAAT-3′waaL-O1-5′-NheI5′-CTAGCAGCTAGCATTAGTTGGAACACGACCCT-3′waaL-O1-3′-KpnI5′-AAGGTACCATATCGCCAACCCAAGAAGAAGG-3′waaL-O1-up-NcoI5′-TTCCATGGTTTGCTTAAATTTTATTTTTCTTACATTGACGA-3′waaL-O1-down-NcoI5′-TTCCATGGTTTTTACTCTAATCAGTTTTTTATTA-3′waaL-V194-5′NheI5′-TATGCTAGCCGAGTGCCACTTTATAGAAAACCGA-3′waaL-V194-up-NcoI5′-TTCCATGGCATAATATTTCCATCTCAGTTTAATTGT-3′waaL-V194-down-NcoI5′-TTCCATGGTGACACTATCCGTTACTGTGCTCTCT-3′wavL-topo-up5′-ATGAATATTTTGATGGCCCTATCCCAA-3′wavL-topo-down5′-TTTTTTGTTCATTTTTCTAAATAGATAATTCCCT-3′wavM-topo-up5′-ATGAAAATCTACGTAATTAGCCTTAA-3′wavM-topo-down5′-TTTTTTATATTCATTAGCAAACATCATTAT-3′phoA-seq5′-GCTCACCAACTGATAACCAC-3′lacZ-seq5′-CCTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAG-3′waaL-start-KpnI5′-AAAGGTACCATGAATAATAAAATAACTAAAACCTCA-3′waaL-stop-KpnI5′-TATGGTACCTCAATTTTTTGCTCTTTTGGCTGCGAT-3′waaL-H311A5′-GTGCCCAGAGGTCATGCAGCCAGCCAGTATTTTGAAGCTAT-3′waaL-H311A-antisense5′-ATAGCTTCAAAATACTGGCTGGCTGCATGACCTCTGGGCAC-3′waaL-R186M5′-GCGACAATCTTAACCTTAACAATGGGAGCCATTTTAACGCTAC-3′waaL-R186M-antisense5′-GTAGCGTTAAAATGGCTCCCATTGTTAAGGTTAAGATTGTCGC-3′waaL-H309A5′-CACGGTGCCCAGAGGTGCCGCACATAGCCAGTATTTT-3′waaL-H309A-antisense5′-AAAATACTGGCTATGTGCGGCACCTCTGGGCACCGTG-3′waaL-H309A/H311A5′-CACGGTGCCCAGAGGTGCCGCAGCCAGCCAGTATTTTGAAGCTAT-3′waaL-H309A/H311A-antisense5′-ATAGCTTCAAAATACTGGCTGGCTGCGGCACCTCTGGGCACCGTG-3′waaL-Sal-H321A5′CCTTTAAAGAATCTATCGGTCCGGCAAATACCATTCTGTACATCTGGTT-3′waaLSal-H321A-antisense5′-AACCAGATGTACAGAATGGTATTTGCCGGACGATAGATTCTTTAAAGG-3′waaLSal-R208M5′-CCTGGGAACCCTATCGATGGGGGCATGGTTGGC-3′waaL-Sal-R208M-antisense5′-GCCAACCATGCCCCCATCGATAGGGTTCCCAGG-3′a Restriction sites are underlined Open table in a new tab Purification of His-tagged WavL and WavM—RecombinantHistagged WavL and WavM proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS asC-terminal V5 epitope/His6 fusion proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1994028197,"Delta-Notch signaling plays an essential role in cell fate determination in many tissue types, including the central nervous system. Although the signaling mechanism of Notch has been extensively studied, the behaviors of its ligands are not well understood. In the present study, we found that, in the developing neural tube, Dll1(Delta-like 1) was mainly localized on the processes extending from nascent neurons toward both the pia and the ventricle and accumulated at apical termini, where adherens junctions (AJs) were formed. To understand the mechanism of Dll1 localization, we searched for binding proteins for Dll1 and identified a scaffolding molecule, MAGI1. In the developing spinal cord, MAGI1 mRNA was highly expressed in the ventricular zone, where Dll1 mRNA was expressed. MAGI1 protein accumulated at the AJs formed around the termini of apically extending processes and was partially colocalized with Dll1. MAGI1 bound not only to Dll1 but also to N-cadherin-β-catenin complexes. In cultured AJ-forming fibroblasts, MAGI1 was localized at AJs, and Dll1 was recruited to these AJs through binding to MAGI1. In addition, Dll1 was stabilized on the cell surface by MAGI1. Taken together, these results suggest that Dll1 is presented on the surface of AJs formed at the apical termini of processes through interaction with MAGI1 to activate Notch on neighboring cells in the developing central nervous system.

Delta-Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls cell fate determination, cellular differentiation, and pattern formation in many tissue types (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4896) Google Scholar, 2Lewis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). During vertebrate central nervous system development, Delta-Notch signaling is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated neural progenitor pool to regulate the correct number and timing of generation of neurons and glial cells (2Lewis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Developing neural tubes consist of two distinct layers, the ventricular zone (VZ), 1The abbreviations used are: VZ, ventricular zone; ML, mantle layer; AJ, adherens junction; ICD, intracellular domain; aa, amino acid(s); WT, wild-type; TX-100, Triton X-100; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. 1The abbreviations used are: VZ, ventricular zone; ML, mantle layer; AJ, adherens junction; ICD, intracellular domain; aa, amino acid(s); WT, wild-type; TX-100, Triton X-100; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. which is composed of undifferentiated neural progenitors, and the mantle layer (ML), where differentiating neurons accumulate. After progenitors in the VZ exit the cell cycle, these neuronally fated cells immediately migrate toward the ML and differentiate into mature neurons (4Nadarajah B. Parnavelas J.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These migrating precursor cells in the VZ transiently express Notch ligand molecules, such as Dll1 (Delta-like 1) and Jagged1, to activate Notch receptors expressed on the neighboring progenitors (5Bettenhausen B. Hrabe de Angelis M. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gossler A. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2407-2418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chitnis A. Henrique D. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Kintner C.

Biol. 1996; 174: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Activation of Notch receptors mediated by the downstream target genes, such as the Hes family basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressors, prevents the cells from undergoing neuronal differentiation by repressing proneural basic helix-loop-helix factors, such as Mash1 (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4896) Google Scholar, 3Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition to these “lateral inhibition” functions, constructive roles of Notch signaling in gliogenesis have also been reported (10Gaiano N. Nye J.S. Fishell G. Neuron. 2000; 26: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 11Wang S. Barres B.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 197-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism of signal transduction by the Notch pathway has been extensively studied. Ligand binding on the cell surface leads to proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor at an extracellular region by tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme metalloprotease (12Lai E.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). This triggers a second cleavage at a transmembrane domain by a presenilin-dependent protease to release the Notch intracellular domain from the plasma membrane. The Notch intracellular domain is then translocated into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator for a DNA-binding factor, RBP-J/CBF1, to induce expression of downstream target genes (12Lai E.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The Delta gene is well conserved from flies to mammals and encodes a transmembrane ligand for the Notch receptor (5Bettenhausen B. Hrabe de Angelis M. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gossler A. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2407-2418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chitnis A. Henrique D. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Kintner C.

Nature. 1995; 375: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Thus, Delta-Notch signaling mediates local cell-cell communication. Regulation of the ligand as well as the receptor seems to play important roles in signal transduction by the Delta-Notch pathway. The soluble extracellular domain of Notch ligands can bind to the Notch receptor; however, it cannot activate Notch in vitro (13Varnum-Finney B. Wu L. Yu M. Brashem-Stein C. Staats S. Flowers D. Griffin J.D. Bernstein I.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but rather acts as a dominant-negative mutant that inhibits the native Delta-Notch pathway in vivo (14Hukriede N.A. Gu Y. Fleming R.J. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3427-3437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun X. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3439-3448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion mutants of Notch ligands lacking the intracellular domain also act as dominant-negative mutants (6Chitnis A. Henrique D. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Kintner C. Nature. 1995; 375: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 8Henrique D. Hirsinger E. Adam J. Le Roux I. Pourquie O. Ish-Horowicz D. Lewis J. Curr.

These findings suggest the possible importance of the intracellular domain of Delta in Notch activation. In support of this, one of the factors involved in the Delta-Notch signaling cascade in Drosophila, Neuralyzed (Neur), has been shown to bind the cytoplasmic domain of Delta and act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Delta protein (17Yeh E. Dermer M. Commisso C. Zhou L. McGlade C.J. Boulianne G.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1675-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Lai E.C. Deblandre G.A. Kintner C.

Cell. 2001; 1: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Neur-dependent internalization, possibly triggered by its ubiquitination, facilitates Notch activation (18Lai E.C. Deblandre G.A. Kintner C. Rubin G.M. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 783-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19Pavlopoulos E. Pitsouli C. Klueg K.M. Muskavitch M.A. Moschonas N.K. Delidakis C. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, dynamin-dependent endocytosis in Delta-expressing signaling cells is required for Notch activation (20Seugnet L. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, trans-endocytosis of the Notch extracellular domain by its ligand has been observed (21Klueg K.M. Muskavitch M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Parks A.L. Klueg K.M. Stout J.R. Muskavitch M.A. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, similar E3 ligases, such as Neur and Mind bomb, have been identified as regulators of Delta protein and Notch signaling (23Deblandre G.A. Lai E.C. Kintner C. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Thus, endocytosis of the ligand regulated by its intracellular domain seems to be an important mechanism of Notch activation, and this mechanism is conserved from flies to vertebrates. The expression pattern and function of the Delta gene have been extensively elucidated. However, the high internalization efficiency that is required for its function and the resulting instability of the Delta protein on the cell surface make it difficult to understand the molecular behavior of Delta protein. In particular, where and how Delta protein is presented to Notch-expressing signal-receiving cells remain largely unknown. Recently, Delta-induced filopodia formation was reported to mediate long-range lateral inhibition of neural differentiation of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila (25De Joussineau C. Soule J. Martin M. Anguille C. Montcourrier P. Alexandre D. Nature. 2003; 426: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but it is currently unknown whether a similar cellular structure is involved in the presentation of Delta protein to neighboring cells in vertebrate systems. The adherens junction (AJ) is a specialized structure for the cell-cell adhesion machinery in epithelial cells and consists of cadherin and nectin family cell adhesion molecules, which are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through their binding proteins catenins and afadin, respectively (26Barth A.I. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 27Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Neuroepithelial cells in the developing neural tube extend processes toward both the ventricle and the pia to form the bipolar morphology and then form AJs at the termini of their apically extending processes with the termini of neighboring progenitors (28Aaku-Saraste E. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 664-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). AJs are thought to be involved in maintenance of the undifferentiated progenitor pool and neural production by asymmetric cell division at the neurogenesis stage (29Chenn A. Zhang Y.A. Chang B.T.

Recently, we observed that migrating nascent neural precursors expressing Dll1 mRNA in the developing spinal cord extended processes toward the ventricle and formed AJs at the apical termini of the extending processes (32Minaki Y. Mizuhara E. Morimoto K. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Imai T. Takai Y. Ono Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). AJs are known to both regulate cell-cell adhesion and mediate the cell-cell signaling involved in cell growth and differentiation (26Barth A.I. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Dll1-expressing nascent precursors in the VZ communicate with neighboring progenitors through the AJs to regulate the differentiation of these cells. In addition, Dll1 mRNA was selectively transported to the apically extending processes (32Minaki Y. Mizuhara E. Morimoto K. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Imai T. Takai Y. Ono Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Dll1 functions on these processes to activate Notch on neighboring progenitors. To address these issues, we first examined the localization of Dll1 in the developing mouse spinal cord and observed that it was mainly localized at the processes. To understand the mechanism of Dll1 localization and regulation of its activity in the Notch signaling pathway, we screened for proteins that interacted with the intracellular domain of Dll1 and identified the multiple PDZ domain-containing scaffolding molecule MAGI1 as a binding partner for the C terminus of Dll1. During the course of this study, Wright et al. (33Wright G.J. Leslie J.D. Ariza-McNaughton L. Lewis J. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that zebrafish MAGI proteins bind to DeltaC and DeltaD proteins and that the MAGI1-binding domain of DeltaD is required for proper development of Rohon-Beard neurons. However, the mode of action of MAGI1 in Delta-Notch signaling has not yet been clarified. Thus, in the current study, we tried to address this issue by focusing on the role of MAGI1 in regulating Dll1 localization. In developing neural tubes, MAGI1 was localized at AJs formed at the termini of apical processes extending from both proliferating progenitors and neuronally fated precursors expressing Dll1 in the VZ and partially colocalized with Dll1. By using an in vitro culture system involving AJ-forming fibroblast cells, we found that Dll1 was recruited to AJs through its interaction with MAGI1. Finally, we showed that Dll1 was stabilized on the cell surface by MAGI1. Taken together, these results suggest a role for MAGI1 in Dll1 localization and the possible involvement of cadherin-based AJs in Delta-Notch signaling.

After culture for 24 h, the transfected cells were replated onto glass coverslips, cultured for an additional 16 h, and subjected to immunofluorescence analyses using anti-Myc (Roche Applied Science), anti-E-cadherin (Takara), anti-Dll1, and anti-MAGI1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments using 293E cells and detection by Western blotting were performed as described previously (34Nakatani T. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Sakamoto Y. Ono Y.

Briefly, transfected 293E cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% TX-100 for 1 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma).

ExTaq polymerase (Takara) was used for amplification, which was carried out by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s (2 min in the first cycle), annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min (3 min in the last cycle). There were 26 cycles for MAGI1 and 30 cycles for Dll1. The primer sequences were as follows: MAGI1, 5′-CTC-TGA-ACA-CTG-TGA-GCT-CTG-GCA-GC-3′ and 5′-TTG-GTT-TGG-TGG-TGG-TCC-TTG-TTT-CC-3′; and Dll1, 5′-GCG-AGA-AGG-ACG-TTT-CTG-TTA-GCA-TC-3′ and 5′-CTT-CTC-TTC-TCC-TGC-AGA-GCT-CTG-TG-3′. TX-100 Extraction—TX-100 extraction experiments were carried out as described previously (36Georgakopoulos A. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Cui W. Li H.C. Schutte M. Gordon R. Holstein G.R.

Briefly, transfected EL cells on coverslips were extracted with CSK buffer (50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% TX-100) for 5 min at 4 °C, fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and subjected to immunofluorescence analyses using anti-E-cadherin (Takara), anti-Dll1, and anti-MAGI1 antibodies. Surface Protein Labeling—Transfected EL cells were surface-labeled with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) and sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Biotinylated proteins were collected with streptavidin beads, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and anti-E-cadherin (Takara) antibodies. Dll1 Protein Is Localized on the Processes Extending from Nascent Neuronally Fated Precursors in the Developing Spinal Cord VZ—We previously observed that Dll1 mRNA was selectively transported into the processes apically extending from nascent neural precursors in the developing spinal cord VZ (32Minaki Y. Mizuhara E. Morimoto K. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Imai T. Takai Y. Ono Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This suggests that Dll1 functions on the processes. To examine this possibility, we first examined the localization of Dll1 protein in the developing mouse spinal cord. In the E11.5 spinal cord, Dll1 mRNA was expressed only in a subset of VZ cells (see Fig. 4B). Consistent with this, a high level of anti-Dll1 immunoreactivity was detected in the VZ region (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the immunoreactivity was not detected in the ventral striped region where Dll1 mRNA was absent (compare Figs. 2A and 4B). Together with the observation that this anti-Dll1 antibody did not cross-react with the most homologous protein (Dll4) and the Jagged family proteins in Western blotting (data not shown), these results confirm the specificity of the antibody. Importantly, Dll1 was detected not only at the cell body but also in the processes. In contrast to its mRNA, which was detected only in the apical processes extending toward the ventricle (32Minaki Y. Mizuhara E. Morimoto K. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Imai T. Takai Y. Ono Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Dll1 protein was distributed in both the apical processes and the basal processes extending toward the pia. These results suggest that the localization of Dll1 is not simply regulated by local protein synthesis from localized mRNA.Fig. 2Localization of Dll1 in the developing spinal cord. Images of transverse sections of E11.5 spinal cord double-stained for Dll1 (green) and ZO1 (red) are shown. B-D show magnified images of A.

Mizuhara E. Morimoto K. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Imai T. Takai Y. Ono Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggests a possible involvement of the process termini, where AJs are formed, in Dll1 function. In support of this, Dll1 was detected in the processes contacting the ventricle, and its accumulation near the ventricle was observed (Fig. 2B). These signals were specific because such apical signals were not detected at Dll1 mRNA-negative regions (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, Dll1 was partially colocalized with an AJ marker, ZO1 (zonula occludens 1), at the termini (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Dll1 is presented on the processes to activate Notch expressed on neighboring cells. MAGI1 Interacts with the C Terminus of Dll1—The selective localization of Dll1 in the processes suggests possible cell-intrinsic regulation through interacting proteins. To understand the mechanism of Dll1 localization, we searched for interacting partners for the ICD of Dll1 by yeast two-hybrid screening of an E12.5 central nervous system cDNA library. Sixteen of the 17 clones obtained encoded the multiple PDZ domain-containing scaffolding molecule, MAGI1 (38Laura R.P. Ross S. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most of the clones were derived from the cDNA portion encoding the fifth and sixth PDZ domains (PDZ4 and PDZ5) (data not shown). Although MAGI proteins have been reported to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of Delta proteins in vitro (33Wright G.J. Leslie J.D. Ariza-McNaughton L. Lewis J. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Pfister S. Przemeck G.K. Gerber J.K. Beckers J. Adamski J. Hrabe de Angelis M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whether the full-length Delta interacts with MAGI1 in vivo has not yet been investigated. To examine this, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected 293E cells. It has been reported that many alternative splicing variants of MAGI1 are expressed in the brain (38Laura R.P. Ross S. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. Exp.

A number of naturally occurring mutations of the hLHR have been identified that cause the receptor to become constitutively active. To gain further insights into the structural basis for the activation of the hLHR by activating mutations, we chose to examine a particularly strong constitutively activating mutation of this receptor, L457R, in which a leucine that is highly conserved among rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors in helix 3 has been substituted with arginine. Using both disruptive as well as reciprocal mutagenesis strategies, our studies demonstrate that the ability of L457R to stabilize an active form of the hLHR is because of the formation of a salt bridge between the replacing amino acid and Asp-578 in helix 6. Such a lock between the transmembrane portions of helices 3 and 6 is concurrent with weakening the connections between the cytosolic ends of the same helices, including the interaction found in the wild-type receptor between Arg-464, of the (E/D)R(Y/W) motif, and Asp-564. This structural effect is properly marked by the increase in the solvent accessibility of selected amino acids at the cytosolic interfaces between helices 3 and 6. The integrity of the conserved amino acids Asn-615 and Asn-619 in helix 7 is required for the transfer of the structural change from the activating mutation site to the cytosolic interface between helices 3 and 6. The results of in vitro and computational experiments further suggest that the structural trigger of the constitutive activity of the L457R mutant may also be responsible for its lack of hormone responsiveness.

The lutropin receptor (LHR), 1The abbreviations used are: LHR, lutropin receptor; hLHR, human lutropin receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; FSH, follitropin; WT, wild-type; SAS, solvent-accessible surface; hFSHR, human follitropin receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: LHR, lutropin receptor; hLHR, human lutropin receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; FSH, follitropin; WT, wild-type; SAS, solvent-accessible surface; hFSHR, human follitropin receptor. a member of the rhodopsin-like, Family A, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), plays a pivotal role in reproductive physiology. The ligand for the LHR is either LH, produced by the pituitary in both males and females of postpubertal age, or hCG, produced by the placenta of pregnant females. LH and hCG are members of a family of related hormones termed the glycoprotein hormones, the other members of which are follitropin (FSH) and thyrotropin. The glycoprotein hormones are composed of two non-covalently associated subunits, a common α subunit and structurally related, but distinct, β subunits. The nearly identical nature of the β subunits of LH and hCG, however, permits the LHR to bind either hormone. The three glycoprotein hormone receptors, the LHR, FSHR, and TSHR, contain relatively large extracellular domains composed of multiple leucine-rich repeats that have been shown to confer high affinity binding of their respective ligands (see Refs. 1Ascoli M.

The very recently released crystal structure of hFSH in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor (4Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) represents the first step toward understanding the yet obscure mechanism of hormone-induced receptor activation of the glycoprotein hormone receptors. In recent years, there have been numerous naturally occurring mutations of the gene for the human LHR (hLHR) that have been shown to result in constitutive activation of the receptor (reviewed in Refs. 5Latronico A. Segaloff D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 949-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 6Themmen A.P.N. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 551-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations have been found in young boys with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty, also called testotoxicosis or familial male precocious puberty. In these boys, the heterozygous presence of a constitutively active hLHR results in the inappropriate synthesis of testosterone when pituitary LH levels are still prepubertal, thus causing an early onset of puberty. The activating mutations of the hLHR have been localized to different transmembrane helices, with many of them clustered within helix 6. Cells expressing an activating hLHR mutant exhibit elevated levels of basal cAMP as compared with cells expressing the wild-type (WT) hLHR, although not necessarily as high as those levels of cAMP observed in hLHR(WT)-expressing cells that are incubated with a saturating concentration of hCG. In particular, we had identified an activating mutation of the hLHR, L457(3.43)R, 2The amino acid numbering in superscript is that proposed by Ballesteros and Weinstein (7Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2389) Google Scholar).

This cellular phenotype is also observed in membranes isolated from L457(3.43)R-expressing cells, where basal adenylyl cyclase activity is elevated in L457(3.43)R membranes, but the activity is not increased further with hCG addition (9Shinozaki H. Fanelli F. Liu X. Jaquette J. Nakamura K. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 972-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the L457(3.43)R mutation appears to stabilize the hLHR in a structure that has intermediate activity (i.e. it is constitutively active but not as active as the agonist-occupied wt hLHR) and it is unable to transduce the binding of agonist into a fully active conformation. The L457(3.43)R mutation is localized to helix 3 and involves the substitution of a leucine residue that is highly conserved in Family A GPCRs (10Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 11Mirzadegan T. Benko G. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Examination of hLHR mutants in which this leucine residue was mutated to arginine, lysine, histidine, alanine, or aspartate showed that only amino acids with positively charged side chains caused constitutive activation and concomitant hormone unresponsiveness (9Shinozaki H. Fanelli F. Liu X. Jaquette J. Nakamura K. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 972-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Computational models of the hLHR achieved by different approaches all converged toward the prediction that the positively charged side chains would be positioned such that they would interact with Asp-578(6.44) in helix 6, possibly perturbing the interactions between helices 6 and 7 (9Shinozaki H.

The aspartate at 6.44 is unique to and conserved within the glycoprotein hormone receptor family of GPCRs. The breakage of the H-bond found in the WT hLHR between Asp-578(6.44) and Asn-615(7.45) has been suggested to be the trigger of the constitutive activity induced by mutations of Asp-578(6.44) to Gly, Leu, His, Phe, and Tyr (12Angelova K. Fanelli F. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32202-32213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Fanelli F. Verhoef-Post M. Timmerman M. Zeilemaker A. Martens J.W. Themmen A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the integrity of Asn-615(7.45) and Asn-619(7.49) proved to be an essential requirement for the constitutive activity of the Asp-578(6.44) mutants (12Angelova K. Fanelli F. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32202-32213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The present studies, based upon in vitro and computational experiments, were undertaken to test the hypotheses inferred from the modeling of the hLHR(L457(3.43)R) mutant regarding the basis for its constitutive activity and to explain its lack of hormone responsiveness. Our data do indeed support the predictions of computational modeling that a salt bridge between positions 3.43 and 6.44 promotes both the hormone-independent active state of the hLHR and the loss of hormone responsiveness. Furthermore, the integrity of Asn-615(7.45) and Asn-619(7.49) appears to be required for the full constitutive activity of the Leu-457 mutants. Hormones and Supplies—Highly purified hCG was purchased from Dr. A. Parlow and the NIDDK National Hormone and Pituitary Program and was iodinated as previously described (14Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A less pure preparation of hCG (purchased from Sigma) was used only for the determination of nonspecific binding in 125I-hCG binding assays. 125I-cAMP and cell culture media were obtained from the Iodination Core and the Media and Cell Production Core, respectively, of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and Corning plastic-wares were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Plasmids and Cells—The WT hLHR cDNA was kindly provided by Ares Advanced Technology (Ares-Serono Group, Randolph, MA) and was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis was performed using the PCR overlap extension method (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar, 16Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). The entire region amplified by PCR, as well as the sites of ligation, were sequenced to ensure that there were no unintended mutations of the amplified cDNA. DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Core of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Human embryonic 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (CRL 1573) and were maintained at 5% CO2 in growth media consisting of high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 μg of gentamicin, 10 mm HEPES, and 10% newborn calf serum. Cells for experiments were plated onto 35-mm wells that had been precoated for 1 h with 0.1% gelatin in calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were transiently transfected at 50–70% confluence following the protocol of Chen and Okayama (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) except that the overnight precipitation was performed in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then washed with Waymouth's MB752/1 media modified to contain 50 μg of gentamicin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, after which fresh growth media was added. The cells were used for experiments 24 h later. For this study, in a given experiment cells were transfected with varying concentrations of plasmids encoding the hLHR(WT) as well as several other mutants. 125I-hCG binding to intact cells and basal and hCG-stimulated cAMP were then determined within a given experiment as described below. Data were plotted using PRISM (GraphPad Software). Binding Assays to Intact Cells Expressing the hLHR—HEK293 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated 35-mm wells and transiently transfected as described above. On the day of the experiment cells were placed on ice for 15 min and washed two times with cold Waymouth's MB752/1 containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin but no sodium bicarbonate. To determine the maximal binding capacity, the cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same media containing a saturating concentration of 125I-hCG (500 ng/ml) with or without an excess of unlabeled crude hCG (50 IU/ml). To terminate the assay, the cells were placed on ice and the contents of each well were scraped into a plastic tube on ice and combined with a 1-ml wash using cold Hanks' balanced salt solution modified to contain 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The tubes were centrifuged at 4 °C and the pellets resuspended in 2 ml of the same wash media. After a second centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated and the pellets counted in a γ counter. Measurement of cAMP—HEK293 cells were plated on gelatin-coated 35-mm wells and transfected as described above. On the day of the experiment cells were washed twice with warm Waymouth's MB752/1 media containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and placed in 1 ml of the same medium containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. After 15 min at 37 °C, a saturating concentration of hCG (100 ng/ml final concentration) or buffer only was added and the incubation was continued for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then placed on ice, the media aspirated, and intracellular cAMP was extracted by the addition of 0.5 n perchloric acid containing 180 μg/ml theophylline and then measured by radioimmunoassay. All determinations were performed in triplicate. Computational Modeling—The model of the hLHR employed in this work was achieved by comparative modeling by means of MODELLER (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar), using the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin as a template (19Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). The details of comparative modeling have been described elsewhere (13Fanelli F. Verhoef-Post M. Timmerman M. Zeilemaker A. Martens J.W. Themmen A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Among many different input arrangements tested, a unique structure was finally selected and used for building the input structures of the receptor mutants. These structures were obtained by substituting the mutated residue in the WT input structure by means of the molecular graphics package QUANTA (release 2000; www.accelrys.com). The WT and mutant structures were energy minimized and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations using CHARMM24 (20Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar) following the computational protocol that was previously employed for simulating the ab initio hLHR model (21Fanelli F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1333-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For each single mutant, different starting conformations of the mutated side chain were probed by molecular dynamics simulations. These conformations were assigned by using different rotamer libraries and checking for the absence of bad contacts between the mutated side chain and its neighboring amino acid residues. The selected conformations of the substituting side chain in the single mutants were employed in the input structures of the multiple mutants. The receptor structures averaged over the 200 structures collected during the last 100 ps of a 150-ps molecular dynamics trajectory and minimized were finally employed for the comparative analysis. As has been previously described (8Latronico A.C. Abell A.N. Arnhold I.J.P. Liu X. Lins T.S.S. Brito V.N. Billerbeck A.E. Segaloff D.L. Mendonca B.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 972-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is shown herein in Fig. 1A, the naturally occurring mutation L457(3.43)R in helix 3 of the hLHR results in marked constitutive activation of the receptor. This was determined in 293 cells transiently transfected with varying concentrations of plasmid encoding WT or mutant hLHR, yielding cells expressing a range of cell surface hLHR numbers as determined by 125I-hCG binding to intact cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, at all concentrations of receptor, cells expressing hLHR(L457(3.43)R) produced far more intracellular cAMP under basal conditions than cells expressing hLHR(WT), confirming the constitutively active nature of this mutant. Previous molecular dynamics simulations of the hLHR(L457(3.43)R) mutant and hLHR(WT) suggested that in the WT receptor Asp-578(6.44) in helix 6 normally interacts with Asn-615(7.45) and that replacements of Leu-457(3.43) in helix 3 with positively charged residues may establish a link between positions 3.43 and 6.44 via a charge-reinforced H-bond (9Shinozaki H. Fanelli F. Liu X. Jaquette J. Nakamura K. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 972-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Angelova K. Fanelli F. Puett D. J. Biol.

These predicted interactions in the WT and L457(3.43)R receptors are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. To test this hypothesis, we used a strategy of both disruptive mutagenesis to first disrupt a putative interaction and then reciprocal (or complementary) mutagenesis to determine whether the interaction could be restored. If so, it would lend greater support to the effects of the disruptive mutagenesis being specific as opposed to being because of general allosteric alterations in receptor conformation.Fig. 2Average minimized structures of the wild-type hLHR, as well as of the L457(3.43)R and L457(3.43)D/D578(6.44)R active mutants. In the left-hand side of each panel, the helix bundles are shown, represented by cylinders and seen from the intracellular side in a direction perpendicular to the membrane surface. The extracellular domains are not shown. Helices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are colored in blue, orange, green, pink, yellow, cyan, and violet, respectively, and the first, second, and third intracellular loops are colored in light green, white, and magenta, respectively. The solvent-accessible surface area computed over Arg-464(3.50), Thr-467(3.53), Ile-468(3.54), and Lys-563(6.29) is represented by dots colored according to the amino acid location.

The amino acid side chains are colored according to their location.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To first examine a potential interaction of the arginine in helix 3 of the L457(3.43)R mutant with Asp-578(6.44) in helix 6, we used the strategy of disruptive mutagenesis and created the double mutant L457(3.43)R/D578(6.44)N. If the arginine of the L457(3.43)R constitutively active mutant is interacting with Asp-578(6.44) in helix 6, then we would expect this double mutant, in which Asp-578(6.44) was mutated, to have reduced constitutive activity. Fig. 1A depicts the basal activities as a function of receptor concentration of this double mutant as compared with the WT receptor, L457(3.43)R alone and D578(6.44)N alone. The single mutation of D578(6.44)N behaved similarly to the WT receptor. Notably, the introduction of the D457(3.43)N mutation into the L457(3.43)R construct caused a marked reduction in constitutive activity as compared with L457(3.43)R alone. These data suggest that the constitutive activity of L457(3.43)R requires that the arginine interact with Asp-578(6.44). To confirm this, we performed the experiment shown in Fig. 1B in which this potential interaction was reestablished, but using a reciprocal amino acid pair. Thus, L457(3.43)D/D578(6.44)R was created to mimic an arginine-aspartate interaction between residue 457(3.43) with residue 578(6.44). Whereas in the L457(3.43)R mutant this would entail a helix 3 arginine interacting with a helix 6 aspartate, in the L457(3.43)D/D578(6.44)R mutant it would now entail a reciprocal helix 3 aspartate interacting with a helix 6 arginine. As shown in Fig. 1B, the individual mutants L457(3.43)D and D457(3.43)R were not constitutively active. However, the reciprocal L457(3.43)D/D578(6.44)R mutant displayed as strong a constitutive activation as the L457(3.43)R mutant. These data convincingly demonstrate that the arginine in helix 3 of the L457(3.43)R mutant does indeed interact with Asp-578(6.44) in helix 6 and that this interaction stabilizes the hLHR in a constitutively active state. The potential interactions of the arginine in the L457(3.43)R constitutively active mutant with Asn-615(7.45) and Asn-619(7.49) in helix 7 were similarly examined. First examining Asn-615(7.45), a potential interaction with this residue was disrupted by the mutation N615(7.45)R. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mutant N615(7.45)R alone displayed a slight degree of constitutive activity compared with the WT hLHR examined in the same experiment. The introduction of N615(7.45)R into the L457(3.43)R mutant (i.e. the double mutant L457(3.43)R/N615(7.45)R) showed much greater constitutive activity than the WT hLHR, but only ∼50% the constitutive activity of L457(3.43)R. These data might implicate an interaction of Arg-457(3.43) with Asn-615(7.45). As such, a reciprocal mutant was made, L457(3.43)N/N615(7.45)R, which now has an asparagine as residue 457(3.43) and an arginine as residue 615(7.45). As shown in Fig. 3B, L457(3.43)N alone displayed basal activity similar to the WT receptor. N615(7.45)R alone displayed some constitutive activity. The reciprocal mutant L457(3.43)N/N615(7.45)R displayed even greater constitutive activity, although significantly lower compared with the L457(3.43)Rmutant (Fig. 5A). These data are not sufficiently supportive of a direct interaction between positions 3.43 and 7.45, in the L457(3.43)R active mutant.Fig. 5Summary of basal and hCG-stimulated cAMP levels in WT hLHR and mutants thereof expressed at the same cell surface densities. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with increasing concentrations of cDNAs encoding the indicated hLHR constructs. In the same experiment, cell surface receptors (reflected by hCG binding assays to intact cells) and basal hCG-stimulated cAMP levels were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cAMP values observed at 2.5 ng of hCG binding/106 cells were interpolated from the curves of each experiment. Within a given experiment, the hCG-stimulated cAMP value thus obtained from cells expressing WT hLHR was defined as 100%. The top panel shows the mean ± S.E. of data from at least three independent experiments for each construct and is expressed as the percent of hCG-stimulated cAMP in cells expressing the WT hLHR. In the bottom panel, the data from the top panel were used to express the hCG-stimulated cAMP as the -fold increase over basal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A similar pattern was observed when examining the potential interaction of the arginine in L457(3.43)R with Asn-619(7.49). Thus, disruption of an interaction of the arginine in the L457(3.43)R mutant with Asn-619(7.49) (as tested with the mutant L457(3.43)R/N619(7.49)R shown in Fig. 3C) resulted in a significant loss of constitutive activity as compared with L457(3.43)R alone. The reciprocal mutant L457(3.43)N/N619(7.49)R was only slightly more active than L457(3.43)R/N619(7.49)R (Figs. 1, D and E, and 5A). These data are not suggestive of a direct interaction between positions 3.43 and 7.49 in the L457(3.43)R active mutant. Taken altogether, the data examining the basal activities of the hLHR and mutants thereof suggest that the naturally occurring hLHR mutant L457(3.43)R causes constitutive activation as a result of interactions of the introduced arginine residue in helix 3 with Asp-578(6.44). The conserved asparagines in helix 7 are required for the constitutive activity of the L457(3.43)R mutant, although their direct interaction with Arg-457(3.43) could not be inferred based upon the results of in vitro experiments. As with the basal cAMP, hCG-stimulated cAMP was examined in 293 cells expressing increasing amounts of receptor, where in any given experiment the hLHR(WT) was compared with three to four different mutants within the same experiment. For the purposes of comparing the basal and hCG-stimulated activities of all the mutants, it was necessary to design a method that would accurately standardize the data. This was made more complicated by the observations that cAMP levels (both under basal and hCG-stimulated conditions) did not always increase linearly with receptor concentration. Therefore, one could not simply divide the cAMP levels by receptor expression. Furthermore, some mutants were expressed at the cell surface at very low levels even when using maximal concentrations of plasmid for transfections. Therefore, it was imperative that all the data be compared at a single receptor concentration where all the mutants were expressed. Fig. 4 depicts a representative experiment measuring cAMP under basal (panel A) and hCG-stimulated (panel B) conditions to demonstrate how all the data were ultimately analyzed. The mutant with the lowest level of cell surface expression was L457(3.43)D. Therefore, we chose to analyze all the data at 2.5 ng of hCG binding/106 cells to ensure that cAMP levels would be detected for L457(3.43)D and, therefore, for all other mutants. For each experiment then the cAMP levels from basal or hCG-stimulated cAMP cells were interpolated for this receptor density. When the response was linear, this determination was made mathematically using the slope of the line. When the response was non-linear, the interpolation was made graphically using expanded scales. To compare the data from different experiments, the results were then normalized to the hCG-stimulated cAMP produced by cells expressing the WT receptor in that particular experiment (Fig. 4B). Fig. 5A depicts the basal and hCG-stimulated cAMP standardized for receptor number (all being taken from the same level of receptor expression) and expressed as a percentage of hCG-stimulated WT receptor. Fig. 5B expresses the hCG-stimulated cAMP levels as the -fold stimulation relative to the basal levels of cAMP for that mutant. The most notable feature is that all the mutants tested displayed a red"

Nasopharyngeal colonization, which plays a key role in the development of pneumococcal disease, is highly dependent on a family of surface-exposed proteins, the choline-binding proteins (CBPs). Here we report the crystal structure of phosphorylcholine esterase (Pce), the catalytic domain of choline-binding protein E (CBPE), which has been shown to be crucial for host/pathogen interaction processes. The unexpected features of the Pce active site reveal that this enzyme is unique among the large family of hydrolases harboring the metallo-β-lactamase fold. The orientation and calcium stabilization features of an elongated loop, which lies on top of the active site, suggest that the cleft may be rearranged. Furthermore, the structure of Pce complexed with phosphorylcholine, together with the characterization of the enzymatic role played by two iron ions located in the active site allow us to propose a reaction mechanism reminiscent of that of purple acid phosphatase. This mechanism is supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Finally, the interactions of the choline binding domain and the Pce region of CBPE with chains of teichoic acids have been modeled. The ensemble of our biochemical and structural results provide an initial understanding of the function of CBPE.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of acute otitis media in children and is responsible for the majority of deaths from invasive infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis, accounting worldwide for the death of one million children younger than 5 years old, annually. Treatment is impaired by the increased number of clinical strains resistant to single or multiple antibiotherapies. In addition, the current vaccine strategies using immunogenic properties of capsular polysaccharides are efficient only against the homologous serotype, and this prevention approach is not very effective in the young and the elderly (1.Bogaert D. De Groot R. Hermans P.W.M. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2004; 4: 144-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Consequently, new vaccine strategies focus on the use of additional pneumococcal surface-associated proteins from which protection in all age groups, and against a large spectra of serotypes, could be attained because of high protein sequence conservation among pneumococcal serotypes (1.Bogaert D. De Groot R. Hermans P.W.M. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2004; 4: 144-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Such new strategies require a complex understanding of the bacterium interaction with the host. Two pneumococcal factors involved in virulence processes are the capsular and cell wall polysaccharides. Teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids are major components of the pneumococcal cell wall and contain phosphorylcholine moieties (PCho) 1The abbreviations used are: PCho, phosphorylcholine; CBP, choline-binding protein; CBD, choline binding domain; Pce, phosphorylcholine esterase; pNP-PC, p-nitrophenyl-phosphorylcholine; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; MME, monomethylether; DTT, dithiothreitol; PEG, polyethylene glycol; WT, wild type; Pap, purple acid phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: PCho, phosphorylcholine; CBP, choline-binding protein; CBD, choline binding domain; Pce, phosphorylcholine esterase; pNP-PC, p-nitrophenyl-phosphorylcholine; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; MME, monomethylether; DTT, dithiothreitol; PEG, polyethylene glycol; WT, wild type; Pap, purple acid phosphatase. to which several functions have been attributed. One of the functions is binding to the platelet-activating factor receptor whose expression at the surface of epithelial and endothelial cells is up-regulated by local generation of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α. Binding to the platelet-activating factor receptor induces internalization of pneumococci and promotes the transcellular migration through the respiratory epithelium and vascular endothelium (2.Cundell D.R.

The presence of PCho molecules at the bacterial surface is a feature shared by most respiratory tract pathogens: streptococcal and clostridial species, Neisseria meningitidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenza (19.Weiser J.N.

Med. 1998; 187: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A specific characteristic of S. pneumoniae is the presence of proteins noncovalently attached to PCho; the choline-binding proteins (CBPs) by the means of choline binding domains (CBDs) (21.Fernandez-Tornero C.

Up to 15 CBPs have been identified in pneumococcal strains (CBPA-G, LytA-C), each containing a CBD located at the N or C terminus, characterized by the repetition of a 20-residue consensus motif GWX6WYYX4GXMX2 (4.Hoskins J.

In addition, CBPs harbor a domain of variable length to which enzymatic properties have been associated in some instances: LytA, LytB, and LytC cleave peptidoglycan bonds, a function also proposed for CBPD, whereas CBPG has been proposed to be a serine protease (24.Ronda C.

A role in pneumococcal virulence has been attributed for almost all CBPs: PcpA is thought to be involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, whereas PspA inhibits complement activation, among other effects (Refs. 7.Mitchell T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar and 29.Sanchez-Beato A.R. Lopez R. Garcia J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and references therein). CBPA is a cell surface adhesin and plays a major role in colonization of the nasopharynx by binding to immobilized sialic acid and lacto-N-neotetraose on cytokine-activated human cells (30.Rosenow C. Ryan P. Weiser J.N. Johnson S. Fontan P. Ortqvist A. Masure R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). CBPA also interferes with the host immune response by interacting with the polymeric Ig receptor, the C3 complement component, and the complement-control protein factor H (Refs. 7.Mitchell T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12.Luo R. Mann B. Lewis W.S. Rowe A. Heath R. Steward M.L. Hamburger A.E. Sivakolundu S. Lacy E.R. Bjorkman P.J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar and references therein). Finally, CBPD, CBPE, and CBPG have been shown to be involved in nasopharynx colonization. Mutant strains deleted in the cbpE and cbpG genes present, in addition, a significantly lower ability to adhere to human epithelial cells (23.Gosink K.K. Mann E.R. Guglielmo C. Tuomanen E. Masure R.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5690-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Increasing knowledge regarding nasopharynx colonization and tissue invasion processes has highlighted the participation of surface-associated proteins in both stages of pneumococcal disease, and such molecules are becoming of major interest as potential new antibiotics targets and/or vaccine candidates, as already established for the CBPs (32.Hava D.L. LeMieux J. Camilli A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this work, we focused on CBPE, one of the most important members of the CBP family. The CBD of CBPE is composed of 10 repeats, and the N-terminal region is predicted to harbor a domain with a metallo-β-lactamase fold (33.Daiyasu H. Osaka K. Ishino Y. Toh H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This domain, referred to phosphorylcholine esterase (Pce), catalyzes the hydrolysis of the choline-phosphoester bond, releasing PCho molecules from cell wall-associated teichoic and lipoteichoic acids (34.Vollmer W. Tomasz A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1610-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35.Höltje J.V. Tomasz A. J. Biol.

Drug Resistance. 2001; 7: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A pneumococcal mutant deleted in cbpE is much less potent than the wild-type strain in colonizing the nasopharynx, harbors a decreased ability to adhere to nasopharyngeal cells, but causes an increase in virulence in a model of intraperitoneal inoculation (23.Gosink K.K. Mann E.R. Guglielmo C. Tuomanen E. Masure R.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5690-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 34.Vollmer W. Tomasz A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1610-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of Pce to a resolution of 2 Å. The features of the Pce active site show that this enzyme is unique among the large family of hydrolases harboring the metallo-β-lactamase fold. Indeed, the orientation and calcium stabilization characteristics of an elongated loop, which lies on top of the active site, suggest that the cleft may be rearranged. Furthermore, the complexed structure of Pce with PCho, together with the characterization of catalytic iron ions in the active site, led us to propose a reaction mechanism that is supported by site-directed mutagenesis. This work provides a structural and mechanistic insight into the function of CBPE. Cloning of the pce Gene Encoding the Catalytic Domain of CBPE—Genomic DNA from the R6 strain of S. pneumoniae was used as a template to amplify the pce gene by conventional PCR methodology. Subsequently, the resulting product was cloned into the pHIS8 vector (pHIS8/pce). This construct encodes the Pce domain of CBPE (Glu27-Ser334), deleted from the peptide signal and from the CBD, fused to a His8 tag at the N terminus. DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble) confirmed that no mutations had been introduced during PCR. Mutagenesis of the pce Gene—The pHIS8/pce construct was employed as a template for QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The D62A-, D114N-, and H253N-encoding constructs were also subsequently sequenced (Genome Express), and no mutations other than the ones expected were introduced during PCR. Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Pce Proteins—An overnight culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain transformed with pHIS8/pce was used to inoculate (1:50) 1 liter of Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml of kanamycin. On achieving an optical density at 600 nm equal to 1 at 37 °C, protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside while incubating for 16 h at 15 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole (buffer A), containing 2 tablets of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were sonicated, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), previously loaded with 100 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated in buffer A. Extensive wash steps (10 column volumes) with buffer A containing successively 50 and 100 mm imidazole were performed preceding the elution of the protein with 300 mm imidazole (buffer A); subsequently, the sample was extensively dialyzed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. Pce was incubated with 4 units of thrombin per mg of fusion protein for 1 h at room temperature to cleave the N-terminal His tag. The cleaved product was loaded onto an anion-exchange chromatography column (Resource Q; Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and a NaCl linear gradient (0-300 mm) was applied to elute Pce. Finally, gel filtration was performed on Superdex 200 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. About 20 mg of pure protein were obtained from a 1-liter E. coli culture. Expression conditions of Pce mutants, D62A, D114N, and H253N were identical to the Pce wild-type protein. The mutants were purified on Ni2+ affinity columns and subsequently dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The homogeneity and masses for all purified proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and ESI-mass spectrometry. Native Mass Spectrometry Characterization of the Apo and Reconstituted Forms of Pce—Noncovalent mass spectrometry measurements were performed by using Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ion source. It operated with a needle voltage of 2.7 kV, sample cone and extraction cone voltages, respectively, of 150 V and 10 V; backing Pirani pressure was set at 6.21 mbar. The mass spectra were recorded in the 2000-4000 mass-to-charge (m/z) range. Samples were continuously infused at a flow rate of 7 μl/min, data were acquired in the positive mode, and calibration was performed using a solution of 0.5 mg/ml CsI in water/isopropyl alcohol (1:1, v/v). Data were processed with MassLynx 4.0 (Micromass). The apo form of Pce deleted from the His tag was prepared as follows: 20 mm EDTA was added to the protein (28 μm) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature; the protein solution was subsequently dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0. Apoprotein was then incubated with 1 mm Fe2+, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm PCho for 2 h at room temperature. Protein solution was again extensively dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0 to eliminate unbound molecules, leading to the reconstituted Pce protein. The three Pce samples in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0; native (before treatment), apo, and reconstituted forms; were analyzed by mass spectrometry under non-denaturing conditions. pNP-PC Assays—The PCho esterase activity of Pce wild type and mutants were measured with p-nitrophenyl-phosphorylcholine (pNP-PC, Sigma) as the substrate at 37 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, in a total volume of 200 μl. The activity was measured by following the increase in absorbance at 405 nm with the production of p-nitrophenyl (pNP), whose quantification as a reaction product of Pce activity had been previously calibrated with a standard curve. Apo forms of wild-type and mutant proteins were prepared by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with 20 mm EDTA and subsequent extensive dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The apo forms were used in the enzymatic assays with and without addition of iron, DTT, and calcium. Metal ions and DTT were added in concentrations from 0.01 to 1 mm. Reduced (Fe2+) and oxidized (Fe3+) forms of iron were generated from Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 salt (uncolored solution in presence of 10 mm DTT) and FeCl3 (deep orange-colored solution), respectively. The concentration of pNP-PC varied from 0.16 to 32.8 mm, and each protein was used at concentrations around 70 nm. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Crystallization Data Collection and Processing—A 40 mg/ml slightly brown solution of Pce in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl was used to grow crystals at 15 °C using the hanging-drop method with a reservoir solution containing 48% (w/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Typically, the best crystals grew within a few days to dimensions of 200 × 200 × 50 μm. Similar crystals were obtained in 30% (w/v) PEG 550 monomethyl ether (MME), 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. A crystal obtained using MPD as precipitant was soaked for 1 day in 0.1 mm PCho, mounted in a loop, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were obtained in-house using monochromatic CuKα x-rays supplied by a Nonius FR591 rotating-anode generator, coupled to a Mar Research Image Plate detector. Another crystal, obtained using PEG550 MME as precipitant, was first transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol), mounted on a loop, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data at the λ1 (remote) and λ2 (peak) edges of iron were collected at the ID29 ESRF beamline. Data sets were processed using MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 program suite (37.CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of Pce was solved using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (38.Dauter Z. Dauter M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Inspection of the in-house collected data set showed an anomalous signal, which could be interpreted as the anomalous signal of iron at 1.5418 Å (f″ = 3.2 e-). The positions of four iron atoms in the asymmetric unit were determined using SOLVE (39.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Phase refinement resulted in an initial figure of merit of 0.24. Density modification with non-crystallographic symmetry averaging by RESOLVE (40.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar) increased the figure of merit to 0.65 and gave a map of good quality. Automatic building using RESOLVE resulted in a model that included 76% of the sequence. Multiple rounds of model building with O (41.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC (42.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) generated the final model. Ca2+ assignments were supported by environment coordination, temperature factors, and omit maps for different cations. Conformational torsion angle restraints and charge assignments for the PCho molecule were obtained using CCP4i Libcheck (37.CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). Phases for the Pce structure were also obtained de novo using synchrotron radiation. The crystal obtained using PEG550 MME as precipitant revealed a strong fluorescence signal at the K-iron edge, which was attributed to the presence of a binuclear iron center. No fluorescence signal was seen at the adsorption edge of zinc or manganese using the same crystal. Using the SAD data from the peak wavelength (1.7396 Å; f″ = 5.6 e-), four iron ions were located in the asymmetric unit using SOLVE. Phase refinement resulted in a figure of merit of 0.22 and of 0.62 after density modification with non-crystallographic symmetry averaging by RESOLVE. Using data collected on the remote wavelength, phases were then extended from 2.40 to 1.95 Å, and automatic building by RESOLVE resulted in a model that included 71% of the sequence. Multiple rounds of model building with O and refinement with REFMAC generated the final model. The quality of the map was very similar to that obtained using the in-house data set. Interestingly, the refined structure obtained from this crystal, which was not soaked in PCho solution, showed a PCho molecule bound to the active site. However, the extra electron density in the active site was weaker than that seen using the in-house data set, indicating a lower ligand occupancy. We therefore only report the refined structure using the in-house data collection, i.e. the Pce-PCho complex with full occupancy. The Pce catalytic region of CBPE model coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (1WRA). The structural model of the CBD of CBPE was obtained using the Geno3D server with the Cpl-1 structure as the starting model (PDB code 1OBA). Overall Structure—The CBPE topology is defined upon amino acid sequence and structural data obtained in this work. The full-length protein contains a signal peptide (Met1-Gln26), the Pce catalytic region (Glu27-Arg298) followed by a linker region (Gly299-Ser334), and the C-terminal CBD (Gly338-Val541) (Fig. 1A). The crystals obtained with the recombinant Pce protein (Glu27-Ser334) belonged to space group P41212, and the structure was refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å. Two very similar polypeptide chains Mol A (Gly30-Ser334) and Mol B (Glu27-Ser334) were found in the asymmetric unit (root mean square deviation of 0.13 Å for pairs of Cα atoms), 2 PCho molecules, a total of 359 water, and 7 MPD molecules were also detected (Table I).Table IData collection, phasing; and refinement statisticsCryst. conditionPEG550MPD; phosphocholine soakedDatasetλ1 Fe (remote)λ2 Fe (peak)In houseData collection statisticsTemperature (K)100100100Wavelength (Å)0.975641.739631.54179Resolution (Å)aNumber in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.43.8-1.95 (2.00-1.95)48.8-2.40 (2.58-2.40)23.8-2.00 (2.05-2.00)ReflectionsObserved1,552,602851,7472,371,810Unique60,01332,83756,344Space groupP41212P41212P41212Unit cell (Å)a97.397.598.3b97.397.598.3c169.5169.9172.6Completeness (%)aNumber in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.99.7 (99.7)99.9 (99.9)96.9 (96.9)MultiplicityaNumber in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.10.2 (9.8)12.9 (12.7)20.0 (21.7)Rsym (%)aNumber in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.,bRsym=Σkhl|I(hkl)−〈I(hkl)〉|I/Σkhl〈I(hkl)〉.11 (39.5)12.1 (35.8)8 (39.5)I/σ (I)aNumber in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.11.1 (2.0)4.5 (2.0)7.7 (1.8)Phasing statisticsFo sites44FOM (centric/acentric)cAfter density modification.0.62/0.640.61/0.66Refinement statisticsRfactor/Rfree (%)dRact=Σkhl|Fo(hkl)−Fc(hkl)|/Σkhl|Fo(hkl)|.eRfree was calculated based on 5% of the total data omi"

On plastic dishes, human, bovine, and rabbit keratocytes lose their characteristic dendritic morphology and keratocan expression when cultured in serum-containing media. Herein, we demonstrated that murine keratocytes also acquired a fibroblastic shape and lost keratocan expression after first passage when cultured on plastic in the presence of serum. In contrast, cells expanded on human amniotic membrane (AM) stromal matrix maintained a three-dimensional dendritic morphology and expressed keratocan mRNA and protein for at least 8 passages before senescence. When keratocytes were cultured on AM, the promoter activity of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 and TGF-β receptor II was down-regulated as compared with that on plastic. Furthermore, cells on AM continuously retained Smad 2 and Smad 4 in the cytoplasm and did not express α-smooth muscle actin, even when 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 was added in a serum-free medium for up to 5 days. In parallel to such down-regulation of TGF-β signaling, keratocan promoter-driven ECFP expression was observed in cells cultured either on AM in the presence of serum or on plastic containing serum treated with a neutralizing antibody to TGF-β. Collectively, these results indicate that down-regulation of Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling is an important mechanism for cultured keratocytes to maintain a normal phenotype while continuously expanded in a serum-containing medium. This strategy of suppressing TGF-β signaling, achieved by AM stromal matrix in part via suppression of TGF-β gene transcription, can be used to expand keratocytes in culture without the use of AM in the future.

Similarly, murine corneal fibroblasts cultured on plastic in a FBS-containing medium lose expression of corneal stroma-specific keratocan mRNA but continue to express mimecan and lumican mRNAs (12Liu C. Arar H. Kao C. Kao W.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Gendron R.L. Liu C.Y. Paradis H. Adams L.C. Kao W.W. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 107-113PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome such a detrimental effect of FBS, a serum-free culture system has to be used to maintain a normal dendritic morphology and expression of keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans at the expense of cell expansion (1Beals M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is essential for corneal development and plays a pivotal role in normal and abnormal wound healing (14Jester J.V. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 311-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 15Saika S. Saika S. Liu C.Y. Azhar M. Sanford L.P. Doetschman T. Gendron R.L. Kao C.W. Kao W.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One important mediator of TGF-β signaling is the Smad pathway. The binding of TGF-β ligands to TGF-β receptors triggers phosphorylation of Smad 2 and Smad 3. Smad 4 binds with phosphorylated Smad 3 in a complex and is translocated to the nucleus to transactivate target genes (16Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Therefore, the translocation of these Smads into the nucleus is a common effector in the Smad-mediated pathway (17Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). In 1% serum or a serum-free medium, addition of TGF-β1 differentiates keratocytes into myofibroblasts with prominent focal adhesions and up-regulates expression of α-SMA, integrin α5β1, cadherins, type I and III collagens, biglycan, and the EDA (EIIIA) form of fibronectin (9Funderburgh J.L. Mann M.M. Funderburgh M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45629-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 10Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Corpuz L. Roth M.R.

It remains unclear whether suppression of TGF-β signaling is not only important to prevent myofibroblast differentiation but also essential for maintaining the normal keratocyte phenotype. Recently, we reported a culture system that can achieve effective expansion of human keratocytes by growing them on the stromal surface of the AM in an FBS-containing medium (3Espana E.M. He H. Kawakita T. Di Pascuale M.A. Raju V.K. Liu C.Y. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5136-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Espana E.M. Kawakita T. Liu C.-Y. Tseng S. C.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). They maintained a dendritic morphology, continued to express corneal stroma-specific keratocan for at least 5 passages (at 1:2 split), and did not express α-SMA under serum-containing conditions or on addition of TGF-β1 (4Espana E.M. Kawakita T. Liu C.-Y. Tseng S. C.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that transcript expression of TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and TGF-βRII is suppressed in both serum-containing and serum-free media, the latter of which was challenged by exogenous TGF-β1, in cultured human corneal and limbal fibroblasts (19Tseng S.C. Li D.Q. Ma X. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) as well as human conjunctival and pterygium fibroblasts (20Lee S.-B. Li D.-Q. Tan D. T.H. Meller D. Tseng S. C.G. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 20: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Suppression of TGF-β signaling is coupled with down-regulation of α-SMA, integrin α5, and the EDA form of fibronectin transcripts. Herein, we report that murine keratocytes can be similarly expanded on AM for at least 8 passages without losing their normal phenotype in a serum-containing medium and that suppression of the Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling pathway is pivotal in maintaining a keratocan-expressing phenotype. Isolation and Culture of Keratocytes on Plastic or AM—Six- to 10-week-old CD-1 albino mice were obtained from Charles Rivers (Boston, MA) and handled according to The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc. (ARVO) guidelines for care of animals in ophthalmic research. After euthanasia, the eyes were enucleated by forceps, washed profusely in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, 15 mg/ml dispase II (Roche Applied Science), and 100 mm sorbitol at 4 °C for 18 h as previously reported (21Espana E.M. Romano A.C. Kawakita T. Di Pascuale M. Smiddy R. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4275-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Kawakita T. Espana E.M. He H. Yeh L.K. Liu C.Y. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The entire corneal epithelium loosened by this treatment was subsequently removed by vigorous shaking. Under a dissecting microscope, the corneal stroma was separated from the sclera at the corneoscleral limbus by pressing down the limbus with a 27-gauge needle while the eye was held with a forcep. Isolated corneal stromas were incubated overnight at 37 °C in DMEM containing 1.25 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 20 mm HEPES in a non-coated plastic dish until the tissue became “smeared” onto the dish bottom. Digested corneal stromas in collagenase A were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. Keratocytes were resuspended in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, ITS (5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B with or without 10% FBS. This keratocyte-containing cell suspension was then seeded on plastic dishes or on the stromal side of the AM (Bio-Tissue, Miami, FL) fastened to a culture insert as previously described (23Meller D. Pires R.T.F. Tseng S.C.G. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2002; 86: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The suspension of keratocytes prepared from three to four murine corneal buttons was seeded on a 35-mm plastic dish or on the stromal surface of one 32-mm AM insert as previously reported (3Espana E.M. He H. Kawakita T. Di Pascuale M.A. Raju V.K. Liu C.Y. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5136-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (DMEM/10% FBS), and the medium was changed every 2-3 days. When cells reached 80-90% confluence, they were dissociated into single cells by incubation in 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for 5 min in plastic dishes or for 20 min in AM inserts, followed by vigorous pipetting. After centrifuging at 800 × g for 5 min, cells were resuspended in DMEM/10% FBS and seeded on a plastic dish or AM stroma. They were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 20 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. TGF-β1 Challenge and Neutralizing Antibody—To assess whether TGF-β1 affected the cell phenotype, triggered Smad 2 and Smad 4 nuclear translocation, and differentiated keratocytes into myofibroblasts, 10 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-β1 (Sigma) was added to serum-free DMEM/ITS cells for 3 h or 5 days when cells expanded on AM were passed to 24-well plastic dishes and AM inserts, respectively. In addition, primary keratocytes were seeded and cultured on AM or plastic for 3 days in DMEM/ITS or DMEM/10% FBS for 24 h, the latter of which was treated with or without 10 μg of a monoclonal antibody neutralizing TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) per milliliter of DMEM for 48 h before adenoviral transfection. Morphological Analysis—The corneal stroma after immediate surgical isolation was assessed for cell morphology by phase-contrast microscopy and for viability by Live/Dead Assay® (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to a previously published method (24Poole C.A. Brookes N.H. Clover G.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 685-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubation for 30 min with 2.5 ml of 2 mm calcein-AM and 4 mm ethidium homodimer in phosphate-buffered saline. Morphology of primary and subcultured cells on plastic and AM was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. Images were photographed with a NikonTe-2000u Eclipse epifluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Assays of Cell Proliferation—To verify that cells indeed proliferated on AM, the passage 2 (P2) cells that were continuously cultured on either AM or plastic were subcultured at a density of 10,000 cells/24-well plastic dish in DMEM/ITS or DMEM/10% FBS or on AM in DMEM/10% FBS. Cells were terminated at day 3 and day 7 for 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. This assay (absorbance, 550 nm) yielded a linear correlation for cell numbers above 2500 cells using P2 murine corneal fibroblasts (data not shown). Cells at day 7 were also immunostained using an anti-Ki67 antibody. The number of Ki67-positive nuclei was randomly measured in 10 fields under high magnification (×400) for each culture. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Transient Transfection and TGF-β Promoter Assays—Freshly isolated cells expanded on AM were subcultured on plastic and AM inserts. Upon reaching 60-80% confluence, cells in each 24-well or AM insert were co-transfected with 1.0 μg/ml plasmid DNA containing TGF-β2 or TGF-βRII promoter-luciferase and 1.0 μg/ml pCMV/Sport/Bgal (Invitrogen) using GeneJammer® (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid containing TGF-β2 or TGF-βRII promoter-luciferase was constructed by inserting either human TGF-β2 promoter (-1729 to +63) or TGF-βRII promoter (-1883 to +50) upstream of Luc+ in pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). TGF-β2 promoter (25Noma T. Glick A.B. Geiser A.G. O'Reilly M.A. Miller J. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Seong-Jin Kim (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and was inserted into KpnI and HindIII of pGL3-basic. TGF-βRII promoter (26Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of human corneal fibroblast as the template, forward primer 5′-GTACGGTACCCATCAAAGAAGTTATGGTTC-3′, and reverse primer 5′-GTACAAGCTTACTCAACTTCAACTCAGCGC-3′. The PCR program used was 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified TGF-βRII promoter fragment was then digested with KpnI and Hind III, gel-purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and inserted at the same sites on pGL3-basic. TGF-β2 and TGF-βRII promoter activities were measured by the Luciferase Assay System® (Promega) and normalized with the β-galactosidase activity. Adenoviral Transfection—A pKerapr3.2-intron-ECFP/BpA plasmid DNA was constructed by insertion of an ECFP fragment generated by PCR using pECFP-N1 (Clontech) as template and two restriction enzyme site-tagged primers (ECFP-RI, 5′-GATCGAATTCCCACCGGTCGCCACCATGGTG-3′; ECFP-SalI, 5′-GTTACTCGACTTACTTGTACATCTCGTCCATG-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI simultaneously and then ligated to the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pKera3.2-int-MCS-BPA plasmid vector (12Liu C. Arar H. Kao C. Kao W.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fidelity of PCR-amplified ECFP was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Next, the Kerapr3.2-intron-ECFP/BpA DNA fragment (6.0 kb) was excised from the pKerapr3.2-intron-ECFP/BpA plasmid with NotI and KpnI digestion and ligated into pAd-Track plasmid vector, which was kindly provided by Dr. Wei Li (Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, FL) and contains a CMV-EGFP expression cassette (27Chen J. Huber B.T. Grand R.J. Li W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The final construct was designated as pAd-Kerapr3.2-intron-ECFP/BpA and used to generate recombinant adenoviral plasmid by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli according to a previously published method (27Chen J. Huber B.T. Grand R.J. Li W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses in the 293 cells according to previously published method (28He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). Large scale adenovirus preparation was prepared as previously described (12Liu C. Arar H. Kao C. Kao W.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purified viruses were aliquoted in 50% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. The viral titer (plaque-forming units/ml) for adenovirus preparation was determined in 293 cells using 96-well plates and a series of diluted virus for transfection. After 7 days, we checked the green fluorescent protein expression under an inverted fluorescence microscope and estimated titer. The Adentrack-Kerapr3.2-intron-ECFP/BpA adenovirus had a titer of 3 × 1011 infectious particles/ml (plaque-forming units/ml). Cells were then transfected by aden-track-Kerapr3.2-intron-ECFP/BpA adenovirus (50 plaque-forming units) for 24 h. Transfection efficiency was judged by expression of EGFP, and expression of keratocan was judged by expression of ECFP in the same cell using a NikonTe-2000u Eclipse epifluorescent microscope equipped with appropriate filters. Immunostaining—To assess protein expression of α-SMA, keratocan, CD34, fibronectin, Smad 2, and Smad 4, culture dishes or frozen sections were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C and blocked and permeabilized as previously described (29Grueterich M. Espana E. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum for 30 min, cells were incubated overnight with antibodies to α-SMA (1:100; DAKO), CD34 (1:100; Santa Cruz), fibronectin (1:100; Sigma), Smad 2 (1:50; Santa Cruz), Smad 4 (1:50; Santa Cruz), and keratocan (1:50; rabbit antiserum against mouse keratocan N-terminal peptide; VRQAYEIQDPEDWDVHDDFYC; Invitrogen) (27Chen J. Huber B.T. Grand R.J. Li W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This peptide was conjugated to a SulfoLink® column (Pierce), which was then used to purify anti-mouse keratocan antibody according to the manufacturer's instruction. The secondary antibodies (Sigma) used at 1:100 dilution were anti-rabbit, fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse, and fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-goat antibodies for immunofluorescence. ABC method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was applied to CD34 and fibronectin staining. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342, propidium iodine, or hematoxylin (all from Sigma). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNAs were extracted by TRIzol™ reagent from cells cultured on plastic or AM and from two murine corneas as a positive control. Total RNAs equivalent to 1 × 105 cultured cells or 2 corneas were subjected to RT-PCR as recommended by Promega. The final concentration of RT reaction was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1 unit/μl recombinant RNase in ribonuclease inhibitor, 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer, and total RNA in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was kept at 42 °C for 60 min. One-tenth of the sample from RT was used for subsequent PCR with the final concentration of PCR reaction being 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl using the primers. The PCR mixture was first denatured at 94 °C for 5 min and then amplified for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) using PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research Inc.). After amplification, 15 μl of each PCR product and 3 μl of 6× loading buffer were mixed and electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were photographed and scanned. Western Blot Analysis—Two normal murine corneas were minced with a blade as a positive control. Conditioned media were collected from passage 2 plastic and AM cultures. These samples and cells cultured on either plastic or AM were extracted from two dishes at 4 °C overnight with 1 ml of 4 m guanidine-HCl containing 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm aminobenzamidine, and 0.1 m ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid. The extracts were dialyzed exhaustively overnight against distilled water, and the water-insoluble fraction was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris acetate solution (pH 6.0) containing 6 m urea. The protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometer at 280 nm. Protein aliquots (100 μg) were incubated with 0.1 unit/ml endo-β-galactosidase (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) or 0.1 unit/ml keratanase II (Seikagaku) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C overnight. Each sample was added with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. These membranes were pre-incubated with the blocking buffer, probed with affinity-purified antiserum against mouse keratocan and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) as a secondary antibody, and visualized with Western Blue® (Promega). In Vivo Morphology and Keratocan Expression of Murine Keratocytes—In CD-1 albino murine globes, there is a visible boundary that demarcates the limbus between the cornea and the sclera (Fig. 1A). Such a demarcation facilitated the surgical isolation of the corneal stroma. Following the removal of an intact sheet of the ocular surface epithelium from the globe by dispase II (22Kawakita T. Espana E.M. He H. Yeh L.K. Liu C.Y. Tseng S.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the corneal stroma was dissected from the adjacent sclera (Fig. 1B). Live/Dead Assay® revealed that an overwhelming majority of keratocytes were viable (stained green) and exhibited a three-dimensional dendritic morphology in the corneal stroma (Fig. 1C). Some dead cells (stained red) were found in the cut edge of the excised stroma (Fig. 1C, inset, marked by arrowheads). Keratocytes in the stroma expressed keratocan as evidenced by positive staining with an affinity-purified antibody against mouse keratocan peptide (Fig. 1D). In contrast, corneal epithelial cells or endothelial cells were not stained (Fig. 1D, inset). These results indicated that in vivo murine keratocytes also exhibited a characteristic dendritic morphology and specifically expressed keratocan. In Vitro Morphology and Proliferation of Keratocytes Cultured on AM—Keratocytes were then isolated from the corneal stroma by collagenase digestion. An average of 5000 cells/mouse cornea was obtained. Cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells/cm2 on either plastic or AM in DMEM/10% FBS. Within 12 h after seeding, cells attached on either substrate and exhibited a distinctly different morphology. Cells on plastic dishes were evenly distributed on the flat surface and adopted a spindle-shaped morphology with a broad stellate cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and B). They became confluent in 4-5 days. In contrast, cells on AM were dendritic or satellite in shape, had a triangular cell body and a scanty cytoplasm that formed extensive intercellular networks, and projected their dendritic processes in a three-dimensional manner (Fig. 2, D and E). They became confluent in 10 days. Upon reaching 80-90% confluence, cells expanded on AM or plastic were trypsinized and continuously passaged onto the same type of substrate as used in the primary culture (passage 0, P0). Cells subcultured on plastic at passage 1 (P1) became more flattened (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cells expanded on AM subcultures still maintained a dendritic morphology with pronounced intercellular contacts (Fig. 2F). They continuously preserved such a dendritic morphology until passage 8, when cells became senescent (data not shown). Using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, cells of P2 plastic cultures in DMEM/ITS did not show an increase of cell number during the 1-week period of culturing, whereas cells on plastic in DMEM/10% FBS rapidly expanded in number (Fig. 2G). The number of cells cultured on AM in DMEM/10% FBS was intermediate between the number of cells cultured under the two conditions described above (Fig. 2G, p < 0.05 cf. DMEM/ITS and p < 0.01 cf. DMEM/10% FBS). At day 7, the number of Ki67-positive nuclei in cells cultured on AM in DMEM/10% FBS was significantly greater than that of cells cultured on plastic in DMEM/ITS but less than that of cells cultured on plastic in DMEM/10% FBS (Fig. 2H, both p < 0.01). Collectively, these results confirmed that cells cultured on AM continued to proliferate and maintained a dendritic morphology in a FBS-containing medium. Phenotypic Characterization of Cells Expanded on AM—To confirm that dendritic cells expanded on AM were indeed keratocytes and not myofibroblasts, immunostaining was performed for the expression of keratocan and α-SMA, respectively. For primary cultures (P0), a majority of dendritic cells cultured on plastic in DMEM/ITS for 5 days (Fig. 3A) expressed keratocan (Fig. 3B) but not α-SMA (Fig. 3C). In contrast, cells cultured on plastic in DMEM/10% FBS were not dendritic (Fig. 3D) and did not express keratocan (Fig. 3E); instead, some cells expressed α-SMA (Fig. 3F). However, dendritic cells expanded on AM in DMEM/10% FBS (Fig. 3G) maintained keratocan expression (Fig. 3H) and did not express α-SMA (Fig. 3I). In DMEM/10% FBS, CD34 was not expressed by cells cultured on plastic (Fig. 4A), but CD34 was expressed by cells cultured on AM (Fig. 4C). In contrast, fibronectin was expressed extracellularly and intracellularly by cells cultured on plastic (Fig. 4B), but it was not expressed by cells cultured on AM (Fig. 4D). These results collectively indicate that the keratocyte phenotype was maintained by AM.Fig. 4CD34 and fibronectin expression. CD34 was not expressed by P2 cells cultured on plastic (A), but f"
https://openalex.org/W2160657673,"The role of a water molecule (water A) located between the primary electron donor (P) and first electron acceptor bacteriochlorophyll (B(A)) in the purple bacterial reaction center was investigated by mutation of glycine M203 to leucine (GM203L). The x-ray crystal structure of the GM203L reaction center shows that the new leucine residue packs in such a way that water A is sterically excluded from the complex, but the structure of the protein-cofactor system around the mutation site is largely undisturbed. The results of absorbance and resonance Raman spectroscopy were consistent with either the removal of a hydrogen bond interaction between water A and the keto carbonyl group of B(A) or a change in the local electrostatic environment of this carbonyl group. Similarities in the spectroscopic properties and x-ray crystal structures of reaction centers with leucine and aspartic acid mutations at the M203 position suggested that the effects of a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at the M203 position can also be explained by steric exclusion of water A. In the GM203L mutant, loss of water A was accompanied by an approximately 8-fold slowing of the rate of decay of the primary donor excited state, indicating that the presence of water A is important for optimization of the rate of primary electron transfer. Possible functions of this water molecule are discussed, including a switching role in which the redox potential of the B(A) acceptor is rapidly modulated in response to oxidation of the primary electron donor."
https://openalex.org/W2022160394,"Sensory error signals have long been proposed to act as instructive signals to guide motor learning. Here we have exploited the temporal specificity of learning in smooth pursuit eye movements and the well-defined anatomical structure of the neural circuit for pursuit to identify a part of sensory cortex that provides instructive signals for motor learning in monkeys. We show that electrical microstimulation in the motion-sensitive middle temporal area (MT) of extrastriate visual cortex instructs learning in smooth eye movements in a way that closely mimics the learning instructed by real visual motion. We conclude that MT provides instructive signals for motor learning in smooth pursuit eye movements under natural conditions, suggesting a similar role for sensory cortices in many kinds of learned behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1967913480,"Protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) has been implicated in the repair or metabolism of proteins containing atypical l-isoaspartyl peptide bonds. The repair hypothesis is supported by previous studies demonstrating in vitro repair of isoaspartyl peptides via formation of a succinimide intermediate. Utilization of this mechanism in vivo predicts that PIMT modification sites should exhibit significant racemization as a side reaction to the main repair pathway. We therefore studied the d/l ratio of aspartic acid at specific sites in histone H2B, a known target of PIMT in vivo. Using H2B from canine brain, we found that Asp25 (the major PIMT target site in H2B) was significantly racemized, exhibiting d/l ratios as high as 0.12, whereas Asp51, a comparison site, exhibited negligible racemization (d/l ≤ 0.01). Racemization of Asp25 was independent of animal age over the range of 2–15 years. Using H2B from 2–3-week mouse brain, we found a similar d/l ratio (0.14) at Asp25 in wild type mice, but substantially less racemization (d/l = 0.035) at Asp25 in PIMT-deficient mice. These findings suggest that PIMT functions in the repair, rather than the metabolic turnover, of isoaspartyl proteins in vivo. Because PIMT has numerous substrates in cells, these findings also suggest that d-aspartate may be more common in cellular proteins than hitherto imagined and that its occurrence, in some proteins at least, is independent of animal age.

The formation of isoaspartyl sites at aspartyl residues is also quite common (5Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Hancock W.S. Spellman M.W. Basa L.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but has not been well appreciated because isomerization of Asp-Xaa linkages alters neither the mass nor the charge (at neutral pH) of a polypeptide. The formation of isoaspartate in proteins is generally viewed as a deleterious event associated with protein aging (10Clarke S. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 263-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PIMT-dependent methylation of isoaspartyl sites serves to either repair the damaged sites or to tag the damaged proteins for degradation (11O'Connor C.M. Aswad D.W. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Aswad D.W. Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Shirokawa J.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 231: 247-259PubMed Google Scholar). A repair function is supported by in vitro studies using PIMT and defined polypeptide substrates (13Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies indicate the pathway shown in Fig. 2 whereby methylation serves to activate the atypical α-carboxyl of the isoaspartyl site. This activation promotes rapid, spontaneous demethylation via formation of the same succinimide intermediate that occurs during isoaspartate formation. Each cycle of methylation/demethylation converts ∼15–30% of the isoaspartyl linkage to a normal aspartyl linkage; however, after multiple cycles of methylation/demethylation, a majority of isoaspartyl sites are converted to normal aspartyl sites. In a study using purified PIMT and three different synthetic l-isoaspartyl peptides, we observed a net repair (l-isoAsp to l-Asp) efficiency of 65–80% after 24–48 h of incubation in the presence of excess S-adenosyl-l-methionine (16Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. Glass D.B. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall efficiency of the repair was limited by racemization of the succinimide intermediate (see Fig. 2) to produce a mixture of d-isoAsp and d-Asp forms of the peptide, neither of which are efficiently methylated by PIMT. Similar results have been reported by other laboratories (14McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2595-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Galletti P. Ciardiello A. Ingrosso D. Di Donato A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Further evidence that PIMT serves to repair l-isoaspartyl sites in proteins comes from two lines of study in which PIMT activity was artificially reduced in living cells. One line of study utilized the methylation inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde to lower PIMT activity in cultured rat PC12 cells (17Johnson B.A. Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted by the repair hypothesis, inhibitor treatment led to a dramatic increase in isoaspartate levels. A second line of study subsequently demonstrated that proteins in tissue extracts of PIMT-deficient (knock-out) mice show dramatically higher levels of isoaspartate than do wild type mice (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H. Yahagi Y. Kobayashi S. Koizumi K. Sakai T. Saito K. Chiba T. Kawamura K. Suzuki K. Watanabe T. Mori H. Shirasawa T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although both of these observations are consistent with a repair role for PIMT, both are also consistent with a possible role for PIMT in facilitating the degradation of isoaspartyl proteins. To more precisely define the in vivo function of PIMT, we thought it would be useful to determine whether an unusual degree racemization can be detected at protein sites that are known targets of PIMT-dependent methylation. If the repair mechanism of Fig. 2 applies in vivo, one would expect significant and selective racemization at such sites because of their repeated transit through a succinimide intermediate during cycles of PIMT-catalyzed methylation. An important corollary prediction is that such site-specific racemization should not be observed (or be much lower) in proteins from a PIMT-deficient mouse. If, on the other hand, PIMT-dependent methylation functions to target isoaspartyl proteins to a degradation pathway (thus avoiding repeated cycles of succinimide formation), we would not expect increased racemization at the PIMT target site in either normal or PIMT-deficient animals. To test these predictions, we decided to investigate the aspartate d/l ratio of mammalian histone H2B. A recent study employing both chemical inhibition of PIMT in PC12 cells and tissues from the PIMT knock-out mouse have demonstrated that H2B is a major substrate for PIMT in vivo (20Young A.L. Carter W.G. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37161-37165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Sequence and flexibility considerations implicate the Asp25-Gly26 linkage in the N-terminal region of H2B as the major site of isoaspartate formation, and we have recently confirmed this expectation using purified nucleosomes aged in vitro. 2W.

Tissue Sources—Frozen (–70 °C) coronal sections from the temporal lobe of male dog brains were obtained from the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia Canine Brain Repository at the University of California, Irvine, CA. Frozen (–70 °C) brains from PIMT (+/+) or PIMT (–/–) mice, 2–3 weeks old, were obtained as described previously (20Young A.L. Carter W.G. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37161-37165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Histone Isolation—Isolation and purification of mammalian core histones was carried out according to Young et al. (20Young A.L. Carter W.G. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37161-37165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The starting material was canine brain (1.6–2.4 g), or pooled mouse brain (2.0–2.4 g). The precipitation of histones from the acid extract of the nuclear fraction was accomplished by addition of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Individual histone peaks resolved by reversed-phase HPLC were identified by mass spectrometry and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Recombinant chicken H2B was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described elsewhere (21Schurter B.T. Koh S.S. Chen D. Bunick G.J. Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Henschen-Edman A. Mackay D.R. Stallcup M.R. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5747-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Individual histones or histone-derived peptide peaks from HPLC were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry Work station. Typically, 0.8 μl of histone or peptide (5–50 pmol) was mixed with 0.8 μl of a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (histones) or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (peptides) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.3% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, spotted onto the sample plate, and allowed to air dry. All spectra were acquired in the linear, positive ion mode. Isolation of Individual Peptides from Histone H2B—Purified samples of H2B (60–120 μg) were digested for 6 h at 37 °C in reactions containing 0.31 mg/ml histone, 0.024 mg/ml endoproteinase Glu-C (Worthington), and 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. After adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), peptides were separated by HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee) at 1.0 ml/min using a gradient of 3.5–49% (v/v) acetonitrile over 100 min in a base solvent of 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Major peaks were collected, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and identified by mass spectrometry. The quantity of peptide recovered in each peak was estimated from a peak area relative to an 18-mer peptide standard run under similar HPLC conditions. To analyze Asp51 from dog H2B, subdigestion of the pooled 36–68/71/76 Glu-C peptides (7–13 μg/sample) was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C in reactions containing 0.2 mg/ml peptide, 0.004 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma), and 96 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. Reactions were terminated by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). Peptides were separated by HPLC and identified as described above for the Glu-C peptides. Determination of Aspartate d/l Ratios—Acid hydrolysis of purified histones and peptides were carried out in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 24 h in 5-ml vacuum hydrolysis tubes (Pierce) containing 0.2 ml of HCl and 2–20 μg of protein or peptide. Hydrolyzed samples were reduced to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 200 μl of trimethylamine:ethanol:water (1:2:2), redried, and finally resuspended in 75 μl of water. Separation and quantitation of d- and l-Asp in the hydrolysates was carried out as described previously (22Aswad D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In the present study, we used a 4.6 × 100-mm Hypersil 3 μm ODS column (Thermo Electron) fitted with a 10-mm guard cartridge and a 250-μl injection loop. Isocratic elution was accomplished over 10 min at 1.0 ml/min in 50 mm Na-acetate, pH 5.9, containing 3.2% (v/v) methanol. Peak areas were corrected for blanks obtained from an acid hydrolysis containing HCl only and run in parallel with each set of samples. Aspartate d/l ratios were calculated from blank-corrected peak areas, taking into account the fact that the derivatized l-Asp has a specific fluorescence that is 12% higher than that of d-Asp (22Aswad D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Aspartate d/l ratios were further corrected for an acid hydrolysis-induced racemization of 4.8%, the value of which was establish by duplicate hydrolyzes of a synthetic peptide (100% l-amino acids) corresponding to amino acids 22–27 of mammalian H2B. Each acid hydrolysis sample or blank was analyzed in triplicate. Aspartate 25 of Canine H2B Is Highly Racemized—As an initial investigation into the possible relationship between isoaspartate formation and racemization in vivo, we purified individual core histones from the post-mortem brains of 2-, 9-, and 15-year-old dogs obtained through the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia Canine Brain Repository at UC Irvine. (The sequences of the histones relevant to this study are shown in Fig. 3.) We first analyzed the d/l ratio of all Asx residues in acid hydrolysates of histones H2B and H3 (Fig. 4a). Histone H2B was chosen for reasons explained above. Histone H3 was chosen for comparison because it separates most cleanly from the other histones during HPLC purification (20Young A.L. Carter W.G. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37161-37165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and because its overall aspartate and asparagine content is similar to that of H2B. As expected, the Asx d/l ratio for histone H3 was close to zero for all samples. In contrast, all of the H2B samples exhibited Asx d/l ratios significantly greater than zero, indicating that one (or more) Asx residues in H2B was at least partially racemized. We were somewhat surprised to see that the d/l ratios for H2B did not increase with animal age.Fig. 4Analysis of aspartate d/l ratios in acid hydrolysates of histones from dog brain. a, age dependence of d/l ratios for whole histone H2B (black) and whole histone H3 (gray). b, comparison of d/l ratios for Asp25 (black) and Asp51 (gray) in histone H2B from two dogs, ages 2.1 and 15.2 years. Note the larger vertical scale in this panel compared with the previous panel. c, examples of three individual aspartate d/l analyses of the H2B 1–35 Glu-C peptide (containing Asp25 as the only Asx residue) from dogs of ages 2.1, 9.4, and 15.2 years. The l-Asp peaks were all normalized for easy comparison of the d/l ratios. The retention time variation is because of the sensitivity of this isocratic separation to small differences in column equilibration between runs. The d/l ratios evident in this panel are higher than those shown in b, because the latter data have been corrected for acid hydrolysis-induced racemization as described under “Materials and Methods.” Error bars in a and b represent the S.D. around the mean of triplicate d/l-Asp determinations from a given acid hydrolysate. The negative value of the Asp51 data for the 15.1-year-old dog reflects the fact that the uncorrected d/l ratio observed for this sample was slightly below that for the control peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the site specificity of Asx racemization in canine H2B by comparing the d/l ratios of Asp25 and Asp51. As mentioned above, Asp25 is the major site of isoAsp formation and PIMT-dependent methylation in H2B. Asp51 was chosen as a comparison site because it was relatively easy to isolate from other Asx residues via proteolytic digestion. Fig. 4b shows that the d/l ratio of Asp25 (0.115–0.122) is considerably higher than the d/l ratio of the Asx-aggregate of whole histone H2B (0.049–0.070, Fig. 4a). In contrast, the d/l ratio of Asp51 in H2B (0.000–0.008, Fig. 4b) is in the same low range found for the aggregate of Asx-residues in H3 (0.002-.013, Fig. 4a). These findings confirmed our prediction that histone H2B would exhibit a higher content of d-aspartate than other histones and that the major contributor would be the succinimide-prone Asp25 residue. Examples of the original HPLC traces used to analyze the Asp25 d/l ratios in three dogs are presented in Fig. 4c. No data were obtainable from the 15.3-year-old dog because of poor recovery of the relevant peptide. Racemization of Asp25 Requires PIMT Activity—To examine the possible role of PIMT in catalyzing the selective racemization of Asp25, we compared the d/l ratios at this residue in H2B isolated from wild type and PIMT knock-out (KO) mice. PIMT-KO mice exhibit a nearly normal phenotype until one month after birth (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H. Yahagi Y. Kobayashi S. Koizumi K. Sakai T. Saito K. Chiba T. Kawamura K. Suzuki K. Watanabe T. Mori H. Shirasawa T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Between 30 and 60 days, most of the KO mice succumb to fatal epileptic seizures. Prior to death, all major tissues of the KO mice show dramatic elevation of protein isoaspartate levels compared with their wild type or heterozygote littermates. This is consistent with the presumed role of PIMT in catalyzing the repair of spontaneously arising isoaspartyl bonds via the mechanism shown in Fig. 2, but it is also consistent with a role for PIMT in the metabolic turnover of isoAsp-bearing proteins. Unlike a turnover role, the repair mechanism provides an opportunity for significant racemization because complete repair of each isoaspartyl site requires multiple cycles of methylation/demethylation, with each cycle resulting in formation of a metastable, racemization-prone succinimide. Fig. 5a shows the Asx d/l ratios for all Asx-containing Glu-C peptides derived from wild type, PIMT-KO mice, and recombinant chicken H2B. The 1–35 peptide provides information on the racemization of Asp25, the only Asx residue in this peptide. The d/l ratio for wild type mouse was 0.141, similar to that found for Asp25 in canine H2B (Fig. 4b). This is 4.1 times the d/l ratio observed in the KO mice (.034), indicating that PIMT makes a major contribution to the in vivo racemization of Asp25. The low but significant level of racemization of this same residue in the KO mouse may stem in part from the nonenzymatic succinimide formation that occurs during isoAsp formation (Fig. 1). We note, however, that the amount of racemization seen in the 1–35 peptide from the KO mice is only slightly greater than that seen in the 1–35 peptide from the recombinant chick H2B. We suspect that the 1–35 racemization observed for recombinant chick H2B (which is subject to minimal in vivo aging during its short expression period and no exposure to mammalian PIMT) occurs mainly from peptide handling during purification, protease digestion, and HPLC. If this is true, then this “in vitro” d/l contribution of 0.022 should be subtracted from the d/l ratio of Asp25 for both the wild type and KO mice. Doing this results in corrected d/l ratios of 0.119 and 0.012, respectively. Thus, PIMT is apparently responsible for 76% (uncorrected) to 90% (corrected) of the racemization observed at Asp25. The other two Glu-C peptides analyzed in Fig. 5a all showed Asx d/l ratios of 0.01 or less, regardless of the source. The 36–68 peptide contains two Asp and two Asn sites, whereas the 77–93 peptide contains a single Asn site. We conclude that Asp25 from wild type mice is the only Asx residue that exhibits significant racemization in vivo and that this racemization results from a combination of the inherent susceptibility of this site to isoaspartate formation coupled with the catalytic activity of PIMT. It is interesting that the extent of racemization of Asp25 in H2B is virtually the same in 2–3-week old mice (Fig. 5a), a 2-year-old dog (Fig. 4b), and a 15-year-old dog (Fig. 4b). Using rat PC12 cells, we previously estimated that isoaspartyl sites are generated in roughly 1% of H2B molecules/day in vivo (20Young A.L. Carter W.G. Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37161-37165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This supplies a steady stream of substrate for PIMT, which rapidly converts the isoaspartyl sites to racemization-prone succinimides. The incubation of a synthetic l-isoaspartyl peptide with PIMT and S-adenosyl-l-methionine resulted in the production of two major end products over a period of 24 h: 80% l-Asp peptide and 13% d-isoAsp/d-Asp peptide (16Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D.

Combining the rates of l-isoAsp generation in vivo with the capacity of PIMT to generate significant d-isoAsp and d-Asp from l-isoAsp provides a logical and compelling explanation for the extent of Asp25 racemization we see in 2–3-week-old wild type mice. This conclusion is supported by the recent studies of Kinzel et al. (23Kinzel V. Koenig N. Pipkorn R. Bossemeyer D. Lehmann W.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who found significant levels of d-isoAsp and d-Asp at the Asn2 site in a deamidated subform of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A and suggested a catalytic role for PIMT in the racemization. This conclusion is also corroborated by the earlier work of Perna et al. (24Perna A.F. D'Aniello A. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. De Santo N.G. Ingrosso D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who observed decreased levels of d-Asp/d-isoAsp in proteins from erythrocytes of uremic patients that have reduced activity of erythrocyte PIMT. The reason why racemization does not continue beyond a d/l ratio of 0.12 or so may be because of a metabolic turnover of the d-isoAsp-containing histones. A similar explanation has been put forward to explain why l-isoAsp accumulation in cellular protein is limited in PIMT-KO mice (25Lowenson J.D. Kim E. Young S.G. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20695-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is also possible that racemization is limited to a subpopulation of H2B molecules, e.g. those in regions of active chromatin, in which the N termini are relatively mobile. The propensity of Asp25 in H2B to racemize is ultimately related to the fact that its C-flanking neighbor is a glycine and that this pair of amino acids fall within a highly flexible domain. Asn-Gly, Asp-Gly, and Asn-Ser pairs in flexible domains are the most frequently encountered sites of rapid succinimide formation when proteins are aged in vitro at physiological pH and temperature (7Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Aswad D.W. Deamidation and Isoaspartate Formation in Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton1995: 91-113Google Scholar). The fact that this racemization-prone site is conserved in mammals (Fig. 3) and that it occurs in a histone domain that interacts with DNA and chromatin remodeling proteins raises the possibility that racemization of Asp25 might be a functional modification rather than a purely deleterious side reaction. It will be of interest to determine whether the d-Asp25 form of H2B is differentially distributed between open and condensed regions of chromatin and whether it is relatively enriched or depleted in nucleosomes associated with active or repressed genes. Coincidentally, histone H2B is a major target of autoimmune responses in systemic lupus erythematosus (26Hardin J.A. Thomas J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The formation of l-isoaspartyl sites, as well as other types of posttranslational modification of self-proteins, are believed to be key factors in eliciting autoimmunity in a number of diseases (27Doyle H.A.

https://openalex.org/W2062564391,"The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) belongs to the structurally conserved ENaC/Degenerin superfamily. These channels are blocked by amiloride and its analogues. Several amino acid residues have been implicated in amiloride binding. Primary among these are αSer-583, βGly-525, and γGly-542, which are present at a homologous site within the three subunits of ENaC. Mutations of the β and γ glycines greatly weakened amiloride block, but, surprisingly, mutation of the serine of the α subunit resulted in moderate (<5-fold) weakening of amiloride Ki. We investigated the role of αSer-583 in amiloride binding by systematically mutating αSer-583 and analyzing the mutant channels with two-electrode voltage clamp. We observed that most mutations had moderate effects on amiloride block, whereas those introducing rings showed dramatic effects on amiloride block. In addition, mutations introducing a β-methyl group at this site altered the electric field of ENaC, affecting both amiloride binding and the voltage dependence of channel gating. We also found that the His mutation, in addition to greatly weakening amiloride binding, appends a voltage-sensitive gate within the pore of ENaC at low pH. Because diverse residues at α583, such as Asn, Gln, Ser, Gly, Thr, and Ala, have similar amiloride binding affinities, our results suggest that the wild type Ser side chain is not important for amiloride binding. However, given that some αSer-583 mutations affect the electrical properties of the channel whereas those introducing rings greatly weaken amiloride block, we conclude that amiloride binds at or near this site and that αSer-583 may have a role in ion permeation through ENaC.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; wt, wild type; I-V, current-voltage. is the primary target of the potassium-sparing diuretic, amiloride. ENaC is expressed in the apical membrane of sodium-absorptive epithelia such as the distal nephron, lung airway and alveoli, and descending colon (1Li X.J. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As such, ENaC plays a critical role in maintaining Na+ homeostasis, controlling blood pressure and airway fluid volume. ENaC is a member of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily, all of which conduct Na+, are inhibited by amiloride, and have some structural features in common. They each have two hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains (M1 and M2) with intracellular N and C termini and a large extracellular loop containing two or three cysteine-rich domains (2Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). To date, α, β, γ, and δ ENaC subunits, which share 30–40% sequence identity, have been identified in mammals. ENaC is largely found in the kidney, lung, and colon as comprised of α, β, and γ subunits, although the subunit stoichiometry of functional channels remains controversial. Several groups have proposed a tetrameric α2βγ quaternary structure, although a nonameric α3β3γ3 arrangement has also been proposed (3Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L.

Understanding the mode of amiloride binding and the mechanism by which it inhibits ENaC has been the objective of numerous studies (2Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Apparent amiloride binding affinity was found to be attenuated by mutations at several specific sites. Mutations at αSer-583, βGly-525, and γGly-542 (γGly-537 using rat ENaC numbering), which are located in a region preceding the second membrane-spanning domain, altered amiloride Ki (7Ji H.L.

Two general mechanisms, ionic block and allostery, have been proposed for the inhibition of ENaC currents by amiloride (14Garty H. Benos D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 309-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Support of the ionic block model was grounded on the findings that amiloride block was voltage sensitive and competitive with Na+ in certain species and that amiloride may bind to the extracellular mouth of the pore (7Ji H.L.

Lindemann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to understand the role, if any, of the αSer-583 side chain in binding amiloride. Previously, mutations at αSer-583 have been found to cause only modest changes in apparent amiloride binding affinity, in stark contrast to all mutations made at the analogous positions in the β and γ subunits (βGly-525 and γGly-542) where any mutation of the Gly residue greatly weakened amiloride block (8Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting that the backbone assumes ϕ and ψ angles uniquely accessible to Gly at this position. In the only resolved structure of a protein with bound amiloride, that of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, several Ser and Gly residues were involved in the coordination of amiloride through either the backbone carbonyl or the Ser hydroxyl (20Zeslawska E. Schweinitz A. Karcher A. Sondermann P. Sperl S. Sturzebecher J. Jacob U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, we have generated a series of point mutations at αSer-583 to explore the role of this residue in amiloride block. We found that residues containing rings have large effects on amiloride block, whereas substitutions that do not introduce rings have moderate or no effect on amiloride block. Interestingly, the presence of a side chain capable of forming H-bonds is not required for high affinity block. Furthermore, certain mutations altered the electric field of the conducting pore, a change that altered the gating behavior of ENaC. In addition, one of the mutations at this site generated a simple voltage-sensitive gate. These findings support a pore block model for amiloride inhibition of ENaC and give insight to the orientation of αSer-583 in the channel pore. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All ENaC clones used in this study are mouse ENaC subunits whose cDNAs were inserted into pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (21Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated by using a PCR-based method as previously described (22Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ENaC Expression—Stage V and VI oocytes free of follicle cell layers were injected with 1–4 ng of cRNA for each mouse ENaC subunit/oocyte and incubated at 18 °C for 24–72 h in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, pH 7.4). Where indicated, cRNAs encoding β and γ subunits truncated at Arg-564 and Arg-583, respectively, were injected instead of cRNAs encoding wild type β and γ subunits to increase functional expression (23Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using a DigiData 1320A interface and a GeneClamp 500B voltage clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data acquisition and analyses were performed using pClamp 8.2 software (Axon Instruments) on a 1.5-GHz Pentium 4 PC (Gateway 2000 Inc., North Sioux City, S.D.). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) with a Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and had resistance of 0.5–5 megaohms when filled with 3 m KCl and inserted into the bath solution. Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber (Automate Scientific, San Francisco, CA) with 20 μl of bath solution and continuously perfused with bath solution at a flow rate of 4–5 ml/min. The bath solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. All experiments were performed at ambient temperatures (20–24 °C). For experiments measuring apparent drug affinity, inhibitors were diluted from 0.5 m stock solutions in Me2SO into the bath solution and delivered to the oocyte by perfusion. Prior to measurement at each indicated inhibitor concentration, oocytes were perfused for 10 s at that inhibitor concentration. Amiloride Ki was determined by nonlinear curve fitting (Igor Pro 4.0.9.1, Oswego, OR) using Equation 1, IIo=KiKi+[Inh]+C (Eq. 1) where I is the Na+ current, Io is the Na+ current measured in the absence of inhibitor, [Inh] is the inhibitor concentration, and C is the inhibitor-insensitive component of the current. Current-voltage relationships were determined by clamping oocytes in a series of voltage steps (500 ms) from –140 to 60 mV in 20-mV increments, whereas whole cell currents were measured 400 ms after initiation of each voltage step. Oocytes were clamped at 0 mV for 50 ms between voltage steps. A tail protocol was also employed. Na+ currents were measured from oocytes clamped at Vhold for 2 s, followed by Vtest for 2 s. Vhold was 20 mV, and Vtest varied from –140 to 60 mV in 40-mV increments unless otherwise indicated. Itail and Iss were measured 50 and 1950 ms, respectively, after application of Vtest. Patch Clamp—Vitelline membranes of oocytes were removed manually following incubation of the oocytes at room temperature in modified Barth's saline supplemented with 200 mm sucrose. Oocytes were then transferred to a recording chamber with bath solution and allowed to recover for 10 min before clamping. The bath and pipette solutions contained 110 mm LiCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Glass pipettes with tip resistances of 5–20 megaohms were used. For single channel conductance measurements, single channel currents were recorded in excised inside-out configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and a DigiData 1322A interface (Axon Instruments) connected to a Pentium 4 PC (Gateway). Single channel recordings were acquired using pClamp 9.0 (Axon Instruments) at 20 kHz, filtered at 1000 Hz by a 4-pole low pass Bessel filter built in the amplifier, and stored on the hard disk. Single channel currents were further filtered at 100 Hz with a Gaussian filter for display and analysis. Transitions with duration <20 ms due to amplifier noise were not included for analysis. For N·Po measurements, single channel currents were recorded in cell-attached mode using a PC ONE patch clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN), DigiData 1322A interface, and Clampex 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). Single channel currents were further filtered at 100 Hz with a Gaussian filter for display and analysis. N·Po estimates were made using recordings of duration ≥5 min using Clampfit 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test. Curve fittings were performed with Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments) and Igor Pro 4.0.9.1 (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR). Effect of αSer-583 Mutations on Amiloride Block—To study the role that αSer-583 may play in amiloride binding, we constructed a series of point mutations at this site. We selected both conservative (e.g. Ala, Cys, Thr) and non-conservative (e.g. Gln, Phe, His, Leu) substitutions for Ser to determine what binding specificity amiloride has toward αSer-583. cRNAs encoding wild type (wt) or mutant α subunits were mixed with those encoding wild type β and γ subunits and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. With the His, Phe, and Tyr αSer-583 mutants, it was necessary to co-inject cRNAs encoding truncated β and γ subunits (denoted βT and γT, respectively) in order to increase functional expression (23Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These channels were benzamil sensitive (see below) and sodium selective (data not shown). Two mutants, αS583K and αS583D, did not give functional expression 72 h after co-injection with βT and γT. Expressing oocytes were perfused with increasing concentrations of amiloride while currents were measured at a holding potential of –100 mV. Currents were normalized to the current measured in the absence of drug, and resultant dose-response curves were fit with Equation 1 (Fig. 1, see “Experimental Procedures”). The order of apparent amiloride affinity for these mutants was Leu >Asn, Gln, Ser (wt) >Gly, Cys >Ile, Thr >Ala >Val >His >Phe >Tyr with wt-ENaC having a Ki of 130 ± 40 nm (Table I). Seven of the mutations had modest effects on apparent amiloride affinity, causing changes that were 16-fold or less. αS583V had a greater effect, weakening apparent affinity by 35-fold. Notably, αS583N and αS583Q did not significantly alter amiloride Ki, whereas αS583L increased apparent affinity by 4-fold. In contrast, all three ring residues had strong effects: αS583H weakened amiloride Ki by 230-fold, whereas both αS583F and αS583Y weakened amiloride Ki by more than three orders of magnitude.Table IEffect of αSer-583 mutation on amiloride and benzamil bindingα583nAmiloride Ki-100 mVδnBenzamil Ki-100 mVμmμmSer (wt)60.13 ± 0.040.19 ± 0.0350.0051 ± 0.0002Ala62.1 ± 0.3*0.18 ± 0.0250.28 ± 0.06*Cys60.6 ± 0.06*0.43 ± 0.03*60.12 ± 0.03*Phe8170 ± 10*0.24 ± 0.022054 ± 2*Gly60.6 ± 0.2*0.14 ± 0.0350.008 ± 0.002His530 ± 10*0.35 ± 0.03*546 ± 9*Ile141.56 ± 0.03*0.70 ± 0.03*80.16 ± 0.04*Leu110.031 ± 0.002*0.11 ± 0.02*60.0047 ± 0.0002Asn80.076 ± 0.0070.15 ± 0.0350.011 ± 0.001Gln50.088 ± 0.0020.22 ± 0.0350.026 ± 0.005*Thr61.6 ± 0.1*0.54 ± 0.03*50.04 ± 0.001*Val54.5 ± 0.9*0.71 ± 0.03*50.6 ± 0.1*Tyr8>300ND16171 ± 8* Open table in a new tab Parallel to experiments with amiloride, we also measured the apparent affinity of these mutants for benzamil, an amiloride derivative with a benzyl substitution off of the guanidinium moiety. Our results with benzamil are similar to those we found with amiloride (Fig. 1). The order of apparent benzamil affinity for these mutants was Leu, Ser (wt), Gly, Asn >Gln >Thr >Cys, Ile >Ala >Val >His, Phe >Tyr with wt-ENaC having a Ki value of 5.1 ± 0.2 nm (Table I). Five of the mutations had modest effects on apparent benzamil affinity, causing less than an 8-fold change. The Cys, Ile, Ala, and Val mutations had stronger effects, weakening benzamil Ki by 24-, 30-, 55-, and 120-fold, respectively. Dramatically, however, and paralleling our amiloride results, all three mutations containing ring structures weakened apparent benzamil binding by ∼four orders of magnitude or more. Interestingly, αS583Gβγ and wt-ENaC had similar apparent affinities for benzamil, which contrasts with αS583Gβγ having a weaker apparent affinity for amiloride as compared with wt-ENaC. This is because αS583Gβγ has a 75-fold greater apparent affinity for benzamil than amiloride, the largest such difference among all mutants. Effect of αSer-583 Mutations on Electrical Depth of Amiloride Binding—To further study the role of αSer-583 in the interaction between ENaC and amiloride, we examined the voltage dependence of amiloride block of the mutant channels. We measured amiloride Ki at 20-mV increments between –140 and –20 mm for each of the mutants studied here (Fig. 2). The voltage dependence of amiloride inhibition was then characterized by fitting the data in Fig. 2 to Woodhull's ionic block model, which provides an estimate for the electrical depth of the amiloride binding site within the channel (24Eyring H. Eyring E.M. Modern Chemical Kinetics. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York1963Google Scholar, 25Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). This model is derived from the application of Eyring rate theory to a simple scheme where the ionic blocker only accesses its binding site in the channel from the external side of the membrane, as shown in Equation 2. Ki(V)=Kioexp(zδFVRT) (Eq. 2) Here, Ki (V) is the amiloride Ki at a given electric potential, Kio is the amiloride Ki in the absence of an electric field, δ is the fraction of the membrane potential acting on the site, and z, F, V, R, and T are the valence of the blocking ion, the Faraday, the electrical potential across the membrane, the gas constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively. Five mutants, namely αS583A, αS583F, αS583G, αS583N, and αS583Q, had δ values that were not significantly different from that of wt-ENaC (Table I). Five other mutants, namely αS583H, αS583C, αS583T, αS583I, and αS583V, had δ values that were significantly higher than that of wt-ENaC. Interestingly, the three mutations that had the highest δ values, causing an average 3.4-fold increase versus wt-ENaC, were those with amino acid side chains that introduced a β-methyl group at α583 (i.e. Thr, Ile, and Val). Effect of αSer-583 Mutations on Current Rectification— Shown in Fig. 3 are the current-voltage (I-V) relationships for wt-ENaC and selected mutant ENaC channels in the absence of amiloride, measured 400 ms after application of the indicated voltages. As has been previously reported, wt-ENaC expressed in oocytes with a high internal [Na+] exhibits slight inward rectification and therefore has a near linear I-V relationship (26Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). Five of the αSer-583 mutations, namely Leu, Gly, Asn, Gln, and Ala, behaved similarly to wt-ENaC (data not shown), whereas the remaining seven exhibited different I-V relationships. In the cases of αS583F and αS583Y, we observed outward rectification. The current-voltage relationship was simulated by characterizing the population of channels as having two distinct activity states with the voltage-dependent transition between the two states governed by a voltage-dependent Boltzmann distribution. This model is described by Equations 3 and 4 P(V)=(1+e−s(V−V1/2))−1 (Eq. 3) I=A·(V−VNa)·{P(V)+r−1[1−P(V)]} (Eq. 4) where P(V) is the probability of the channel being in the high activity state at a given voltage, V½ is the midpoint voltage of the transition, s is the slope of the S-shaped function at the inflection point, VNa is the reversal potential for Na+, r is the ratio between the high and low channel activity states, and A is a scaling factor so that I is –1 at –100 mV. Fits of this model to the data for αS583FβTγT and αS583YβTγT channels are shown in Fig. 3. Whole cell conductance was 1.6- and 2.7-fold higher at depolarizing versus hyperpolarizing clamping voltages for oocytes expressing αS583FβTγT and αS583YβTγT channels, respectively (Table II). For both mutants, V½ was similar to the reverse potential, suggesting that rectification is closely associated with the direction of the ion flux. Indeed, equivalent fits were obtained with one less variable by setting V1½ equal to VNa (fit not shown).Table IIFitted values for I–V plots of selected αSer-583 mutantsα583nV1/2VNarmVmVSer (wt)11-66 ± 73.3 ± 0.21.08 ± 0.01Thr11-88 ± 191.1 ± 1.42.7 ± 1Cys12-58 ± 45.1 ± 0.71.5 ± 0.1Ile22-65 ± 7-5 ± 22.6 ± 0.5Val10-120 ± 60-7 ± 43 ± 3Phe28-11 ± 18-2.7 ± 0.81.6 ± 0.2Tyr245 ± 8-2.5 ± 1.22.7 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab In the case of oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ, αS583Iβγ, αS583Tβγ, or αS583Vβγ channels, we observed greater inward rectification relative to wt-ENaC. All four mutant channels were satisfactorily simulated by the model described above. The degree of rectification among three of these mutants was similar, having an average 2.8 ± 0.2-fold enhanced whole cell conductance at highly hyperpolarizing versus depolarizing potentials, with the rectification of αS583C being less pronounced with only a 1.5-fold change in activity. The V½ values were also similar among the four, having an average value of –83 ± 28 mV. Interestingly, three of these mutations are the only naturally occurring amino acids that have a methyl group on the β-carbon (see “Discussion”). Effect of αSer-583 Mutations on Single Channel Properties— Given that the time between current measurements during the I-V protocol was less than 1 s, we hypothesized that the rectification induced by these mutations was due to either a voltage-dependent conductance (g) or open probability (Po) effect and not due to changes in the number of channels in the membrane. To test this hypothesis, we performed single channel recordings of the αS583Tβγ channel (Fig. 4). In excised inside-out patches, in which both the bath and the pipette contained identical solutions with 110 mm Li+, we observed that the I-V relationship was linear from –120 to 60 mV (Fig. 4A). We found that the αS583T mutation reduced the single channel conductance with Li+ as the charge carrier, with g equal to 3.2 ± 0.1 pS, compared with wt-ENaC, which has a reported g value of 8.1 pS (27Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the inward rectification of αS583Tβγ is the result of a voltage-sensitive Po effect rather than a voltage-dependent g effect. To measure this effect directly, we measured the N·Po of αS583Tβγ in cell-attached patches, with 110 mm Li+ in the pipette solution (Fig. 4B). We observed that N·Po increased with hyperpolarization, such that from –40 to –80 mV the value of N·Po almost doubles. Assuming that N remains constant for each patch during the time of the experiment, these data demonstrate that the inward rectification of αS583Tβγ is the result of a voltage-dependent Po effect. We were unable to perform single channel experiments with the outwardly rectifying mutants αS583F and αS583Y, perhaps because of the low conductance evidenced by the necessity of coexpressing these mutants with βT and γT subunits to achieve functional expression. In lieu of single channel data, we performed a tail current protocol using two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 5). In these experiments, the membrane potential is held at a given voltage (Vhold, 20 mV) for a time sufficient to achieve steady state, after which the membrane potential is changed to a test value (Vtest). This is then repeated for a series of test potentials (Fig. 5, A and B). I-V relationships measured immediately upon change to Vtest (current defined as Itail) that deviate from linearity reflect either non-linear single channel conductance or very rapid Po changes. Changes in current that occur after Itail with a time constant on the order of seconds or faster can be attributed to changes in Po (Fig. 5C). Apparent changes in Po were then fit using the Boltzmann equation as shown in Equations 5 and 6 Po(V)=[1+exp(w−zgqeVkBT)]−1 (Eq. 5) ΔPo=Po(Vtest)−Po(Vhold)Po(Vhold)·100 (Eq. 6) where w is the conformational energy increase upon opening the channel in the absence of a membrane potential, zg is the gating charge, qe is the elemental charge, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and V and T are as described above. Values of w determine the Po in the absence of an electric field, whereas zg represents the net charge moved across the electric field during gating. Values of w determined by fitting had large confidence intervals (>95%); however, those of zg, were smaller. For the αS583T mutant, we observed a linear I-V relationship at Itail but an inwardly rectifying I-V relationship 2 s after application of the test potential (Iss), giving a zg value of –0.15 ± 0.02. These results clearly parallel the single channel results for αS583T in implicating a voltage-dependent Po change as responsible for the inward rectification of αS583T. Using the same rationale to analyze the other channels, we found that the Po of the wild type channel has only slight voltage dependence (zg = –0.04 ± 0.02). In contrast to wt-ENaC, the αS583C, αS583I, and αS583V mutants behave similarly to the αS583T mutant, giving zg values of –0.11 to –0.14. We note, however, that the I-V relationships taken at Itail for the αS583I and αS583V mutants do exhibit slight inward rectification. This is due, at least in part, to measuring Itail 50 ms after switching to Vtest in order to avoid current contamination from the capacitance current. However, we cannot exclude a non-linear single channel I-V relationship for these two mutants. Distinct"

Here we show that the phosphorylation state of the endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can be quantitatively imaged in tumor cells and tissues by detecting fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorophores conjugated to antibodies against the receptor and phosphotyrosine, respectively. Five different human colorectal cell lines were analyzed for activity and expression of EGFR. All cell lines exhibited basal EGFR phosphorylation under serum starvation conditions. Phosphorylation levels increased after stimulation with EGF or pervanadate, dependent on the level of basal EGFR phosphorylation in the respective cell lines. This basal activity correlated inversely with receptor expression. Using the acceptor photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging approach, a significantly higher phosphorylation state of EGFR was also found in resected human colorectal tumor samples as compared with adjacent healthy tissue. Imaging of EGFR phosphorylation may thus serve as a valuable tool to investigate the role of receptor tyrosine kinase activity in malignant cell growth.

These phosphorylated tyrosyl residues recruit proteins with Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, thereby assembling multiprotein complexes that propagate the signal inside the cell. The amount of phosphorylated receptors is determined by the balance between tyrosine kinase and specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase activities (1Flint A.J. Tiganis F. Bardford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 95: 1680-1685Google Scholar). Therefore, lowering the protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity or increasing the receptor kinase activity should lead to enhanced phosphorylation of the receptor in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Up-regulation and overexpression of EGFR has been correlated to many processes related to cancer, including uncontrolled cellular proliferation, autocrine stimulation of tumors producing their own growth factors (e.g. TGF-β, EGF), and prevention of apoptosis (2Waksal H.W. Cancer Met. Rev. 1999; 18: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Wu X. Fan Z. Masui H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Mendelsohn J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 339-344PubMed Google Scholar). This also appears to protect cancer cells from the toxic actions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, rendering these treatment modalities less effective. Many epithelial tumor entities including gastric and cervical cancer as well as cancers of the head, neck, breast, and lung express high EGFR densities, which are associated with advanced disease and poor clinical prognosis (5Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Extensive expression studies have also been performed in colorectal carcinoma in vivo and in vitro (6Gradilone A. Gazzaniga P. Silvestri I. Gandini O. Trasatti L. Lauro S. Frati L. Agliano A.M.

A higher level of EGFR expression has been inversely correlated to survival in these patients and high expression levels have been found in advanced tumor stages (13Nicholson R.I. Gee J.M.

However, expression level of the receptor is not necessarily an indicator of its signaling activity in tumor cells. Especially in the view of the novel EGFR targeting treatment modalities no study has so far provided a method for direct imaging of endogenous EGFR phosphorylation in tumor tissues to validate treatment efficiency. To close this gap, we introduce a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method for quantifying EGFR phosphorylation within individual tumor cells. Spatially resolved FRET measured in the microscope (15Bastiaens P.I.H. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Söling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) has provided an approach for tracing the reaction state of fluorescently tagged proteins inside single cells (16Bastiaens P.I.H.

Science. 2000; 290: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Using this novel approach we investigate the endogenous phosphorylation state of EGFR in tumor cells and correlate it to its expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human recombinant EGF and the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG 1478 was purchased from Calbiochem. Vanadate was obtained from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Cell culture materials were derived from Invitrogen. EGFR antibodies binding to the sequence DVVDADADEYLIPQ, which corresponds to amino acid residues 985–996 (referred to as F4) and generic phosphotyrosine antibodies (referred to as PY72) were obtained from the monoclonal cell facility of Cancer Research UK (London, UK). For immunoprecipitation a polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody from sheep was used (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Monoreactive dyes Cy3 and Cy5 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.Cell Culture—Colon cancer cell lines were provided by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in minimal essential medium (HT-29, WiDr), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (A431), RPMI (Colo 320, SW-480), or McCoy (Caco-2) medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% (v/v) glutamine (ICN, Irvine, CA) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stock cultures were stored in liquid nitrogen and used for experiments within 5 passages. Cell viability (at least 95%) was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion before cells were processed further.Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 6-well dishes containing glass coverslips, starved in 1% fetal calf serum for 24 h, and then exposed to EGF (100 ng/ml) or pervanadate (final concentration of 1 mm after oxidation of vanadate by addition of 30% H2O2 to the 200 mm stock solution). Controls obtained the carrier PBS. After incubation cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before staining.Cancer Samples—Human tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from specimens that were resected at the Surgical Clinic Mannheim. Tissues were classified as normal or cancerous by hematoxylin and eosin staining of frozen sections. Adjacent sections of the tissue blocks were stained with the antibodies as described below. Samples were collected with informed patient consent, and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Mannheim University Hospital.Antibody Labeling—F4 antibody binding a conserved intracellular domain of EGFR was labeled with Cy3, and antiphophotyrosine antibody PY72 was labeled with Cy5. For labeling, 10-μl aliquots of 1 m sodium Bicine buffer, pH 9.0, were added to 90 μl of antibody solution in PBS and a 20-fold molar excess of the monofunctional N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester of the chromophores was added from a 10 mm stock solution in N,N-dimethylformamide. Conjugation reactions were allowed to proceed for 40 min in the dark at room temperature. Labeled antibody was separated from free unreacted dye by gel exclusion chromatography using Econo-Pac 10DG columns (Bio-Rad) and concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml using Centricon centrifugal filter devices (Amicon, Bedford, MA). The dye/protein labeling ratio was determined to be ∼5 chromophores per antibody by absorption spectroscopy. Fixed, permeabilized cells were incubated with 3 μg/ml F4-Cy3 and 9 μg/ml PY72-Cy5 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C in a moist chamber. The stained cells were washed five times with PBS and mounted on glass slides in Mowiol (Calbiochem).EGF Receptor Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown to 90% confluence, starved (control), and stimulated with pervanadate or pervanadate and 5 μm AG 1478 as described above before lysation in ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, activated Na3VO4, aproptinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 1 μg/ml each). Protein content was adjusted to 1 mg/ml of total protein by performing a Bradford assay. 4 μg of anti-EGFR antibody was added for each milligram of protein and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on an orbital shaker. Control lysates were incubated with unspecific mouse IgG. The immuncomplex was captured by 30 μl of protein G bead slurry, washed three times in 1:10 diluted lysis buffer, and collected by pulse centrifugation. Beads were resuspendeded in Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C.Immunoblotting—25 μl of the sample solutions were separated electrophoretically on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with 1 μg/ml PY72. Secondary antibodies were linked to horseradish peroxidase and detected by a chemiluminescence/Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For standardization of the EGFR content, membranes were stripped and reprobed with 0.5 μg/μl F4 anti-EGFR antibody. No bands could be seen in the IgG controls in both blots (data not shown).FRET Microscopy—For acceptor photobleaching FRET imaging a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica SP2 (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) was used. All measurements were obtained using a 63×/1.32 NA objective. Simultaneous images with the pinholes set at 2 Airy units were acquired from the donor (Cy3) and the acceptor (Cy5) using 10% of the maximal 554 nm HeNe laser line power for excitation of Cy3 and 15% of the 633 nm laser line power for excitation of Cy5. Detection of fluorescence was in the spectral window of 560–595 nm for Cy3 and 650–700 nm for Cy5. Acceptor photobleaching was performed by irradiation of Cy5 in a region of interest (Zoom = 25) with the 633 nm laser line set at maximum intensity for eight rounds with a line avarage of four. Postbleached donor (Cy3) images were acquired by reverting back to the original acquisition settings. The FRET efficiency image (E) was calculated by normalizing the difference of the donor post- and prebleach intensity by the postbleach intensity according to Bastiaens et al. (15Bastiaens P.I.H. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Söling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar): E = (Ipostbleach - Iprebleach)/Ipostbleach.Control samples labeled with the donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Cy5) alone were used to verify that no bleed-through of acceptor fluorescence was present in the donor channel disturbing the calculation of the FRET efficiency at the used spectral settings. All acquired images were transferred to a NT work station. Image processing was performed using ScionImage beta 4.2 software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Difference images were obtained with IP-Lab version 3.5.5 (Scananalytics, Fairfax, VA).Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)—FLIM sequences were obtained at a modulation frequency of 80 MHz with an Olympus IX 70 microscope (Olympus, Hauppauge, NY) using a 100×/1.4 NA oil immersion objective. The donor (Cy3) was excited by the 514 nm argon laser line. Fluorescence was detected with a dichroic beamsplitter (Q 570 LP; Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) and a narrow-band emission filter (HQ 610/75 Chroma Technology Corp.). The Cy5 images were recorded using a 100-watt mercury arc lamp with a High Q Cy5 filter set (exciter: HQ 620/60, dichroic: Q 660 LP, emitter: HQ 700/75 LP; Chroma Technology Corp.). We analyzed FLIM data by calculating phase and modulation lifetimes as described previously (18Verveer P.J. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I. Biophys.

Microsc. 2001; 202: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation—5 × 106 cells were lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen). After adding 0.2 ml of chloroform and mixing for 3 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 12000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. A second phenol/chloroform extraction was performed, followed by an isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Total RNA samples containing pellets were air-dried and dissolved in water, and purity was determined by gel electrophoresis. Samples were treated with DNase before storage at -80 °C.Reverse Transcription-PCR for EGFR—cDNA was derived by a reverse transcriptase reaction with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo-p(dT)-primers (25 °C 10 min, 42 °C 1 h, 95 °C 5 min, cooling to 4 °C). An EGFR-specific primer pair designed by Tib Molbiol Syntheselabor (Berlin, Germany) was used for amplification in a T-gradient cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany): 5′ TCT CAG CAA CAT GTC GAT GG 3′ and 5′ TCG CAC TTC TTA CAC TTG CG 3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C 2 min, 38 cycles 94 °C 30 s, 66 °C 45 s, 72 °C over 45 s with a final elongation time of 10 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel.Cloning a Standard for EGFR—A RNA standard was cloned from the 479-base pair PCR fragment. In brief, PCR fragments were purified according to the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 50 ng of the purified fragment were incubated with 50 ng of the pDRIVE cloning vector for 10 min. Ligation mix was added. 50 μl of bacteria were co-incubated with 2 μl of plasmid solution in SOC medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 20 mm MgSO4, 20 mm glucose) and heat-shocked (42 °C, 30 s). The transformation mixture was plated on ampicillin containing LB agar dishes for overnight culture. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside negative clones were derived and amplified in 15 ml of medium. Plasmids were isolated with the QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The length of the plasmids were determined by gel electrophoresis, and the sequence was determined (Seqlab, Göttingen, Germany). For in vitro transcription, plasmids were treated with AVRII (2 IU/μg plasmid, 37 °C, 60 min) before incubation with RNA polymerase T7. RNA was purified as described above.Real-time PCR—Kinetic reverse transcription-PCR was performed with a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by using SYBR Green I as a double-strand DNA-specific binding dye. Since the EGFR primer pair used for the cloning step described above showed dimer formation in the melting curve analysis, a different EGFR-specific primer pair coding for a 304-base pair fragment of EGFR-cDNA contained within the region of EGFR used as a 479-base pair standard was used. Primers were designed by Tib Molbiol Syntheselabor: 5′-GAG GAG AAC TGC CAG AAA CTG A-3′ and 5′-CCG TGA TCT GTC ACC ACA TAA TTA C-3′. The following single step reverse transcription-PCR protocol was used for detection: amplification was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl in glass capillaries containing a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, 3.25 μm Mn(Oac)2, 2 μl of Light Cycler RNA Master SYBR Green I (containing Tth Polymerase, 10× Taq buffer, 2 mm concentration of each dNTP, SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 ng of RNA diluted in 2 μl. RT was performed at 50 °C over 20 min. Probes were denaturated at 95 °C over 15 min. Amplification conditions were 95 °C 15 s, 52 °C 20 s, 72 °C over 15 s, 10 s with temperature transition rates of 20 °C/s with acquisition of the intensities at 80 °C. Additionally for control, PCR products were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis.ELISA—Protein levels were measured using an EGFR-ELISA in quadruple (BIOSOURCE International). Assays were performed in duplicate for each measurement using 100 μl per well in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS, and protein was extracted by incubation in cell extraction buffer (BIOSOURCE International) for 30 min at 0 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using a BCA protein assay. Samples used for ELISA contained 5–10 mg/ml protein. Values were read on a Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA) microplate spectrophotometer at 450 nm.Statistics—The data were analyzed for statistical significance with the Student's t test using the software package SPSS™ (Chicago, IL). p values of <0.05 were considered significant. In the box blots used for graphical data representation a box is drawn around the interquartile range. A line inside the box indicates the median value. Error bars are drawn at the 5% and the 95% confidence intervals.RESULTSDetection of the co-occurrence of a specific Cy3-tagged anti-EGFR antibody and a generic Cy5-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody on EGFR by FRET allows a highly specific quantification of EGFR phosphorylation in cells. Here, EGFR phosphorylation was imaged by this two-antibody FRET approach (20Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S. Mellor H. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using acceptor photobleaching (15Bastiaens P.I.H. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Söling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). FRET in the prebleach images quenches the fluorescence intensity, which can be visualized by photobleaching the acceptor. It was first determined whether FRET can take place between the two chromophore-tagged antibodies bound to phosphorylated receptor. For this, unstimulated SW-480 cells were incubated with both antibodies after fixation and permeabilization. The data from a typical FRET experiment are shown in Fig. 1. The initial anti-EGFR-Cy3 image (Fig. 1a) represents the fluorescence of the donor in the precence of the acceptor Cy5. The Cy3 fluorescence distribution shows a partial co-localization with that of Cy5-antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1b). After complete photobleaching of the acceptor, a second image was taken in both channels. Fig. 1d shows the bleached region in the acceptor Cy5 image, and Fig. 1c shows the resulting Cy3 fluorescence. The difference in intensity of the donor is shown in Fig. 1e. Increased donor fluorescence after photobleaching of the acceptor Cy5 indicates that the fluorescence of anti-EGFR-Cy3 was indeed quenched by FRET. We also used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (16Bastiaens P.I.H. Squire A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 17Verveer P.J. Wouters F.S. Reynolds A.R. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2000; 290: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) to measure the decrease in Cy3 lifetime as an independent confirmation that FRET took place between the chromophores in HT-29 cells. An increase in fluorescence lifetime of Cy3 after photobleaching the acceptor Cy5 shows that FRET took place between the chromophores. Cy3 fluorescence increased due to a loss of FRET after photobleaching (Fig. 2 showing the false color phase lifetime images and the wide field fluorescence images). Using this optical assay we now characterized and compared EGFR phosphorylation in different colorectal cell lines. Experiments were carried out in HT-29, WiDr, Colo 320, SW-480, and Caco-2 cells. To determine the degree of autonomous EGFR autophosphorylation in these tumor cells lines, all cells were serum-starved for 24 h before imaging experiments. The cell lines showed a significantly different pattern of autonomous phosphorylation (Fig. 3a). WiDr cells and HT-29 cells maintained high levels of phosphorylation with FRET efficiencies of over 50%. Caco-2 cells showed FRET efficiencies close to 30%. SW-480 and Colo 320 cells showed a low residual phosphorylation with FRET efficiencies of 10% and 20%, respectively.Fig. 2Determination of EGFR phosphorylation in HT-29 cells by FRET-FLIM.

Therefore, maximal FRET efficiency after treatment with pervanadate corresponds to 100% EGFR phosphorylation, which can be used to calibrate the assay. Cells with low levels of autonomous autophosphorylation responded well to pervanadate treatment with the highest increase in FRET efficiency in relation to the basal activity in Caco-2 and SW-480 cells. Colo 320 and HT-29 cells showed a lesser increase, and no significant increase could be found for the WiDr cells that exhibited the highest autonomous EGFR phosphorylation.Since aggregating of labeled antibody might also contribute unspecific signal to the total FRET efficiency, we tested whether blocking of the epitope would attenuate the FRET signal. SW-480 cells were grown on coverslips, starved, and treated with pervanadate before fixation and permeabilization. Cells were incubated with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled F4 or PY 72 antibody at 30 and 90 μg/ml, respectively, before staining was performed with Cy3-F4 and Cy5-PY72. No FRET could be found in these cells. Specific PY-72-Cy5 staining of pervanadate stimulated SW-480 cells was also lacking by preincubation of the labeled antibodies with a 10-molar excess of phosphotyrosine-albumin for 60 min at room temperature. The Cy3-F4 staining remained unchanged. Again, no FRET could be detected in these samples. In all cell lines, FRET efficiencies dropped to zero when cells were incubated for 180 min with the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor AG 1478 ad 5 μm prior to stimulation with pervanadate. Immunoblots against phosphotyrosine using the PY72 antibody of immunoprecipitated EGFR showed concordance with the optical assays in that a high level of basal phosphorylation was found for WiDr cells, which could not be stimulated further by pervanadate, and a low basal phosphorylation was found for SW-480 cells with weak bands only appearing at long exposure times. In SW-480 cells phosphorylation increased in a time-dependent manner after stimulation with EGF (Fig. 3b). Pervanadate treatment gave the highest phosphorylation levels on blot in agreement with the FRET experiments. EGFR phosphorylation in response to the ligand EGF was also followed over time in all cell lines. Here again, cells with a lower level of autonomous autophosphorylation that had responded to pervanadate (Colo 320, HT-29, and SW-480 cells) showed a significant increase in FRET efficiency after EGF stimulation. Caco-2 cells showed a delayed response to EGF stimulation with a marginal increase in FRET efficiency after 10 min. WiDr cells, which had shown the highest autonomous EGFR phosphorylation level after serum starvation, did not further respond to EGF. In SW-480 cells, the phosphorylation response after EGF was lower than after pervanadate treatment as shown by both the FRET experiments (Fig. 3a) and immunoblotting (Fig. 3b). EGFR immunofluorescence images showed that these cells had a particular high level of intracellular EGFR localized to endomembranes that can be phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibition with pervanadate but not by extracellular EGF. Taken together, these results show that cell lines that exhibit a high degree of autonomous phosphorylation cannot be stimulated further.The same optical FRET assay was used to determine EGFR phosphorylation levels in human tissue samples (Fig. 4, a and b). Since in fixed tissues the FRET efficiency cannot be calibrated by pervanadate treatment, FRET signals in tissue sections from human colon tumor samples were compared with tissue samples taken from the mucosa of tumor-free resection margins (Fig. 4c). Significantly higher FRET efficiency was found in sections of tumor tissues as compa"
https://openalex.org/W2171914747,"<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a major human pathogen. Pathogenic effects are largely due to production of bacterial toxins, whose synthesis is controlled by an mRNA molecule termed RNAIII. The <i>S. aureus</i> protein called RAP (RNAIII-activating protein) is secreted and activates RNAIII production by inducing the phosphorylation of its target protein TRAP (target of RAP). Antibodies to TRAP have been shown to suppress exotoxin production by <i>S. aureus in vitro</i>, suggesting that TRAP may be a useful vaccine target site. Here we showed that a peptide TA21 was identified by screening a phage display library using anti-TRAP antibodies. Mice vaccinated with <i>Escherichia coli</i> engineered to express TA21 on their surface (FTA21) were protected from <i>S. aureus</i> infections, using sepsis and cellulitis mice models. By sequence analysis, it was found that the TA21 is highly homologous to the C-terminal sequence of TRAP which is conserved among <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, suggesting that peptide TA21 may be a useful broad vaccine to protect from infection caused by various staphylococcal strains."

The targeting signal of the P2Y2 receptor is located between the N terminus and 7TM, whereas that of the P2Y4 receptor is present in its C-terminal tail. To identify the apical targeting signal in the P2Y2 receptor, regions of the P2Y2 receptor were progressively substituted with the corresponding regions of the P2Y4 receptor lacking its targeting signal. Characterization of these chimeras and subsequent mutational analysis revealed that four amino acids (Arg95, Gly96, Asp97, and Leu108) in the first extracellular loop play a major role in apical targeting of the P2Y2 receptor. Mutation of RGD to RGE had no effect on P2Y2 receptor targeting, indicating that receptor-integrin interactions are not involved in apical targeting.

P2Y2 receptor mutants were localized in a similar manner in Caco-2 colon epithelial cells. This is the first identification of an extracellular protein-based targeting signal in a seven-transmembrane receptor. Extracellular nucleotides play an important role in a broad range of physiological and pathophysiological processes through two classes of receptors, the ligand-gated P2X receptors and the G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (1Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson J.G.J. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Publishers, London1998: 187-206Google Scholar, 2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). To date, pharmacological characterization and molecular cloning have identified seven P2X receptors (P2X1–7) and eight P2Y receptor subtypes (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14). The P2Y receptors can be divided into two main subfamilies based on sequence identity and phylogenetic considerations: the P2Y1 receptor subfamily, which is comprised of P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors, and the P2Y12 receptor subfamily, comprising P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14 receptors. The P2Y1 receptor subfamily is coupled to activation of phospholipase C, generation of inositol phosphates, activation of protein kinase C, and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In addition to coupling to activation of phospholipase C, the P2Y11 receptor is also coupled to Gs, thereby activating adenylyl cyclase (3Torres B. Zambon A.C. Insel P.A. J. Biol.

Although P2Y receptors mediate a multitude of cellular responses throughout the body, one of their main functions is to regulate ion transport in polarized epithelial cells. Proteins in polarized epithelial cells can be expressed predominantly at either the apical or basolateral membrane surface, or they can be indiscriminatingly distributed to both membranes. The proper targeting of proteins to their respective membrane surface is critical in host defense, nutrient absorption, ion transport, and signal transduction. However, the mechanism(s) by which epithelial cells target proteins to a particular membrane surface remains a critical question in epithelial cell biology. Alterations in the trafficking and targeting of proteins are often associated with diseases (9Altschuler Y. Hodson C. Milgram S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Koivisto U.M. Hubbard A.L. Mellman I.

For example, cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disease of the epithelia, is caused primarily by mutations that prevent expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator at the plasma membrane (12Kerem B.

This defect in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator trafficking results in decreased Cl- transport and water secretion, increased Na+ absorption, and thickening of the mucous layer. The impairments caused by defective trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator can be alleviated acutely by activation of the P2Y2 receptor (15Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1997Google Scholar, 16Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M. Boucher R.C. J. Gen.

The P2Y2 receptor is expressed in airway epithelial cells, and activation of this receptor from the apical surface increases Cl- secretion and H2O efflux through a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-independent mechanism (17Knowles M.R. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), while at the same time decreasing Na+ absorption by inhibiting epithelial sodium channels (18Mall M. Wissner A. Gonska T. Calenborn D. Kuehr J. Brandis M. Kunzelmann K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, P2Y2 receptor activation increases mucous secretion and ciliary beat frequency (19Bennett W.D. Olivier K.N. Zeman K.L. Hohneker K.W. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 1796-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the P2Y2 receptor facilitates mucociliary clearance and is an important therapeutic target for treatment of cystic fibrosis and other diseases of epithelia (20Yerxa B.R. Sabater J.R. Davis C.W. Stutts M.J. Lang-Furr M. Picher M. Jones A.C. Cowlen M. Dougherty R. Boyer J. Abraham W.M. Boucher R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated by confocal microscopy that the P2Y2 receptor is targeted to the apical membrane in epithelial cells of multiple lineages (21Wolff S.C. Qi A.D. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C624-C632Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and this localization is consistent with pharmacological studies of the receptor in epithelial cell lines (22Cressman V.L.

Proteins are targeted to a particular membrane surface because they contain a signal within their primary sequence that is recognized by the cell. To reveal the location of the apical sorting signal of the P2Y2 receptor, we utilized a chimeric receptor approach with the P2Y4 receptor, which shares high sequence identity with the P2Y2 receptor but achieves apical targeting by harboring an apical signal in its C-terminal tail. We show here that the apical targeting signal in the P2Y2 receptor resides in its first extracellular loop and that four amino acids within this loop play a major role in directing apical targeting. This is the first report of an extracellular protein domain involved in apical targeting. Construction of Chimeric and Mutant P2Y2 and P2Y4 Receptor cDNAs—Chimeric and mutant receptor cDNA constructs were generated by overlap extension PCR (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers that incorporated an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end and a XhoI site at the 3′-end of the coding sequence. Truncated P2Y receptor constructs were generated by PCR with the same 5′ primers described above and 3′ primers that engineered a stop codon directly after the truncation site, followed by a XhoI site for cloning into pLXSN. P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors were truncated at Arg315 and Tyr313, respectively. For the BK2 receptor fusions, Phe316 of the P2Y2 receptor and Asp311 of the P2Y4 receptor were fused after Arg313 of the BK2 receptor. All receptor constructs were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into similarly digested pLXSN retroviral expression vectors. In addition, each of the cloned receptors harbored an HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; 7TM, seven transmembrane; BK2, bradykinin 2 receptor; EL1 and EL2, 1st and 2nd extracellular loop respectively; P2Y2-ΔCT, the P2Y2 receptor missing its C-terminal tail; P2Y4-ΔCT, the P2Y4 receptor missing its C-terminal tail; PDZ, postsynaptic density protein of 95-kDa disc large-zona occludens; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. -epitope tag (YPYDVPDY) following the initiating methionine residue. Previous studies have shown that the presence of an HA epitope at the N terminus of the P2Y2 receptor has no effect on its function (25Sromek S.M. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression of Receptor Constructs in MDCK(II), 1321N1, and Caco-2 Cells—MDCK(II) (ATCC, Rockville, Maryland) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) medium, Caco-2 cells in Earle's minimal essential medium with non-essential amino acids, and 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose medium. The culture medium was supplemented with either 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Gaithersburg, MD) for MDCK and 1321N1 cells or 20% fetal bovine serum for Caco-2 cells. Recombinant retrovirus particles were produced by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of PA317 cells with the pLXSN vector containing the various receptor constructs, and the resultant viral particles were used to infect both MDCK(II) and 1321N1 cells (26Comstock K.E. Watson N.F. Olsen J.C. Tuan R. Methods in Molecular Biology: Recombinant Gene Expression Protocols. 62. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 207-222Google Scholar). Geneticin-resistant cells were selected after 7–10 days with 0.6 mg ml-1 G418 and maintained in medium containing 0.4 mg ml-1 active G-418. Confocal Microscopy—MDCK(II) and Caco-2 cells stably expressing HA-tagged receptor constructs were seeded in 12-mm polyester Transwell inserts (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) and allowed to polarize for 7 days with daily medium changes. Cell monolayers were then washed with cold PBS2+ (containing 2 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+), fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, and then permeabilized with -20 °C methanol for 1 min. Receptors were labeled with the anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance, Berkeley, CA) and the tight-junction protein complex was labeled with anti-ZO-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS2+ and labeled with goat anti-mouse A-488 (HA epitope) and goat anti-rabbit A-594 (ZO-1) secondary fluorescent antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Following three more washes with cold PBS2+, the Transwell filters containing the labeled and fixed monolayers were excised and mounted on glass microscope slides with Slowfade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 300 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Melville, NY) configured with an IX70 Fluorescence microscope fitted with a PlanApo ×60 oil objective. Two different views, an XY scan horizontal to the cell monolayer and an XZ scan vertical to the cell monolayer, were collected of all labeled monolayers to determine the steady-state localization of the receptor constructs. Representative results are shown for each construct. Quantification of Cell Surface Expression of HA-tagged P2Y Receptors—MDCK(II) cells stably expressing HA-tagged P2Y receptors were seeded in duplicate in 24-mm Transwell inserts and allowed to polarize as described above. Monolayers were placed on ice and kept at 4 °C for the duration of the experiment. Cells were washed with cold PBS2+ three times for 5 min each, and then labeled with 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in cold PBS2+ buffer, pH 8, for 40 min. The biotin solution was removed and the reaction quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS2+ for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS2+ and then incubated for 5 min with 0.7 ml of Tris-Triton buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were passed 7–10 times through a 25-gauge needle and then incubated for 1.5 h with rocking. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant incubated with 50 ml of immobilized Neutravidin (Pierce) for 1.5 h. The resin was washed twice with Tris-Triton buffer and biotin-labeled proteins were eluted from the Neutravidin resin by incubating with 35 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 37 °C. The dithiothreitol cleaves the disulfide bond within the biotin spacer and releases the proteins from Neutravidin under mild conditions. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred overnight to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS2+ for 1 h, then incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (3F10; Roche Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The blots were developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and the resulting bands were imaged on a Bio-Rad Flour-S system and quantitated with Bio-Rad QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). The % distribution values (based on the total protein expressed at the cell surface equaling 100%) reported in the text and figures represent the average of three independent experiments. The standard errors were <5% of the mean. Radioimmunoassay for Detection of HA-tagged Receptors—1321N1 cells stably expressing HA-tagged P2Y2/P2Y4 chimeras were seeded at 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. The expression of receptor chimeras was quantitated on confluent cells (∼3 days after passage) essentially as described previously (48Brinson A.E. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11939-11948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, after which they were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm each of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS2+) and blocked with bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone HA.11; Covance Research Products, Denver, PA). Cells were washed twice with HBSS2+, followed by addition of 125I-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody (typically 105 cpm/well). After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with HBSS2+. Cells were then solubilized overnight with 1 m NaOH and transferred to glass tubes for quantitation of radioactivity by γ-counting. Intracellular [Ca2+] Measurements—Agonist-promoted increases in intracellular [Ca2+] were quantified under constant superfusion in 1321N1 cells stably expressing HA-tagged P2Y2/P2Y4 chimeras as described previously (27Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar). UTP (100 μm) was applied for 30 s in the superfusate (1.4 ml/min) and increases in intracellular [Ca2+] were measured in 6–13 individual cells per coverslip. To avoid receptor desensitization, each coverslip was challenged with UTP only once. The average responses from 6 to 13 cells per coverslip were measured from three coverslips. Data were recorded and processed using an InCyt IM2 digital imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Assay of Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the P2Y2 receptor constructs were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and assayed 3 days later when confluent. Inositol lipids were radiolabeled by incubating the cells with 200 μl of serum-free, inositol-free DMEM containing 0.4 mCi of myo-[3H]inositol. UTP was added at 5× concentration in 50 ml of 50 mm LiCl, 250 mm HEPES, pH 7.25. Following a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the medium was aspirated and the reaction was terminated by adding 0.75 ml boiling EDTA, pH 8.0. [3H]Inositol phosphates were resolved on Dowex AG1-X8 columns as described (5Qi A.D. Kennedy C. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Role of the C-terminal Tail in the Apical Targeting of P2Y2 and P2Y4 Receptors—We have shown previously that the P2Y2 receptor, when expressed in MDCK(II) epithelial cells, is located exclusively at the apical membrane at steady state (21Wolff S.C. Qi A.D. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C624-C632Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To determine the location of the signal that directs apical targeting, we first examined the targeting of the P2Y2 receptor missing its C-terminal tail and the B2-bradykinin receptor in which its C-terminal tail was replaced by the C-tail of the P2Y2 receptor. We focused on the C-terminal tail because several 7TM receptors, including rhodopsin (28Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), three peptide hormone receptors (thyroid stimulating hormone, leutinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors) (29Beau I.

Nicholas, manuscript in preparation. achieve polarized expression because of sequences within their C-terminal tails. As shown in Fig. 1A, both the full-length P2Y2 receptor and the receptor missing its C-tail (P2Y2-ΔCT) were expressed exclusively at the apical membrane of MDCK(II) cells. Moreover, replacement of the C-terminal tail of the B2-bradykinin (BK2) receptor, which is unsorted in MDCK(II) cells, with the C-terminal tail of the P2Y2 receptor had no effect on targeting (Fig. 1B). These data, which were confirmed in biotinylation experiments (Fig. 1C), demonstrated that the P2Y2 receptor contains an apical targeting signal within the region comprising the N terminus through TM7. The P2Y4 receptor, which has the highest sequence identity to the P2Y2 receptor of all the members in the P2Y receptor family, is also expressed at the apical membrane of MDCK(II) cells (21Wolff S.C. Qi A.D. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C624-C632Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the P2Y2 receptor, however, the P2Y4 receptor missing its C-terminal tail (P2Y4-ΔCT) was unsorted, whereas the BK2 receptor containing the C-terminal tail of the P2Y4 receptor was expressed at the apical membrane (Fig. 1, A and B). Importantly, the BK2 receptor missing its C-terminal tail was unsorted (data not shown), confirming that the apical location of the BK2-P2Y4 CT receptor was due to the addition of the P2Y4 C-terminal tail and not to the uncovering of a cryptic apical signal in the BK2 receptor missing its C-terminal tail. The localization of these receptors identified by confocal microscopy was also verified by biotinylation (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the P2Y4 receptor, although highly homologous to the P2Y2 receptor, achieves apical targeting by a different mechanism, by having an apical targeting signal in its C-terminal tail. A more in depth characterization of the P2Y4 receptor apical targeting signal will be reported in a separate study. Characterization of P2Y2/P2Y4-ΔCT Receptor Chimeras—The results described above suggested that P2Y2/P2Y4 receptor chimeras, in which the apical signal within the C-tail of the P2Y4 receptor was removed, would allow us to define the location of the apical targeting signal within the P2Y2 receptor. P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors have 52% sequence identity overall, which increases to 63% when comparing sequences between TM1 through TM7. Thus, we generated a series of chimeras starting with the P2Y2 receptor and progressively containing increasing amounts of P2Y4-ΔCT sequence at the C terminus (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that the general location of the apical targeting signal in the P2Y2 receptor would be revealed when the region of the P2Y2 receptor containing the signal was replaced with the corresponding P2Y4 receptor sequence. To exclude the possibility that these chimeric receptors might be non-functional and therefore show aberrant targeting, we expressed the P2Y2/P2Y4-ΔCT receptor chimeras in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells and measured intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to 100 μm UTP, a common agonist of the two receptors. 1321N1 cells were utilized for this purpose as they do not endogenously express Gq-coupled P2Y receptors, whereas MDCK(II) cells express canine homologues of P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y11 receptors that would complicate functional analysis (32Insel P.A. Ostrom R.S. Zambon A.C. Hughes R.J. Balboa M.A. Shehnaz D. Gregorian C. Torres B. Firestein B.L. Xing M. Post S.R. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, each of the five receptor chimeras mobilized intracellular Ca2+, although the responses promoted by the last two chimeras (4 and 5) were considerably lower than those promoted by chimeras 1–3. The lower responses of chimeras 4 and 5 were due at least in part to a decrease in cell surface expression, as a cell surface radioimmunoassay revealed that these constructs were expressed at 20–40% of the levels of the other chimeras (Fig. 2A, inset). Taken together, these data demonstrate that each of the receptor chimera constructs was functional. The first three P2Y2/P2Y4-ΔCT receptor chimeras, which contain the least amount of P2Y4 receptor sequence, were localized to the apical membrane of MDCK(II) cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, intense staining for two of these constructs (chimeras 1 and 2) was observed just below the apical membrane. In contrast to chimeras 1–3, apical targeting was lost when the additional P2Y2 receptor sequence from the 1st extracellular loop (EL1) through TM3 was replaced with the corresponding sequence from the P2Y4 receptor (chimera 4), suggesting that the apical targeting signal of the P2Y2 receptor is located within this region (Fig. 2B). A similar loss of targeting was observed in chimera 5, which also contains the EL1—TM3 sequence from the P2Y4 receptor. Chimeras 4 and 5 also showed a considerable amount of diffuse staining underneath the membrane surface. Identification of the Amino Acids in the P2Y2 Receptor Involved in Apical Targeting—There are nine amino acid differences in EL1 and TM3 between the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptor, seven of which are located within EL1 (Fig. 3A). To determine which of these amino acids are critical for apical targeting, we mutated the full-length P2Y2 receptor, three amino acids at a time, to the corresponding residues of the P2Y4 receptor. The mutant receptors (Arg95-Gly96-Asp97 → AHN, Ser102-Val104-Leu105 → GEI, and Leu108-Thr115-Ile121 → FWV) were expressed in MDCK(II) cells and their steady-state localization was determined (Fig. 3B). Both the RGD and LTI triple mutant receptors were unsorted, with nearly 40% of the receptors expressed on the basolateral surface (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the SVL triple mutant receptor was still mostly expressed at the apical membrane, with only very light staining in the lateral membranes below the tight junctions, suggesting that these three amino acids play a very minor role in targeting (Fig. 3B). Further elaboration of the two triple mutant receptors was accomplished by making six individual mutations in the full-length P2Y2 receptor, again to the corresponding residue in the P2Y4 receptor. As shown in Fig. 3C, mutation of Arg95, Gly96, Asp97, or Leu108 resulted in an unsorted phenotype, with 30–36% of the receptors localized to the basolateral surface, whereas mutation of Ile121 (14% basolateral) and Thr115 (6% basolateral) had little to no effect on targeting. Taken together, these data identify four amino acids that play a critical role in apical targeting of the P2Y2 receptor. The Role of Integrins in Apical Targeting of the P2Y2 Receptor—The RGD triad is a well known integrin-binding motif (33Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), and the αVβ3 integrin has been reported to interact with the RGD motif of the human P2Y2 receptor and to modify its signaling properties (34Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, mutation of any one of the three residues in the RGD motif of the P2Y2 receptor generated an unsorted phenotype. Thus, it was possible that interaction with integrins through the RGD motif of the P2Y2 receptor is responsible for apical targeting. To test this possibility, we constructed two mutations in the full-length human P2Y2 receptor that disrupted the RGD integrin-binding motif: RGD → QGD which is the sequence of the rat P2Y2 receptor in this region, and RGD → RGE. When expressed in MDCK(II) cells, both the QGD and RGE mutant P2Y2 receptors targeted exclusively to the apical membrane (Fig. 4). These data provide compelling evidence that intergrins are not involved in apical targeting of the P2Y2 receptor. Targeting of P2Y2 Receptor Mutants in Human Caco-2 Epithelial Cells—We showed previously that the Gq-coupled P2Y receptors, including the P2Y2 receptor, are targeted in a similar fashion in MDCK and Caco-2 epithelial cells (21Wolff S.C. Qi A.D. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C624-C632Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To confirm that the amino acids involved in targeting of the P2Y2 receptor function in an identical manner in other epithelial cells, we expressed in Caco-2 cells the wild-type P2Y2 receptor and the four mutants (R95A, G96H, D97N, and L108F) that disrupt targeting in MDCK cells (Fig. 3C), and examined their steadystate distribution by confocal microscopy. As in MDCK cells, the wild-type P2Y2 receptor in Caco-2 cells"

Rad51 and RecA share a core ATPase domain that is structurally similar to the ATPase domains of helicases and the F1 ATPase. Rad51 has an additional N-terminal domain, whereas RecA protein has an additional C-terminal domain. Here we show that glycine 103 in the N-terminal domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 is important for binding to single-stranded and duplex DNA. The Rad51-G103E mutant protein is deficient in DNA strand exchange and ATPase activity due to a primary DNA binding defect. The N-terminal domain of Rad51 is connected to the ATPase core through an extended elbow linker that ensures flexibility of the N-terminal domain. Molecular modeling of the Rad51-G103E mutant protein shows that the negatively charged glutamate residue lies on the surface of the N-terminal domain facing a positively charged patch composed of Arg-260, His-302, and Lys-305 on the ATPase core domain. A possible structural explanation for the DNA binding defect is that a charge interaction between Glu-103 and the positive patch restricts the flexibility of the N-terminal domain. Rad51-G103E was identified in a screen for Rad51 interaction-deficient mutants and was shown to ablate the Rad54 interaction in two-hybrid assays (Krejci, L., Damborsky, J., Thomsen, B., Duno, M., and Bendixen, C. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 966–976). Surprisingly, we found that the physical interaction of Rad51-G103E with Rad54 was not affected.

Our data suggest that the two-hybrid interaction defect was an indirect consequence of the DNA binding defect. The DNA within our cells is constantly exposed to DNA-damaging agents, such as ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation (from natural radiation sources or diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures), environmental chemicals, free radicals generated by cellular metabolism, and mechanical stress on chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). These agents can induce different kinds of DNA damage. One of the most detrimental DNA damages is DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-stranded break; HR, homologous recombination; SSA, single-strand annealing; EM, electron microscope; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; nt, nucleotide(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); RPA, replication protein A; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-stranded break; HR, homologous recombination; SSA, single-strand annealing; EM, electron microscope; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; nt, nucleotide(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); RPA, replication protein A; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. which threaten chromosomal integrity and genetic stability. Failure to accurately repair DSBs may result in chromosomal aberrations, which can lead to cell death (apoptosis) or uncontrolled cell growth (cancer) in mammalian cells (2Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, 3Norbury C.J. Zhivotovsky B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2797-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Several pathways have evolved to repair DSBs to maintain the stability and integrity of the genome: homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining, and single-strand annealing (SSA). Only the HR pathway is inherently error-free, whereas the other pathways often involve sequence changes at the DSB junction (4Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The RAD52 epistasis group genes encode the core of the HR pathway (4Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol.

After DSB formation redundant pathways involving Exo1, Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2, and possibly other factors process the break to generate 3′-OH ssDNA tails. Rad51, Rad52, Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer, and the eukaryotic ssDNAbinding protein complex replication protein A (RPA) cooperate to form the Rad51 pre-synaptic filament on the ssDNA tails. Rad51 filaments recognize homologous dsDNA and perform DNA strand exchange, which are the central steps in HR. Rad54 augments the activities of Rad51 in joint molecule formation and heteroduplex DNA extension (branch migration) in vitro. Genetic and biochemical data show that the Rad51 and Rad54 proteins are key components in recombinational DNA repair since mutants in either gene exhibit an extreme sensitivity to DSBs. In chicken and mammalian cell lines, disruption of Rad51 is lethal (7Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 8Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K.

Its central ATPase domain (core domain) is highly conserved both in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure from E. coli to higher eukaryotes. The N terminus of Rad51 contains a portion that is conserved in Archaea and eukaryotes but is absent from bacterial RecA proteins (10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front.

RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 function in HR by forming nucleo-protein filaments on DNA that are active in homology search and DNA strand exchange. In the absence of DNA and nucleotides, RecA forms either ring structures (15Yu X. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct.

The flexibility of the N-terminal domain may be critical for Rad51 function. Rad54 protein is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-stimulated/dependent ATPases and is conserved in all eukaryotes investigated (31Tan T.L.R. Kanaar R. Wyman C. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis provides energy for its topological activity on duplex DNA, which is consistent with Rad54 protein tracking along dsDNA (31Tan T.L.R. Kanaar R. Wyman C. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to account for the stimulation of Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange by Rad54 protein, including chromatin remodeling, Rad51 filament formation/stabilization, synapsis, and post-synapsis (31Tan T.L.R. Kanaar R. Wyman C. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Rad54 protein displays chromatin remodeling activities (32Alexeev A. Mazin A.

Rad54 specifically dissociates Rad51 protein from duplex DNA and may have a role in the turnover of Rad51 filaments stuck on the heteroduplex DNA product formed during HR (39Solinger J.A.

Common to all models is the notion of specific Rad51-Rad54 protein interactions, when Rad51 is bound to ssDNA and/or dsDNA. Interestingly, Rad54 homologs only exist in eukaryotes and possibly some Archaea but not in bacteria. Rad51 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with DNA, itself, Rad52, Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer, RPA, Rad54, and with Brca2 in humans (6Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 41Pellegrini L. Venkitaraman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 310-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The protein interaction surface on Rad51 may be shared by several proteins, and the interface exchange may control transitions between major events in HR (42Shin D.S. Chahwan C. Huffman J.L. Tainer J.A. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interaction between the Rad51 and Rad54 proteins has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (43Jiang H. Xie Y.Q.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In vitro, Rad54 assists Rad51-mediated recombination by interacting with Rad51 filaments, stimulating the pairing between the nucleo-protein filaments and dsDNA, enhancing the homology search (35Mazin A.V.

Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Rad54 ATPase activity is specifically stimulated by Rad51 protein bound to dsDNA (40Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46205-46215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Rad51 interaction surface is mainly limited to the N-terminal region of yeast and human Rad54 protein (43Jiang H. Xie Y.Q. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33181-33186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 44Golub E.I. Kovalenko O.V. Gupta R.C. Ward D.C. Radding C.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51973-51980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Rad54 interaction surface on Rad51 protein is complex and may be involved in multiple protein interactions, including the Rad51 self-interaction and the interaction of human Rad51 with the tumor suppressor protein Brca2 (48Pellegrini L. Yu D.S. Lo T. Anand S. Lee M. Blundell T.L. Venkitaraman A.R. Nature. 2002; 420: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 49Jasin M.

It has been proposed that consecutive protein interactions involving common and overlapping interfaces are critical for the functioning of multistep DNA repair pathways (51Wilson S.H. Kunkel T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 52Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 53Hosfield D.J. Daniels D.S. Mol C.D. Putnam C.D. Parikh S.S. Tainer J.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 315-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that the Rad51 interaction surface controls multiple, probably mutually exclusive protein interactions that are critical for HR (42Shin D.S. Chahwan C. Huffman J.L. Tainer J.A. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, two-hybrid assays have identified several point mutations in RAD51, including rad51-G103E, which ablate the Rad51-Rad54 two-hybrid interaction (54Krejci L. Damborsky J. Thomsen B. Duno M. Bendixen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular deficit of the interaction defect has not been elucidated. Here we have reconstructed the rad51-G103E mutant, overexpressed the protein in budding yeast cells, and purified the Rad51-G103E protein to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1). Biochemical analysis showed that Rad51-G103E is defective in DNA strand exchange, exhibiting very low ATPase activity due to a general DNA binding defect. Contrary to the expectation from the two-hybrid analysis, the physical interaction of the mutant protein with wild type Rad54 in solution was unaffected. Our data and structural modeling suggest that the flexibility of the N-terminal domain of Rad51 protein is important for DNA binding. The two-hybrid interaction defect with Rad54 appears to be an indirect consequence of the inherent DNA binding defect. Yeast Media, Strains, and Plasmids—Standard yeast media were used for cell growth. S. cerevisiae WDHY1930, a rad51 deletion mutant (his3-Δ1 leu2-3,112 trp1 ura3-52 pep4-3 rad51-Δ::KanMX), was created by using pFA-KanMX6 to replace the RAD51 open reading frame from amino acids 5–394 by the KAN resistance marker and used as a host for overexpression of wild type and mutant Rad51 proteins (55Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A Rad51-G103E-expressing plasmid was generated by in vitro mutagenesis of plasmid pR51.3 (kind gift of Patrick Sung, Yale University (56Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar)), in which the constitutive phosphoglycerol kinase promoter controls the expression of the wild type RAD51 gene. Mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with the forward primer, 5′-CTAAGGGAGAGTGAGCTTCACACTGCTGAAGCGG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-CCGCTTCAGCAGTGTGAAGCTCACTCTCCCTTAG-3′. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Overexpression and Purification—S. cerevisiae GST-Rad54 and RPA were purified as described previously (36Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.-D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The wild type Rad51 protein was purified as described (57New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The Rad51-G103E protein was purified from 116 g of yeast cells obtained from 33 liters of culture. The cells were lysed in 100 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 0.5 m KCl and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine). The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a G-Sepharose column (equilibrated with buffer A with 0.5 m KCl) and washed with buffer A with 1 m KCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the flow-through to 40% and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. The Rad51-G103E protein was sedimented by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1.5 h. The pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of buffer P (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 50 mm KCl. The sample was loaded onto a Cibacron blue column equilibrated with buffer P containing 200 mm KCl and eluted with buffer P containing 1 m KCl. Rad51-G103E was in the flow-through fraction from the Cibacron blue column and dialyzed against buffer H (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm KCl) and loaded on a Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite (HAP, Bio-Rad) column. The HAP column was washed with buffer H containing 20 mm phosphate, and proteins were eluted with buffer H containing a stepped phosphate gradient (20–200-500 mm). The fractions containing Rad51 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 100 mm KCl before loading onto a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) Mono Q column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences, equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl). The column was washed with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and eluted with buffer A containing a 100–600 mm KCl gradient. The Rad51-containing fractions were dialyzed against Rad51 storage buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 100 mm KCl) and kept at –80 °C. DNA Substrates—RFI ϕX174 and single-stranded poly(dA) were used for the wild type Rad51 and Rad51-G103E ATPase assay. Linearized ϕX174 dsDNA and short ssDNA (621 nt) were used for DNA binding analysis of the Rad51 proteins. Linearization and labeling of RFI ϕX174 DNA was performed as described (36Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.-D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The 621-nt linear ssDNA fragment was synthesized by run-off PCR from a PstI-linearized ϕX174 DNA template in 40 cycles of non-exponential Taq polymerase extension from a single primer (5′-GTC TTC ATT TCC ATG CGG TG-3′). Fragments were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and radiolabeled to high specific activity using T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase. The activity of radiolabeled DNA substrate was adjusted by spiking to 10,000–20,000 cpm per reaction with a known molar amount of unlabeled DNA substrate. DNA concentrations are expressed in mol of nt for ssDNA and mol of bp for dsDNA. ATPase Activity—A charcoal-based ATPase assay was used as described (36Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.-D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction buffer contained 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 13 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 90 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μm Rad51/Rad51-G103E. DNA concentration was varied as indicated. A 50-μl reaction system contained 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was started by transferring the sample tubes from ice to a 30 °C water bath and incubated for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of Norite charcoal solution, which contained 5% Norite charcoal (Sigma, C-5260) and 50 mm KH2PO4. The samples were kept on ice for 5 min, vortexed once during the incubation. Then the samples were centrifuged at maximum speed using an Eppendorf bench top centrifuge, and 0.4 ml of the supernatant was thoroughly mixed with 4 ml of Aquasol. The free γ-32P from [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis was counted on a Beckman LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter. The ATPase activity was expressed as the ratio of radioactivity in free phosphate relative to the total radioactivity added in the sample. DNA Strand Exchange Assay—The DNA s"
