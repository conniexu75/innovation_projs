https://openalex.org/W2038952882,Alcohol dehydrogenase allodimers composed of an unstable active subunit and a stable but inactive subunit are both active and stable. The implication of this finding for the problem of heterosis is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2055428840,"Two identified interneurons in each buccal ganglion of Aplysia can mediate conjoined excitation and inhibition to a single follower cell. A single presynaptic action potential in one of these interneurons produces a diphasic, depolarizing-hyperpolarizing synaptic potential apparently as a result of a single transmitter acting on two types of postsynaptic receptors in the follower cell. These receptors produce synaptic potentials with differing reversal potentials, ionic conductances, time courses, rates of decrement with repetition, pharmacological properties, and functional consequences. The excitatory receptor controls a sodium conductance, the inhibitory receptor controls a chloride conductance. Both components of the synaptic potentials can be produced by iontophoretic application of acetylcholine on the cell body of the follower cell, and each component is differentially sensitive to different cholinergic blocking agents."
https://openalex.org/W1991801386,"Pioneer 6, which was launched into orbit around the sun on 16 December 1965, was occulted by the sun in the last half of November 1968. During the period in which the spacecraft was occulted by the solar corona, the S-band telemetry carrier underwent Faraday rotation as a result of this anisotropic plasma. The NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory 210-foot (64-meter) antenna of the Deep Space Network at Barstow, California, which was equipped with an automatic polarization tracking system, was used to measure this effect. Three large-scale transient phenomena were observed. The measurement of these phenomena indicated that Faraday rotation on the order of 40 degrees occurred. The duration of each phenomenon was approximately 2 hours. These phenomena appear to be correlated with observations of solar radio bursts with wavelengths in the dekametric region."
https://openalex.org/W2091913614,"In a study of 90 randomly chosen parotid salivas from Blacks three phenotypes were observed during acid-urea starch-gel electrophoresis. Inheritance was controlled by two codominant alleles at an autosomal locus. Of 101 Caucasians, one had a heterozygous phenotype indistinguishable electrophoretically from that in Blacks. Gene frequencies were: for Blacks, parotid basic protein (Pb(l)) = 0.84, (Pb(2)) = 0.16; for Caucasians, (Pb(l)) ~ 0.995, (Pb(2)) ~ 0.005."
https://openalex.org/W2062728897,"Spectrograms of the radio signals from Pioneer 6 were taken as the spacecraft was occulted by the sun. The spectral bandwidths increased slowly at first, then very rapidly at 1 degree from the sun. In addition, six solar ""events"" produced marked increases of bandwidth lasting for several hours. The received signal power seemed unaffected by the solar corona."

https://openalex.org/W1967676468,Oblique and chevron-like ridges on the shell surfaces of certain burrowing bivalve mollusks grip the sediment during shell-rocking movements to aid in sediment penetration. These ridges (characterized by steep dorsal slopes and gentle ventral slopes) have evolved through convergence in several families in association with particular behavioral and ecological traits.
https://openalex.org/W2025546909,"Four ""giant"" mechanoreceptive cells form part of a stretch receptor organ at the base of the uropod in the sand crab, Emerita (Crustacea, Anomura). Injection of the fluorescent dye Procion Yellow revealed that these sensory cells are monopolar with somata located in the central nervous system. No such cells have previously been described in arthropods. These neurons are also unusual in that they do not generate propagated action potentials; rather, they mediate stretch reflexes by transmission of graded, decremental potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2076212265,"Rats that had been deprived of water for 23(1/2) hours were presented with water for 30 minutes per day. As the temperature of the water was increased from 12 degrees to 36 degrees C (body temperature), the total water intake for 30 minutes increased 71 percent. Tongue cooling during drinking appears to suppress drinking in anticipation of extracellular hydration."
https://openalex.org/W2093126253,The nucleotide sequence of one of the two major lysine transfer RNA's from bakers' yeast has been determined. Its structure is compared to that of a lysine tRNA from a haploid yeast. A total of 21 nucleotides differ in the two molecules. Only the T-psi-C-G (thymidine-pseudouridine-cytidine-guanosine) loop and its supporting stem are identical.
https://openalex.org/W2061001453,Shallow scattering layers consisting mainly of Calanus cristatus were detected on a trans-Pacific crossing to depths of 60 meters with a high-frequency echo sounder. Biomass estimates of these layers indicate concentrations of zooplankton that are greater and more extensive than previously reported in the open ocean.
https://openalex.org/W2079844500,Galactose is converted to galactonic acid in vivo in man. Galactonate was isolated from the urine of galactosemia patients who had been given galactose orally. The identity of the galactonate was established by gas-liquid chromatography and by the preparation of derivatives.
https://openalex.org/W2084654758,"Chromatic stimuli were matched in luminance to a homogeneous white background field. The relative visual latency, as measured by subjective simultaneity, of 621-nanometer (red) light was 20 to 25 milliseconds less than that for 549-nanometer (green) light. When the chromatic stimuli were different in luminance fronm the background field, no differences in visual latency related to the wavelength of light were observed. The procedure of matching the luminance of test fields to that of a background field appears to be crucial for observing a visual latency difference related to wavelength."
https://openalex.org/W2015138937,The 1.1-megaton nuclear test Benham caused movement on previously mapped faults and was followed by a sequence of small earthquakes. These effects were confined to a zone extending not more than 13 kilometers from ground zero; they are apparently related to the release of natural tectonic strain.
https://openalex.org/W2054631826,"ln southeastern Alaska the first marine evidence of widespread glaciation occurs in Miocene sections near the base of the Yakataga Formation. An associated temperature decrease of about 10 degrees C is indicated by the influx of an upper Miocene cold-water planktontic foraminifer, Turborotalia pachyderma, an event that occurred about 13 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2047878535,An antiserum induced against the isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-X) that is unique to spermatozoa reduced significantly the number of pregnancies in mice treated at varying times after they had mated. This effect of the antiserum occurred both prior to and following implantation. The fecundity of treated animals appeared to be normal in subsequent matings.
https://openalex.org/W2061379333,"Studies by optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and electron probe techniques of ferromanganese concretions from three Canadian lakes reveal chemical banding of amorphous hydrated iron and manganese oxides. The average ratio of iron to manganese in concretions from these lakes varies from 0.43 to 2.56. The concentrations of cobalt, nickel, copper, and lead are one to two orders of magnitude below those reported for oceanic ferromanganese concretions."
https://openalex.org/W2048071328,The toroidal but parallel array of planes of unidirectionally oriented molecules believed to characterize cholesteric liquid crystals also gives rise to certain geometrical patterns. The reality of this structure is demonstrated by micrographic evidence.
https://openalex.org/W1976469328,"Self-paced recall in Broadbent's simultaneous listening task shows particular temporal patterns associated with report strategies. Accuracy is a decreasing function of the interval between presentation and report of an item, irrespective of report strategy. Results are related to an interaction between strategies of response selection and decay of information from memory."
https://openalex.org/W2060272704,"Certain continents have in the past moved with respect to each other in a manner clearly implied by sea-floor spreading and other data. However, the resulting collective motion of all the continents was apparently not topologically possible on the present-sized earth. An expanding earth might resolve this difficulty."
https://openalex.org/W2025565735,A 30-second exposure (priming) to a loud noise induced a long-lasting susceptibility to audiogenic seizures and a 15-decibel decrease in threshold to the Preyer acoustic startle reflex in C57BL/6J mice. Both effects were absent when the subjects were primed in one ear and subsequently tested in the contralateral ear. It was postulated that the primary effect of priming is an increase in auditory sensitivity due to changes in the ear itself or in those parts of the auditory system which receive their input exclusively from one ear.
