Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) superfamily that has been shown to be activated during TNFα-induced apoptosis. ASK1 increases apoptosis when overexpressed, but the mechanism of ASK1 activation and the mechanisms of ASK1-induced apoptosis are unclear. We now report that hydrogen peroxide induces the activation of ASK1 in 293 cells. TNFα-induced activation of ASK1 was inhibited by antioxidants. Hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced by the expression of ASK1. These results suggest that TNFα-induced activation of ASK1 is mediated by ROS. We also examined how ASK1 activity is regulated by ROS. We found that ASK1 formed dimers or higher order oligomers in 293 cells. TNFα or hydrogen peroxide treatment increased the dimeric form of ASK1, and pretreatment withN-acetylcysteine decreased it. Furthermore, synthetic dimerization of an ASK1-gyrase B fusion protein by coumermycin resulted in substantial activation of ASK1, suggesting that dimerization of ASK1 is sufficient for its activation. These results taken together suggest that TNFα causes ASK1 activation via ROS-mediated dimerization of ASK1.

In mammalian cells, there are at least three distinct members of the MAPK family: MAPK (also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) (also known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)), and p38. The “classical” MAPK is known to be activated and involved in growth factor-mediated cell proliferation and differentiation (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). In contrast, SAPK and p38 are activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses such as UV and osmotic shock and are implicated in inflammatory responses, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar).Considerable progress has been made in identifying the upstream kinases that regulate each member of the MAPK family. The central core of each MAPK pathway is a conserved cascade of three protein kinases, which are commonly referred to as MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 2Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The MAPKKs for the “classical” MAPK are MKK1/MEK1 and MKK2/MEK2; those for SAPK are SEK1/MKK4 and MKK7; and those for p38 are MKK3 and MKK6. At the MAPKKK level, Raf-1, B-Raf, and c-Mos (and MEKK1 and Tpl2) are known to activate the classical MAPK pathway, whereas MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4/MTK1, Tpl2/Cot, MLK3/PTK1/SPRK, MUK, TAK1, and ASK1/MAPKKK5 have been reported to activate the SAPK and p38 pathways (3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 6Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr residues catalyzed by MAPKKs, which in turn are activated by dual phosphorylation on Ser and Ser/Thr residues catalyzed by MAPKKKs. The activation of the MAPKKKs in the classical MAPK pathway has been studied extensively. The activation of Raf-1 has been shown to involve Ras-mediated membrane recruitment, phosphorylation at critical sites (7Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 44-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and possibly dimerization (8Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvaas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the activation mechanism of MAPKKKs in the “stress-activated” MAPK pathways remains largely unknown and is one of the critical unanswered questions in signal transduction.ASK1 (also called MAPKKK5) is a member of the MAPKKK family, which can activate MKK4 and MKK7 (SAPK pathway) and MKK3 and MKK6 (p38 pathway) by direct phosphorylation (10Wang X.S.

Several lines of evidence suggest that ASK1 is involved in TNFα-induced apoptosis signaling. First, ASK1 is activated by TNFα treatment in many cells; second, the overexpression of ASK1 induces apoptosis in stably transfected Mv1Lu cells; and third, the expression of a dominant-negative ASK1 inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined how ASK1 is regulated by TNFα signaling.TNFα is a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine, which induces apoptosis or other responses depending on the cellular context. The effects of TNFα are mediated by cell surface receptors (p55 TNF-R1 and p75 TNF-R2), their adaptor proteins, and intracellular messengers (12Tracy K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 13Wallach D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 107-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Among them, ROS have been proposed to act as signaling intermediates for TNFα-induced apoptosis, because they are produced in response to TNFα stimulation (14Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M.

These studies prompted us to examine whether ASK1 is regulated by ROS in TNFα signaling. We have found that ROS can activate ASK1. We further examined the molecular mechanism of ASK1 activation induced by ROS and found that dimeric forms of ASK1 exist in ROS-stimulated cells and that in vivo dimerization of ASK1 is sufficient for its activation. Thus, we provide the first evidence that dimerization is important for activating an enzyme that regulates the stress-activated MAPK pathways.RESULTSTo study the activation mechanism of ASK1 in response to TNFα stimulation, we first examined whether ceramide can activate ASK1. Ceramide is known to be generated in response to TNFα and can induce apoptosis in U937, lymphoblastoid, and endothelial cells (36Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 37Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp.

A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ASK1 and treated with a membrane-permeable ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide. HA-ASK1 was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was determined by a coupled kinase assay using recombinant MKK6 and a kinase-negative p38. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the C2-ceramide treatment had little effect on ASK1 activity (∼1.3-fold activation). However, the same concentration of C2-ceramide induced apoptosis in 293 cells (data not shown), suggesting that ceramide may not be a major mediator of ASK1 activation.TNFα treatment increases ROS, such as H2O2, that are thought to be essential for TNFα-induced apoptosis (see Introduction). In fact, the ROS level measured by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was increased after 15 min of TNFα treatment in Mv1Lu cells (5.8-fold on average) in which ASK1 activation is highest at 30 min after TNFα treatment (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that ROS is involved in ASK1 activation. H2O2 treatment induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 ∼ 50 μm) as determined by the appearance of apoptotic bodies and nuclear condensation in 293 cells (data not shown). Importantly, H2O2 treatment significantly increased ASK1 activity in 293 cells transiently transfected with HA-ASK1 (Fig. 1 A). Activation of ASK1 by H2O2 was detected not only by a coupled kinase assay but also by an autophosphorylation assay for ASK1 (Fig. 1 B). The doses of H2O2 required for the activation of ASK1 (EC50 ∼30 μm) were approximately the same as those required for inducing apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). The activation of ASK1 by H2O2 treatment was sustained for at least 2 h (Fig. 1 C). Endogenous ASK1 was also activated by H2O2 treatment as determined by immunoprecipitation with an anti-ASK1 antibody (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, treatment with 10 μg/ml anisomycin did not increase ASK1 activity (Fig. 1 A), although anisomycin is a strong activator of the SAPK and p38 pathways. This implies that ASK1 is only activated by a subset of the stimuli that activate p38 and SAPK. In fact, it is not clear that ASK1 is a major MAPKKK for p38 and SAPK in TNF signaling.Activation of ASK1 by either TNFα or H2O2 was 3–5-fold compared with basal level (Fig. 1). The -fold activation of MAPKKKs is generally low compared with that of MAPKs. A model proposed by Ferrell might explain why a small change in activity of a MAPKKK can trigger robust activation of a MAPK; the requirement for dual phosphorylation to activate the MAPKK and MAPK, the three-kinase cascade (MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK), and near saturation of the enzymes produce multistep cooperativity or “ultrasensitivity” and thus create a switch-like response from a graded stimulus (39Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar).Since H2O2 activated ASK1 in the cell, we next examined if ROS are required for TNFα-induced activation of ASK1. We pretreated 293 cells with an antioxidant, NAC, and then treated the cells with TNFα. In the presence of 20 mm NAC, the activation of ASK1 by TNFα treatment was markedly inhibited, as shown in Fig. 2. The basal activity of ASK1 was also reduced by NAC treatment (∼30% reduction) (Fig. 2). In addition to NAC, catalase (3000 units/ml) (a peroxide-scavenging enzyme) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (100 μm) reduced the TNFα-induced activation of ASK1 (data not shown; Fig. 2). These results suggest that the production of ROS is essential for ASK1 activation in TNFα signaling.Figure 2Inhibition of ASK1 activity by antioxidants. 293 cells (7 × 105 cells) were transfected with 1.5 μg of pME18-HA-ASK1 for 12 h. Cells were pretreated with or without 20 mm NAC for 2 h (top and middle panels) or 100 μm pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) for 4 h (bottom panel) and then treated with 100 ng/ml TNFα for the indicated times. After immunoprecipitation, ASK1 activity was measured by a coupled kinase assay using His-MKK6 and His-kinase negative p38. Values in the top panelrepresent five independent experiments. Error bars represent the S.D. The bottom panel is a representative result.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since ASK1 was activated by H2O2 and ASK1 has been implicated in apoptosis signaling, we tested whether ASK1 expression enhances H2O2-induced apoptosis. ASK1 was inducibly expressed in Mv1Lu cells stably transfected with an ASK1 construct driven by the metallothionein promoter (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Only a small fraction of cells grown in serum undergo apoptosis by ASK1 expression (Fig. 3). 2H. Ichijo, personal communication. Treatment of the ASK1-expressing cells with 50 μmH2O2 for 3 h effectively induced apoptosis (∼90% of the cells), whereas less than 10% of the cells underwent apoptosis in the Mv1Lu cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3). More than 200 μm H2O2 was required to induce apoptosis in the latter cells. Therefore, ASK1 synergized with H2O2 in inducing apoptosis, which is consistent with the hypothesis that ASK1 plays a role in ROS-mediated apoptosis signaling. A kinase-dead mutant (K709R) ASK1 did not inhibit H2O2-induced apoptosis in 293 cells (data not shown), suggesting that ASK1 is not the only target for H2O2 in inducing apoptosis in 293 cells.Figure 3Enhancement of H2O2-induced apoptosis by ASK1 expression.Mv1Lu cells stably transfected with ASK1 driven by a metallothionein promoter were described previously (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). ASK1 was uninduced or induced with 50 μm ZnCl2 for 12 h in the presence of 0.1% serum. Cells were treated with or without 50 μm H2O2 for 3 h and then fixed. Cells undergoing apoptosis were visualized by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase end labeling method with fluorescein-labeled dUTP. Note that in the presence of 0.1% serum neither 50 μm H2O2 treatment alone nor ASK1 expression alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis in >10% of cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We then investigated the molecular mechanism of ASK1 activation induced by ROS. Because Raf1, another member of the MAPKKK superfamily, has recently been reported to be activated by dimerization, we examined whether ASK1 also forms a dimer. First we carried out chemical cross-linking experiments using EDC, which cross-links between carboxyl groups and amine groups. After treatment with or without EDC, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA to determine the mobility of HA-ASK1. In addition to the monomeric HA-ASK1 (∼190 kDa), some bands at the position around 350 kDa were detected only in the lysate incubated with EDC (Fig. 4). The mobility of this band appeared to correspond to the molecular weight of a dimer of ASK1. To confirm that ASK1 forms a dimer, Myc-tagged ASK1 and HA-tagged ASK1 were either co-expressed or expressed separately in 293 cells to see if they would coprecipitate. Myc-tagged ASK1 was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from the cells expressing both HA- and Myc-tagged ASK1 but not from the cells expressing only either Myc- or HA-ASK1 (Fig. 5). In the converse experiment, HA-tagged ASK1 was detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates only from the cells expressing both HA- and Myc-ASK1 (Fig. 5). These results suggest that ASK1 either forms dimers or higher order oligomers.Figure 4Chemical cross-linking of ASK1. 293 cells (7 × 105 cells) were transfected with 5 μg of pME-HA-ASK1 for 12 h, pretreated with or without 20 mmNAC for 2 h, and then treated with either 100 μmH2O2 for 10 min or 100 ng/ml TNFα for 30 min. Cells were lysed and incubated with or without 10 mm of the chemical cross-linker EDC for 10 min at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After electrophoresis, ASK1 was detected by anti-HA immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Coprecipitation of HA-ASK1 and myc-ASK1.293 cells (7 × 105 cells) were transfected with (+) or without (−) pME18-HA-ASK1 (HA-ASK1) and pME18-Myc-ASK1 (Myc-ASK1) (2 μg for each plasmid). Cells were extracted without stimulation. After immunoprecipitation with either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies (IP), the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies (blot).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Importantly, both TNFα and H2O2 treatment moderately increased the amount of ASK1 at the dimer position (Fig. 4). Moreover, pretreatment with NAC markedly reduced the amount of ASK1 at the dimer position (Fig. 4). Therefore, TNFα and its downstream mediator H2O2 may promote dimerization of ASK1 within the cell.The next important question is whether ASK1 can be activated by dimerization. To address this, we produced a fusion protein between gyrase B and ASK1 to determine if dimerization of ASK1 is sufficient for its activation. The application of coumermycin to cells induces the dimerization of gyrase B, but novobiocin, a monovalent analogue of coumermycin, does not (Ref. 8Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar; Fig. 6 A). Activation of ASK1 within the cell was monitored by the activity of a co-transfected substrate, MKK6. Treatment of the gyrase B-ASK1-transfected 293 cells with coumermycin induced activation of ASK1 efficiently (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, coumermycin had little effect on MKK6 activity in cells transfected with gyrase B without ASK1 (Fig. 6 B). In addition, novobiocin did not induce gyrase B-ASK1 activation (Fig. 6 B). The activation of gyrase B-ASK1 by coumermycin was also detected when the activity of ASK1 was monitored by the activity of another co-transfected substrate, SAPK (JNK) (Fig. 6 C). These results strongly suggest that dimerization of ASK1 is sufficient for its activation.Figure 6Synthetic dimerization of a gyrase B-ASK1 fusion protein. A, a schematic diagram of the system. The gyrase B-ASK1 fusion protein is dimerized by coumermycin but not by a monovalent analogue, novobiocin. B, coumermycin induces activation of the gyrase B-ASK1 fusion protein in 293 cell transfectants. 293 cells (7 × 105 cells) were transfected with 2 μg of either gyrase B-ASK1 or gyrase B together with 2 μg of either HA-MKK6 (top) or HA-SAPK (JNK,bottom) for 12 h. Cells were treated with the indicated amounts of coumermycin or novobiocin for 30 min or with 0.5m sorbitol for 30 min. After HA-MKK6 and HA-SAPK were immunoprecipitated, their activities were measured with the substrates His-kinase-negative p38 (KN-p38) for MKK6 and GST-c-Jun for SAPK. Coumermycin and novobiocin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (1% of the medium) was used for all of the experiments. The radioactivity of each band was quantified and is shown in arbitrary units below the figures. The results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONVery little is known about the activation mechanism of the MAPKKKs in the stress-activated MAPK pathways, although the activation and the functions of those pathways have been studied extensively (4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the activation mechanism of ASK1, a MAPKKK that is involved in TNFα-induced apoptosis. Since both ROS and ASK1 are thought to be important for propagating cytotoxic effects of TNFα, we examined the relationship between ROS and ASK1. We propose that ROS, especially H2O2, are involved in TNFα-induced ASK1 activation based on the following evidence: 1) TNFα induces both H2O2 production and ASK1 activation (11Ichijo H. Nishida E.

These results are consistent with the idea that ASK1 is activated downstream of H2O2in TNFα signaling. Therefore, ASK1 as well as other potential ROS targets (direct or indirect; cf.

The results presented here demonstrate that ASK1 dimerizes in vivo. In addition, we have shown here that 1) treatment of the cells with either H2O2 or TNFα increased the dimeric form of ASK1, 2) NAC treatment decreased the dimeric form, and 3) synthetic dimerization of ASK1 by a gyrase B-coumermycin system was sufficient for ASK1 activation in the cells. These data strongly suggest that dimerization of ASK1 plays a role in its activation. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that overexpression of ASK1 leads to a high level of basal activity in the absence of stimulation (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Also, it is possible that immunoprecipitation artificially increases ASK1 activity by aiding dimer formation. Therefore, it would be good to develop a method to assay ASK1 without immunoprecipitation. It still remains to be addressed whether mechanisms other than dimerization are involved in ASK1 activation and whether the dimerization of ASK1 is required for its activation.It is not clear whether ASK1 is a direct or indirect target for ROS.In vitro incubation of an ASK1 immunoprecipitate with H2O2 did not increase its activity. 3Y. Gotoh, unpublished observation. However, the altered oligomerization of ASK1 induced by H2O2and TNFα may be due to changes in sulfhydryl oxidation in ASK1. When we carried out anti-HA immunoblotting of extracts prepared from HA-ASK1-expressing cells under nonreducing conditions, we observed extra bands that were not detected in extracts prepared under standard reducing conditions.3 This might suggest that ASK1 is directly modulated by ROS. Interestingly, ASK1 has a cysteine-rich domain in its NH2 terminus, which might be a target for the action of ROS. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether this domain is involved in the dime"
https://openalex.org/W1979369057,"We report the cloning, sequence analysis, tissue distribution, functional expression, and chromosomal localization of the human pancreatic sodium bicarbonate cotransport protein (pancreatic NBC (pNBC)). The transporter was identified by searching the human expressed sequence tag data base. An I.M.A.G.E. clone W39298 was identified, and a polymerase chain reaction probe was generated to screen a human pancreas cDNA library. pNBC encodes a 1079-residue polypeptide that differs at the N terminus from the recently cloned human sodium bicarbonate cotransporter isolated from kidney (kNBC) (Burnham, C. E., Amlal, H., Wang, Z., Shull, G. E., and Soleimani, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 19111–19114). Northern blot analysis using a probe specific for the N terminus of pNBC revealed an ∼7.7-kilobase transcript expressed predominantly in pancreas, with less expression in kidney, brain, liver, prostate, colon, stomach, thyroid, and spinal chord. In contrast, a probe to the unique 5′ region of kNBC detected an ∼7.6-kilobase transcript only in the kidney. In situhybridization studies in pancreas revealed expression in the acini and ductal cells. The gene was mapped to chromosome 4q21 using fluorescentin situ hybridization. Expression of pNBC in Xenopus laevis oocytes induced sodium bicarbonate cotransport. These data demonstrate that pNBC encodes the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter in the mammalian pancreas. pNBC is also expressed at a lower level in several other organs, whereas kNBC is expressed uniquely in kidney.

As characterized in many cell types, several features distinguish the Na(HCO3)n cotransporter from other bicarbonate-dependant transporters.1) Na(HCO3)ncotransport is not dependent on the presence of Cl−, 2) transport is inhibited by stilbenes, and 3) transport is stimulated in the presence of HCO3−. In the kidney, Na(HCO3)n cotransport was initially localized by functional studies to the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule where it plays an important role in mediating electrogenic basolateral bicarbonate efflux (2Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 53-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21Alpern R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 613-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Yoshitomi K.

Although Na+-dependent and -independent Cl−/base exchangers also contribute to basolateral bicarbonate transport in the proximal tubule (23Alpern R.J. Chambers M. J. Gen.

Boulpaep E.L. Kidney Int. 1989; 36: 392-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Romero et al. have recently cloned a renal electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) from rat (28Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 1259Google Scholar) and salamander kidney (29Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Burnham et al. have reported the cloning of a sodium bicarbonate cotransporter from human kidney (30Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The NBC clone isolated from salamander kidney encoded a 4.2-kb mRNA transcript that was expressed predominantly in kidney, with less expression in small intestine, large intestine, brain, eye, and bladder (29Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Human NBC isolated from kidney encoded a ∼7.6-kb mRNA and was reportedly also expressed in pancreas and brain by Northern analysis using a probe to the 3′ region of kNBC (30Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NBC expression in the kidney has recently been shown to be highest in the S1 proximal tubule, with less expression in the proximal straight tubule (31Abuladze N. Lee I Newman D. Hwang J Pushkin A. Kurtz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: 628-633Google Scholar). The high level of expression in S1 proximal tubules is in keeping with the high rate of transepithelial bicarbonate transport in this segment (32Jacobson H.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: F54-F62PubMed Google Scholar,33Schwartz G.J. Evan A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F382-F390PubMed Google Scholar). The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes dissolved in a HCO3−-rich fluid (34Kuijpers G.A.J. Depont J.J.H.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Pancreatic bicarbonate secretion is mediated by principal cells lining the pancreatic ducts (34Kuijpers G.A.J. Depont J.J.H.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Case M.R. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1989; 5: 665-681Crossref Google Scholar). Previous functional studies have led to a cell model that can account for transcellular bicarbonate secretion. Apical bicarbonate secretion is thought to be mediated by an apical Cl−/base exchanger acting in parallel with a small conductance cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel on the apical membrane (5Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Gray M.A. Harris A. Coleman L. Greenwell J.R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C591-C602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Influx of H+ equivalents during the process of apical bicarbonate secretion requires the efflux of H+ or the influx of bicarbonate in the steady state. Studies of pig, rat, and guinea pig pancreatic ducts have demonstrated the presence of a basolateral Na+/H+ antiporter, which serves an important housekeeping role (5Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8de Ondarza J. Hootman S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G124-G134PubMed Google Scholar, 37Stuenkel E.L. Machen T.E.

Scand. 1992; 144: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A basolateral vacuolar-type H+/ATPase and Na(HCO3)ncotransporter are thought to play an important role in agonist-mediated bicarbonate secretion (5Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen.

The relative contribution of these transporters to basolateral H+/base transport and their respective stimulation by secretogues in different species is controversial. The importance of basolateral Na(HCO3)n cotransport has recently been documented in studies of isolated rat and guinea pig pancreatic ducts (5Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Villanger O. Veel T. Raeder M.G.

( Lond. ). 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reported that basolateral Na(HCO3)n cotransport contributed up to 75% of basolateral bicarbonate uptake during stimulation of transepithelial bicarbonate transport by secretin. Furthermore, in isolated pancreatic acini, Na(HCO3)n cotransport has been shown to participate in the regulation of pHi after acid loads (3Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of HCO3− flux measurements and thermodynamic considerations, it was concluded that this transporter contributes to HCO3− efflux under unstimulated conditions (3Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ishiguro H., M. Steward C. Lindsay A.R. Case R.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with a stoichiometry of 3:1 (3Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although direct measurements of the stoichiometry have thus far not been performed. After depolarization of the basolateral membrane by secretin (40Novak I. Pahl C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the electrochemical driving forces would favor basolateral bicarbonate influx (7Ishiguro H., M. Steward C. Lindsay A.R. Case R.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the functional characteristics of pancreatic Na(HCO3)n cotransport have begun to be investigated, the protein responsible for this function has not been identified. We report here the cloning the human pancreatic Na(HCO3)n cotransporter (pNBC). The predicted pNBC polypeptide is 1079 amino acids in length, whereas the NBC variant expressed in kidney (kNBC) consists of 1035 amino acids. The C-terminal 994 amino acids of pNBC and kNBC are identical. pNBC has a unique N terminus of 85 amino acids that replaces the initial 41 amino acids in kNBC. Expression of the cDNA encoding pNBC in Xenopusoocytes results in sodium-dependent and chloride-independent HCO3− transport, which is inhibited by DIDS. A 159-bp PCR product (2795–2954 bp in human pNBC) was generated using the human pancreas NBC EST clone W39298 (I.M.A.G.E clone) as a template, random primer-labeled with 32P and used to screen a human pancreas λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). A similar approach was utilized by Burnham et al. (30Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) while the present studies were in progress to obtain an NBC clone from human pancreas. Standard hybridization conditions were employed (42 °C, 50% formamide, 5× standard saline phosphate EDTA (SSPE), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml prehybridization herring sperm DNA). The filters were washed three times with 1× SSC/0.1%SDS (42 °C) and once with 0.1× SSC/0.1%SDS (25 °C) (1×SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). Positive clones were verified by sequencing. Two overlapping clones (7.1) and (9.2.1) were obtained that contained the entire coding region. To obtain a full-length clone containing the complete open reading frame, these two clones were spliced together using a common SpeI restriction site and subcloned into pPCR-Script SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To increase the stability of the capped RNA transcribed from this clone, a poly(A) (70-mer) oligonucleotide was added to the 3′ end of the clone between a SalI and KpnI restriction site. The 5′ end of the coding sequence for pNBC was confirmed by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR amplification and primer extension analysis. Furthermore, to confirm that the pNBC amino acid sequence was derived from a bona fide transcript, we amplified the entire open reading frame of human pNBC by reverse transcription-PCR using Marathon Ready cDNA prepared from human pancreas (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as a template. Nucleotide sequences were determined bidirectionally by automated sequencing (ABI 310 Perkin-Elmer) using Taq polymerase (Ampli-Taq FS, Perkin-Elmer). Sequence assembly and analysis was carried out using Geneworks software (Oxford, UK). Northern blots with various human tissues were obtained fromCLONTECH. The various probes were random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP to a specific activity of about 1.5 × 109 dpm/μg. The filters were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h using 50% formamide, 6× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, Denhardt's solution, and 0.1 mg/ml of sheared herring testes denatured DNA. After the prehybridization, the filters were incubated with the 32P probe using 25 ml of hybridization buffer. The probes were denatured and added to the hybridization solution at 107 dpm/ml. The filters were probed at 42 °C for 18 h and washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45 °C for 60 min (3 changes, 350 ml/wash); after exposure for 9.5 h, the filters were rewashed in 1× SSC, 0.1%SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and 0.1× SSC, 0.1%SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA was T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) labeled with [32P]γATP to a specific activity of 2.5 μCi/pmol. The filters were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h using 50% formamide, 6x SSPE, 0.5% SDS, Denhardt's solution, and 0.1 mg/ml sheared herring testes denatured DNA. After the prehybridization, the filters were probed with the 32P probe using 25 ml of hybridization buffer. The probe was denatured and added to the hybridization solution at 0.5 pmol/ml. The filters were probed at 42 °C for 18 h and then washed 3 times in 1x SSC, 0.1%SDS at 45 °C for 30 min. The following probes were used in the Northern blot studies: 1) a 159-bp PCR product with a sequence common to both pNBC and kNBC (nucleotides 2795–2954 pNBC sequence and 2695 to 2854 in the kNBC sequence); 2) synthetic oligonucleotide specific for pNBC (nucleotides 118 to 212 in the pNBC sequence); 3) synthetic oligonucleotide specific for kNBC (nucleotides 175 to 268 in the kNBC sequence). To prepare the riboprobes, the insert (9.2.1) was subcloned into pPCR-script SK(+) (Stratagene) Riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription and labeled with 35S-CTP. For generation of the antisense riboprobe, the plasmid was linearized withSstI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. For generation of the sense riboprobe, the plasmid was linearized with KpnI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase. The RNA transcripts were purified by phenol-chloroform extractions and Sephadex G-50 spin columns (Sigma). The final products were suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer with 0.1 m dithiothreitol. The RNA transcripts were then sheared by alkaline hydrolysis at 68 °C for 5 min. After the shearing, the reaction was neutralized by adding 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5, to make a final acetate concentration of 0.3m. Slices of mouse pancreas (1 mm) were fixed in 4% formalin, and 5-μm sections were attached to glass slides (Fisher). The slides were prewashed and digested for 15 min at 37 °C with proteinase K. To reduce nonspecific background staining, the slides were succinylated with succinic anhydride and acetylated with acetic anhydride. The riboprobes were hybridized for 18 h at 45 °C. The slides were then washed for 15 min in 2× SSC at room temperature, followed by a wash (15 min) in 1 × SSC/50% formamide at 45 °C, then three washes in 2 × SSC/0.1% Triton X-100 at 60 °C for 15 min each, followed by two washes in 0.1 SSC at 60 °C for 15 min each. The slides were then digested by RNase A (25 μg/ml; Sigma) and RNase T1(25 units/ml; Sigma) for 40 min at 37 °C. The slides were washed twice in 2× SSC at 60 °C for 15 min each and then dehydrated in 0.3 m ammonium acetate, 70% ethanol for 5 min followed by a further 5 min of dehydration in 0.3 mammonium acetate, 95% ethanol. The slides were dipped into NTB2 emulsion solution (Eastman Kodak Co.) and exposed for 3 days at 4 °C followed by hematoxylin/eosin staining. The sections were imaged using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Max Erb, Los Angeles, CA) and digitized using a Sony 3CCD color video camera (model DXC-960MD, Compix Imaging Systems, Tuscon, AZ) with C Imaging software (Compix Imaging Systems, Tuscon, AZ). The PCR probe used to screen the pancreatic cDNA library was also used to screen an arrayed PAC human genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). DNA from clone F335 was identified by sequencing and was then labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride for one color experiments. Probe detection for two color experiments was accomplished by incubating the slides in fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies and Texas red avidin followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride. The plasmid containing the complete coding sequence of pNBC was linearized by digestion withKpnI, and capped cRNA was prepared with T3 RNA polymerase using a T3 mMessage mMachine kit RNA capping kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as recommended by the manufacturer. This cRNA was used for theXenopus oocyte expression studies. An aliquot of the synthesized cRNA was run on a denaturing gel to verify the expected size before oocyte injection. Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 50 nl of sterile water or a solution containing 1 ng/nl capped pNBC cRNA (prepared as described above). They were then bathed in Barth's medium at 18 °C. 3–6 days post-injection, optical recordings were made at 22–24 °C. Intracellular pH was monitored using the fluorescent probe 2′,7′-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and a microfluorometer coupled to the microscope (41Kurtz I. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Individual defolliculated oocytes were held in place with pipettes attached to low suction with vegetal pole surface closest to the 40× objective. Before loading with BCECF, the background intensity from each oocyte was digitized at 500 nm and 440 nm (530-nm emission). The oocytes were loaded with 32 μm BCECF-acetoxymethyl ester for 1 h before experimentation in the following solution: NaCl (108 mm), KCl (2 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), and Hepes (8 mm), pH 7.4. Calibration of intracellular BCECF in the oocytes was performed at the end of each experiment by monitoring the 500/440-nm fluorescence excitation ratio at various values of pHi in the presence of high K+ nigericin standards as described previously (42Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Nagai T. Marumo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Three experimental protocols were performed: 1) Na+ removal/addition. The oocytes were bathed in the following Na+-containing solution for 30 min: NaCl (100 mm); KCl (2 mm); CaCl2 (1 mm); MgCl2 (1 mm); NaHCO3 (8 mm) and bubbled with 1.5% CO2, pH 7.4. After a steady state was reached, Na+ was removed by bathing the oocytes in the following Na+-free solution: TMA-Cl (100 mm), KCl (2 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), TMA-HCO3 (8 mm) bubbled with 1.5% CO2, pH 7.4; 2) Na+ removal/addition with DIDS (0.3 mm); and 3) Na+ removal/addition in Cl−-free solutions with EIPA (10 μm). For the latter experiments, the oocytes were loaded with BCECF in the following Cl−-free solution: sodium gluconate (108 mm), potassium gluconate (2 mm), calcium gluconate (7 mm), magnesium gluconate (2 mm), Hepes (8 mm), pH 7.4. The oocytes were bathed in the following Na+-containing Cl−-free solution for ∼30 min with EIPA (10 μm): sodium gluconate (100 mm), potassium gluconate (2 mm), calcium gluconate (7 mm), magnesium gluconate (2 mm), NaHCO3 (8 mm), pH 7.4. bubbled with 1.5% CO2, pH 7.4. After a steady state was reached, Na+ was removed by bathing the oocytes in the following Na+-free, Cl−-free solution with EIPA (10 μm): TMA-OH (100 mm), d-gluconic acid lactone (100 mm), potassium gluconate (2 mm), calcium gluconate (7 mm), magnesium gluconate (2 mm), TMA-HCO3 (8 mm) bubbled with 1.5% CO2, pH 7.4. Defolliculated oocytes were injected with pNBC cRNA (50 nl, 1 μg/ul) or water and incubated in Barth's medium for 3–6 days at 18 °C before study. The oocytes were preincubated for 1 h in 1 ml of a Na+-free solution containing: TMA-Cl (108 mm), KCl (2 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), and Hepes (8 mm), pH 7.4. The oocytes were then transferred into 1.4 ml of the following Na+-containing solution: NaCl (100 mm), KCl (2 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), NaHCO3 (8 mm) bubbled with 1.5% CO2, pH 7.4 with 2 μCi of 22Na+. A 10-μl aliquot was removed from the influx solution for later determination of 22Na+-specific activity.22Na+ influx was measured after 15 min and terminated with three washes of ice-cold Na+-free stop solution. The influx experiments were repeated in the presence of DIDS (0.3 mm). In the DIDS-containing experiments, the oocytes were exposed to 0.3 mm DIDS for 30 min before and throughout the influx period. The oocytes were preincubated in 1 ml for 1 h in a Cl−-free solution containing sodium gluconate (108 mm), potassium gluconate (2 mm), calcium gluconate (7 mm), magnesium gluconate (2 mm), and Hepes (8 mm), pH 7.4. The oocytes were then transferred into 1.4 ml of the following Cl−-containing solution: NaCl (100 mm), KCl (2 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), NaHCO3 (8 mm) bubbled with 1.5% CO2, pH 7.4. with 3.3 μCi of36Cl−. A 10-μl aliquot was removed from the influx solution for later determination of36Cl−-specific activity.36Cl− influx was measured after 15 min and terminated with three washes of ice-cold stop solution. The sequences submitted to GenBankTM have been scanned against the data base, and the following related human sequences have been identified (AF007216, P02730, P48751, U62531). The cloning of pNBC was based on the identification of human pancreatic cDNA clone in the GenBankTM data base. To obtain full-length pNBC, we screened a human pancreas λgt10 cDNA library using a probe generated by PCR amplification of the human EST sequence. Two overlapping clones were obtained that were fused at a shared SpeI restriction site to generate a full-length clone containing the entire open reading frame. To confirm that the pNBC sequence was derived from a bona fide transcript, reverse transcription-PCR was used to generate a full-length PCR product containing the complete open reading frame. Analysis of the full-length clone revealed a 1079-amino acid open reading frame beginning with the initial methionine as well as 117 bp of 5′-untranslated region. Additional overlapping 3′-untranslated rapid amplification of cDNA ends sequences were almost identical to the sequence recently published by Burnham et al. (30Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except for minor changes likely due to polymorphisms. The nucleotide sequence of human pNBC has been submitted to the GenBankTM (accession number AF011390). The overall structure of pNBC is similar to kNBC (30Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and other members of the anion exchange gene family (43Alper S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Specifically, pNBC has 12 predicted transmembrane regions and hydrophilic intracellular N- and C-terminal regions. As shown in Fig. 1, the sequences of pNBC and kNBC are identical after the Ser residue at position 42 of kNBC and position 86 of the pancreatic sequence. Unlike the kidney sequence, the N terminus of pNBC before the region common to both polypeptides contains blocks of charged amino acids. Further distinctive features of the N terminus of pNBC are 1) the consensus phosphorylation site for protein kinase A beginning at Lys46, 2) the consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C beginning at Ser38 and Ser65, and 3) the casein kinase II phosphorylation"

In the glucose-sensitive pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1, it was found that glucose (6–18 mm) independently increased INS-1 cell proliferation (>20-fold at 15 mm glucose). Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-induced INS-1 cell proliferation was glucose-dependent only in the physiologically relevant concentration range (6–18 mm glucose). The combination of IGF-I and glucose was synergistic, increasing INS-1 cell proliferation >50-fold at 15 mm glucose + 10 nm IGF-I. Glucose metabolism and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase) activation were necessary for both glucose and IGF-I-stimulated INS-1 cell proliferation. IGF-I and 15 mm glucose increased tyrosine phosphorylation mediated recruitment of Grb2/mSOS and PI 3′-kinase to IRS-2 and pp60. Glucose and IGF-I also induced Shc association with Grb2/mSOS. Glucose (3–18 mm) and IGF-I, independently of glucose, activated mitogen-activated protein kinase but this did not correlate with IGF-I-induced β-cell proliferation. In contrast, p70S6K was activated with increasing glucose concentration (between 6 and 18 mm), and potentiated by IGF-I in the same glucose concentration range which correlated with INS-1 cell proliferation rate. Thus, glucose and IGF-I-induced β-cell proliferation were mediated via a signaling mechanism that was facilitated by mitogen-activated protein kinase but dependent on IRS-mediated induction of PI 3′-kinase activity and downstream activation of p70S6K. The glucose dependence of IGF-I mediated INS-1 cell proliferation emphasizes β-cell signaling mechanisms are rather unique in being tightly linked to glycolytic metabolic flux.

Adult pancreatic β-cells are relatively well differentiated and consequently have a low mitotic index (1Brockenbrough J.S. Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 232-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances the proportion of β-cells undergoing mitosis is about 0.5% of the population of β-cells in a pancreatic islet (1Brockenbrough J.S. Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 232-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, β-cell proliferation can be increased by several nutrient factors, such as glucose and amino acids (2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Glucose increases mitogenesis in islet β-cells so that around 5% of the β-cell population are undergoing DNA synthesis (2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes Nutr. Metab. 1992; 5: 1-3Google Scholar, 4Swenne I. Bone A.J. Howell S.L. Hellerstrom C.

However, the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for glucose-mediated β-cell proliferation, beyond a requirement for glucose metabolism, are not particularly well understood. Nonetheless, it has been postulated that this may be via elevation of intracellular cAMP (2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Chick W.L. Diabetes. 1973; 22: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), glucose-mediated activated protein kinase C (6Welsh M. Mares J. Öberg C. Karlsson T. Diabetes Metab.

Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β-cell proliferation can also be stimulated by several growth factors (2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Scharfmann R. Basmaciogullari A. Czernichow P. Diabetes Res. 1990; 15: 137-141PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, somatolactogenic hormones (prolactin and growth hormone (GH)) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) have been shown to increase the number of replicating β-cells in rodent islets by up to 6% of the islet cell population (2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Nielsen J.H. Linde S. Welinder B.S. Billestrup N. Madsen O.D. Mol.

A. 1990; 87: 7210-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A prolactin-induced increase in β-cell proliferation is likely associated with an increase in β-cell mass observed during pregnancy (12Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GH is perhaps the most potent of peptide growth factors to induce proliferation of differentiated β-cells (10Nielsen J.H. Linde S. Welinder B.S. Billestrup N. Madsen O.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 13: 165-173Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Hellerström C. Sjöholm Å. Swenne I. Acta Padiatr. Scand. 1991; 377: 55-62Crossref Google Scholar). It has been postulated that GH mediates β-cell growth via local IGF-I production (14Swenne I. Hill D.J. Strain A.J. Milner R.D.G. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 288-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, it is more likely that GH mediates a direct effect on β-cell proliferation (15Billestrup N. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinol. 1991; 129: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) probably via a JAK2/STAT5 signal transduction pathway (16Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Bouchelouche P. Nielsen J.H. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12273-12669Google Scholar). Likewise, IGF-I stimulates β-cell proliferation independently of GH or prolactin (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), most probably via the IGF-I receptor and subsequent protein tyrosine phosphorylation signal transduction pathway found in other mammalian cell types (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K.

IGF-I binds to the IGF-I-receptor resulting in activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that in turn tyrosine phosphorylates members of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family (18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K. Takahashi Y. Yamauchi T. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Endocrin. J. 1996; 43: S33-S41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yenush L.

Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS is then able to recruit the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase) via its SH2 domain, leading to activation of the enzyme (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This then leads to PI 3′-kinase-dependent downstream activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase (p70S6K) (21Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS also engages the bridging molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb-2) via its SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine site on IRS (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This results in an increased binding of IRS-docked Grb-2 to the murine Son-of-Sevenless 1 protein (mSOS), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor which converts inactive Ras-GDP into active Ras-GTP (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Activated GTP-bound Ras then recruits the Raf serine kinase that phosphorylates MAP kinase kinase (MEK), resulting in MEK-mediated phosphorylation activation of the MAPK (erk-1 and -2 isoforms) (18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K. Takahashi Y. Yamauchi T. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Endocrin. J. 1996; 43: S33-S41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yenush L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IGF can also activate the Ras/MAPK branch of the pathway independently of IRS, via IGF-I receptor kinase tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2-containing protein (Shc) which then directly binds Grb-2/mSOS resulting activation of Ras/MAPK (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K.

Notwithstanding, by which ever signal transduction pathway it is mediated, activation of MAPK and p70S6K are known to be a requirement for induction of a mitogenesis in most mammalian cell types (17Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K.

In the pancreatic β-cell, although several peptide growth factors and nutrients have been shown to increase β-cell proliferation (2Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the intracellular signal transduction pathway(s) involved in induction of β-cell mitogenesis have not been well defined. Moreover, the regulation of β-cell growth may actually be uniquely different from other cell types, since β-cell function is exquisitely related to its metabolic state (23Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In these studies we have used the β-cell line INS-1 as a model to better characterize glucose and IGF-I-mediated signal transduction pathways that specially influence β-cell proliferation. Compared with other β-cell lines, despite a higher mitotic index than primary β-cells, INS-1 cells are relatively well differentiated and respond to glucose in terms of insulin secretion in a physiologically relevant glucose concentration range (24Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Guodong L. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The [methyl-3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Anti-“active-MAPK” antiserum was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), the “total MAPK” antiserum (erk1/erk2) was a gift from Dr. M. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), and the IRS-1 and IRS-2 antisera were generated as described previously (20Myers M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All other antisera were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Transblot nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm pore size) was from Bio-Rad, immunoblot chemiluminescence detection kit from NEN Life Science Products. IGF-I and protein kinase/phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). The (Rp)-2′-O-monobutyryl-cAMP and (Sp)-2′-O-monobutyryl-cAMP were from Biolog Life Sciences Institute (La Jolla, CA). All the other biochemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) and were of the highest purity available. The glucose-sensitive pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1 (24Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Guodong L. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), was used in the experiments. INS-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 11.2 mmglucose, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 as described (24Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Guodong L. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured at 80% confluence. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was used as an indicator of DNA synthesis and INS-1 cell proliferation (7Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were cultured on 96-well plates (105 cells/well) and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C in INS-1 medium. The medium was removed and the cells made quiescent by serum and glucose deprivation for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA instead of serum and no glucose. The INS-1 cells were then incubated for a further 24 h in RPMI 1640, 0.1% BSA at different glucose concentrations (0–24 mm glucose) with or without IGF-I (0.1–100 nm), ± various inhibitors. The last 4 h of this latter incubation period was carried out in the additional presence of 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine to monitor the degree of DNA synthesis and gain an assessment of the β-cell proliferation rate. After this final incubation period, the cells were collected and lysed using a semi-automatic cell harvester (Cambridge Technology Inc.) and the cell lysates transferred to Whatmann glass fiber micropore filters. The [3H]thymidine specifically incorporated into the INS-1 cell DNA trapped on glass fiber filters was counted by liquid scintillation counting. INS-1 cells were subcultured on 10-cm plates to about 50% confluence as described previously (24Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Guodong L. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The cells were then subjected to a 24-h period of quiescence by serum and glucose deprivation in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA instead of serum and no glucose. After the quiescent period, INS-1 cells were then incubated in fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 0, 3, 6, 9, or 18 mm glucose ± 10 nm IGF-I for between 5 and 60 min as indicated. The cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoblot analysis of mitogenic signal transduction protein expression and protein tyrosine phosphorylation was as described previously, using horseradish peroxidase based chemiluminescence reaction as a secondary detection method (21Myers Jr., M.G.

Examination of stimulated protein-protein interactions between mitogenic signal transduction pathway proteins was by co-immunoprecipitation analysis as described previously (21Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 17: 4902-4911Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, 50–75 μg of INS-1 cell total protein lysate was used, and for immunoprecipitation 750 μg of INS-1 cell total protein. Protein assay was by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Data are presented as a mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t test, where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The effect of glucose (0.1–24 mm) ± IGF-I (10 nm) on INS-1 cell DNA synthesis was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation as an index of β-cell proliferation. Glucose independently increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells (Fig. 1). In the absence of IGF-I, no change in [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS-1 cells was observed between 0 and 0.5 mm glucose (Fig. 1), but at 1 mm glucose a modest increase in INS-1 cell proliferation was observed (1.4-fold increase compared with no glucose,p < 0.001; Fig. 1). However, the most effective glucose concentration range on INS-1 cell proliferation occurred in the physiologically relevant range between 6 and 18 mm glucose (4–19-fold above that in the absence of glucose; p < 0.001; Fig. 1). Maximum [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells above “zero glucose” occurred at 18 mmglucose (19-fold increase, p < 0.0001; Fig. 1), and declined above this glucose concentration (Fig. 1). Notwithstanding, a 14-fold higher INS-1 cell proliferation rate at 24 mmglucose was significantly higher than that observed in the absence of glucose (p < 0.001; Fig. 1). It was apparent that IGF-I only exerted a notable effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells when glucose was present at physiologically relevant concentrations (6–18 mm glucose; Fig. 1). Below 1 mm glucose, IGF-I modestly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells (1.9-fold increase above zero glucose in the absence of IGF-I,p < 0.001; Fig. 1), however, this effect was rather small compared with the synergistic effects of IGF-I and glucose in the physiologically relevant range (6–18 mm; Fig. 1). At 6 mm glucose, IGF-I instigated a 10-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation above that in the absence of glucose and IGF-I (p < 0.001; Fig. 1), which was 2.5-fold higher than the rate of INS-1 cell proliferation at 6 mm glucose alone (p < 0.01; Fig. 1). IGF-I instigated a maximum increase in INS-1 cell [3H]thymidine incorporation at 15 mm glucose (52-fold above that in the absence of glucose and IGF-I glucose, p < 0.001; Fig. 1), which was 4.2-fold higher than that at 15 mm glucose alone (p < 0.01; Fig. 1). Above 18 mmglucose the synergistic effect of IGF-I and glucose on [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells was significantly diminished (p < 0.001 above 15 mm glucose + 10 nm IGF-I; Fig. 1), so that at 24 mm glucose addition of IGF-I only surpassed the glucose effect by 1.4-fold (Fig. 1). Notwithstanding, this was 21-fold higher than the proliferation rate in the absence of glucose and IGF-I (p < 0.001; Fig. 1). Both IGF-I and glucose-stimulated INS-1 cell proliferation required glucose metabolism (Fig. 2). Mannoheptulose (15 mm), a competitive inhibitor of glycolysis (27Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), completely inhibited 15 mmglucose-stimulated INS-1 cell [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence or absence of IGF-I (p < 0.001; Fig. 2). Not surprisingly, mannoheptulose (3 or 15 mm) had no independent effect on INS-1 cell proliferation whether IGF-I was present or not (Fig. 2). Likewise, the non-metabolizable glucose analogues, 2-deoxyglucose or 3-O-methyl glucose (at concentrations of 3 or 15 mm), had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells (Fig. 2), and could not provide a suitable platform for IGF-I instigated INS-1 cell proliferation (Fig. 2). Fructose (15 mm), which is not efficiently metabolized in pancreatic β-cells (27Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), did not significantly increase INS-1 cell proliferation in the presence or absence of IGF-I (Fig. 2). These observations further emphasize the requirement of physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose for IGF-I to stimulate INS-1 cell proliferation. The effect of increasing IGF-I concentrations on [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS-1 cells at various glucose concentrations was examined (Fig. 3). In the absence of IGF-I there was an incremental increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation with increasing glucose between 3 and 18 mm as observed previously (Fig. 1). IGF-I above 1 nm increased [3H]thymidine incorporation >2-fold compared with cells treated with glucose alone, with a maximal increase at 10 nm IGF-I, 18 mm glucose (49-fold above zero glucose, p < 0.001; Fig. 3). This effect was not exceeded above a concentration of 10 nm IGF-I (Fig. 3), and subsequently 10 nm IGF-I was used as an optimal IGF-I concentration in following experiments. The effect of insulin to compete for IGF-I (10 nm)-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells was also examined at various glucose concentrations (Fig. 4). Only at very high insulin concentrations (>10 μm) was any significant competition for IGF-I-stimulated INS-1 cell proliferation observed, which then rendered only a 20–30% inhibition (p < 0.02; Fig. 4). In the absence of IGF-I, only high concentrations of insulin (>10 μm) could instigate a modest increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into INS-1 cells at 15 mm glucose (1.3-fold above 15 mm glucose without IGF-I, p < 0.05; Fig. 4). Thus, the observations found in this study were predominately attributable to IGF-I working through the IGF-I receptor. The effect of specific protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS-1 cells by 15 mm glucose ± 10 nm IGF-I was examined (Table I). In these series experiments 15 mm glucose instigated a 20-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation above that in the absence of glucose (p < 0.001), and the combination of 15 mm glucose and 10 nm IGF-I gave a 52-fold increase above that in the absence of glucose and IGF-I (p < 0.001) similar to that observed previously (Fig. 1). Addition of (Sp)-2′-O-monobutyryl-cAMP (5 μm), a cell permeable PKA agonist (28Ogreid D. Dostmann W. Genieser H.G. Niemann P. Doskeland S.O. Jastorff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), did not show any significant changes in the rate of INS-1 cell [3H]thymidine incorporation at either 15 mmglucose alone or in the additional presence of IGF-I (Table I). However, in the presence of (Rp)-O2′-monobutyryl-cAMP (5 μm), a cell permeable cAMP analogue which inhibits protein kinase-A (PKA) activity (28Ogreid D. Dostmann W. Genieser H.G. Niemann P. Doskeland S.O. Jastorff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), 15 mm glucose-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS-1 cells was inhibited by 87% (p < 0.001; Table I), whereas it was not significantly affected in the additional presence of IGF-I (Table I). This suggested a possible role for PKA in glucose-induced INS-1 cell mitogenesis (29Sjoholm A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this was overcome by addition of IGF-I.Table IThe effect of protein phosphorylation inhibitors on glucose/IGF-I stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS-1 cellsInhibitorPercentage [3H]thymidine incorporation compared to 15 mM glucose controlPercentage [3H]thymidine incorporation compared to 15 mM glucose + 10 nM IGF-1 controlProtein kinase A (Rp)-2′-O-monobutyryl-cAMP (5 μm)6.3 ± 0.7aStatistically significant difference from the equivalent control at p ≤ 0.02.94.2 ± 4.9 (Sp)-2′-O-monobutyryl-cAMP (5 μm)78.7 ± 8.488.6 ± 11.3Protein kinase C Sphingosine (10 μm)37.7 ± 4.6aStatistically significant difference from the equivalent control at p ≤ 0.02.42.9 ± 3.5aStatistically significant difference from the equivalent control at p ≤ 0.02.

https://openalex.org/W2024322753,"Merbarone is a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II that is in clinical trials as an anticancer agent. Despite the potential therapeutic value of this drug, the mechanism by which it blocks topoisomerase II activity has not been delineated. Therefore, to determine the mechanistic basis for the inhibitory action of merbarone, the effects of this drug on individual steps of the catalytic cycle of human topoisomerase IIα were assessed. Concentrations of merbarone that inhibited catalytic activity ≥80% had no effect on either enzyme·DNA binding or ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, the drug was a potent inhibitor of enzyme-mediated DNA scission (in the absence or presence of ATP), and the inhibitory profiles of merbarone for DNA cleavage and relaxation were similar. These data indicate that merbarone acts primarily by blocking topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. Merbarone inhibited DNA scission in a global (rather than site-specific) fashion but did not appear to intercalate into DNA or bind in the minor groove. Since the drug competed with etoposide (a cleavage-enhancing agent that binds directly to topoisomerase II), it is proposed that merbarone exerts its inhibitory effects through interactions with the enzyme and that the drug shares an interaction domain on topoisomerase II with cleavage-enhancing agents.

Among the topoisomerase II-targeted agents currently in clinical use are etoposide, teniposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and amsacrine. These drugs kill cells in an unusual fashion. Rather than inhibiting the overall catalytic activity of the type II enzyme, they act by increasing levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, thus converting this essential enzyme into a potent cellular toxin (1Corbett A.H.

Hence, to distinguish their unique mechanism of action, they are referred to as topoisomerase II “poisons” (11Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second class of drugs that affect the activity of topoisomerase II also appears to have clinical potential (2Liu L. Adv.

Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast to poisons, these agents act by inhibiting the catalytic activity of the enzyme and display no ability to stimulate DNA cleavage. Originally, topoisomerase II “catalytic inhibitors” were defined by antibacterial compounds such as novobiocin and coumermycin (12Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4474-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). These coumarin-based drugs block the DNA strand passage activity of the prokaryotic type II enzyme, DNA gyrase, by interfering with the ability of the enzyme to bind its ATP cofactor (13Sugino A.

Recently, catalytic inhibitors that display high activity against eukaryotic type II topoisomerases have been described. These are typified by drugs such as merbarone (18Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3311-3316PubMed Google Scholar), fostriecin (21Boritzki T.J. Wolfard T.S. Besserer J.A. Jackson R.C. Fry D.W. Biochem.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which reflect a variety of inhibitory mechanisms. Aclarubicin, for example, blocks binding of the enzyme to its DNA substrate, the initial step of the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle (24Sørensen B.S. Sinding J. Andersen A.H. Alsner J. Jensen P.B. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 12). In contrast, ICRF-193 blocks the final step of the catalytic cycle, ATP hydrolysis (25Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This action traps topoisomerase II on the DNA in its closed clamp form and prevents both enzyme release and regeneration. One of the catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase II that has generated the most interest is merbarone (18Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Mong S.M. Bartus J.O. Hertzberg R.P. Johnson R.K. Mattern M.R.

In addition to its inhibitory effects, merbarone has been shown in vitro and in cultured cells to attenuate the DNA cleavage-enhancing properties of topoisomerase II poisons such as teniposide and amsacrine (18Drake F.H.

Therefore, to determine the basis of merbarone inhibition, the effects of the drug on individual steps of the catalytic cycle of human topoisomerase IIα were characterized. Results indicate that merbarone is a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission. Human topoisomerase IIα was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (34Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by the protocol of Kingma et al. (35Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Yeast topoisomerase II was isolated from S. cerevisiae by the procedure of Elsea et al. (36Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y.

Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II was purified from embryonic Kc cells as described by Shelton et al. (38Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calf thymus topoisomerase I was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was prepared as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.35Google Scholar). Hepes was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; proteinase K and SDS were from Merck; bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase, Klenow DNA polymerase, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs, Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase, [α-32P]ATP (∼6000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 or ∼6000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; etoposide and ellipticine (stored at 4 °C as 20 mm stock solutions in 100% Me2SO) as well as ethidium bromide were from Sigma; and fluorescein phosphoramidite was from Glen Research. Merbarone was the generous gift of Dr. Randall K. Johnson (SmithKline Beecham) and was stored at 4 °C as a 20 mm stock solution in 100% Me2SO. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade. DNA relaxation assays were based on the procedure of Osheroff et al. (40Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 3 nm human topoisomerase IIα, 5 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, and 1 mm ATP in a total of 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 135 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaEDTA, and 2.5% glycerol). One microliter of merbarone (or Me2SO for control reactions) was included, so that the final [Me2SO] was 5% (v/v). Reactions were started by the addition of topoisomerase II, incubated 10 min at 37 °C, and stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 0.77% SDS, 77 mmNaEDTA (pH 8.0). Alternatively, assays utilized eitherDrosophila (4 nm) or yeast (6 nm) topoisomerase II and were carried out as described previously (36Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with agarose gel loading buffer (30% sucrose, 0.5% bromphenol blue, and 0.5% xylene cyanole FF in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9)) and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer (100 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA). DNA bands were stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized by UV light, photographed through Kodak 23A and 12 filters with Polaroid type 665 positive/negative film, and quantitated by scanning photographic negatives with an E-C apparatus model EC910 scanning densitometer in conjunction with Hoefer GS-370 Data System software. The intensity of bands in the negative was proportional to the amount of DNA present. The effect of merbarone on topoisomerase II·DNA binding was characterized by two independent techniques. In the first, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was employed (41Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of reaction buffer and contained 10 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA and 0–300 nm human topoisomerase IIα in the presence or absence of 100 μm merbarone (5% final [Me2SO]). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 6 min, loaded directly onto a 1% agarose gel, and subjected to electrophoresis in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA bands were visualized and photographed as described above for relaxation assays. Alternatively, the effect of merbarone on topoisomerase II·DNA binding was monitored by fluorescence anisotropy. Assays were performed at 25 °C on an ISS PC2 spectrofluorometer. A 40-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide (same as utilized for AP site cleavage described below, except that the uracil was replaced by guanine) with fluorescein incorporated at the 5′ terminus of the top strand was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer using fluorescein phosphoramidite. The fluoresceinated DNA substrate was excited at 430 nm with a xenon arc lamp (18 A current) in a 1-cm silica quartz glass cuvette, and emission was monitored through a 530-nm glass cut-off filter (Melles Griot). Binding assays contained 5 nm fluoresceinated DNA oligonucleotide and 0 or 100 μm merbarone (1% final [Me2SO]) in 1.8 ml of fluorescence buffer (10 mm Hepes HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaEDTA). Human topoisomerase IIα (0–50 nm) was titrated into the sample, and anisotropies were determined for each topoisomerase II concentration. Anisotropy binding curves were generated, andKD values were determined by nonlinear least squares regression analysis. DNA cleavage reactions were carried out as described previously (42Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), either in the absence or presence of a nucleoside triphosphate. Assays contained 300 nm human topoisomerase IIα, negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA (5 nm in reactions that lacked nucleotide triphosphate or contained 1 mmAPP(NH)P 1The abbreviations used are: APP(NH)P, adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; bp, base pair. , or 10 nm in reactions that contained 1 mm ATP), and 0–200 μm merbarone (5% final [Me2SO]) in a total of 20 μl of reaction buffer. Reactions were started by the addition of topoisomerase II. Following a 6-min incubation at 37 °C, cleavage intermediates were trapped by the addition of 2 μl of 4% SDS and 2 μl of 250 mm NaEDTA (pH 8.0). Proteinase K was added (2 μl of 0.8 mg/ml), and reactions were incubated 30 min at 45 °C to digest the topoisomerase II. Samples were mixed with loading buffer, heated at 70 °C for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% TAE agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Photography of the gel and quantitation of cleavage products were as described above. DNA cleavage assays that characterized the order of drug (merbarone and etoposide) addition contained 75 nm human topoisomerase IIα, 10 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, and 1 mm ATP in 20 μl of reaction buffer. Due to the presence of both drugs, the final [Me2SO] in these experiments was 6%. As a prelude to DNA cleavage, mixtures were incubated with 20 μm etoposide, 0–400 μm merbarone, or a combination of the two drugs for 2 min at room temperature or 37 °C. As appropriate, the absent drug was added to reaction mixtures, and samples were further incubated for 6 min at 37 °C. DNA cleavage intermediates were trapped, resolved by electrophoresis, and quantitated as above. A unique32P-3′-end-labeled linear DNA substrate was prepared by digesting pBR322 DNA with EcoRI, labeling with [α-32P]ATP and Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and digesting the labeled product withPstI. The resulting 3609-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis using DE81 ion exchange paper (Whatman) (36Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage reactions contained 6 nm labeled 3609-bp DNA substrate, 300 nm human topoisomerase IIα, 1 mm ATP, and 0 or 100 μm merbarone (5% final [Me2SO]) in 20 μl of reaction buffer. Reactions were started by adding topoisomerase II and carried out as described in the preceding section on DNA cleavage. Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer. The gel was dehydrated by blotting with paper towels and dried under partial vacuum at 50 °C. Imaging and data analysis were performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. A double-stranded 40-bp DNA oligonucleotide (residues 87–126 of plasmid pBR322 (43Sutcliffe J.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 43: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar)) that contained a position-specific apurinic site (44Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) within the context of a preexisting topoisomerase II cleavage site was employed (45Sander M. Hsieh T.S.

A uracil (shown below in bold) was incorporated into the bottom strand. The sequences of the top and bottom strands, respectively, were 5′-TGAAATCTAACAATG↓CGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGGTGCCGAGGATGACGATG↓AUCGCATTGTTAGATTTCA-3′. Sites of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are denoted by thearrows. The top strand was 32P-labeled on its 5′ terminus with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and oligonucleotides were gel-purified (44Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and annealed (46Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

An apurinic site was generated in the oligonucleotide substrate by treatment with uracil-DNA glycosylase (44Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Reactions contained 150 nm human topoisomerase IIα, 100 nm apurinic site-containing 40-mer DNA, and 0–400 μm merbarone (5% final [Me2SO]) in a total of 20 μl of 10 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.9), 135 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaEDTA, and 2.5% glycerol. Reactions were started by the addition of topoisomerase II, incubated 10 min at 37 °C, and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 4% SDS and 2 μl of 250 mm NaEDTA. Proteinase K was added (2 μl of 1.6 mg/ml), and reactions were incubated 20 min at 37 °C. Cleavage products were ethanol-precipitated twice and resuspended in 5 μl of 95% formamide, 3% sucrose, 1 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanole FF. Products were subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing 7m urea, 14% polyacrylamide sequencing gel in TBE buffer. The gel was fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 s and dried. DNA cleavage products were quantitated by analysis on a PhosphorImager. ATPase assays were performed as described by Osheroff et al. (40Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis reactions contained 50 nm human topoisomerase IIα, 40 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol stock), and 0 or 200 μm merbarone (5% final [Me2SO]) in a total of 60 μl of reaction buffer. Reactions were started by addition of topoisomerase II and incubated at 37 °C. Samples (2 μl) were removed at intervals up to 16 min and spotted on polyethyleneimine-impregnated thin layer cellulose chromatography plates (J. T. Baker Inc.). Plates were developed by chromatography in freshly made 400 mmNH4HCO3 and analyzed by autoradiography. Radioactive areas corresponding to free inorganic phosphate released by ATP hydrolysis were cut out and quantitated by scintillation counting. Interactions between merbarone and DNA were assessed by two independent techniques. First, the ability of the drug to intercalate into plasmid DNA was determined by a topoisomerase I unwinding assay (47Robinson M.J. Martin B.A. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Moynihan M. Sutcliffe J.A. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 5 nm relaxed or negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA and 10 units of topoisomerase I. Assays were carried out in the presence or absence of 100 μm merbarone, etoposide, or ellipticine in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were treated with 3 μl of 250 mm EDTA and extracted with phenol/chloroform. Aqueous samples (20 μl) were treated with 2 μl of 2.5% SDS, mixed with 2 μl of agarose gel loading buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer. DNA bands were stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized by UV light, and quantitated as described above. Second, an ethidium displacement fluorescence assay (48Baguley B.C. Falkenhaug E.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 49Cain B.F. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1978; 21: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was employed to determine whether merbarone binds in the minor groove of DNA. Fluorescence emission spectra (λmax = 605 nm, excitation wavelength 510 nm) were obtained at 25 °C on an ISS PC2 spectrofluorometer. Assays contained 1 μm ethidium bromide, 0–100 μm merbarone, and 5 nmdouble-stranded 40-mer oligonucleotide in 2 ml of fluorescence buffer. The oligonucleotide employed for this study was the same as utilized for AP site cleavage (see above), except that the uracil was replaced by guanine. Merbarone (Fig. 1) is a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II (18Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Mong S.M. Bartus J.O. Hertzberg R.P. Johnson R.K. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K.

The effects of this drug on the activity of human topoisomerase IIα (which represents the major topoisomerase II isoform present in rapidly proliferating human cells) as well as the type II enzymes from Drosophila and yeast are shown in Fig. 2. Merbarone was considerably more effective against the mammalian type II enzyme than it was against topoisomerase II from lower eukaryotes. While the drug inhibited relaxation of negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA by human topoisomerase IIα with an IC50 of ∼40 μm, little inhibition was observed with either theDrosophila or yeast enzyme up to 100 μmmerbarone. The IC50 values for these latter type II enzymes were ∼350 and ∼700 μm merbarone, respectively (not shown). Although the inhibition of topoisomerase II by merbarone is believed to contribute to its efficacy against cancer cells, the mechanism by which this drug blocks the function of the type II enzyme is not known. Therefore, to determine the basis for merbarone action, the ability of this drug to inhibit individual steps of the catalytic cycle (41Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 12) of human topoisomerase IIα was assessed. It has been suggested that merbarone inhibits the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II by blocking its ability to bind to its DNA substrate (33Chen M. Beck W.T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5946-5953PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, two independent approaches were utilized to characterize the effects of the drug on enzyme·DNA binding. One hundred micromolar merbarone, a concentration that inhibited catalytic activity ∼80%, was employed for both. In the first approach, interactions between human topoisomerase IIα and negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA were monitored by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As determined by the upshift of bound DNA to the gel origin, merbarone did not impair topoisomerase II-DNA interactions (Fig. 3). If anything, levels of DNA binding appeared to be slightly higher in the presence of the drug. In the second approach, interactions between human topoisomerase IIα and a double-stranded 40-mer oligonucleotide that contained a single cleavage site were monitored by fluorescence anisotropy. As seen in Fig. 4, merbarone had no effect on enzyme·oligonucleotide binding. The apparent KDvalues calculated in the absence or presence of the drug were 43 ± 9 or 45 ± 10 nm topoisomerase IIα, respectively. Since merbarone does not interfere"

Using the technique of differential display, the adrenomedullin gene was observed to be differentially expressed in developing rat heart. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the level of adrenomedullin mRNA was significantly higher in adult ventricular cardiac muscle as compared with embryonic day 17 ventricular cardiac muscle. Adrenomedullin receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed throughout development of the ventricular heart. Two potential hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) consensus binding sites were identified in the mouse adrenomedullin promoter at –1095 and –770 nucleotides from the transcription start site. Exposure of cultured adult rat ventricular cardiac myocytes to hypoxia (1% O2) resulted in a significant, time-dependent increase in adrenomedullin mRNA levels. Transfection studies revealed that the 5′-flanking sequence of adrenomedullin was capable of mediating a hypoxia-inducible increase in transcription. Mutation of the putative HIF-1 consensus binding sites revealed that the major regulatory sequence that mediates the hypoxia-inducible transcriptional response is located at –1095. These data demonstrate that the adrenomedullin gene is developmentally regulated in ventricular cardiomyocytes, that adrenomedullin transcription can be induced by hypoxia, and that this response is primarily mediated by HIF-1 consensus sites in the adrenomedullin promoter.

The Adm peptide is expressed in a variety of rat tissues including the heart, adrenal medulla, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, spleen, thyroid, and liver (2Washimine H. Kitamura K. Ichiki Y.

The rat Adm peptide consists of 50 amino acids and shows slight structural homology to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family (4Muff R. Born W. Fischer J.A. Eur. J.

Drugs. 1995; 49: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The increased vasodilation was associated with a slight increase in glomerular filtration rate and natriuresis in the renal system (8Hirata Y. Hayakawa H. Suzuki Y. Suzuki E. Ikenouchi H. Kohmoto O.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), we analyzed differential gene expression in the developing rat heart. The RNA samples analyzed were isolated from embryonic day 17; neonatal days 10, 17, and 21; and adult ventricular cardiac muscle. We observed 23 differentially expressed genes in this developmental series, and 15 were successfully reamplified and cloned. One of these clones was identified as the Adm gene.In this study, we have determined that the expression of the Adm gene increases significantly in the developing rat heart, while the AdmR mRNA levels remained relatively constant throughout development. Furthermore, Adm mRNA levels increased in cultured adult ventricular cardiac myocytes in response to hypoxia as a function of time. Studies using an Adm promoter-luciferase reporter construct indicated that the increase in Adm mRNA occurred as a result of increased transcription in response to hypoxia. These studies suggest a potential role for Adm in the development of the heart and in the response of cardiomyocytes to hypoxic stress.DISCUSSIONUsing differential display and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, we have determined that the expression of the Adm gene is developmentally regulated in the rat heart. Our observation is in accordance with previous immunocytochemical data presented by Montuengaet al. (27Montuenga L.M. Martı́nez A. Miller M.J. Unsworth E.J. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1-12Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, they show that the heart is the first organ to express the Adm peptide in both the mouse and rat, with expression first being observed as early as embryonic day eight (27Montuenga L.M. Martı́nez A. Miller M.J. Unsworth E.J. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1-12Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they show that localization of the Adm peptide corresponds to the degree of cellular differentiation in several organs (27Montuenga L.M. Martı́nez A. Miller M.J. Unsworth E.J. Cuttitta F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1-12Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In our studies, Adm mRNA expression increases during cardiac muscle development, indicating a possible role for the Adm peptide in growth and differentiation. Whether Adm plays a role in heart development and, if so, what that role might be remains to be determined.The increased expression of Adm in hypoxic brain tissue (28Wang X. Yue T.L. Barone F.C. White R.F. Clark R.K. Willette R.N. Sulpizio A.C. Aiyar N.V. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Feuerstein G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11480-11484Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) suggested, to us, a role for Adm in the hypoxic response of the heart. Recent studies have shown an increase in blood levels of Adm peptide in human congestive heart failure (29Jougasaki M. Rodeheffer R.J. Redfield M.M. Yamamoto K. Wei C.-M. McKinley L.J. Burnett Jr., J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Kato J. Kobayashi K. Etoh T. Tanaka M. Kitamura K. Imamura T. Koiwaya Y. Kangawa K. Eto T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and, furthermore, that this Adm peptide secretion originates from the heart and is correlated with the severity of the heart disease (31Nishikimi T. Horio T. Sasaki T. Yoshihara F. Takishita S. Miyata A. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiac Adm peptide synthesis and secretion has been demonstrated to be induced in a rat heart failure model (31Nishikimi T. Horio T. Sasaki T. Yoshihara F. Takishita S. Miyata A. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these studies suggest a possible involvement for Adm in the response of the heart to ischemic stress. Our preliminary studies showed that cultured adult ventricular cardiomyocytes secrete the Adm peptide in response to hypoxia.2 In addition, we show here that cardiomyocyte Adm mRNA levels increase temporally in response to hypoxia. This response reached a maximum at 12 h of hypoxia and was approximately 2.3-fold greater than the normoxic control (Fig. 4). Results from our transfection studies indicate that this increase is regulated by the Adm promoter. We found Adm promoter activity to increase 1.8-fold over control after 12 h of hypoxia, as assessed using a luciferase reporter. Although this increase in transcription in response to hypoxia appears to be modest, our data are consistent with that of other hypoxia-responsive genes such as VEGF (25Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), Src kinase (32Seko Y. Tobe K. Takahashi N. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Fyn kinase (32Seko Y. Tobe K. Takahashi N. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and Epo (33McGary E.C. Rondon I.J. Beckman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8628-8634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), where 1.7–4.0-fold increases in transcription have been observed. In contrast, the AdmR mRNA levels decreased somewhat with increasing time of exposure to hypoxia.Our studies provide the first evidence that the Adm promoter contains HIF-1 sites that are capable of responding to hypoxia. Hypoxic regulatory elements have been identified in both the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes (24Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the 5′-flanking region of the Adm gene was capable of conferring hypoxia responsiveness in transient transfection assays performed in HL-1 cells. Sequence analysis of the mouse Adm 5′-flanking region has revealed the presence of two potential HIF-1 binding sites at –1095 and –770 upstream from the transcription start site. These two sites are 100% identical to the HIF-1 core binding site, 5′-ACGT-3′ (24Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and similar to the defined HIF-1 consensus binding site, 5′-BACGTGSK-3′ (23Forsythe J.A. Bing-hua J. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3165) Google Scholar, 24Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (B = C, G, or T; S = C or G; K = G or T). Mutation analyses of the HIF-1 sites in the mouse Adm 5′-flanking region revealed that there are two functional hypoxia-responsive sites (Fig. 7) and that their disruption leads to a substantial decrease (54%) in the transcriptional response of Adm to hypoxia. We found that the HIF-1 binding site at –1095 was largely responsible for the observed hypoxic response of Adm and that the HIF-1 binding site at –770 was only responsible for a small portion of the hypoxic response. Interestingly, mutation of HIF binding sites at –1095 and –770 were not additive and failed to abolish all transcriptional activity in response to hypoxia. The lack of a complete attenuation of the transcriptional hypoxia response suggests that other as yet unidentified cis-acting elements may be responsible for the full transcriptional response of Adm. A tripartite hypoxia-inducible enhancer has recently been proposed in which elimination of one of these sites in the Epo promoter resulted in a decrease but not a total elimination of the hypoxic response (34Semenza G.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This tripartite enhancer has been proposed for the two other well characterized hypoxia-responsive genes (VEGF and lactate dehydrogenase), and further functional studies may elucidate the presence of such an enhancer in the Adm promoter.The physiological reason for the increase in cardiomyocyte Adm mRNA expression and peptide secretion in response to hypoxia is not clear, but this response may provide a compensatory mechanism for the ischemic heart. Adm is a potent hypotensive peptide (1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be important in the regulation of both the renal and cardiovascular systems (35Ishimitsu T. Nishikimi T. Saito Y. Kitamura K. Eto T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Omae T. Matsuoka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2158-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In addition to decreasing blood pressure, the Adm peptide is capable of increasing the cardiac index and stroke volume without a subsequent change in the heart rate (9Ishiyama Y. Kitamura K. Ichiki Y. Sakata J. Kida O. Kangawa K. Eto T. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to clarify the exact physiological role of the Adm peptide in the response of the heart to hypoxia.

Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). The Adm peptide is expressed in a variety of rat tissues including the heart, adrenal medulla, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, spleen, thyroid, and liver (2Washimine H. Kitamura K. Ichiki Y.

Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Eto T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The rat Adm peptide consists of 50 amino acids and shows slight structural homology to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family (4Muff R. Born W. Fischer J.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 133: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is capable of acting through the CGRP receptor and the recently cloned Adm receptor (AdmR) (5Kapas S. Catt K.J. Clark A.J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25344-25347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The Adm peptide has been implicated as an important regulator in the renal and cardiovascular systems, where it has been observed to produce a dose-dependent increase in vasodilation (6Richards A.M. Nicholls M.G. Lewis L. Lainchbury J.G. Clin. Sci. 1996; 91: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Eto T. Drugs. 1995; 49: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The increased vasodilation was associated with a slight increase in glomerular filtration rate and natriuresis in the renal system (8Hirata Y. Hayakawa H. Suzuki Y. Suzuki E. Ikenouchi H. Kohmoto O. Kimura K. Eto T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Omata M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 790-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cardiovascular system, Ishiyama et al. (9Ishiyama Y. Kitamura K. Ichiki Y. Sakata J. Kida O. Kangawa K. Eto T. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported that the Adm peptide, in addition to producing a fall in blood pressure, elicited an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume without a subsequent change in heart rate. Using the differential display technique (10Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4687) Google Scholar, 11Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), we analyzed differential gene expression in the developing rat heart. The RNA samples analyzed were isolated from embryonic day 17; neonatal days 10, 17, and 21; and adult ventricular cardiac muscle. We observed 23 differentially expressed genes in this developmental series, and 15 were successfully reamplified and cloned. One of these clones was identified as the Adm gene. In this study, we have determined that the expression of the Adm gene increases significantly in the developing rat heart, while the AdmR mRNA levels remained relatively constant throughout development. Furthermore, Adm mRNA levels increased in cultured adult ventricular cardiac myocytes in response to hypoxia as a function of time. Studies using an Adm promoter-luciferase reporter construct indicated that the increase in Adm mRNA occurred as a result of increased transcription in response to hypoxia. These studies suggest a potential role for Adm in the development of the heart and in the response of cardiomyocytes to hypoxic stress.

Mutation analyses of the HIF-1 sites in the mouse Adm 5′-flanking region revealed that there are two functional hypoxia-responsive sites (Fig. 7) and that their disruption leads to a substantial decrease (54%) in the transcriptional response of Adm to hypoxia. We found that the HIF-1 binding site at –1095 was largely responsible for the observed hypoxic response of Adm and that the HIF-1 binding site at –770 was only responsible for a small portion of the hypoxic response. Interestingly, mutation of HIF binding sites at –1095 and –770 were not additive and failed to abolish all transcriptional activity in response to hypoxia. The lack of a complete attenuation of the transcriptional hypoxia response suggests that other as yet unidentified cis-acting elements may be responsible for the full transcriptional response of Adm. A tripartite hypoxia-inducible enhancer has recently been proposed in which elimination of one of these sites in the Epo promoter resulted in a decrease but not a total elimination of the hypoxic response (34Semenza G.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This tripartite enhancer has been proposed for the two other well characterized hypoxia-responsive genes (VEGF and lactate dehydrogenase), and further functional studies may elucidate the presence of such an enhancer in the Adm promoter. The physiological reason for the increase in cardiomyocyte Adm mRNA expression and peptide secretion in response to hypoxia is not clear, but this response may provide a compensatory mechanism for the ischemic heart. Adm is a potent hypotensive peptide (1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be important in the regulation of both the renal and cardiovascular systems (35Ishimitsu T. Nishikimi T.

In addition to decreasing blood pressure, the Adm peptide is capable of increasing the cardiac index and stroke volume without a subsequent change in the heart rate (9Ishiyama Y. Kitamura K. Ichiki Y. Sakata J. Kida O. Kangawa K. Eto T. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Here, we describe the GTPase specificity of RGS12 and identify four alternatively spliced forms of human RGS12 mRNA. Two RGS12 isoforms of 6.3 and 5.7 kilobases (kb), encoding both an N-terminal PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain and the RGS domain, are expressed in most tissues, with highest levels observed in testis, ovary, spleen, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus. The 5.7-kb isoform has an alternative 3′ end encoding a putative C-terminal PDZ domain docking site. Two smaller isoforms, of 3.1 and 3.7 kb, which lack the PDZ domain and encode the RGS domain with and without the alternative 3′ end, respectively, are most abundantly expressed in brain, kidney, thymus, and prostate. In vitro biochemical assays indicate that RGS12 is a GTPase-activating protein for Gi class α subunits. Biochemical and interaction trap experiments suggest that the RGS12 N terminus acts as a classical PDZ domain, binding selectively to C-terminal (A/S)-T-X-(L/V) motifs as found within both the interleukin-8 receptor B (CXCR2) and the alternative 3′ exon form of RGS12. The presence of an alternatively spliced PDZ domain within RGS12 suggests a mechanism by which RGS proteins may target specific G-protein-coupled receptor systems for desensitization.

In vitro biochemical analyses soon established that this gene family encodes potent accelerators (“GAPs”) of the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of G-protein α subunits, revealing a molecular mechanism by which RGS proteins drive G-proteins into their inactive GDP-bound form and hence down-regulate GPCR signal transductionin vivo (reviewed in Refs. 4Dohlman H.G.

However, the mechanisms by which individual RGS proteins desensitize pathways activated by particular GPCRs remain to be elucidated. Tightly regulated transcription has been described for RGS1 (3Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kerhl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar),RGS2 (6Siderovski D.P.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and palmitoylation of the cysteine-rich N terminus of Gα-interacting protein (GAIP) has also been observed (8De Vries L. Elenko E.

We and others have hypothesized that regions outside the RGS fold contribute to regulation of Gα GAP activity and/or targeting of individual RGS proteins to particular receptor signaling pathways (4Dohlman H.G.

Here, we report the GAP activity of RGS12 and identify a PDZ-like N-terminal sequence within two splice forms. PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules that bind to three or four amino acid motifs at the extreme carboxyl termini of target proteins (reviewed in Ref. 11Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). PDZ domains of many proteins localize enzymatic activities and other protein-protein interaction domains to specific submembranous regions. Members of the PSD-93/95 protein family cluster NMDA receptors, nitric oxide synthase activity, and Shaker K+ channels at neuronal synapses (12Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The protein tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1 interacts via a PDZ domain with the C terminus of CD95, receptor of the apoptosis-inducing Fas ligand (13Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Most recently, the five-PDZ domain-containing protein InaD was shown to organize the G-protein-coupled phototransduction machinery inDrosophila, with individual PDZ domains binding to phospholipase C, transient receptor potential ion channel, and protein kinase C subunits (14Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y.M. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid, surface plasmon resonance, and protein overlay analyses, we demonstrate specific binding of the RGS12 PDZ domain to C-terminal (A/S)-T-X-(L/V) motifs. Our findings suggest that, by virtue of an alternatively spliced N terminus, specific isoforms of RGS12 may localize in vivo to site(s) of specific G-protein-coupled signaling complexes. In addition, affinity of the RGS12 PDZ domain for an alternatively spliced C-terminal motif within RGS12 itself presents the possibility of RGS12 autoregulation by intra- and/or intermolecular association. Oligonucleotides flanking both the open reading frame (sense primer 5′-ATATGGCTCCAAGGGAACAATGAGACG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TACGGGGCCAAGGTGGAGGGATCAG-3′) and 3′-UTR of hRGS12 (sense primer 5′-ATCCCTCCACCTTGGCCCCGTAAGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTGCTGGGAGCCTCGCCTCAGTTTC-3′) were designed based on cosmid sequences (9Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and used to amplify the hRGS12 cDNA from 0.5 ng of Marathon-ReadyTM human brain cDNA (CLONTECH) using the ExpandTM long template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously forhRGS16 (15Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Siderovski D.P. Gene. 1998; 206: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were then cloned and sequenced as described previously (15Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Siderovski D.P. Gene. 1998; 206: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments from rat RGS12 encoding amino acids 1–94 and 664–885, and from human RGS12 encoding amino acids 1–110, were each amplified by PCR, cloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), sequenced, and transformed into Escherichia colistrain BL21 (Stratagene). Expression of GST-rRGS12-(1–94), GST-rRGS12-(664–885), and GST-hRGS12-(1–110) fusion proteins was induced with 0.8 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C in bacterial cultures at an OD600 nm of 0.7. Cells were lysed by lysozyme treatment and sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and cleared by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer and the column was washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl), concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at −80 °C. cDNA fragments from rat RGS12 encoding amino acids 1–440, 440–1108, and 1–1387 were each amplified by PCR, cloned into the thioredoxin-hexahistidine tag (Trx) fusion vector pET32b (Invitrogen), sequenced, and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). Expression of Trx-rRGS12-(1–440), Trx-rRGS12-(440–1108), and Trx-rRGS12-(1–1387) was induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 8 h at 26 °C. Cells were lysed as above in Trx-lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was passed through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with Trx-lysis buffer, and the hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins were eluted using an imidazole concentration gradient and dialyzed against storage buffer. G-protein α subunits Gsα, myr-Giα1, and myr-Goα were expressed and purified as described elsewhere (16Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A point mutant of Gqα, Arg-183 to Cys, which reduces without abolishing the intrinsic GTPase activity, was purified from Sf9 cells co-infected with Gqα(R183C), Gβ1, and Gγ2 baculoviruses (17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Recombinant RGS4 was purified from E. coli as described previously (18Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant RGS2 from Sf9 cells will be described elsewhere. 2T. Ingi, A. M. Krumins, P. Chidiac, G. M. Brothers, S. Chung, B. E. Snow, C. A. Barnes, A. A. Lanahan, D. P. Siderovski, E. M. Ross, A. G. Gilman, and P. F. Worley, submitted for publication. Purified Gqα(R183C) was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (specific activity 500 cpm/pmol) for 3 h at 20 °C in the following buffer (150 μl final volume): 10 μm GTP, 5.5 mm CHAPS, 50 mmsodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm (NH2)2SO4, and 4% glycerol. Other Gα subunits were loaded in the same manner in the absence of MgSO4; Gsα and myr-Goα subunits were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C, and myr-Giα1 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Following loading, reaction mixtures were exchanged by Sephadex G-25 chromatography into 1 mm CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 0.018 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Protein eluants were then diluted 4-fold in ice-cold OG buffer (0.1% octyl glucopyranoside, 20 mm sodium HEPES pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm MgSO4 (for Gqα only), 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm GTP). GAP activity was initiated by adding Gα-GTP to RGS protein sample and OG buffer (supplemented with 9 mm MgSO4 when Gsα, myr-Goα, or myr-Giα1 were used). Timed, 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn and quenched with 900 μl of a 5% (w/v) slurry of Norit A. After centrifugation, 600 μl of supernatant was counted for32P content. Human MTN blots (CLONTECH), containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from multiple adult human tissues and brain regions, were hybridized consecutively with a 686-bp hRGS123′-UTR cDNA probe (nucleotides 4185–4870 of GenBank AF035152), a 330-bp cDNA probe spanning the entire PDZ domain (nucleotides 55–384 of GenBank AF035152), and a 350-bp alternative 3′end probe (nucleotides 2441–2790 of GenBank AF030109). Blots were then hybridized with a 1.3-kb fragment of human GAPDH cDNA to correct for RNA loading. Probe labelings and blot hybridizations were performed as described previously (15Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Siderovski D.P. Gene. 1998; 206: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GST-hβ2AR tail (80 amino acids) and GST-hCXCR2 tail (40 amino acids) fusion proteins were produced via PCR amplification of the tails and insertion of the PCR products into a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutation to the hCXCR2 tail was induced by the use of a mutant sequence oligonucleotide during PCR and confirmed by sequencing. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described above. GST and GST fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with recombinant thioredoxin-rRGS12-(1–440) fusion protein. Bound protein was detected using an anti-thioredoxin mouse monoclonal antibody, 3G. M. Brothers and D. P. Siderovski, unpublished data. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on the BIAcore 2000 (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). N-terminally biotinylated, synthetic polypeptides were bound to a streptavidin-coated sensor surface (Sensor Chip SA) as per manufacturer's instructions to a density of 300 response units (RU). GST and thioredoxin fusion proteins were 2-fold serially diluted in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) and injected at a 10 μl/min flow rate; surface regeneration was performed by 10-μl injections of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH at a 20 μl/min flow rate. Relative binding to test peptides (test) was calculated based on the increase in response units relative to simultaneous measurement of binding to wild-type CXCR2 peptide (wt) and negative control peptide (ctrl) surfaces at 286 s after the start of a 300 s total protein injection: relative binding = (RU286stest − RU286sctrl)/(RU286swt− RU286sctrl). Yeast strain PJ69–4A and the plasmids pAS1 and pACTII have been described (19James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Rat RGS12 cDNA (amino acids 1–94) was amplified from rat brain cDNA using PCR, cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced, and subcloned in-frame downstream of the Gal4p DNA binding domain (DBD) (amino acids 1–147) in pAS1 using the EcoRI and SalI sites. cDNA encoding amino acids 322–359 of the rat high affinity interleukin-8 receptor B (rCXCR2; Swiss-Prot no. P35407) was amplified from rat brain cDNA using PCR, cloned and sequenced in pCR2.1, and subcloned in-frame downstream of the Gal4p activation domain (AD) (amino acids 768–881) in pACTII using the EcoRI andXhoI sites. Nonsense and missense mutations to the rCXCR2 C-terminal tail were engineered within the pCR2.1 plasmid using QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), sequenced, and subcloned into pACTII as above. Yeast strain PJ69–4A was co-transformed with pAS1- and pACTII-based plasmids using the Gietz lab transformation kit (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and plated on synthetic complete drop-out medium (SC) lacking tryptophan and leucine (BIO 101, Vista, CA). Six independent yeast colonies from at least two independent transformations were then plated onto SC lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine, supplemented with 2 mm3-aminotriazole. We recently described the cloning of Rgs12 from rat brain using a degenerate PCR strategy directed toward conserved regions of the RGS domain (9Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether RGS12 is capable of stimulating the GTPase activity of G-protein α subunits, the conserved RGS domain of rRGS12 (amino acids 664–885) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. The ability of GST-rRGS12-(664–885) protein to enhance Gα GTP hydrolysis was measured in single turnover assays using [γ-32P]GTP-loaded, recombinant Giα1, Goα, Gqα, and Gsα proteins. The slow rate of GDP dissociation and GTP binding observed for wild-type Gqα protein relative to its intrinsic GTPase activity makes it difficult to prepare GTP-Gqα for use in single turnover studies (21Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a GTPase-deficient mutant of Gqα (R183C) was employed; this protein serves as an adequate substrate for detection of the GAP activities of RGS2 and RGS4.2 The GTPase activities of myr-Giα1 and myr-Goα proteins were increased by the addition of GST-rRGS12-(664–885) protein, albeit modestly in comparison to recombinant, full-length RGS4 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, Gsα and Gqα(R183C) GTPase activities were not enhanced by RGS12 (Fig. 1, C andD). Partially purified preparations of thioredoxin-rRGS12-(1–1387) and thioredoxin-rRGS12-(440–1108) fusion proteins also demonstrated Giα1 and Goα GAP activity (data not shown). Based on thesein vitro results, we conclude that RGS12 is a bona fide member of the RGS family, in that it acts as a GAP for at least Gi class α subunits. In our initial report of the cloning of rat Rgs12, we also identified the human ortholog (9Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) within cosmid sequences mapping to human chromosome 4p16.3. PCR was used to amplify both the predicted open-reading frame and 3′-UTR of hRGS12 from human brain cDNA. These two cDNA clones overlapped to form a contiguous sequence encompassing 4870 nucleotides and encoding 1376 amino acids (GenBank AF035152). Comparison of rat and human RGS12 protein sequences previously revealed nearly identical RGS domains and a highly conserved N terminus with similarity to a C-terminal region of mouse rhophilin (9Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); subsequent sequence and biochemical analyses (see below) indicate that the latter region encodes a PDZ domain. During the cloning ofrRgs12 cDNA, we observed an alternatively spliced variant lacking the PDZ domain (GenBank AF035151); an alternative exon 1 with a unique 5′-UTR was found to replace exons 1 and 2 of the longerrRgs12 cDNA (GenBank U92280). Sequence of several human expressed sequence tags suggests that alternative exon usage also occurs in the same position in human RGS12 (e.g.GenBank N31659 and AA455449). To explore the tissue distribution of human RGS12 mRNA isoforms containing or lacking the PDZ domain region, Northern blot analyses were performed with probes specific to either the 3′-UTR or the PDZ domain. Hybridization of the 3′-UTR cDNA probe to poly(A)+ RNA prepared from various human tissues (Fig. 2 A) and brain regions (Fig. 2 B) revealed two major hRGS12 transcripts of 6.3 and 3.7 kb. The 6.3-kb transcript was expressed abundantly in spleen, testis, ovary, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus, whereas the 3.7-kb transcript was most abundant in whole brain, kidney, thymus, and prostate, and detected at lower levels in all other tissues examined. Within specific brain regions, the 3.7-kb mRNA was most abundant in the cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, putamen, amyglada, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus. Hybridizing the same Northern blots with a PDZ domain-specific probe revealed twohRGS12 transcripts of 6.3 and 5.7 kb (Fig. 2, Aand B); the absence of hybridization to lower molecular weight mRNA indicates that the 3.7-kb hRGS12 transcript corresponds to an isoform lacking the PDZ domain. The 6.3-kb mRNA detected by the PDZ domain-specific probe corresponds to the size and tissue distribution of the 6.3-kb transcript detected by the 3′-UTR probe. The additional, 5.7-kb transcript was observed in both the same tissue distribution and abundance as seen for the 6.3-kb transcript. To determine how the 5.7- and 6.3-kb isoforms differed, the sequence of human RGS12 was compared with the GenBank data base. Alignments to the predicted amino acid sequences of human expressed sequence tags (e.g. GenBank AA523013) and several otherhRGS12 cDNA clones (e.g. GenBank AF030109 andAF030111) revealed several isoforms of RGS12 possessing an alternative 3′ end. Alternative splicing removes the last four amino acids of RGS12 (GenBank AF035152) and inserts an additional 75 amino acids of open-reading frame and an alternative 3′-UTR. Hybridization of Northern blots with a probe specific for the alternative 3′ end detected hRGS12 mRNA of 5.7 and 3.1 kb (Fig. 2 A and B), with the size and tissue distribution of the 5.7-kb transcript identical to that detected with the PDZ domain-specific probe. The 3.1-kb isoform was observed to be expressed with the same tissue distribution and abundance as the 3.7-kb isoform. These data indicate the presence of at least four alternatively spliced isoforms of hRGS12, containing or lacking an N-terminal PDZ domain, and encoding one of two alternative C termini (Fig. 2 C). Alternative splicing of the N terminus of human and rat RGS12 suggests that this region may be functionally important. Sequence analysis revealed highest homology of this region to the PDZ domains of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF; Fig. 3 A), a protein that has recently been shown to bind the C-terminal tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor (22Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether RGS12 might also bind the tail of β2AR or other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Full-length and truncated forms of human and rat RGS12 were expressed as GST or thioredoxin fusion proteins and their binding to various peptides was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Streptavidin-coated biosensor surfaces were pre-adsorbed with N-terminally biotinylated, synthetic peptides encompassing the last 12 amino acids of various GPCRs. Neither thioredoxin-rRGS12-(1–1387), thioredoxin-rRGS12-(1–440), nor GST-rRGS12-(1–94) fusion proteins bound appreciably to a biosensor surface coated with rat β1- or β2-adrenergic receptor tail peptides. However, the RGS12 fusion proteins did bind the C terminus of the rat interleukin-8 receptor B (rCXCR2; Fig. 3 B and data not shown). GST and thioredoxin proteins alone did not bind any peptide surface tested, whereas full-length NHERF and NHERF domain 1 proteins bound both the rat β2AR and CXCR2 tail peptides (data not shown). We tested the C-terminal-specific nature of this interaction in a protein blot overlay using a point mutant of the CXCR2 C-terminal motif. Thioredoxin-rRGS12-(1–440) protein bound a GST-hCXCR2 tail fusion protein in blot overlay experiments but failed to interact with either GST alone or GST-β2AR tail (Fig. 3 C); mutation of Leu to Ala at the terminal position within the hCXCR2 tail (L360A) abolished all binding. Specificity for the extreme C terminus of CXCR2 was also shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Rat RGS12 PDZ domain fused to the Gal4p transcription factor DBD and wild-type or mutated rCXCR2 tails fused to the Gal4p AD were expressed together in a yeast strain containing HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes under the control of the GAL1 and GAL2promoters, respectively (19James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth on selective media lacking both histidine and adenine was compared with a positive control strain co-expressing the strongly interacting yeast proteins Snf1p and Snf4p (23Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) and a negative control strain co-expressing solely the Gal4p DBD and AD proteins. Co-expression of rRGS12 PDZ domain with wild-type rCXCR2 receptor tail allowed prototrophic growth (TableI); however, truncation of the last five C-terminal amino acids of the rCXCR2 tail (Δ355–359), or mutation of the −2 or terminal residues, abolished the interaction. Several missense mutations at the −1 position within the rCXCR2 tail did not disrupt the interaction, consistent with previous reports of PDZ domain binding specificity (24Songyang Z. Fanning A.S.

Open table in a new tab We were intrigued by the selectivity shown by RGS12 for threonine at the −2 position of the CXCR2 tail, as removal of the Cβ methyl group by mutation of threonine to serine was observed to abolish completely the interaction in yeast (Table I). To confirm this specificity, we tested three different rat metabotropic glutamate GPCR tails with Ser/Thr-rich carboxyl termini ending in S-(S/T)-L, of which MGR1α and MGR5 interact with the PDZ domain of the neuron-specific protein Homer (25Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The lack of binding of GST-rRGS12-(1–94) to these three MGR tail peptides, as measured by SPR (Table II, A), confirms the preference of RGS12 for the motif T-X-Lversus S-X-L. While necessary, the C-terminal T-X-L motif alone is not the sole determinant of RGS12 PDZ domain binding, as interaction with phospholipase C β1 and β3 carboxyl termini, both possessing the T-X-L motif, was at least 4-fold weaker than with the CXCR2 tail (Table II, A and B). Alanine/serine scanning mutagenesis of the last six residues of human CXCR2 tail peptide revealed the most important residues for hRGS12 PDZ binding specificity as the −3, −2, and 0 positions (S-T-X-L), with lesser contributions from the −4 and −5 positions (Table II, B). In addition, the failure of GST-hRGS12PDZ-(1–110) to bind amide-blocked C-terminal CXCR2 peptides confirms a critical role for the free carboxylic acid moiety in the binding interaction, as previously observed for other PDZ domains (26Doyle D.A.

Open table in a new tab The predicted C terminus of the alternative 3′ end splice isoform of hRGS12 is similar to that of human CXCR2, with both tails conforming to a consensus of (T/S)-S-(A/G)-H-X-(A/S)-T-X-(L/V). We therefore tested binding of the human RGS12 PDZ domain to synthetic peptides encompassing the last 12 amino acids of the two, alternative carboxyl termini of RGS12. Although no binding was detected to the T-S-R-F C terminus conserved between human and rat RGS12 (hRGS12Tail1; Table II, B), GST-hRGS12PDZ-(1–110) protein was shown to bind the A-T-F-V C-terminal RGS12 peptide (hRGS12Tail2; Table II, B). While a pattern search of the Swiss-Prot data base identified only CXCR2 as terminating with a polypeptide sequence conforming to the (T/S)-S-(A/G)-H-X-(A/S)-T-X-(L/V) motif, several other GPCRs, membrane-spanning proteins, and intracellular proteins with GAP or other enzymatic activities were identified as terminating in the shorter (A/S)-T-X-(L/V) motif. These potential RGS12 PDZ domain-binding proteins and their C-terminal sequences are summarized in Table III. It must be noted, however, that a terminal (A/S)-T-X-(L/V) motif alone is clearly not sufficient to specify RGS12 PDZ domain binding, as no appreciable binding has been observed to the A-T-N-V C-terminal tail of the human neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 (Table II, B).

However, among those form(s) of RGS12 containing both the N-terminal PDZ domain and the A-T-F-V C terminus, the interaction could be kinetically favored given its intramolecular nature. Such a scenario is reminiscent of the mechanism of reversible autoinhibition of Src family kinases, which adopt a “closed” conformation upon intramolecular association of their N-terminal SH2 and SH3 domains with C-terminal motifs (27Superti-Furga G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Intramolecular association of the N and C termini within RGS12 isoform(s) may serve as a source of regulation, either of its Giα-directed GAP activity or of PDZ-mediated binding to other proteins. The ability of the alternative C terminus to serve as a docking site for PDZ domain-containing proteins also presents the possibility of in vivo concatemerization and/or organization of RGS12 within multi-component signaling complexes. Compartmentalization by virtue of the N- and/or C-terminal domains of RGS12 could thereby associate desensitizing GAP activity within specific receptor complexes, analogous to inclusion of the negative regulatory function of protein kinase C within theDrosophila phototransduction complex by InaD (14Tsunoda S.

https://openalex.org/W2043074873,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) is one of the few mammalian phosphatases residing within the mitochondrial matrix space. It is responsible for dephosphorylation and reactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and, by this means, is intimately involved in the regulation of utilization of carbohydrate fuels in mammals. PDP is a dimeric enzyme consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The catalytic subunit of PDP is a Mg2+-dependent enzyme homologous to the cytosolic phosphatases of the 2C family. In the present study, we isolated two cDNAs encoding for mitochondrial phosphatases. The first cDNA is highly homologous to the previously identified cDNA encoding for the catalytic subunit of PDP (PDP1). The second cDNA encodes a previously unknown catalytic subunit of PDP (PDP2). The new phosphatase, expressed as the recombinant protein inEscherichia coli, shows strict substrate specificity toward PDC and does not use phosphorylated branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase as substrate. Like PDP1, PDP2 is a Mg2+-dependent enzyme, but its sensitivity to Mg2+ ions is almost 10-fold lower than that of PDP1. In contrast to PDP1, PDP2 is not regulated by Ca2+ ions. Instead, it is sensitive to the biological polyamine spermine, which, in turn, has no effect on the enzymatic activity of PDP1. Western blot analysis of PDP extracted from mitochondria isolated from liver and skeletal muscle revealed that PDP1 is predominantly expressed in mitochondria from skeletal muscle, whereas PDP2 is much more abundant in the liver rather than muscle mitochondria. Both isoenzymes are expressed in mitochondria from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but the level of expression of PDP2 is considerably higher. These observations are consistent with previous findings on the enzymatic parameters of PDP in adipose tissue. Thus, our results provide the first evidence that there are at least two isoenzymes of PDP in mammals that are different with respect to tissue distribution and kinetic parameters and, therefore, are likely to be different functionally.

In tissues with large energy demands like brain, muscle, and heart, it supplies the carbon units derived from carbohydrate fuels mainly for complete oxidation by the Krebs cycle. In lipogenic tissues such as adipose, mammary gland, and liver, the metabolic fate of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates is quite different, because it can be used for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol (for reviews, see Refs. 1Randle P.J. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1995; 54: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 2Sugden M.C. Orfali K.A. Holness M.J. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1746S-1752SPubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the reaction catalyzed by PDC should be highly regulated, and this regulation must be sophisticated enough to accommodate the different metabolic requirements of a variety of tissues. Indeed, several molecular mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of mammalian PDC. In the short term, the enzyme activity may be regulated by negative feedback (3Randle P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 653-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The products of the PDC reaction, NADH and acetyl-CoA, inhibit the overall reaction by reversing the partial reactions catalyzed by the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and transacetylase components of the complex (4Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 653-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This mechanism may be important for the rapid adjustment of flux through PDC, particularly in the liver (3Randle P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A perhaps even more important mechanism of PDC regulation is based on reversible phosphorylation (5Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Mammalian mitochondria contain two enzymes dedicated to the regulation of PDC: pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) (6Hucho F. Randall D.D. Roche T.E. Burgett M.W. Pelley J.W. Reed L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The kinase is an integral part of the multienzyme complex (7Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It phosphorylates three serine residues of the decarboxylase component (pyruvate decarboxylase) (8Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 13: 2364-2370Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation completely halts the enzymatic activity of PDC (9Sugden P.H. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,10Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The phosphoenzyme can be reactivated only via dephosphorylation catalyzed by phosphatase (11Sugden P.H. Hutson N.J. Kerbey A.L. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast to PDK, PDP is loosely associated with PDC but becomes complex-bound upon stimulation (12Teague W.M. Pettit F.H. Wu T.L. Silberman S.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 26: 5585-5592Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both PDK and PDP can integrate a considerable number of different regulatory stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 13Behal R.H. Buxton D.B. Robertson J.G. Olson M.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 497-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The kinase activity is likely to reflect the relative intramitochondrial concentrations of the substrates (pyruvate, NAD+, and CoA) and products (NADH and acetyl-CoA) of the main dehydrogenase reaction. An excess of substrates results in the inhibition of kinase activity with concomitant activation of PDC by the phosphatase. An excess of products activates the kinase and results in the net phosphorylation and inactivation of PDC. The enzymatic activity of PDP depends on intramitochondrial concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions (14Pettit F.H. Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 17: 563-571Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Severson D.L. Denton R.M. Pask H.T. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The latter promotes the association of PDP with the complex (12Teague W.M. Pettit F.H. Wu T.L. Silberman S.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 26: 5585-5592Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and, by this means, stimulates the rate of dephosphorylation. Another co-factor that may be important for the regulation of PDP is intramitochondrial NADH (16Rahmatullah M. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8106-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least in vitro, NADH inhibits the phosphatase activity and, therefore, may simultaneously modulate the activities of both the kinase and the phosphatase (17Chen G. Wang L. Liu S. Chuang C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28064-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation state of PDC in mammalian mitochondria reflects the relative activities of the kinase and phosphatase, which, in turn, depend upon the intramitochondrial concentrations of different metabolites and co-factors. Tissue-specific aspects of the regulation of mammalian PDC became a subject of interest fairly recently when it was found that there are multiple isoenzymes of PDK in humans and rodents (18Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28989-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 19Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus far, four genes showing characteristic patterns of tissue-specific expression have been identified (18Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28989-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 20Rowles J. Scherer S.W. Xi T. Majer M. Nickle D.C. Rommens J.M. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Riebow N.L. Xia J. Tsui L.C. Bogardus C. Prochazka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22376-22382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The respective protein products appear to be somewhat different with respect to their enzymatic activities and regulation (19Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These observations bring about the very intriguing possibility that regulation of PDC in mammals may be tissue-specific, reflecting the isoenzymic composition of PDK. Whether the diversity of PDKs in mammals is matched by the diversity of PDPs, however, is largely unknown. So far, just one gene encoding PDP has been identified by Lester Reed's laboratory (21Lawson J.E. Niu X.D. Browning K.S. Trong H.L. Yan J. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 7: 8987-8993Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It encodes for a Mg2+-dependent, Ca2+-stimulated form of PDP (22Yan J. Lawson J.E. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 14: 4953-4956Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Some studies, however, have suggested that the complexity of the PDP gene family may be greater. For example, PDP purified from the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum is Ca2+-insensitive but responsive to physiologically relevant concentrations of malate (23Song H. Komuniecki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31573-31578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it appears that malate at physiologically relevant concentrations produces marked activation of spermatozoal PDC and does not modify significantly the activity of liver PDC (24De Burgos N.M.G. Gallina F. Burgos C. Blanco A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Even more importantly, Rutter et al. (25Rutter G.A. McCormack J.G. Midgley P.J. Denton R.M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that the kinetic properties of PDP in mitochondria from adipose tissue are markedly different from those that were described for purified enzyme. Calcium ions at physiologically relevant concentrations activate adipose PDP at low concentrations of Mg2+. However, when Mg2+ was present at saturating concentrations, there was no longer any effect of Ca2+ on PDP activity (25Rutter G.A. McCormack J.G. Midgley P.J. Denton R.M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ca2+-stimulated PDP purified from kidney mitochondria showed a large activation by Ca2+ at all concentrations of Mg2+ (14Pettit F.H. Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 17: 563-571Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Severson D.L. Denton R.M. Pask H.T. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to analyze the diversity of the PDP gene family in mammals. Here we report the first evidence indicating that indeed there is another isoenzyme of PDP in rodents and, probably, in humans. It is abundantly present in mitochondria from liver and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and virtually absent in mitochondria from skeletal muscle. We also show that this isoenzyme, obtained as the recombinant protein, is not sensitive to stimulation by Ca2+ ions but instead can be directly regulated by spermine. 5′-STRETCH PLUS λgt10 rat heart and rat liver cDNA libraries, bovine total RNA, QUICK-CloneTM rat liver cDNA, rat liver 5′-RACE-ReadyTM cDNA, and TALONTM metal affinity resin were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. QIAGEN plasmid purification kits were obtained from QIAGEN Inc. Native PfuDNA polymerase was from Stratagene. The reverse transcriptase-PCR kit was obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The bacterial expression vector pET-28a and Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) were from Novagen. pGroESL plasmid was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Antony Guttenbery (DuPont). Recombinant human PDC and PDK3 were prepared as described elsewhere. 125I-Protein A was obtained from ICN Biochemicals. Radioactive nucleotides were from NEN Life Science Products. Other reagents used were of the highest purity available commercially. Common PCR primers for amplification of PDP-related genes were designed according to the sequences of polypeptides -A345TDGLWE351- and -M442YRDDIT448- of bovine PDP (GCN ACN GA(C/T) GGN CTN TGG GA and GT(A/G/T) AT(A/G) TC(A/G) TCN CG(A/G) TAC AT, respectively). These primers were used to amplify rat liver QUICK-CloneTM cDNA. The PCR reaction mixture contained 50 pmol of each gene-specific primer and 1 ng of double-stranded cDNA as well as deoxyribonucleic triphosphates, buffer, and 5.0 units of native Pfu DNA polymerase, which were added according to the manufacturer's instructions. 35 cycles of PCR were set up using 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 50 °C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for extension. The resulting PCR product of approximately 300 bp was subcloned in pUC18 and sequenced. The cDNA for bovine PDP was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using reverse-transcribed total RNA from bovine heart as the template. The upstream (GCT TCC ACA CCG CAG AAG TTT) and downstream (CTG TTC CTG GTT TTG ATA TGC) PCR primers corresponded to the bases 378–398 and 1757–1778 of published cDNA. Reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand was primed with random hexamers. The cycling parameters were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 60 °C for annealing, and 3 min at 72 °C for extension with a 10-min final extension at 72 °C. The resulting DNA (1.4 kb) was subcloned in pUC18 and sequenced. The rat heart cDNA library was screened with random-primed32P-labeled cDNA of bovine PDP (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (17.3–17.41, and 18.40–18.41, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 8.46-8.47Google Scholar). Approximately 2–4 × 106 plaque-forming units of cDNA library were screened as described elsewhere. In order to clone the cDNA encoding for the PDP-related protein, approximately 0.5–1 × 106 plaque-forming units of rat liver λgt10 cDNA library were screened with 32P-labeled 0.3-kb PCR product, which was obtained as described above. Positive plaques from both libraries were purified by four additional rounds of plating and screening. λ DNA was purified as described by Chisholm (27Chisholm D. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 21-23PubMed Google Scholar) and digested with EcoRI. Resulting cDNAs were separated on TEA-agarose gel, purified, and religated in EcoRI-digested pUC18 for sequencing. Commercially available 5′-RACE-ReadyTMtemplates prepared from rat liver cDNA were used in order to obtain the 5′-end of PDP2 cDNA. The first round of amplification was set up according to the manufacturer's instructions with gene-specific primer (TAG GTC AAG GAG TTC CTG CCA ATA) corresponding to bases 663–686 of PDP2 cDNA. For the second round of amplification, gene-specific primer (CCA CTG CAG GAT GGG CAG CAA) corresponding to positions 558–596 was used. Several PCR products ranging in size from 300 to approximately 700 bp were separated on TEA-agarose gel, purified, and subcloned in pUC18 for sequencing. The PCR products obtained from three independent amplifications were analyzed. NcoI and XhoI restriction sites flanking the coding region of PDP1 cDNA corresponding to the mature polypeptide were constructed by PCR using the cDNA of rat PDP1 (cloned in the present study) as the template and nativePfu DNA polymerase. The sense primer (AAA CCA TGG CTT CTA CGC CTC AGA AAT TTT AC) containing theNcoI restriction site (both restriction sites areunderlined) corresponded to bases 340–363 of rat PDP1 cDNA. The antisense primer (TTT CTC GAG CTG TTC CTG GTT TTG ATA TGC) carrying the XhoI restriction site corresponded to bases 1720–1740. The resulting cDNA was digested with NcoI and XhoI restrictases and subcloned between the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pET-28a expression vector in order to produce the carboxyl-terminal fusion with His6 tag encoded by the vector (plasmid PDP1). The cDNA for rat PDP2 was amplified using primers AAA TCA TGA CAT CAA CCG AGG AAG AGG ATT (bases 225–247) and TTT CTC GAGACC CTC CTT AAA ATA GGT ATC (bases 1597–1617). The sense primer contained the BspHI restriction site, and the antisense primer contained the XhoI restriction site (both restriction sites are underlined). Amplification reactions were performed using rat liver QUICK-CloneTM cDNA as the template with nativePfu DNA polymerase. The resulting cDNA of approximately 1.4 kb was digested with BspHI (New England BioLabs) andXhoI restrictases and subcloned between NcoI andXhoI sites of pET-28a (plasmid PDP2). The resulting plasmid directs the synthesis of PDP2 with a carboxyl-terminal His6tag. The fidelity of the pPDP1 and pPDP2 vectors was established by nucleotide sequencing. Sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA was carried out by the Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility (Indiana University) using a Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer) following the manufacturer's instructions. Both strands were sequenced. To establish expressing cell lines, competent BL21(DE3) cells were co-transformed with one of the pPDP vectors and pGroESL containing the inducible genes for the molecular chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Resulting transformants were selected on TY agar plates containing kanamycin (45 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). Several colonies displaying resistance to both antibiotics were tested for their ability to express phosphatases and were used to prepare glycerol stocks. In order to express the recombinant phosphatases, 10 μl of the respective glycerol stock was inoculated into 1 liter of M9ZB medium containing kanamycin (45 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). The cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C in an incubator with constant shaking at 200 rpm. After the OD of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6, the flasks were transferred to a shaker at room temperature and induced with 0.4 mmβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Incubation was continued for another 20–24 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (JA-10 rotor) for 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of TN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl) supplemented with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin). Cells were disrupted by sonication (five times for 20 s with 1-min intervals for cooling on ice). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For enzymatic assays, the extracts were desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Mops, pH 7.3, 0.1 mmEGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (MEMG buffer) and immediately used without any further purification. For raising antisera, both PDP1 and PDP2 were further purified on a 5-ml bed volume of TALON resin equilibrated with 3 volumes of TN. After loading of the extract, the column was sequentially washed with 10 volumes of TN and 5 volumes of TN containing 15 mm imidazole. Bound phosphatase was eluted with TN plus 100 mm imidazole. Fractions containing phosphatase were pooled, supplemented with dithiothreitol, the mixture of protease inhibitors given above, and glycerol (50% final concentration). Resulting preparations were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. 32P-Labeled substrate was prepared by incubating human recombinant PDC (2–5 mg) in MEMG buffer supplemented with 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity ∼1,000 cpm/pmol) and recombinant PDK3 (10–25 μg) in a final volume of 1.0 ml at 37 °C for 30 min. By the end of the incubation, PDC was precipitated with polyethylene glycol-8000 (12% final concentration) for 1 h on ice. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, dissolved in 0.5 ml of MEMG, and passed through a PD-10 column equilibrated with MEMG to remove the radioactive ATP. The resulting complex contained 4–9 nmol of phosphoryl group/mg of protein. The PDP activity assay was performed essentially as described by Yan et al. (22Yan J. Lawson J.E. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 14: 4953-4956Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extract containing PDP was diluted in MEMG buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and aliquots containing approximately 1.0 μg of total protein were preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min with the indicated concentrations of MgCl2 and effectors. The reaction was initiated by adding 32P-labeled PDC (final concentration, 1.0 mg/ml) in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 s and then terminated with 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were counted in order to determine the PDP activity. All experiments were conducted in duplicate. Under the conditions described, the time course of the reaction was linear for several minutes of incubation, and the rate of the reaction was proportional to the amount of PDP added. The results of kinetic experiments were fitted and analyzed using GraFit software (Eritacus Software). Antisera against recombinant PDP1 and PDP2 were produced in New Zealand White rabbits following a standard immunization protocol (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-138Google Scholar). Antisera obtained were specific for each of these isoenzymes and showed little if any cross-reactivity under the loading and detection conditions used in the present study for immunoblotting. Western blot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (29Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mitochondria purified from rat skeletal muscle, liver, or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS at 100 °C for 5 min. Unsolubilized proteins were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Mitochondrial proteins (∼10 μg of total mitochondrial protein/lane) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (TBST) plus 5.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 2–4 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-PDP1 or anti-PDP2 antiserum diluted 1:1000 in TBST/bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 10–12 h. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized after incubation with 125I-protein A (0.5 μCi/ml) in TBST/bovine serum albumin followed by autoradiography. Under the described conditions, there was a linear relationship between the relative densities of the bands corresponding to PDP1 or PDP2 and the amount of total mitochondrial protein loaded per lane. 3T3-L1 cells purchased from ATCC were maintained and differentiated as described by Kedishvili et al. (31Kedishvili N.Y. Popov K.M. Jaskiewicz J.A. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from skeletal muscle, liver, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were isolated according to Refs. 32Kerbey A.L. Randle P.J. Cooper R.H. Whitehouse S. Pask H.T. Denton R.M. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results from several laboratories have indicated that in mammals, and possibly in other higher eukaryotes, there may be more then one gene encoding for the phosphatase regulating the activity of PDC (23Song H. Komuniecki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31573-31578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24De Burgos N.M.G. Gallina F. Burgos C. Blanco A. Arch. Biochem.

Sci. 1989; 573: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These studies prompted us to search for genes that are homologous to the bovine PDP characterized recently (21Lawson J.E. Niu X.D. Browning K.S. Trong H.L. Yan J. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 7: 8987-8993Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, we employed a PCR-based approach using common primers designed according to the sequences of the two polypeptides (-A345TDGLWE351- and -M442YRDDIT448-). These sequences were chosen based on the recently solved three-dimensional structure of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) (36Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The bovine PDP is a metal-dependent enzyme showing some sequence similarity to PP2C, as pointed out by Lawson and colleagues (21Lawson J.E. Niu X.D. Browning K.S. Trong H.L. Yan J. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 7: 8987-8993Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggested that PDP may have a folding pattern reminiscent of other metal-dependent phosphatases (36Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The two polypeptides chosen for the primer design in this study are likely to be a part of the binuclear metal-binding center, residues Asp347 and Asp445 of bovine PDP, and, therefore, should be conserved among PDP-related proteins (see the model below). The use of these primers has an additional advantage, because, in contrast to the cytosolic phosphatases, PDP has a 56-amino acid long insertion in this region. This, therefore, allows the identification of PDP-related cDNAs according to their size (approximately 300 bp). As discussed under “Experimental Procedures,” amplification of rat liver cDNA indeed yielded a product 300 bp long. Sequencing of this cDNA revealed that it encodes for the protein, showing about 60% similarity to the previously reported sequence of bovine PDP. This finding i"

In this paper, we have examined the protein targets for the ceramide attachment. By partial saponification of isolated foreskin epidermal CEs followed by limited proteolysis, we have recovered several lipopeptides. Biochemical and mass spectroscopic characterization revealed that all contained near stoichiometric amounts of ceramides of masses ranging from about 690 to 890 atomic mass units, of which six quantitatively major species were common. The array of ceramides was similar to that obtained from pig skin, the composition of which is known, thereby providing strong indirect data for their fatty acid and sphingosine compositions. The recovered peptides accounted for about 20% of the total foreskin CE ceramides. By amino acid sequencing, about 35% of the peptides were derived from ancestral glutamine-glutamate-rich regions of involucrin, an important CE structural protein. Another 18% derived from rod domain sequences of periplakin and envoplakin, which are also known or suspected CE proteins. Other peptides were too short for unequivocal identification.

The phospholipid-rich cellular plasma membrane is rebuilt as a 5-nm-thick layer of ceramide lipids, which subsequently become covalently attached to the protein envelope on the extracellular surface (18Elias P.M.

A minor but important component are the acylglucosyl-ceramides, of which about two-thirds are converted to ω-hydroxyceramides that become covalently attached by ester linkages to the protein envelope to complete CE assembly. Many other lipids, such as cholesterol esters and free fatty acids, function to form the lamellae in the intercellular milieu and contribute in a major way to the barrier against desiccation (2Downing D.T.

One idea is that the ceramides that are ester-linked to the outer surface of the CE contribute a hydrophobic surface to the corneocyte that has important consequences for water barrier function by associations with and perhaps organization of intercellular lipids (2Downing D.T. Stewart M.E. Wertz P.W. Strauss J.S. Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen K.F. Dermatology in General Medicine. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1993: 210-221Google Scholar). We have been interested in the structure of the CE and have devised models on the nature and sequences of the proteins involved in its formation (10Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

Specifically, although a model has been suggested (2Downing D.T. Stewart M.E. Wertz P.W. Strauss J.S. Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen K.F. Dermatology in General Medicine.

In this study, we explored this question. Partial removal of ester-linked lipids from isolated foreskin epidermal CEs by saponification has allowed the isolation of lipopeptides consisting of ceramides attached to certain glutamines and/or glutamic acid residues of involucrin, as well as other likely CE proteins. “Mature” CEs were prepared from the stratum corneum tissue of freshly-prepared foreskin epidermis as described previously (10Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

They were resuspended in a buffer of 0.1m N-ethylmorpholine acetate (pH 8.3) and digested with trypsin (Sigma, sequencing grade, 1% by weight, for 2 h at 37 °C) to remove contaminating adherent proteins (12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and pelleted at 14,000 × g. Aliquots of CEs containing known amounts of protein were resuspended in 1 m KOH in 95% methanol for 15–120 min at 45 °C, washed with methanol, and dried. Potential ceramide-peptide adducts were reacted similarly to hydrolyze the ester linkages (generally a 2-h reaction). The saponified lipids were recovered by extraction into chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) and dried. Amino acid analysis of hydrolyzed samples (5.7 n HCl at 110 °C for 24 hin vacuo) was used to routinely measure protein amounts. Partially or completely saponified CEs were resuspended (1 mg of CE protein/ml) in buffer and redigested with trypsin or proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.; 1% by weight) for up to 3 h at 37 °C. The solubilized material was collected following removal of the CE remnants by pelleting and dried. Peptides were fractionated on a C18high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column as before (10Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar,11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To recover potential lipopeptide adducts, a Phenomenex C4 HPLC column (200 × 2.5 mm) was used at a flow rate of 0.22 ml/min with 10% acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and with a linear gradient of up to 15% (v/v) isopropanol in acetonitrile and collected into 0.11-ml fractions. Aliquots of selected peptide peaks were subjected to amino acid analysis or attached to a solid support (Sequelon-AA, Millipore) for sequencing as described previously (11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, aliquots (5–20 pmol) were removed for mass measurements by mass spectroscopy both before and after saponification, using a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization procedure. Following an initial scan from 600 atomic mass units (below which reliable data could not be obtained), scans were repeated in the vicinity of the major mass species. Aliquots of potential lipopeptides were saponified for 2 h as described above. The released ceramides were then extracted with chloroform/methanol (95:5) and quantified using the diacylglycerol assay reagent kit and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (25Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). This reaction specifically labels an hydroxyl of the sphingosine moiety of a ceramide only. High performance thin layer chromatography silica gel plates (Merck) were developed with chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water 10:4:3:2:1. N-stearoyl-d-sphingosine (C18 ceramide) (Sigma) was used as quantitation standard. The dried plates were then exposed for up to 6 days. Bands were quantitated by scanning densitometry of several exposures of the x-ray films. Previously, we have demonstrated that saponification of foreskin epidermal CEs, a mild alkaline hydrolysis procedure that is likely to cleave ester bonds, exposes for proteolytic attack a number of structural proteins of the protein portion of the CE (11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our immunogold electron microscopy analyses and proteolytic digestion experiments suggested that in intact CEs, the ester-linked lipids mask access to structural proteins corresponding to the inner or earlier stages of CE assembly (12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These proteins were predominantly involucrin, envoplakin, and desmoplakin (12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but they may also consist of other desmosomal and calcium-binding proteins (12Steinert P.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have addressed the questions of the nature of the possible protein substrates to which these lipids are covalently attached, their sites of attachment, and the properties of the attached lipids. We reasoned that by reducing the time of an initial saponification reaction to only a few minutes, followed by limited proteolysis, it should be possible to isolate peptides with ester-linked lipid adducts. Such adducts could be identified by HPLC fractionation on a C4 HPLC column monitored at 220 nm. Free hydrophilic peptides typically found in CE proteins should not be retarded, and retarded free lipids cannot be detected at 220 nm. We performed a number of trial experiments titrating the degree of saponification (in the range of 10–30 min) and subsequent proteolysis with trypsin or proteinase K singly or in combination. Although trypsin released several retarded peaks resolvable on the C4 column, a reproducibly better yield of 10 arbitrarily numbered peaks was obtained by proteinase K digestion alone (Fig. 1), even though a significant portion of the peptide material released would have originated from the cytoplasmic (loricrin-rich) face of the CE, where lipids are largely absent (10Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Optimized conditions were obtained for 15 min of saponification and 10–60 min of proteinase K digestion. Of these, peaks 5–7 were stable for ≈1 h of digestion, peaks 3 and 4 became well resolved only after 20–30 min of digestion, peaks 8–10 were lost after ≈20 min of digestion, and peaks 1 and 2 were rapidly lost in a time- and shape-dependent manner. The 15-min saponification procedure alone did not result in a significant release of peptide material. In a typical experiment with 15 min of saponification followed by digestion with proteinase K, we released 5.1% (10 min), 12.7% (30 min), 15.8% (1 h) and 19.5% (3 h, complete digestion, cf. 20% in Ref. 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) of the protein mass of the CEs used. Of this, the total amount of retarded peptide material recovered in Fig. 1 represents ≈0.4% (10-min digestion) or 0.25% (60-min digestion) of the 220-nm absorbing material eluted from the HPLC column, which corresponds to 0.02–0.05% of the total protein mass of the CEs, or ≈250 ng/mg of CEs. None of the retarded peptide fractions contained the isodipeptide cross-link, indicating that different regions of CE proteins were used for lipid attachments and for cross-linking. The material from each peak was recovered from the pooled epidermis of 20–30 foreskins. By amino acid analysis, each contained protein, and based on the composition of the simplest peptides (see below), the yields were 20–100 pmol. After a 2-h resaponification reaction, followed by chromatography on the same HPLC column, the 220-nm absorbing peptides of each peak eluted at the column wash, and there was no detectable retarded material. These data suggest the presence of ester-linked hydrophobic lipopeptides. Earlier data have demonstrated that a major class of lipid molecules ester-linked to the CE proteins are ceramides (19Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 709-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest.

To ascertain whether the retarded peptide-containing species identified in Fig. 1 contained ceramides, we used an established method that specifically incorporates a phosphate group onto an hydroxyl group of the sphingosine moiety of a ceramide (25Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Using 10–40-pmol aliquots (based on peptide content), the data of Fig. 2 demonstrate that each peak contains ceramides. Following densitometric scans of the bands, and in relation to the reaction with the C18 ceramide standard, we calculated that the peaks contain 0.6 mol (peaks 4 and 10), 0.7 mol (peak 2), 0.8 mol (peaks 1, 5, 6, and 9), or up to 0.9 mol (peaks 3, 7, and 8) of ceramide/mol of peptide. The somewhat lower stoichiometry and the multiplicity of species may indicate degradation or oxidation of the ceramides. Alternatively, because most peptide peaks contained multiple ceramide bands that migrated significantly faster than the C18 ceramide standard (Fig. 2), the bands may represent species with variably-sized sphingoid and/or fatty acid chains that were considerably longer than those of the C18 ceramide standard. Fig. 2 also shows the reaction of 50 pmol of ceramides recovered from a 2-h saponification reaction of human foreskin CEs and pig skin CEs (a kind gift from Dr. P. Wertz). These broad bands suggest the presence of multiple unresolved ceramide species of similar size to those of the 10 recovered peaks. Following a 2-h saponification reaction, we calculated that the total yield of human foreskin CE ceramides was 2750 pmol/mg of CE protein. Assuming that the CE is about 15 nm thick and its density is about 1 g/cm3 (26Jarnik M. Simon M. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1051-1060PubMed Google Scholar), 1 mg of protein would occupy about 7 × 1016 nm2 of CE surface. This means that there is about 1 molecule of ceramide/40 nm2 of CE. Based on the predicted size of these ceramides (Refs. 19Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 709-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest.

Dermatol. 1989; 93: 169-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and see below), this means that the entire CE surface is effectively coated by a monomolecular layer of ceramides (19Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 709-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we could account for 15–20% of this total amount of ceramides in separate experiments by summation of the yields recovered from the 10 peaks of Fig. 1. Another ≈70% of the total ceramides was present in the CE pellet following the 15-min limited saponification and 60-min proteinase K digestion procedures. Aliquots (5–20 pmol) of each peak were used for amino acid sequencing. As TableI shows, peaks 3–8 contained peptides of sequences that are either identical (peaks 4, 6, and 8) or very similar (peaks 3, 5, and 7) to human involucrin. In peaks 3, 5, and 7, a Gln residue in human involucrin was sequenced as a Glu residue. There are two possible explanations for this. The first is that these Gln residues may have participated in the initial step of a cross-linking reaction with transglutaminases but failed to complete the transfer of the enzyme-substrate complex to an acceptor substrate amine, such as a Lys residue: the net result would be deamidation of the Gln residue (27Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 29Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We think that this is a relatively rare event because we have found only a few cases of such modifications in the sequences of many cross-linked peptides characterized to date. 2L. N. Marekov and P. M. Steinert, unpublished observations. Moreover, such hydrophilic peptides would not have been retarded by the C4column. A second, more plausible possibility is that a lipid adduct was linked through an ester bond to the Gln residue, which, following hydrolysis (saponification) of the ester bond, would generate a Glu residue. Such an hydrolysis would likely occur during the amino acid sequencing chemistry reactions. Thus, these modified residues identify the likely target position of lipid attachment. However, in peptides 4, 6, and 7, in which there was an exact match with involucrin, the lipid was likely attached to an existing Glu residue, but the residue position of modification could not be ascertained.Table ISequences of peptides resolved on C4 column of Fig. 1Peak numberSequenceCalculated massCommentatomic mass units1Complex2Complex3PEQECEQQEK1246Involucrin-like, residues 70–79 Glu78 is a Gln in involucrin4EEEKKL775Involucrin residues 123–1285QQEHWaAs determined from databases, this sequence occurs only in a Drosophila protein.725Involucrin-like, residues 87–91 Glu89 is a Gln in involucrin6EEEEGQL833Involucrin, residues 386–3927NTHQEQMK886Involucrin, residues 27–338aDQELNKQ872Involucrin-like, residues 115–121 Glu117 is a Gln in involucrin8bDQELDQEL986Involucrin-like, residues 130–137 Glu132 is a Gln in involucrin9Complex10ComplexSingle letter amino acid code is used.

https://openalex.org/W2019964639,"Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation with insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and interleukins. A key question is whether different IRSs play different roles to mediate insulin's metabolic and growth-promoting effects. In a novel system of insulin receptor-deficient hepatocytes, insulin fails to (i) stimulate glucose phosphorylation, (ii) enhance glycogen synthesis, (iii) suppress glucose production, and (iv) promote mitogenesis. However, insulin's ability to induce IRS-1 and gab-1 phosphorylation and binding to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is unaffected, by virtue of the compensatory actions of IGF-1 receptors. In contrast, phosphorylation of IRS-2 and generation of IRS-2/PI 3-kinase complexes are markedly reduced. Thus, absence of insulin receptors selectively reduces IRS-2, but not IRS-1 phosphorylation, and the impairment of IRS-2 activation is associated with lack of insulin effects. To address whether phosphorylation of additional IRSs is also affected, we analyzed phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates from insulin-treated cells. However, these experiments indicate that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are the main PI 3-kinase-bound proteins in hepatocytes. These data identify IRS-2 as the main effector of both the metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin through PI 3-kinase in hepatocytes, and IRS-1 as the main substrate mediating the mitogenic actions of IGF-1 receptors.

The mechanism by which insulin regulates energy metabolism and promotes cell growth has been extensively studied. In recent years, a consensus has emerged that phosphorylation of IRS molecules by the insulin receptor kinase is important for insulin action (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS molecules engage in the formation of signaling complexes with numerous adapter molecules and enzymes via their pY-X-X-M motifs (2Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of different IRSs in insulin signaling, as well as the role of the numerous additional substrates of the insulin receptor kinase that are distinct from IRS has remained elusive.Progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of suitablein vitro systems in which phosphorylation of individual molecules can be correlated with specific biologic functions. In fact, insulin-responsive cell lines such as 3T3-L1 adipocytes or L6 myoblasts possess an endogenous complement of signaling molecules, so that the effects of individual components can be addressed only by way of overexpression or inhibition experiments. It is significant that much progress in our understanding of the IRS system has derived from studies of the myeloid cell line 32D, which carries a functional knock-out of these molecules (8Wang L.-M.

However, 32D cells may not be representative of classic target tissues of insulin action.Targeted mutagenesis of genes of the insulin and IGF signaling system in mice has provided clues as to the functional differences among related molecules (11Accili D.

Diabetes. 1996; 104: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We and others, for example, have shown that insulin receptors are indeed the master switch of the insulin signaling pathway (13Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P.

Likewise, the phenotype of mice with a genetic ablation of IRS-1 has suggested that IRS-1 plays a more important role in mediating growth than metabolic responses (18Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B.r. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 19Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y.

Interestingly, however, combined heterozygosity for an insulin receptor and an IRS-1 null allele triggers synergistic interactions to impair insulin action and causes insulin-resistant diabetes in mice, suggesting that IRS-1 can also affect metabolism (20Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner W.S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mice lacking IRS-2 develop lethal diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of combined insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, indicating that IRS-2 plays a crucial role in the development of mechanisms regulating fuel homeostasis (21Withers D.J. Sanchez-Gutierrez J. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar).The derivation of cell lines from mice with targeted mutations provides an important tool to dissect the function of these molecules in vitro. For example, Bruning et al. (22Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have been able to show that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not functionally interchangeable in mediating various growth-promoting functions of IGF-1 in fibroblasts of IRS-1-deficient mice.In this study, we have analyzed insulin action in permanent cultures of hepatocytes from mice lacking insulin receptors. We generated these cells using a well established procedure entailing transformation with a temperature-sensitive mutant SV40 virus (23Chou J.Y. Methods Emzymol. 1985; 109: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We asked whether, in the absence of insulin receptors, IGF-1 receptors could mediate the typical metabolic and growth-promoting responses of insulin in hepatocytes. We report that insulin, acting through the IGF-1 receptor, mediates IRS-1, but not IRS-2 phosphorylation, and that the failure to phosphorylate IRS-2 correlates with the inability of these cells to mediate insulin's characteristic actions. Phosphorylation of gab-1, and association of other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, were similar in normal and insulin receptor-deficient cells. These findings correlate IRS-2 phosphorylation with both the metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin, and suggest that individual IRS molecules play a more specific role in signal transduction than previously recognized.DISCUSSIONIn these investigations, we have analyzed the correlation between IRSs phosphorylation and insulin action in hepatocytes derived from insulin receptor-deficient mice. We provide evidence that impaired activation of IRS-2 in these cells is associated with failure of both metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin. An important result of the present study is that ablation of insulin receptors results in a selective loss of IRS-2 phosphorylation, in the absence of detectable changes in IRS-1 phosphorylation. Indirect evidence suggests that additional IRSs are minor components of the IRS signaling system in this cell type. Thus, these data support the notion that signaling from insulin receptors to IRS-2 is required for the characteristic actions of insulin in liver. Since our data were obtained in the context of a physiologic target cell of insulin action, we believe that they add significant new information to our understanding of the insulin signaling system.The link between impaired phosphorylation of IRS-2 and impaired insulin action is further demonstrated by the decrease in the formation of IRS-2/PI 3-kinase complexes in −/− cells. There is substantial evidence that PI 3-kinase is required for many, if not all, of insulin actions (35Berger J. Hayes N. Szalkowski D.M. Zhang B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

While in this study we did not measure PI 3-kinase activity directly, it is well established that insulin activates PI 3-kinase by causing IRSs to bind to the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit (29Nikolic-Rordorf T.

Our analysis of the patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected in p85 immunoprecipitates indicates that the main proteins bound to p85 in hepatocytes are indeed IRS-1 and IRS-2, and therefore account for most of PI 3-kinase activity elicited by insulin in these cells. Furthermore, we have recently been able to show that insulin fails to stimulate Akt activity in −/− cells, which is consistent with an impairment of PI 3-kinase activity 2B.-C. Park and D. Accili, unpublished observation. (47Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 48Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

These data provide support to the notion that impairment of IRS-2 phosphorylation in −/− cells is one of the mechanisms of the failure of insulin action, and not an epiphenomenon.The conclusion that IRS-2 plays an important role in mediating the metabolic actions of insulin is supported by several lines of independent evidence. IRS-2-deficient mice are diabetic as a result of combined insulin resistance and impaired insulin production (21Withers D.J. Sanchez-Gutierrez J. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), while IRS-1-deficient mice are growth retarded, but mildly insulin-resistant (18Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B.r. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 19Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K.

Furthermore, normal insulin action in liver of IRS-1-deficient mice is associated with increased phosphorylation of IRS-2 (51Yamauchi Y. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Kohjiro U. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R.

Based on the phenotypes of insulin receptor-, IGF-1 receptor-, IRS-1-, and IRS-2-deficient mice (13Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P. Asico L.D. Jose P.A. Taylor S.I.

Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), one has to conclude that IRS-1 is predominantly an IGF-1 receptor substrate, and IRS-2 an insulin receptor substrate. This conclusion is strengthened by the present findings, indicating that insulin receptors are required for optimal IRS-2 phosphorylation. By suggesting that IRS-2 functions primarily as an insulin receptor substrate, our data provide a compelling explanation for the phenotype of mice lacking IRS-2 (21Withers D.J. Sanchez-Gutierrez J. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), and corroborate the findings of Bruning et al.that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are functionally distinct molecules (22Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Substrate selection, however, is likely to be a more complex eventin vivo, as indicated by studies of mice with combined null mutations of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 genes, which develop insulin resistant diabetes with significantly higher frequency than mice heterozygous for each individual mutation (20Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner W.S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).An important question raised from our studies is why IGF-1 receptors fail to phosphorylate IRS-2 as insulin receptors do. There is ample evidence that IRS-1 and IRS-2 utilize different mechanisms to interact with their receptor partners (52He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 53Sawka-Verhelle D. Baron V. Mothe I. Filloux C. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This evidence, however, does not support a different mode of interaction of insulin and IGF-1 receptors with IRS-1 and IRS-2. An alternative possibility is that the subcellular localization of IRS-2 in hepatocytes prevents its efficient phosphorylation by IGF-1 receptors. A similar mechanism has been postulated to explain the differences between epidermal growth factor and insulin signaling (55Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.B. Ou W.-J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but there is no direct evidence that a similar mechanism may be at play in this instance.The failure of insulin at high doses to activate metabolic responses through IGF-1 receptors is an important finding and deserves further comment. There has been considerable controversy over the ability of IGF-1 receptors to mediate metabolic actions (56Moses A.C. Morrow L.A. O'Brien M. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1995; 28: S185-S194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that IGF-1 receptors are weak mediators of metabolic effects in mice lacking insulin receptors (17Di Cola G. Cool M.H. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We postulated that IGF-1 may enhance peripheral glucose uptake in muscle and decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis. Based on those data, we proposed that IGF-1 may act on hepatic glucose production either directly through IGF-1 receptors, or indirectly through inhibition of glucagon secretion. The failure of IGF-1 receptors to impinge on hepatic glucose metabolism favors an indirect mechanism as a more likely explanation of our previous findings, but further studies comparing gluconeogenetic rates are required.The impairment of insulin-mediated growth in −/− cells correlated with the loss of insulin receptor-mediated IRS-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that growth-promoting signaling of insulin receptors occurs prevalently through IRS-2. On the other hand, IGF-1-dependent growth occurred normally in −/− cells, indicating that IGF-1 receptors signal through IRS-1, phosphorylation of which is not affected in −/− cells. It is possible that some of the effects of insulin or IGF-1 on growth are mediated by shc through the grb-2/mSOS pathway to mitogen-activated protein kinase (41Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Rincon J.

However, it is interesting to note that Bruning and co-workers have shown that IGF-1-dependent growth of IRS-1-deficient fibroblasts is impaired despite normal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and cannot be rescued by IRS-2, consistent with our model in which IGF-1 receptors utilize primarily IRS-1 to mediate their actions on cell growth (22Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The impairment of IGF-2-mediated growth in −/− cells is consistent with previous evidence from our laboratory and others that insulin receptors mediate the growth-promoting actions of IGF-2 (62Morrione A. Valentinis B. Xu S.Q. Yumet G. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3777-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 63Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our data support a model in which the specificity of insulin signaling in liver is bestowed by the formation of a signaling complex between insulin receptors and IRS-2. It remains to be seen whether a similar mechanism operates in other cell types, for example in insulin-dependent translocation of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin, IGF-1, 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; WT, wild type; PI, phosphatidylinositol. 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; WT, wild type; PI, phosphatidylinositol. and IGF-2, acting through insulin and IGF-1 receptors, promote a wide range of metabolic and growth-promoting functions in typical insulin target cells, such as liver, muscle, and fat, and to a lesser extent in other tissues. The mechanism by which insulin regulates energy metabolism and promotes cell growth has been extensively studied. In recent years, a consensus has emerged that phosphorylation of IRS molecules by the insulin receptor kinase is important for insulin action (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS molecules engage in the formation of signaling complexes with numerous adapter molecules and enzymes via their pY-X-X-M motifs (2Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A.

Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Thus, the IRS signaling system provides an elegant explanation for the diversity of insulin signaling (7Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of different IRSs in insulin signaling, as well as the role of the numerous additional substrates of the insulin receptor kinase that are distinct from IRS has remained elusive. Progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of suitablein vitro systems in which phosphorylation of individual molecules can be correlated with specific biologic functions. In fact, insulin-responsive cell lines such as 3T3-L1 adipocytes or L6 myoblasts possess an endogenous complement of signaling molecules, so that the effects of individual components can be addressed only by way of overexpression or inhibition experiments. It is significant that much progress in our understanding of the IRS system has derived from studies of the myeloid cell line 32D, which carries a functional knock-out of these molecules (8Wang L.-M.

However, 32D cells may not be representative of classic target tissues of insulin action. Targeted mutagenesis of genes of the insulin and IGF signaling system in mice has provided clues as to the functional differences among related molecules (11Accili D. Trends Endocrinol.

https://openalex.org/W1984071163,"Upon feeding, mosquito midguts secrete the peritrophic matrix (PM), an extracellular chitin-containing envelope that completely surrounds the blood meal. Because the malaria parasite must cross the PM to complete its life cycle in the mosquito, the PM is a potential barrier for malaria transmission. By antibody screening of an expression library we have identified and partially characterized a cDNA encoding a putative PM protein, termed Anopheles gambiae adult peritrophin 1 (Ag-Aper1).Ag-Aper1 is the first cloned PM gene from a disease vector. Northern analysis detected an abundant Ag-Aper1 transcript only in the adult gut, and not in any other tissues or at any other stages of development. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that it has two tandem chitin-binding domains that share high sequence similarity with each other and also with the chitin-binding domain of an adult gut-specific chitinase from the same organism. The presumed ability of Ag-Aper1 to bind chitin was verified by a functional assay with the baculovirus-expressed recombinant protein. Ag-Aper1 did bind to chitin but not to cellulose, indicating that Ag-Aper1 binds chitin specifically. The double chitin-binding domain organization of Ag-Aper1 suggests that each protein molecule is able to link two chitin polymer chains. Hence, this protein is likely to act as a molecular linker that connects PM chitin fibrils into a three-dimensional network. Upon feeding, mosquito midguts secrete the peritrophic matrix (PM), an extracellular chitin-containing envelope that completely surrounds the blood meal. Because the malaria parasite must cross the PM to complete its life cycle in the mosquito, the PM is a potential barrier for malaria transmission. By antibody screening of an expression library we have identified and partially characterized a cDNA encoding a putative PM protein, termed Anopheles gambiae adult peritrophin 1 (Ag-Aper1).Ag-Aper1 is the first cloned PM gene from a disease vector. Northern analysis detected an abundant Ag-Aper1 transcript only in the adult gut, and not in any other tissues or at any other stages of development. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that it has two tandem chitin-binding domains that share high sequence similarity with each other and also with the chitin-binding domain of an adult gut-specific chitinase from the same organism. The presumed ability of Ag-Aper1 to bind chitin was verified by a functional assay with the baculovirus-expressed recombinant protein. Ag-Aper1 did bind to chitin but not to cellulose, indicating that Ag-Aper1 binds chitin specifically. The double chitin-binding domain organization of Ag-Aper1 suggests that each protein molecule is able to link two chitin polymer chains. Hence, this protein is likely to act as a molecular linker that connects PM chitin fibrils into a three-dimensional network. The peritrophic matrix (PM) 1The abbreviations used are: PM, peritrophic matrix; Ag-Aper1, Anopheles gambiae adult peritrophin 1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is an extracellular layer that surrounds the food bolus in the guts of most arthropods (1Peters W.

All PMs are composed of chitin, proteins, and proteoglycans (1Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130.

Entomol. 1997; 42: 525-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). There are two types of PMs in insects. The type 1 PM is thick (usually between 2 and 20 μm) and is secreted by most midgut epithelial cells. Secretion of the type 1 PM is triggered by the dramatic distention of the midgut epithelium that occurs during ingestion of a meal (5Freyvogel T.A. Jaquet C. Acta Trop. 1965; 22: 148-154PubMed Google Scholar). Many adult blood-feeding insects, including mosquitoes, form type 1 PMs after blood feeding. Two-dimensional protein gel analysis indicated that black flies have only two major proteins (6Ramos A. Mahowald A. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Exp. Zool. 1994; 268: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas mosquitoes have a considerably more complex mixture of proteins (7Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). So far no type I PM proteins have been cloned. The type 2 PM is thin (usually less than 1 μm) and is synthesized continuously from a specialized organ, the cardia (or proventriculus), which is located at the junction of the foregut and midgut. Mosquitoes and many other hematophagous insects produce type 2 PM during larval life and type 1 PM during adult life. Several type 2 larval PM proteins have been cloned (8Elvin C.M. Vuocolo T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16663-16669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Little is known about the structural and biochemical differences between these two very different types of PM. The function of the PM has not been clearly established. It is likely that the PM provides protection for midgut epithelial cells from damage from food particles, prevents infection from viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens, and also facilitates digestion by partitioning digestive enzymes and the ingested food between the endo- and the ecto-peritrophic compartments (1Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar, 2Jacobs-Lorena M. Oo M.M.

The PM may also function as a partial barrier to toxins and other macromolecules. For example, exogenous chitinase significantly increases the toxicity ofBacillus thuringiensis' delta toxin in Spodoptera littoralis, presumably by increasing PM permeability (11Regev A. Keller M. Strizhov N. Sneh B. Prudovsky E. Chet I. Ginzberg I. Koncz-Kalman Z. Koncz C. Schell J. Zilberstein A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human malaria is caused by protozoan parasites, Plasmodiumsp. Malaria is one of the most serious global health problems, causing about 2 million deaths annually. Anopheline mosquitoes are the sole vectors for human malaria. Upon ingestion of an infected blood meal,Plasmodium gametes mate, develop into ookinetes, and about one day later, the ookinetes penetrate the PM and the gut epithelial cells. After traversing the gut epithelium and reaching the gut basal lamina, the ookinetes develop into oocysts. Each oocyst eventually releases thousands of sporozoites that invade the salivary glands and infect the next person when the mosquito bites again. The PM is a thick and dense layer that the Plasmodium parasite must traverse. Although it is known that the parasite secretes a chitinase to facilitate the penetration of the PM (12Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it is unclear what role, if any, the PM plays in triggering chitinase secretion or whether secretion of other hydrolytic enzymes by the parasite is also required. The resolution of these issues will require the elucidation of the molecular composition and structure of the Anopheles PM. Here, we report for the first time, the cloning of a PM protein from a disease vector and propose that this PM protein plays a major role in the spatial organization of the PM. An A. gambiae (G3 strain) colony was maintained as described previously (13Lemos F.J. Cornel A.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Adult mosquitoes (about 5 days old) were fed with a protein-free latex meal as described previously (7Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to induce PM formation. PMs were dissected in PBS buffer 30 min after mosquitoes had a latex meal. Dissected PMs were transferred to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube (kept on ice) with a fine glass pipette. After collecting PMs for about 30 min, the tube was centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g, the residual dissection buffer was removed, and the PM pellet was stored at −80 °C. Five BALB/cJ mice were used to produce polyclonal antisera. About 200 PMs dissected from latex-fed mosquitoes were homogenized in 250 μl of PBS and mixed with an equal volume of adjuvant. Complete Freund's adjuvant was used for the initial immunization and incomplete Freund's adjuvant for all boosts. For each immunization, about 100 μl of the antigen/adjuvant mixture (containing 40 PMs) per mouse were injected intraperitoneally. The antisera were collected after 6 injections at 2-week intervals. Dissected PMs were rinsed briefly with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was then homogenized in H2O containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a disposable plastic pestle. After vortexing for 2 min, the sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was the water-soluble fraction, and the pellet was the water-insoluble fraction. Both fractions were boiled for 10 min with SDS sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol (7Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The proteins in both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) as described by Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Five guts from 4th-instar larvae or from adult mosquitoes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 d after eclosion, were dissected and kept frozen at −80 °C. After adding 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), each sample was boiled for 5 min. An aliquot from each sample (10 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separation, Inc., MA). PM proteins were detected with the anti-PM antiserum. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody, and a chromogenic reaction was used to detect the bound antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Schleicher & Schuell). The anti-PM antiserum was used to screen an A. gambiae midgut cDNA expression library (13Lemos F.J. Cornel A.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with an immunoscreening kit (Stratagene, CA). A phagemid (pBluescript SK) was obtained from each purified bacteriophage byin vivo excision following the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). Both strands of the cDNA insert were sequenced with an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystem). Total RNA was isolated using the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). RNA samples were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 1 m formaldehyde, and then transferred onto a GeneScreen nylon membrane. A probe was made by random labeling of the 774-nucleotide Ag-Aper1 cDNA insert with [α-32P]dCTP (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Church's buffer was used for both prehybridization and hybridization. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C. The final wash was done in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C. Two primers (Aper1N, 5′-ATGAAAGTTTCTGCCAGTTTGGTA; Aper1C, 5′-AATCTTTCCACCCTGAAGCATGCC), located in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, respectively, were designed to amplify the genomic DNA fragment of Ag-Aper1. The PCR was carried out for 32 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. A. gambiae genomic DNA was used as a template. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Further identification of the PCR products as Ag-Aper1 was accomplished by Southern hybridization with the cloned cDNA. Genomic DNA from whole adult mosquitoes was isolated according to Campbell et al. (17Campbell B.C. Bragg T.S. Turner C.E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 415-421Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DNA (5 μg) was digested with either EcoRI or HindIII and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA in the agarose gel was alkali-denatured, neutralized with HCl, and then transferred onto a GeneScreen nylon membrane. Two probes, one made from the cDNA insert and the other from a PCR genomic fragment, were used to hybridize to either of two identical blots. The hybridization and washing conditions were the same as for the Northern analysis described above. TheAg-Aper1 was expressed by recombinant baculovirus in insect cells using the Baculovirus BacPack expression system (CLONTECH, CA). The manufacturer's recommendations were followed. To obtain the transfer plasmid pBacPack9-Ag-Aper1, the Ag-Aper1 cDNA was excised from the plasmid by digestion with BamHI andXhoI, and cloned into the transfer plasmid vector pBacPak9 (CLONTECH). The recombinant baculovirus was generated by co-transfection of pBacPack9-Ag-Aper1 and baculovirus DNA (provided by CLONTECH) into Sf21 cells. To express Ag-Aper1, recombinant viruses were used to infect 107 log growth phase Sf21 cells. The cells were collected by centrifugation 60 h postinfection. The cells were lysed in 6 ml of PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and the insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. About 0.5 ml (settled volume) of chitin (New England BioLabs) or cellulose (Sigma) was washed with PBS and mixed with 2.5 ml of cleared cell lysate. After rocking for 30 min, the matrices were packed into columns. The columns were washed with 2 ml of PBS and then eluted sequentially with 0.5 ml of 50 mm NaAc (pH 5.0) and 0.5 ml with 50 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.0). The matrices were then stripped by boiling with 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS. The protein composition of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected either by Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blotting with the PM antiserum. To obtain PMs without contaminating food proteins, mosquitoes were fed with a protein-free latex meal. We found that the PM formed very quickly, within 30 min of feeding. This is much earlier than the previously reported 13-h lag for blood-fed mosquitoes (18Freyvogel T. Staubli W. Acta Trop. 1965; 22: 118-147PubMed Google Scholar). The protein composition of the water-insoluble and water-soluble PM fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Proteins in the 60-kDa range are the main component of the insoluble fraction, whereas a 180-kDa protein and some smaller proteins appear to compose the soluble fraction. Because adult mosquito PM proteins are glycosylated (7Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is difficult to predict the actual size or number of protein species in the PM. If proteins are glycosylated to different extents, the PM protein complexity could be lower than the number of bands in the gel. Mice were immunized with total adult PM proteins, and the antiserum was used to detect PM proteins in gut extracts. Three major bands were detected (Fig. 2). One is approximately 180 kDa, which may correspond to the 180-kDa water-extractable protein (Fig. 1,lane 2). The two other major bands of around 60 kDa may correspond to the major insoluble proteins shown in lane 1of Fig. 1. The antiserum cross-reacts with some proteins from the larval gut (Fig. 2, lane 1). Although one of the larval proteins co-migrates with the ∼180 kDa adult PM protein, another major cross-reacting protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of over 220 kDa. There were no cross-reacting larval PM proteins in the range of 60 kDa. The results of the experiment in Fig. 2 also indicate that PM proteins are synthesized within the first day of adult life. Although the abundance of the 180-kDa protein does not appear to increase with age, the group of ∼60-kDa proteins appears to increase in amount until day 4 after eclosion, when mosquitoes reach maturity for blood feeding. The finding that PM proteins are stored in the gut epithelium before blood feeding is consistent with the observation that the PM forms within minutes of feeding. A gut cDNA expression library was screened with the anti-PM serum. A cDNA clone, named Ag-Aper1 for Anopheles gambiae adult peritrophin 1, was obtained. It has an insert of 0.77 kilobase pairs and an open reading frame encoding 153 amino acids (Fig. 3). The cDNA has 27 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence and 254 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence. The polyadenylation signal (AATAAAA) is found 30 base pairs upstream of the poly(A) end. The deduced amino acid sequence has a highly hydrophobic N terminus, as expected for a secretory protein. According to von Heijne's rules (19von Heijne G. Nucleic Acid Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar), the signal peptide cleavage site is predicted to be after Ala-17. The conceptual translation of theAg-Aper1 cDNA predicts a protein of 15 kDa, pI of 4.0 with a high content of proline (17.5%), cysteine (8.8%), and aspartic acid (9.5%). The high proline content suggests thatAg-Aper1 has little secondary structure. Western analysis with the same antiserum used to cloneAg-Aper1 did not detect a major protein at ∼15 kDa (Fig. 1). This could be because of protein glycosylation. The Ag-Aper1 amino acid sequence is internally repeated. The amino acid residues of the first and second halves of the protein are 41% identical and 60% conserved (Fig. 4), indicating that the protein is composed of two similar domains. Interestingly, the two domains also share high sequence similarity with the chitin-binding domain of AgChi-1, the gut-specific chitinase from A. gambiae (20Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28895-28900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Sequence comparisons with different data bases by BLAST searching (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 401-410Crossref Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) revealed that Ag-Aper1 also shares low but significant similarity with several groups of proteins that interact (or are presumed to interact) with chitin. These include chitinases from nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans (Swiss-Prot accession no.Q11174, Nhan, N); Brugia malayi (22Fuhrman J.A. Lane W.S. Smith R.F. Piessens W.F. Perler F.B. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16663-16669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). The larval type 2 PM proteins have 5 putative chitin-binding domains, whereas Ag-Aper1 has only two. Northern analysis was used to measure Ag-Aper1 mRNA expression at different developmental stages and in different tissues. The Ag-Aper1mRNA was only detected in adult guts. RNA from adult carcass (whole body minus gut), pupae, or larvae yielded no detectable signal (Fig. 5). Therefore, Ag-Aper1 is an adult gut-specific gene. In the adult midgut, a strong signal was detected 1 day after eclosion (Fig. 6) even though the mRNA appears to be absent from pupae (Fig. 5). Thus, it is likely that Ag-Aper1 transcription is turned on soon after eclosion. Ag-Aper1 mRNA abundance does not change appreciably with age of the mosquito or as a function of time after feeding (Fig. 6). This expression pattern is in agreement with the profile of PM proteins detected by Western analysis (Fig. 2) but different from that of many digestive enzymes that are induced after blood feeding (25Muller H.M. Catteruccia F. Vizioli J. della Torre A. Crisanti A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Muller H.M. Crampton J.M. della Torre A. Sinden R. Crisanti A.

Total RNA was isolated from 30 midguts from sugar-fed mosquitoes of different ages (days after eclosion are indicated) or from 5-day-old mosquitoes at different times after feeding on a γ-globulin meal (hours after feeding are indicated). One-fourth of each RNA sample was fractionated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The blot was hybridized with a 32P-labeled Ag-Aper1 probe. An autoradiograph is shown in the upper panel. A photograph of the ethidium bromide-stained gel before transfer to the membrane is shown in the lower panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ag-Aper1gene copy number was estimated by Southern blotting analysis of genomic DNA digested with either EcoRI or HindIII (Fig. 7). Two bands in the 6-kilobase pair region were detected in the EcoRI digest, whereas only one band was detected with the HindIII digest. Although theAg-Aper1 cDNA does not have an EcoRI site, it is possible that the Ag-Aper1 gene has an intron with anEcoRI site. To investigate this possibility, we performed PCR with primers located at the 3′- and 5′-ends of the cDNA sequence. The size of the PCR product was the same using either the genomic DNA or the cDNA clone as the template (result not shown), indicating that no introns are present within this interval. When the Southern blot of Fig. 7 was rehybridized with the PCR product of genomic DNA it gave the identical pattern as with the cDNA probe (result not shown). Therefore, the Southern blot analysis suggests that they may be two genes (similar or identical) located within 7 kilobase pairs. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that there is only one Ag-Aper1 gene per haploid genome and that because of sequence polymorphism, one allele has an internal EcoRI site although the other does not. The structure of Ag-Aper1 (Fig. 4) suggested that this is a chitin-binding protein. This premise was tested with a functional assay. Ag-Aper1 was expressed in an insect cell line from a recombinant baculovirus and detected with the anti-peritrophic matrix serum as a protein of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 8,lanes 2 and 9 in the lower panels). An extract from cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing the green fluorescent protein was analyzed as a control (Fig. 8,lanes 1 and 8). The antiserum did not detect any proteins, even though more extract was loaded on the gels. This indicates that the antiserum detected specifically the recombinantAg-Aper1 protein. The apparent molecular weight of the recombinant protein is higher than that calculated (15 kDa). This may be because of protein glycosylation.Figure 9Proposed model for the participation of Ag-Aper1 and AgChi-1 (a gut-specific chitinase) in the formation and maintenance of PM structure. The two chitin-binding domains of the PM protein Ag-Aper1 cross-link chitin polymer chains to form a three-dimensional network, whereas the chitinase AgChi-1 binds to chitin and hydrolyzes it, resulting in local disruption and introduction of discontinuities in the network.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The following experiments were to investigate whetherAg-Aper1 binds to chitin, and if so, whether binding is specific for this polymer. Total soluble proteins from cells expressingAg-Aper1 were mixed with an insoluble matrix made of chitin (a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine subunits) or cellulose (a polymer of glucose subunits). The recombinant Ag-Aper1 protein appeared to bind to chitin efficiently, because no Ag-Aper1was detected in the flow-through (Fig. 8, lane 3). The chitin matrix did not absorb proteins nonspecifically since most proteins were present in the flow-through (Fig. 8, upper panel,lanes 2 and 3). The bound proteins were eluted with a pH 2 buffer (Fig. 8, lane 6), but not with a pH 5 buffer (Fig. 8, lane 4). The interaction of Ag-Aper1 with chitin appears to be specific, because no Ag-Aper1 binding was detected to a cellulose matrix (Fig. 8, right panel). Virtually all of the Ag-Aper1 was detected in the flow-through from the cellulose matrix (Fig. 8, lower panel, lane 10). Two bands were detected in the pH 2 eluate by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 8,upper panel, lane 6). One migrates at about 30 kDa, which coincides with the mobility of the band detected by Western analysis (Fig. 8, lower panels). Therefore, this band is likely Ag-Aper1. The upper band also appears to be a chitin-binding protein, and originates either from the Sf21 cells or from the baculovirus itself. Boiling with SDS did not release a significant amount of protein from either matrix (Fig. 8, lanes 7 and13). We conclude that Ag-Aper1 binds to chitin but not to cellulose. Chitin is a linear polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and a key structural component of the PM. In the presence of inhibitors of chitin synthesis, such as Dimilin or Polyoxin D, PM formation is repressed or completely blocked (1Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar). Moreover, feeding mosquitoes with a meal containing chitinase completely blocks PM formation (29Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, chitin is an essential component of the PM. However, it is unknown how chitin fibers interact with proteins to form the PM. The characterization of theAg-Aper1 gene has shed some light on this issue. Ag-Aper1 has two chitin-binding domains connected by a short linker sequence. This double-domain structure suggests that each Ag-Aper1 molecule can bind two chitin fibers and thus form a three-dimensional chitin-Ag-Aper1 network (Fig. 9). Growth of the PM would occur by addition of new chitin fibers and Ag-Aper1 to the existing network, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The two chitin-binding domains of Ag-Aper1 are highly homologous to the chitin-binding domain of the Anophelesgut-specific chitinase (Fig. 4). In the case of chitinase, the chitin-binding domain may enhance enzyme function by facilitating the binding of the enzyme to the chitin fibers (Fig. 9). Although the Ag-Aper1 is presumed to be an essential component of PM synthesis and structure, the gut chitinase would play an inverse but equally important role of controlling PM turnover and porosity. Chitin hydrolysis is likely to serve two physiologically important roles: 1) control of PM thickness by balancing PM growth with degradation; and 2) increase PM porosity to support the heavy “molecular traffic” that occurs during digestion, digestive enzymes crossing the PM from the epithelium toward the food bolus and hydrolytic products traveling in the opposite direction. TheAg-Aper1 protein has two chitin-binding domains that share significant amino acid sequence similarity. It is unlikely that these two domains have arisen independently by convergent evolution. Rather, they probably resulted from gene duplication. Furthermore, the high similarity among the chitin-binding domains of Ag-Aper1 and AgChi-1 suggests that they may be derived from a common ancestor. We propose that the chitin-binding domain is a basic module that combined with other protein sequences to generate new function or modify existing function. Elucidation of PM structure may help clarify howPlasmodium manages to pass through the PM. This knowledge could be used to develop novel strategies to control malaria transmission. For instance, the blood of sheep vaccinated with theL. cuprina larval PM (type 2) hinders larval development, probably because of the blockage of PM pores (32Willadsen P. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 132-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33East I.J. Fitzgerald C.J. Pearson R.D. Donaldson R.A. Vuocolo T. Cadogan L.C. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 1993; 23: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the adult mosquito forms a different type of PM (type 1), it is conceivable that antibodies to adult Anopheles PM proteins will have a similar effect on the PM. This effect could impedePlasmodium to cross the PM, prolong digestion time, and perhaps shorten the life span of the mosquito. The combination of antibodies against PM proteins and gut chitinase may have even more pronounced effects. Inhibition of chitinase may result in a thicker PM, which in turn inhibits Plasmodium development (20Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28895-28900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Billingsley P.F. Rudin W. J. Parasitol. 1992; 78: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The cloning of genes encoding PM proteins may provide the tools to test these ideas. With the advance of germ line transformation of mosquitoes (35Jasinskiene N. Coates C.J. Benedict M.Q. Cornel A.J. Rafferty C.S. James A.A. Collins F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), new approaches became possible for the control of malaria transmission. For instance, it may be possible to genetically engineer mosquitoes that express foreign genes that are toxic to Plasmodium (36Crampton J.M. Warren A. Lycett G.J. Hughes M.A. Comley I.P. Eggleston P. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1994; 88: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This approach requires the identification of a promoter capable of driving the expression of a foreign gene in the right tissue and at the right time. The gut is an excellent target, because Plasmodium must complete a complex developmental program while exposed to the relatively confined environment of the gut lumen. Most gut-specific genes that have been characterized to date reach peak expression and secrete their protein products into gut lumen relatively late after a blood meal, at a time when the lumen (and any parasites therein) is shielded from the secretory epithelium by a thick PM.Ag-Aper1 is different. Large amounts of Ag-Aper1mRNA accumulate prior to the blood meal (Fig. 6), and its protein is presumed to be stored and released immediately after feeding. Thus, the Ag-Aper1 promoter (and its signal peptide) should be ideal for driving the expression of anti-malaria proteins in transgenicAnopheles."

The fragments translocate to the nucleus where they activate genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. The SREBPs are bound to membranes in a hairpin fashion. The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains face the cytoplasm, separated by two membrane spanning segments and a short lumenal loop. The first cleavage occurs at Site-1 in the lumenal loop. The NH2-terminal fragment is then released by cleavage at Site-2, which is believed to lie within the first transmembrane segment. Here, we use a novel cysteine panning method to identify the second cleavage site (Site-2) in human SREBP-2 as the Leu484-Cys485 bond that lies at the junction between the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal fragment and the first transmembrane segment. We transfected cells with cDNAs encoding fusion proteins with single cysteine residues at positions to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal sides of cysteine 485.

Cells maintain cholesterol homeostasis through a feedback pathway that depends upon the regulated proteolytic processing of a pair of membrane-bound transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 and -2 (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; ACBP, acyl-CoA-binding protein; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal; HSV, herpes simplex virus; MPB,Nα-(3-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; S2P, Site-2 protease; TK, thymidine kinase; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

When cells accumulate sterols, proteolysis of the SREBPs is suppressed, nuclear SREBPs decline, and the transcription of the target genes is reduced. This regulation assures a steady supply of cholesterol and fatty acids while preventing their overaccumulation. SREBPs are unique among transcription factors because they are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors with three domains. The precursors are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope in a hairpin orientation (9Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domain (∼480 amino acids) contains an acidic transcriptional activation sequence and a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper element that is responsible for DNA binding and dimerization. The middle segment (∼80 amino acids) consists of two-membrane spanning helices separated by a short hydrophilic loop of 31 amino acids that projects into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. The COOH-terminal segment (∼590 amino acids) projects into the cytoplasm. It is designated the regulatory domain because it is necessary for the sterol-regulated proteolysis of the SREBPs (10Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In response to sterol deprivation, the NH2-terminal domains of the SREBPs are released from membranes by a two-step proteolytic cascade (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The first proteolytic cleavage is regulated by the putative sterol sensor, SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), which forms a complex with the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of the SREBPs (10Sakai J. Nohturfft A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The complex triggers the first cleavage, which occurs at Site-1 in the middle of the lumenal loop (14Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This separates the NH2-terminal half of the SREBP from the COOH-terminal half, but both halves remain membrane bound. The membrane-bound NH2-terminal fragment of SREBP is termed the intermediate (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Next, a second protease, designated the Site-2 protease (S2P), cleaves the NH2-terminal intermediate, apparently within the first transmembrane segment (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Molecular Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The cleaved NH2-terminal domain now travels to the nucleus where it activates transcription by binding to sterol regulatory elements in the promoters of the genes described above. The activity of S2P is not itself regulated by sterols, but it cleaves the NH2-terminal domain at Site-2 only after the protein has been cleaved at Site-1 (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X.

The cDNA encoding S2P, a multiple membrane-spanning protein that is required for Site-2 proteolysis, was recently identified by complementation cloning in a mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary cells (M19 cells) (16Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that lack this activity (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S.

Lacking the ability to cleave the SREBPs at Site-2, M19 cells are unable to transcribe cholesterol biosynthetic genes and are thus cholesterol auxotrophs (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar,15Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y.

Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When transfected into M19 cells, the S2P cDNA restores cleavage at Site-2 and relieves the need for exogenous cholesterol. S2P contains the consensus metalloprotease zinc-binding site, HEXXH (15Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Molecular Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site abolishes S2P activity, and it was concluded that S2P is indeed the Site-2 protease (15Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Molecular Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We recently mapped Site-1 of human SREBP-2 to the Leu522-Ser523 bond in the lumenal loop by a combination of mutagenesis, [35S]methionine labeling, and radiochemical sequencing of the cleaved COOH-terminal fragment (14Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To estimate the location of Site-2, we previously replaced the NH2 terminus of SREBP-2 with H-Ras and used truncated forms of this fusion protein as size standards for comparison with the fully processed fusion protein (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that Site-2 is located somewhere within the first transmembrane segment, but the precise peptide bond was not identified. Proteolysis of the SREBPs at Site-2 is abolished when the sequence D478RSR, which is immediately proximal to the first transmembrane segment, is replaced with AS (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In designing a strategy to identify the precise location of Site-2, we faced several obstacles. Radiochemical sequencing was not possible because this technique relies upon the ability to isolate the COOH-terminal product of the cleavage reaction (14Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Following Site-2 proteolysis, this small fragment (∼40 amino acids) is likely to be rapidly degraded. Mass spectrometry could be used to determine the precise mass of the nuclear NH2-terminal fragment. However, this would require the isolation of relatively large amounts of this fragment from cell nuclei. This is not feasible in cultured cells because overexpression of SREBPs by transfection leads to artifactual proteolytic processing (17Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Faithful processing is observed only when the cells express low levels of SREBPs through the use of weak promoters, such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase promoter (17Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We herein report a novel technique that permits the identification of the precise peptide bond cleaved during proteolysis at Site-2. We produced a fusion protein whose NH2-terminal fragment lacks cysteine. Each residue near Site-2 was singly replaced with cysteine, the released NH2-terminal fragment was isolated, and its susceptibility to a cysteine modification reagent was studied. The results demonstrate that Site-2 cleavage occurs at a bond that appears to lie just inside the first transmembrane segment of human SREBP-2,i.e. the Leu484-Cys485 bond. This cleavage site is located three residues to the COOH-terminal side of the D478RSR sequence that was shown previously to be required for the Site-2 cleavage reaction (12Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We obtained IgG-HSV-Tag™ monoclonal antibody from Novagen; streptavidin-agarose from ProZyme, Inc.; Ni-NTA-agarose from Qiagen; cytochrome c and bovine serum albumin from Sigma-Aldrich; Rat Brain QUICK-Clone cDNA fromCLONTECH; N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) from U.

The expression vector pTK-HSV-ACBP/BP2 encodes an epitope-tagged ACBP (acyl-CoA-binding protein)/SREBP-2 fusion protein (782 amino acids) consisting of an initiator methionine, two tandem copies of the HSV epitope (QPELAPEDPED) (17Hua X.

To construct pTK-HSV-ACBP/BP2, we first used oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to produce an intermediate plasmid with a uniqueAgeI site immediately following the H-Ras sequence in pTK-HSV-Ras-BP2(473–1141). The cDNA encoding amino acids 2–87 of rat ACBP was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using rat brain cDNA as a template (CLONTECH), an NH2-terminal primer flanked by an EcoRV site, and a COOH-terminal primer flanked by an AgeI site. The amplified product was digested with EcoRV andAgeI and ligated into the unique EcoRV andAgeI sites of the intermediate plasmid (described above). The expression vector pTK-HSV-8His-ACBP/BP2 encodes the sequence described above with an insertion of 11 amino acids between the HSV tag and ACBP/BP2. To construct pTK-HSV-8His-ACBP/BP2, a pair of complementary oligonucleotides (top strand, 5′-ATCCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACACCGGT-3′; bottom strand, 5′-ACCGGTGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGAT-3′) were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the unique EcoRV restriction site of pTK-HSV-BP2-ACBP/BP2. The inserted oligonucleotides encode 11 amino acids (isoleucine, 8 histidines, threonine, and glycine). The expression vector pTK-HSV-8His-BP2 encodes the same sequence as pTK-HSV-BP2 (Ref. 17Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

To construct pTK-HSV-8His-BP2, complementary oligonucleotides (top strand, 5′-CGCACATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACAT-3′; bottom strand, 5′-CGATGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTG-3′) were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the unique BspDI restriction site of pTK-HSV-BP2. The structures of the above expression vectors were confirmed by sequencing all ligation junctions and the entire ACBP coding region. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA using the Muta-gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Version-2 kit (Bio-Rad). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the relevant region; at least two independent clones of each mutant were independently transfected. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were set up for experiments on day 0 (4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and cultured in 8–9% CO2 at 37 °C in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum.

For transfections involving pTK-HSV-8His-BP2 and its mutant versions, the cells received ALLN (N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml 3 h prior to harvest. Cells transfected with constructs encoding ACBP/SREBP-2 fusion proteins did not receive ALLN prior to harvest.

All buffers contained the following protease inhibitors: 25 μg/ml ALLN, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. The cytosol fraction was not precipitated with acetone, but used directly in hypotonic buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The procedure used to identify the Site-2 cleavage site in SREBP-2 is outlined in Fig. 4. All buffers were freshly prepared before each experiment. Aliquots of nuclear extracts (500 μg of protein; 0.2 ml from four pooled 60-mm dishes of transfected 293 cells) were mixed with 2 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 3 murea, and 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 5 mmimidazole-HCl (pH 8.0) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by 37 °C for 3 min. All subsequent operations were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Each sample was then mixed with 75 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose (washed in buffer A), rotated for 30 min, and centrifuged at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 3 min. The agarose beads were washed 3 times (2 min each) in 1 ml of buffer A supplemented with 5 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 8.0). The His-tagged SREBP-2 was eluted from the Ni-NTA-agarose by mixing the beads for 10 min in 0.4 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, 8 m urea, and 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 100 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0). The mixture was centrifuged at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 3 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to 90 μm dithiothreitol and incubated for 20 min. The volume was then brought to 1.3 ml with PBS-Tween (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20), and each sample then received a 0.2-ml addition of either NEM or MPB at a final concentration of 0.35 mm. (Stock solutions of 1.6 mg/ml NEM and MPB were made up in PBS-Tween and stored at −20° C.) After 60 min, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm.

To identify potential cellular targets for HCV core protein, a human liver cDNA library was screened for core-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. Among the proteins identified was heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), which has been demonstrated to be a transcriptional regulator. The interaction of HCV core protein with hnRNP K was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase fusion protein binding assay, protein-protein blotting assay, and coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, these two proteins were shown to be partially colocalized in the nucleus. The hnRNP K-binding site in HCV core protein was mapped to the region from amino acid residues 25–91, a hydrophilic area near the N terminus. The HCV core protein-binding domain was located within amino acid residues 250 to 392, which contain the three proline-rich domains, of hnRNP K. Furthermore, HCV core protein relieved the suppression effect of hnRNP K on the activity of the human thymidine kinase gene promoter. The specific binding of HCV core protein to hnRNP K suggests that multiple functions of hnRNP K may be disrupted by the core protein during HCV infection and thus explains, in part, the pathogenesis of HCV.

The genome of HCV is approximately 9.5 kilobases and contains a 9-kilobase open reading frame, which encodes a polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids (11Choo Q.-L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K.

Chen D.-S. Virology. 1992; 188: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The polyprotein is cleaved by host and viral proteases into three structural proteins, including the core protein and two envelope proteins, and at least six nonstructural proteins (16Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core protein, which is the major component of the viral nucleocapsid, is cleaved from the very N terminus of the polyprotein by a host signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum (17Hussy P.

Recent studies have shown that HCV core protein can modulate the expression of several viral and cellular genes (23Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J.

These properties together suggest that HCV core protein may affect normal cellular functions and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of HCV. To explore the potential targets of the core protein during HCV infection, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human liver cDNA library for cellular proteins that can interact with HCV core protein. We have previously characterized one of the major proteins detected, namely, lymphotoxin-β-receptor (28Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.-Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.-Y. Ou J.-H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. In this study, we report the second molecule detected in the yeast two-hybrid screening. This molecule, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), was isolated in two independently derived cDNA clones. hnRNP K has both RNA-binding and DNA-binding properties, with preference for polypyrimidine sequences (29Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a component of the hnRNP complex and is predominantly present in the nucleus, but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (31Buchenau P. Saumweber H. Arndt-Jovin D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Therefore, hnRNP K is thought to participate in the processing and transport of pre-mRNA (33Dreyfuss G. Matunis-M-J Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). hnRNP K has also been demonstrated to be a transcriptional regulator, which stimulates the c-mycpromoter in vitro (30Takimoto M.

We showed that HCV core protein can relieve the suppression effect of hnRNP K on the activities of the human thymidine kinase gene promoterin vivo. These results suggest that HCV core protein can disrupt the multiple functions of hnRNP K and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of HCV. COS-7, a monkey kidney cell line, and K12 (36Kim Y.K.

The plasmids used for in vitro translation of the core protein from various HCV isolates were constructed as described previously (28Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.-Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.-Y. Ou J.-H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid used forin vitro translation and expression of hnRNP K in K12 cells was constructed by subcloning the blunt-ended EcoRI fragment from psp72-hnRNP K, kindly provided by Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss (29Matunis M.J.

The truncation mutants of HCV core protein and hnRNP K used for mapping the interacting domains in the yeast two-hybrid system were constructed by subcloning PCR-generated cDNA fragments in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the GAL4 activation domain plasmids, respectively. The plasmid phTK-CAT, which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene driven by the human thymidine kinase promoter containing 474 base pairs of promoter sequence, was constructed as described previously (40Li L.-J. Naeve G.S. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3554-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The procedures for the yeast two-hybrid screening were described previously (28Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.-Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.-Y. Ou J.-H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, theSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain SFY526 was grown in YPD (containing 1% of yeast extract, 2% of peptone, 2% of dextrose) or synthetic minimal medium (containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, and appropriate auxotrophic supplements). Yeast was cotransformed with both GAL4 DNA-binding domain hybrid and GAL4 activation domain hybrid plasmids by the lithium acetate method (41Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar) and selected for leucine and tryptophan prototrophy. The β-galactosidase activity was assayed 3–4 days after transformation by the colony lift β-galactosidase filter assay; briefly, the nitrocellulose filter replicas of yeast transformants were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 20 s to permeabilize the yeast, then dried and incubated with buffer containing 0.8 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Blue colonies were scored 6 h after reactions. The E. colistrain BL21(DE3) was transformed with a GST-hnRNP K-expressing vector and grown in LB medium containing ampicillin. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by adding 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and sonicated on ice. GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were washed four times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and once with PBS. [35S]Met-labeled HCV core proteins were generated by using a coupled in vitrotranscription and translation system (Promega). Approximately equal amounts of GST and GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining, were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with [35S]Met-labeled HCV core protein in binding buffer (42Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed four times with the binding buffer, and bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and visualized by autoradiography. Partially purified GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins and E. coli-expressed recombinant HCV core protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, or electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was first incubated with blocking solution (43Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar) (2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% non-fat milk, 4% bovine serum albumin, and 2.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone) for 1 h at room temperature and then with [35S]Met-labeled protein in binding buffer (43Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol.

Bound [35S]Met-labeled protein was visualized by autoradiography. In vitrotranslated, [35S]Met-labeled proteins were mixed in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), precleaned with protein A-Sepharose-bound rabbit preimmune serum, and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose-bound rabbit polyclonal antibody against HCV core protein (39Matsumoto M. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Zhu N. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1996; 218: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for 4 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed four times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. COS-7 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7–3 expressing T7 RNA polymerase (44Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). At 2 h post-infection, cells were cotransfected with HCV core protein- and N-Flag-hnRNP K-expressing vectors by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (45Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (46Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mmsodium fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) 12 h after transfection. Lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose-bound anti-Flag (Eastman Kodak Co.) or anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim). Beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:250) against HCV core protein in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was washed again with PBS, incubated with125I-protein A for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again with PBS. The membrane was dried and subjected to autoradiography. COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were cotransfected with GFP-HCV core protein- and N-Flag-hnRNP K-expressing plasmids, by the (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl[-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts method (Boehringer Mannheim). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and stained with the anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (5 mg/ml) and the rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (American Qualex) (1:100) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The stained cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The CAT reporter plasmid phTK-CAT, and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pCMV/β-galactosidase, under the control of a CMV promoter, were cotransfected into K12 cells together with hnRNP K-expressing and the various HCV core protein-expressing vectors using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min prior to CAT assays. CAT activities were measured according to the published method (47Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) and normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression. To identify possible cellular proteins interacting with HCV core protein, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to screen a human liver cDNA library, using the hydrophilic region of HCV core protein (aa 1–115) as a bait as reported previously (28Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.-Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.-Y. Ou J.-H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty positive clones were obtained from a total of 4.7 × 106 transformants screened. DNA sequence analysis showed that two of the 20 positive clones matched the cDNA sequence of hnRNP K. Both of these two clones represent nucleotides 231–1282 of hnRNP K cDNA sequence, corresponding to amino acid residues 42–392 of hnRNP K, fused in frame to the GAL4 activation domain (Fig. 1). Re-transformation of these two clones into the yeast host produced blue colonies only in the presence of the pGBT9/HCVcore(1–115) plasmid, but not the empty vector, indicating that this hnRNP K clone specifically interacts with HCV core protein. As shown previously, the full-length HCV core protein (aa 1–191) did not interact with hnRNP K in the yeast two-hybrid screen, probably because the strong hydrophobicity of the C-terminal residues of the core protein prevented its function in the yeast two-hybrid system. But the full-length core protein did have a similar binding properties to those of the truncated (aa 1–115) core protein (see below). To confirm the binding between HCV core protein and hnRNP K, we first performed in vitro binding studies between hnRNP K and HCV core protein using GST fusion protein binding assay. Thein vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled HCV core protein was incubated with partially purified GST-hnRNP K fusion protein, and bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the core protein bound to GST-hnRNP K but not to GST. The in vitro translated core protein consisted of two major species (21 and 18 kDa) and several high molecular weight core protein aggregates, as demonstrated previously (39Matsumoto M. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Zhu N. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1996; 218: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All of these protein species bound to GST-hnRNP K. Furthermore, C terminus-truncated core proteins, including aa 1–115, 1–153, and 1–173, bound to the GST-hnRNP K to the same extent, indicating that the binding domain is located within the N-terminal 115 amino acids of the core protein (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the result of the yeast two-hybrid screening, which showed that the aa 1–115 of the HCV core protein is sufficient for binding to hnRNP K (see below). The remaining sequences (aa 116–191) did not affect thein vitro binding properties of the core protein, but did affect its hydrophobic properties and subcellular distribution (see below). For all of the full-length and truncated HCV core proteins used, approximately 10–15% of input radioactivity bound to GST-hnRNP K. There was no difference in the extent of binding among the various constructs. To establish that the hnRNP K binding was not unique to the sequence of this particular HCV clone, we examined the core proteins from two other HCV isolates (Southern California (RH) and the prototype Chiron isolates) (48Lo S.-Y. Selby M. Tong M. Ou J.-H. Virology. 1994; 199: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins bound to GST-hnRNP K but not to GST (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicated that the ability to bind to hnRNP K is a general property of the core protein from different HCV isolates. We next used a far-Western protein-protein blotting assay to confirm the interaction between the two proteins. Partially purified GST and GST-hnRNP K from E. coli were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with in vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled HCV core protein. The results showed that HCV core protein bound to GST-hnRNP K but not to GST (Fig. 3 B). It is significant that the smaller GST-hnRNP K bands (Fig. 3 A) did not bind to HCV core protein (Fig. 3B). Because these smaller proteins likely represent the C terminus-truncated forms of GST-hnRNP K, these results suggest that the binding requires the C-terminal sequence of hnRNP K. This conclusion was confirmed by subsequent mapping studies (see below, Fig. 8). We also performed a reverse experiment usingE. coli-expressed HCV core protein and [35S]Met-labeled hnRNP K in the protein blotting assay. The results also showed that hnRNP K bound to the recombinant HCV core protein (Fig. 3 D). However, hnRNP K also bound to severalE. coli proteins. We next performed coimmunoprecipitation ofin vitro translated core protein and hnRNP K. [35S]Met-labeled HCV core and hnRNP K were translated, incubated together, and then precipitated with the antibody against HCV core protein. The results showed that hnRNP K was coprecipitated by the antibody against HCV core protein (Fig. 4, lane 4). However, only about 1–2% of the translated hnRNP K could be coprecipitated with the HCV core protein under this in vitro condition. Nevertheless, this coprecipitation was specific, because no hnRNP K was precipitated in the absence of core protein (Fig. 4, lane 3). These three independent approaches together conclusively showed that hnRNP K and HCV core protein could interact with each otherin vitro.Figure 8Mapping of the HCV core protein-binding domain in hnRNP K. Various hnRNP K truncation mutants were fused to the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD424. HCV core protein (aa 1–115) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9. Both plasmids were cotransformed into yeast strain SFY526. The cotransformants were selected and subjected to the β-galactosidase activity assay. Blue colonies were scored as positive.

To determine the role of Tel in normal hematopoietic development, we used the tel gene as the bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a hematopoietic stem cell library. Two partners were identified: Tel binds to itself, and Tel binds to the ets family member Fli-1. In vitroand in vivo assays confirmed these interactions. In transient transfection assays, Fli-1 transactivates megakaryocytic specific promoters, and Tel inhibits this effect of Fli-1. Transactivation studies using deletion mutants of Tel, and the Tel-AML-1 fusion protein, indicate that the helix-loop-helix domain of Tel only partially inhibits transactivation and that complete inhibition requires the full-length Tel molecule, including the DNA binding domain. The Tel and Fli-1 proteins are expressed early in hematopoiesis, and the inability of Tel fusion proteins such as Tel-AML-1 to counteract Fli-1 mediated transactivation may contribute to the malignant phenotype in human leukemias where this fusion protein is present.

Acute and chronic human leukemias are frequently associated with chromosomal translocations which result in the formation of chimeric proteins. Considerable evidence indicates that these chimeric proteins play a role in transformation (1Rabbitts T. Cell. 1991; 67: 641-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). At least one member of the chimeric protein is frequently a transcription factor, implicating disordered regulation of target genes as a mechanism of transformation. In most cases the role of these transcription factors in normal hematopoiesis has not been determined. Recently a member of the ets family of transcription factors, Tel, was identified at the site of chromosomal breakage in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) where it forms a chimeric protein with the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β chain (PDGFRβ) (2Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Lovett M. Gilliland D.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Tel has now been shown to be involved in a number chromosomal translocations in human leukemias. The Tel-AML-1 fusion is present in approximately 40% of cases of childhood pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 1The abbreviations used are: ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; HLH, helix-loop-helix; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SCF, stem cell factor; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; HLH, helix-loop-helix; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SCF, stem cell factor; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. making it the most common molecular abnormality in childhood cancer (3Golub T.R.

Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1995; 9: 1985-1989PubMed Google Scholar). In a number of cases involving tel translocations, the remainingtel allele is deleted, suggesting that loss of functional Tel may contribute to leukemic transformation. Tel contains the highly conserved ETS DNA-binding domain at the carboxyl-terminal region as well as a distinct 5′ region with weak homology to the well described helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain (also referred to as the pointed domain) (2Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Lovett M. Gilliland D.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The predicted HLH secondary structure in the amino-terminal region suggests that this region may be involved in protein-protein interactions (6Seth A. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1761-1767PubMed Google Scholar). To identify potential protein partners of Tel, we screened a hematopoietic stem cell library using Tel in the bait plasmid (7Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We identified two partners of Tel, Tel itself, and the etsprotein Fli-1. Two-hybrid screens and parent vectors pBTM116 and pVP16 were as described by (8Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 38113-38122Crossref Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLexA-Tel-(1–371) was constructed by insertion of the Tel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product encoding amino acids from 1 to 371 intoEcoRI-BamHI sites of pBTM116, resulting in an open reading frame encoding a LexA-Tel fusion protein. Tel was constructed by PCR with the following primers: 5′-CGGAATTCCGGATGTCTGAGACTCCTGCTCAGT-3′ (coding strand) and 5′-CGGGATCCCGTGAGGTGGACTGTTGGTTCCTTC-3′ (noncoding strand). The PCR product was cut with EcoRI and BamHI, and the 1125-bp fragment was cloned. The EML-1 cell line cDNA library was amplified once in DH5α and transformed into yeast containing pLexA-Tel-(1–371) (7Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Plasmids pVP-Tel-(19–163), pVP-Fli-(32–334), and pVP-Fli-(14–230) were identified as clones that activated lacZ transcription and conferred histidine prototrophy in the presence of pLexA-Tel-(1–371). Binding specificity was confirmed in the mating test with specific bait pLexA-Tel-(1–371) versusnonspecific bait pLexA-Lamin (pBTM116 expressing LexA-Lamin fusion protein). Plasmids were sequenced by automatic fluorescent sequencing (Applied Biosystems). In vitro transcription-translation was performed in TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of l-[35S]methionine (specific activity 37.0 TBq/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All clones were transcribed under the control of T7 promoter. In each case, 2 μl of a 25-μl translation reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2 A.). Radiolabeled Fli-1 protein (5 μl of translation reaction) was mixed with one of each radiolabeled proteins, PU.1, CD18, CD11a, RARα, Luciferase, or Tel-(1–371) (5 μl of translation reaction in each case) and immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti human Fli-1 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Plasmids pGST-Fli and pGST-Tel-(1–371) were cloned by linking the full-length coding sequence of Fli-1 protein (amino acids 1–452) and the coding sequence for amino acids from 1 to 371 of Tel intoBamHI/XhoI and EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. This resulted in vectors expressing GST-Fli-1 and GST-Tel fusion proteins. Both fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α cells according to directions from the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were obtained by sonication 4–6 times for 15 s on ice. GST fusion proteins were bound to the glutathione-Sepharose by incubating 500 μl of bacterial cell lysate with 20 μl of Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For the in vivo protein binding assay, coding sequence for full-length Tel protein (amino acids 1–452) was cloned into theXhoI/XbaI site in pCS2+MT vector expressing six Myc domains (9Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). This cloning resulted in a vector expressing the fusion Myc-Tel proteins with the Myc domain located at the amino terminus of Tel protein. Wild type protein was expressed from pSG5-Tel vector (full-length Tel coding sequence for amino acids 1–452 inEcoRI/BglII site of pSG5 vector). 293 cells were cultured on 100-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed with 10 μg of each plasmid with the calcium phosphate method (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Forty eight h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed by incubation for 10 min at 4 °C in cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin). 20–100 μl of 293 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (αmyc 9E10, Sigma) or nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 7.5% SDS gels. Protein immunoblots were probed with Tel antiserum produced by five sequential immunizations of a rabbit with synthesized peptide H-TNHRPSPDPEQRPLRC-OH (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) emulsified with Freund's Adjuvant. This antiserum detected all forms of human Tel protein used in this study on Western blots and showed no cross-reactivity with any other human protein. Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. For electroporations, 300 μl of ∼8 × 106 cells/ml, washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640, was mixed with 10 μg of pL(Fli-1)SN plasmid (wild type human Fli-1 coding sequence ligated into HpaI/XhoI site of pLXSN vector) and 10 μg of pSG5-Tel-(1–452) in a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette (BTX, San Diego, CA). Cells were electroporated with 275 V, 600 microfarads, and 13 ohm using Elecro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX). After 48 h of incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were harvested and lysates were prepared as described previously. 100–200 μl of lysate was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-human Fli-1 antibody (PharMingen). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the human Tel protein was used for detection. CD34+ cells were purified and cultured as described (11Bauer Jr., T. Dennis D. Hickstein Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For differentiation, growth factors interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, G-CSF, and GM-CSF and stem cell factor (SCF) were added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Lysates were created from identical numbers of cells at designated time periods. Anti-Tel and anti-Fli-1 antibodies were used to detect their respective proteins. For transactivation assays, 293 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium-phosphate method with 5 μg of each of the indicated plasmids, and cell lysates were prepared after 48 h of incubation. For internal control of transfection efficiency, all samples were co-transfected with the vector pCMV-GH (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) expressing human growth hormone. Twenty μl of cell lysate was assayed for luciferase activity by using Promega luciferase assay kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The activity was assayed by using a Turner two-dimensional 20e luminometer. The growth hormone assay was performed by the use of HGH-TGES 100T kit (Nichols Institute) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To identify potential partners of Tel in normal hematopoietic cell development, we used a LexA-Tel fusion protein consisting of the first 371 amino acids of Tel to screen a yeast two-hybrid library constructed from a murine pluripotent hematopoietic cell line (EML-1) (7Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The fragment of Tel used in the bait plasmid contains the HLH domain. Five positive clones were identified from 2 × 106transformants screened. Two ets family members were identified as partners of Tel, Tel itself and Fli-1 (Fig. 1). The two 435-bp Tel cDNA clones that were isolated include the entire HLH domain, and the three positive clones coding for Fli-1 also include the HLH domain (Fig. 1) (12Rao V.N. Ohno T. Prasad D.D. Bhattacharya G. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2167-2173PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the amino-terminal HLH domain in each protein is involved in the interaction. To confirm the specificity of the Tel/Tel and Tel/Fli-1 interaction, we conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Initially, we expressed several proteins known to be involved in protein-protein interactions using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 2 A). These proteins were then used in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2 B). Monoclonal antibodies directed against Fli-1 immunoprecipitated the human Tel protein (amino acids 1–371) but none of the control proteins (Fig. 2 B, lane Fli-1 + Tel). Additional in vitro experiments addressed the specificity of protein-protein interactions. In in vitro studies, GST-Fli-1 bound to35S-Met-Tel protein (amino acids 1–371) but not to control35S-Met-Luciferase (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, GST-Tel associated with 35S-Met-Tel (1–371 amino acid fragment), but not with 35S-Met-Luciferase (Fig. 2 C). In vivo experiments confirmed the interaction of Tel and Fli-1. When the Tel protein containing the Myc domain at its amino terminus and wild type Tel protein were expressed in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, the anti-Myc antibody immunoprecipitated wild type Tel protein as well as the Myc-Tel protein (Fig. 2 D). Neither mouse nonspecific IgG (Fig. 2 D) nor anti-Myc antibody (data not shown) were able to immunoprecipitate the wild type Tel protein alone. The Tel-Fli-1 interaction in vivo was tested in K562 cells electroporated with expression vectors harboring wild type Fli-1 and wild type Tel. Cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an anti-Fli-1 antibody revealed the presence of the accompanying Tel protein on Western blots using an anti-Tel antibody (Fig. 2 E). The Tel protein was not present in lysates immunoprecipitated with nonspecific mouse IgG and probed with the anti-Tel antibody (Fig. 2 E). To identify the stage of hematopoietic cell development at which Tel and Fli-1 are expressed, human CD34+ cells were differentiated with IL-3, IL-6, SCF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF, and the appearance of Tel and Fli-1 proteins was detected by Western blotting. Fli-1 protein was expressed at day 0, peaked at day 2 of differentiation, and decreased to undetectable levels by day 4 (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the Tel protein displayed a similar pattern of appearance with a peak at 2 days of differentiation and a decrease to undetectable levels by day 4 (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether Tel and Fli-1 displayed a functional interaction, the transactivation abilities of Tel and Fli-1 proteins were tested individually and in concert on promoters containing ETS binding sites (Fig. 4 A). Recombinant Fli-1 has been shown to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner and to transcriptionally activate the platelet glycoprotein IIb promoter (12Rao V.N. Ohno T. Prasad D.D. Bhattacharya G. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2167-2173PubMed Google Scholar,13Zhang L. Lemarchandel V. Romeo P.H. Ben David Y. Greer P. Bernstein A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used the promoters from the related megakaryocytic genes GPIbα (14Hashimoto Y. Ware J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24532-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and GPIX (15Bastian L.S. Yagi M. Chan C. Roth G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18554-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) which contain ETS sequences. The GPIbα promoter region extended to −567 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site, and the GPIX promoter region covered 203 bp proximal to the transcriptional start site. Transfection of Fli-1 resulted in a 3.5-fold increase of activity of the GPIbα promoter and a 7-fold increase in the activity of the GPIX promoter (Fig. 4, B and C). Expression of Tel alone did not activate either promoter; however, co-transfection of Tel with Fli-1 together resulted in complete inhibition of Fli-1-mediated transactivation (Fig. 4, B and C). Transfection of Fli-1, Tel, or the two ets factors together did not transactivate a GPIX promoter construct in which the ETS site was deleted (pGPIX-EETS-Luc) (Fig. 4 D). Thus, Tel inhibits Fli-1-mediated transactivation of megakaryocytic promoters as GPIbα and GPIX (Fig. 4) and as GPIIb (data not shown), and the ETS binding site in the promoter sequence is required for transactivation. To analyze the mechanism whereby Tel inhibits Fli-1-mediated transactivation in more detail, we generated deletion mutants of Tel. The Tel H protein consists of the HLH domain of Tel, and Tel D consists of the DNA binding domain of Tel (Fig. 5 A). To assess whether Tel fusion proteins identified in human leukemias are capable of inhibiting the transactivation mediated by Fli-1, we also expressed the Tel-AML-1 fusion protein present in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These constructs were tested in transactivation assays with Fli-1 on the GPIX promoter. Transfection of the Tel and Fli-1 constructs were adjusted to achieve expression of equivalent amounts of respective proteins (Fig. 5 C). In these experiments, wild type Tel was able to completely abrogate transactivation (Fig. 5 B). The Tel H, Tel D, and Tel-AML-1 constructs partially inhibited Fli-1-mediated transactivation (Fig. 5 B). Similar data have been obtained using the GPIbα promoter (data not shown). These data indicate that full-length Tel protein is necessary to completely repress Fli-1-mediated transactivation. The Tel H construct, lacking the DNA binding domain, inhibits Fli-1-mediated transactivation by approximately 50%, indicating that protein-protein interaction between Tel and Fli-1 most likely accounts for this effect. The mechanism whereby the Tel D construct inhibits transactivation has not been established. We and others have not been able to demonstrate DNA-binding activity by Tel (data not shown). It is possible that the Tel DNA-binding domain may recruit a generalized transcriptional repressor to the promoter. To determine whether overexpression of the Tel truncation constructs abrogated Fli-1-mediated transactivation of the GPIX promoter, titration experiments were performed. Transactivation experiments were conducted using increasing molar ratios of Tel expression constructs (Tel, Tel H, Tel D, and Tel-AML-1) to Fli-1 expressing plasmid DNA (Fig. 6). Three sets of transactivations were performed with Tel constructs to Fli-1 DNA molar ratios of 1:1, 2.5:1, and 5:1, respectively. Increasing amounts of Tel H or Tel D protein resulted in only a small effect on the ability of these proteins to inhibit Fli-1 transactivation of the GPIX promoter (Fig. 6). The addition of increasing amounts of Tel-AML-1 resulted in a modest increase in the ability of the fusion protein to repress Fli-1-mediated transactivation. These results confirm our previous observation that the full-length Tel protein is necessary to completely inhibit Fli-1 transactivation of the GPIX promoter, and they indicate that the effect of the Tel mutant proteins appears to reach a plateau at a 1:1 molar ratio. With Tel-AML-1, the expression of the chimeric protein in these studies may not represent the physiological level of the protein in cells from ALL patients because, in at least one ALL cell line expressing Tel-AML-1 protein (the REH cell line), the level of expression of Fli-1 was more than 10-fold higher then the expression of Tel-AML-1 (data not shown). The wild type Tel protein is not expressed by REH cells. In this cell line, it is possible that the low molar ratio of Tel-AML-1 protein to Fli-1 protein expression may not be sufficient to inhibit the activation of Fli-1 target genes in these ALL cells. Ets family members have been identified at the site of chromosomal translocations in primitive stem cell tumors including leukemia (16Hromas R. Klemsz M. Int. J. Hematol. 1994; 59: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of Fli-1 as a partner of Tel is of interest for several reasons. First, the interaction of Tel with Fli-1 was unexpected since ets family members have previously not been demonstrated to form heterodimers with others ets family members (17Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Second, Fli-1 is involved in malignancies in both mouse and man. Mouse fli-1 (Friend leukemia integration site 1) gene was identified originally as a proto-oncogene insertionally activated in 75% of erythroleukemias derived from newborn mice infected with F-MuLV (Friend murine leukemia virus (18Ben David Y. Giddens E.B. Letwin K. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 908-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)). Erythroleukemia cell lines induced by F-MuLV expressed high levels of Fli-1 transcript (18Ben David Y. Giddens E.B. Letwin K. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 908-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The human homologue of fli-1 is rearranged in Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma as a result of a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(11;22) that fuses the DNA binding domain of Fli-1 to a novel amino-terminal sequence of theEws gene (19Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. et al.Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Thus, not only is Fli-1 involved in human and mouse malignancies, but its DNA-binding domain is preserved in both instances. There are reasons to suspect that Tel and Fli-1 may have opposing roles in development. Whereas Fli-1 translocations preserve the DNA binding domain of Fli-1, the translocations involving Tel almost invariably result in the loss of the Tel DNA binding domain and preserve the helix-loop-helix domain of Tel in the fusion protein. This suggests that Fli-1 retains its ability to recognize its target genes as a fusion protein and Tel does not. In Tel translocations, the chimeric Tel fusion protein may also dimerize with the normal Tel protein from the other allele and result in a loss of normal, wild-type Tel function (3Golub T.R.

Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1995; 9: 1985-1989PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the remaining Tel allele is deleted in up to one-third of patients with the Tel/AML-1 translocation is consistent with the loss-of-function hypothesis of Tel as a result of the generation of the chimeric protein (3Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Bohlander S.K. Hiebert S.W. Ward D.C. Bray Ward P. Morgan E. Raimondi S.C. Rowley J.D. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Future studies will address the effect of Tel and Fli-1, and their respective fusion proteins, on the process of malignant transformation."

Activated HIV-1-infected monocytes secrete high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF). TNF-α and PAF are elevated in the central nervous system of patients with HIV-1-associated dementia. We now demonstrate that conditioned media from activated HIV-1-infected monocytes induces neuronal apoptosis, which can be prevented by co-incubation with PAF acetylhydrolase, the enzyme that catabolizes PAF in the central nervous system. Preceding apoptosis is a TNF-α-induced increase in neuronal ceramide levels.

However, there is not a good correlation between viral burden in the central nervous system and neurologic disease, which is presumably secondary to neuronal dysfunction and death. Recently, the extent of neurologic dysfunction (i.e. dementia) has been correlated with the total number of macrophages and activated microglia in the brain parenchyma, rather than the number of HIV-1-infected macrophages and microglia (1Glassa J.D. Fedor H. Wesselingh S.L. McArthur J.C. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Because direct infection of neurons with HIV-1 is unlikely, these findings suggest that neuronal dysfunction and death are mediated by soluble factors released by macrophages and microglia. We and others have demonstrated that HIV-1-infected monocytes, when activated by antigenic stimuli in vitro or contact with neural cells in vivo, release high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) (2Genis P.

Belardelli F.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5874-5882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAF, in turn, appears to up-regulate TNF-α synthesis in HIV-1-infected cells of monocytic lineage (5Weissman D. Poli G. Bousseau A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2537-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, the number of macrophages expressing mRNA for TNF-α is elevated in the brains of patients with HIV-D, compared with patients with HIV-1 infection but without dementia (6Wesselingh S.L.

PAF is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV-1-associated dementia and immunosuppression (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.B.

We have previously demonstrated in both primary human neuronal cultures and in a differentiated human neuronal cell line that TNF-α and PAF induce dose-dependent apoptosis (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S.

DiLoreto D. del Cerro C. del Cerro M. Epstein L.G. Neuroscience. 1994; 15: 417-422Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that reciprocal relationships between TNF-α and PAF exist, and that TNF-α and PAF play a major role in the pathogenesis of HIV-D. Nevertheless, the mechanisms for TNF-α- and PAF-mediated neuronal apoptosis in HIV-D remain elusive. Because little is known about how TNF-α and PAF interact in neuronal cultures, we investigated cellular pathways pertinent to TNF-α- and PAF-mediated signal transduction that results in neuronal apoptosis.One key element in this relationship may be the sphingomyelin ceramide, a probable second messenger of TNF-α. Activation of monocytic p55 receptors by TNF-α is thought to result in the sphingomyelinase-mediated production of ceramide (11Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), which has itself been shown to induce apoptosis (12Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the temporal interrelationship of TNF-α, ceramide, and PAF in inducing apopotic neuronal cell death. Knowing that TNF-α induces dose-dependent apoptosis in primary human neuronal cultures and a differentiated human neuronal cell line (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.B. Zhang D. Lipton S.A. Tourtellotte W.W. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4628-4635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W.

Neuroscience. 1994; 15: 417-422Google Scholar), we first investigated whether TNF-α induces time-dependent apoptotic cell death in primary human neuronal cultures. Next, we measured ceramide levels in a human neuronal cell line as affected by varying lengths of TNF-α or PAF exposure. Having established both time-dependent TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity and time-dependent TNF-α-induced neuronal ceramide production, and because PAF receptor antagonism can down-regulate TNF-α-mediated induction of HIV-1 in a monocytic cell line (5Weissman D. Poli G. Bousseau A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2537-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we investigated whether a reciprocal relationship existed between TNF-α, ceramide, and PAF in the brain, i.e. if PAF receptor antagonism or catabolism of PAF would affect TNF-α- and ceramide-mediated toxicity of primary human neuronal cultures. Finally, to assess the relative contribution of PAF to HIV-1-induced neurotoxicity, we used conditioned media from activated HIV-1-infected macrophages, co-incubated with PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), the principle catobolic enzyme for PAF.DISCUSSIONThe results described here imply a novel relationship between the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α and PAF receptor activation that results in neuronal cell death. Neuronal dysfunction and death in HIV-D is thought to be due to the presence of HIV-1 gene products, increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, PAF, and other products of arachidonic acid metabolism (18Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Here we establish a TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity that increases proportionally with length of exposure. Our data further suggest that this TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity occurs via production of the second messenger ceramide and requires activation of PAF receptors, since ceramide levels were elevated in response to TNF-α exposure (Fig. 2), and PAF receptor antagonism abrogated both TNF-α- and ceramide-mediated neurotoxicity to a similar degree (Fig. 3). PAF catabolism also reduced TNF-α-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. 4 A). A comparison of the data in Figs. 1 and 2, showing maximal ceramide levels present before the majority of apoptosis has occurred, lends further support to the theory that TNF-α-induced ceramide production may serve as an initiator of apoptotic neuronal cell death. Furthermore, the findings that overexpression of the anti-apoptosis gene crmAinhibits ceramide formation in response to TNF-α (19Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), and protects cells from the cytotoxic action of TNF-α (8Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W. Dollard S.C. Gummuluru S. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), but not from ceramide-induced cytotoxicity (19Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), provide strong additional support for the role of ceramide as a mediator of TNF-α-induced neuronal apoptosis. Further, if elevated ceramide levels do indeed lead to neurotoxic activation of PAF receptors, our finding that direct PAF receptor activation decreased neuronal ceramide levels prior to cell death (Fig. 2) suggests a potential compensatory neuroprotective mechanism against PAF receptor-mediated cell death.The data presented here also presents the question of whether a glial cell intermediary is involved in TNF-α-mediated neurotoxicity. The answer to this question remains uncertain, but may well be species-dependent, because several important species-specific differences exist in the biological actions of TNF-α in the central nervous system. Several reports have emphasized the neuroprotective role of TNF-α in vitro and in vivo in the murine central nervous system in acute brain injury such as stroke or head trauma that may involve excitotoxicity resulting in necrotic neuronal death (20Bruce A.J.

However, in human primary neurons or neuronal cells, exposure to TNF-α results in apoptosis in most, but not all experimental systems (8Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W. Dollard S.C. Gummuluru S.

Our confirmation here of TNF-α-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro is consonant with findings of TUNEL-stained neuronal nuclei with chromatin condensation adjacent to focal inflammatory infiltrates of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes present in postmortem brain tissue from patients with HIV-D (22Adle-Biassette H.

TNF-α may initiate a sequence of events resulting in neuronal damage and death in a chronic setting of low level inflammation, a concept that is strengthened by the observation that levels of TNF-α mRNA in brain tissue of patients with HIV-D correlate with dementia (6Wesselingh S.L.

Neurol. 1993; 33: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).Additional studies may provide insight into how PAF receptor activation may lead to downstream neuronal death. Previous experiments from this laboratory have established that NMDA receptor channel antagonists including MK 801 and memantine substantially ameliorate PAF-induced neurotoxicity in both human and rat culture systems (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.B. Zhang D. Lipton S.A. Tourtellotte W.W. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4628-4635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown whether PAF can directly activate NMDA receptors with subsequent excitotoxic damage. One study has shown that PAF can increase intracellular Ca2+ in a population of rodent hippocampal neurons with NMDA receptors (25Bito H. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Iwatsubo T. Seyama Y. Ogura A.

It is also possible that during conditions that promote chronic inflammation in the brain, including HIV-1 encephalitis, PAF can activate microglia to release arachidonic acid in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and arachidonic acid, in turn, can down-regulate high affinity glial glutamate uptake (30Volterra A.

Although the mechanisms are different, both TNF-α and PAF disrupt homeostasis for glutamatergic transmission, and thus may ultimately increase ambient glutamate to levels sufficient to cause NMDA receptor-mediated apoptosis in vulnerable neurons (33Bonfoco E.

Finally, we have previously demonstrated that levels of PAF in cerebrospinal fluid correlate well with neurologic dysfunction (i.e. dementia in adults and progressive encephalopathy in children) and immunosuppression (7Gelbard H.A.

In the experiments reported here, we extend these findings to show that PAF acetylhydrolase, the catabolic enzyme for PAF in the central nervous system, can almost completely prevent the neurotoxicity induced by exposure to neurotoxins from activated HIV-1-infected macrophages. This suggests that PAF may be the principle initiator of neuronal dysfunction and death in the clinical setting of HIV-D, and further, that PAF-AH, or PAF receptor antagonists, may ameliorate or prevent the neuronal damage associated with HIV-D. There is a consensus that the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; HIV-D, HIV-1-associated dementia; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PAF, platelet-activating factor; AH, acetylhydrolase; NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate. 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; HIV-D, HIV-1-associated dementia; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PAF, platelet-activating factor; AH, acetylhydrolase; NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate.-associated dementia (HIV-D) is initiated by productively infected and antigenically activated brain-resident macrophages and microglia. However, there is not a good correlation between viral burden in the central nervous system and neurologic disease, which is presumably secondary to neuronal dysfunction and death. Recently, the extent of neurologic dysfunction (i.e. dementia) has been correlated with the total number of macrophages and activated microglia in the brain parenchyma, rather than the number of HIV-1-infected macrophages and microglia (1Glassa J.D. Fedor H. Wesselingh S.L. McArthur J.C. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Because direct infection of neurons with HIV-1 is unlikely, these findings suggest that neuronal dysfunction and death are mediated by soluble factors released by macrophages and microglia. We and others have demonstrated that HIV-1-infected monocytes, when activated by antigenic stimuli in vitro or contact with neural cells in vivo, release high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) (2Genis P. Jett M. Bernton E.W. Boyle T. Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K. Keane R.W. Resnick L. Mizrachi Y. Volsky D.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1703-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 3Nottet H.S. Jett M.

TNF-α markedly up-regulates HIV-1 production in HIV-1-infected macrophages (4Locardi C. Petrini C. Boccoli G. Testa U. Dieffenbach C. Butto S. Belardelli F.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5874-5882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAF, in turn, appears to up-regulate TNF-α synthesis in HIV-1-infected cells of monocytic lineage (5Weissman D. Poli G. Bousseau A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2537-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, the number of macrophages expressing mRNA for TNF-α is elevated in the brains of patients with HIV-D, compared with patients with HIV-1 infection but without dementia (6Wesselingh S.L.

PAF is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV-1-associated dementia and immunosuppression (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.B.

We have previously demonstrated in both primary human neuronal cultures and in a differentiated human neuronal cell line that TNF-α and PAF induce dose-dependent apoptosis (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S.

Taken together, these studies suggest that reciprocal relationships between TNF-α and PAF exist, and that TNF-α and PAF play a major role in the pathogenesis of HIV-D. Nevertheless, the mechanisms for TNF-α- and PAF-mediated neuronal apoptosis in HIV-D remain elusive. Because little is known about how TNF-α and PAF interact in neuronal cultures, we investigated cellular pathways pertinent to TNF-α- and PAF-mediated signal transduction that results in neuronal apoptosis. One key element in this relationship may be the sphingomyelin ceramide, a probable second messenger of TNF-α. Activation of monocytic p55 receptors by TNF-α is thought to result in the sphingomyelinase-mediated production of ceramide (11Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), which has itself been shown to induce apoptosis (12Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the temporal interrelationship of TNF-α, ceramide, and PAF in inducing apopotic neuronal cell death. Knowing that TNF-α induces dose-dependent apoptosis in primary human neuronal cultures and a differentiated human neuronal cell line (7Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.B. Zhang D. Lipton S.A. Tourtellotte W.W. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4628-4635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W.

Neuroscience. 1994; 15: 417-422Google Scholar), we first investigated whether TNF-α induces time-dependent apoptotic cell death in primary human neuronal cultures. Next, we measured ceramide levels in a human neuronal cell line as affected by varying lengths of TNF-α or PAF exposure. Having established both time-dependent TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity and time-dependent TNF-α-induced neuronal ceramide production, and because PAF receptor antagonism can down-regulate TNF-α-mediated induction of HIV-1 in a monocytic cell line (5Weissman D. Poli G. Bousseau A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2537-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we investigated whether a reciprocal relationship existed between TNF-α, ceramide, and PAF in the brain, i.e. if PAF receptor antagonism or catabolism of PAF would affect TNF-α- and ceramide-mediated toxicity of primary human neuronal cultures. Finally, to assess the relative contribution of PAF to HIV-1-induced neurotoxicity, we used conditioned media from activated HIV-1-infected macrophages, co-incubated with PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), the principle catobolic enzyme for PAF. DISCUSSIONThe results described here imply a novel relationship between the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α and PAF receptor activation that results in neuronal cell death. Neuronal dysfunction and death in HIV-D is thought to be due to the presence of HIV-1 gene products, increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, PAF, and other products of arachidonic acid metabolism (18Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Here we establish a TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity that increases proportionally with length of exposure. Our data further suggest that this TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity occurs via production of the second messenger ceramide and requires activation of PAF receptors, since ceramide levels were elevated in response to TNF-α exposure (Fig. 2), and PAF receptor antagonism abrogated both TNF-α- and ceramide-mediated neurotoxicity to a similar degree (Fig. 3). PAF catabolism also reduced TNF-α-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. 4 A). A comparison of the data in Figs. 1 and 2, showing maximal ceramide levels present before the majority of apoptosis has occurred, lends further support to the theory that TNF-α-induced ceramide production may serve as an initiator of apoptotic neuronal cell death. Furthermore, the findings that overexpression of the anti-apoptosis gene crmAinhibits ceramide formation in response to TNF-α (19Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), and protects cells from the cytotoxic action of TNF-α (8Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W. Dollard S.C. Gummuluru S. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), but not from ceramide-induced cytotoxicity (19Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), provide strong additional support for the role of ceramide as a mediator of TNF-α-induced neuronal apoptosis. Further, if elevated ceramide levels do indeed lead to neurotoxic activation of PAF receptors, our finding that direct PAF receptor activation decreased neuronal ceramide levels prior to cell death (Fig. 2) suggests a potential compensatory neuroprotective mechanism against PAF receptor-mediated cell death.The data presented here also presents the question of whether a glial cell intermediary is involved in TNF-α-mediated neurotoxicity. The answer to this question remains uncertain, but may well be species-dependent, because several important species-specific differences exist in the biological actions of TNF-α in the central nervous system. Several reports have emphasized the neuroprotective role of TNF-α in vitro and in vivo in the murine central nervous system in acute brain injury such as stroke or head trauma that may involve excitotoxicity resulting in necrotic neuronal death (20Bruce A.J.

However, in human primary neurons or neuronal cells, exposure to TNF-α results in apoptosis in most, but not all experimental systems (8Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W. Dollard S.C. Gummuluru S.

It is also possible that during conditions that promote chronic inflammation in the brain, including HIV-1 encephalitis, PAF can activate microglia to release arachidonic acid in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and arachidonic acid, in turn, can down-regulate high affinity glial glutamate uptake (30Volterra A.

Although the mechanisms are different, both TNF-α and PAF disrupt homeostasis for glutamatergic transmission, and thus may ultimately increase ambient glutamate to levels sufficient to cause NMDA receptor-mediated apoptosis in vulnerable neurons (33Bonfoco E.

Finally, we have previously demonstrated that levels of PAF in cerebrospinal fluid correlate well with neurologic dysfunction (i.e. dementia in adults and progressive encephalopathy in children) and immunosuppression (7Gelbard H.A.

Virol. 1994; 68: 4628-4635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we extend these findings to show that PAF acetylhydrolase, the catabolic enzyme for PAF in the central nervous system, can almost completely prevent the neurotoxicity induced by exposure to neurotoxins from activated HIV-1-infected macrophages. This suggests that PAF may be the principle initiator of neuronal dysfunction and death in the clinical setting of HIV-D, and further, that PAF-AH, or PAF receptor antagonists, may ameliorate or prevent the neuronal damage associated with HIV-D."
https://openalex.org/W2056467352,"The C2 domains of conventional protein kinase C (PKC) have been implicated in their Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. The C2 domain of PKC-α contains several Ca2+ ligands that bind multiple Ca2+ ions and other putative membrane binding residues. To understand the roles of individual Ca2+ligands and protein-bound Ca2+ ions in the membrane binding and activation of PKC-α, we mutated five putative Ca2+ligands (D187N, D193N, D246N, D248N, and D254N) and measured the effects of mutations on vesicle binding, enzyme activity, and monolayer penetration of PKC-α. Altered properties of these mutants indicate that individual Ca2+ ions and their ligands have different roles in the membrane binding and activation of PKC-α. The binding of Ca2+ to Asp187, Asp193, and Asp246 of PKC-α is important for the initial binding of protein to membrane surfaces. On the other hand, the binding of another Ca2+ to Asp187, Asp246, Asp248, and Asp254 induces the conformational change of PKC-α, which in turn triggers its membrane penetration and activation. Among these Ca2+ ligands, Asp246was shown to be most essential for both membrane binding and activation of PKC-α, presumably due to its coordination to multiple Ca2+ ions. Furthermore, to identify the residues in the C2 domain that are involved in membrane binding of PKC-α, we mutated four putative membrane binding residues (Trp245, Trp247, Arg249, and Arg252). Membrane binding and enzymatic properties of two double-site mutants (W245A/W247A and R249A/R252A) indicate that Arg249 and Arg252 are involved in electrostatic interactions of PKC-α with anionic membranes, whereas Trp245 and Trp247 participate in its penetration into membranes and resulting hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, these studies provide the first experimental evidence for the role of C2 domain of conventional PKC as a membrane docking unit as well as a module that triggers conformational changes to activate the protein.

More than 10 members of the PKC family have been identified by molecular cloning. Based on common structural features, PKCs are generally classified into three groups; conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKC (δ, ε, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKC (ζ and ι subtypes). Conventional PKCs are activated by the Ca2+-dependent translocation to the membrane containing phosphatidyl serine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DG). It has been proposed that the C2 domain of conventional PKCs is involved in this Ca2+-dependent membrane binding activity (4Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). On the other hand, novel PKCs and atypical PKCs that have either a modified or no C2 domain can be activated in a Ca2+-independent way (5Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Cell. 1988; 53: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Konno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to PKC, the C2 domain has been found in a wide variety of proteins that are involved in diverse cellular functions (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of C2 domains of these proteins suggests that all known C2 domains exhibit either type I or type II topology, differing slightly in their β-strand connectivity (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The C2 domains of conventional PKCs and synaptotagmins have type I topology and show significant sequence homology (see Fig. 1 A). High resolution crystal structures have been determined for the isolated C2 domains of synaptotagmin, phospholipase C-δ1, and cytosolic phospholipase A2(8Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M.

J Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Despite noticeable variations in primary structures, all of these proteins have highly homologous tertiary structural folds consisting of eight antiparallel β-strands and connecting loops (Fig. 1 B). These structures of C2 domains have defined much of Ca2+ ligands in the Ca2+ binding sites, which consist of three Ca2+ binding loops dubbed calcium binding region 1 (CBR1), CBR2, and CBR3. Multiple Ca2+ ions have been located within these sites, and the binding of these Ca2+ ions shows positive cooperativity (11Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A recent NMR study assigned two Ca2+ ions (CA1 and CA2) bound to the C2 domain of a conventional PKC, PKC-β (12Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A putative coordination pattern of the two Ca2+ ions, based on this study and the tertiary structure of homologous synaptotagmin C2A domain, is illustrated in Fig. 1 C. At present, the roles of individual Ca2+ ligands and Ca2+ ions bound to these ligands in the membrane binding and activation of conventional PKC are not fully understood. Furthermore, other residues in the C2 domain that are involved in membrane binding of conventional PKC have not been identified. To address these questions, we mutated several residues in the C2 domains of PKC-α, including five putative Ca2+ligands and four putative membrane binding residues. Membrane binding affinity, enzyme activity, and membrane penetrating power of these mutants demonstrate that individual Ca2+ ions and their ligands have distinct roles in the membrane binding and activation of PKC-α. These studies also identify the C2 domain residues of PKC-α that are involved in its electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with membranes. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and 1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Hereinafter, DG refers to 1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol. Tritiated POPC ([3H]POPC) was prepared from 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and [9,10-3H]oleic acid using rat liver microsomes as described (13Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (15Kates M. Techniques of Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 113-115Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/μmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and cold ATP was from Sigma. Triton X-100 was obtained from Pierce. Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from either Boehringer Mannheim or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).45CaCl2 (5.91 Ci/g) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Baculovirus transfer vectors encoding the cDNA of PKC-α with appropriate C2 domain mutations were generated by the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar) using pVL1392-PKC-α plasmid (17Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as a template. Briefly, appropriate complementary synthetic oligonucleotides introducing the desired mutation and two other primers at the beginning of the PKC-α gene and around the NcoI site inside the PKC-α gene were used as primers for polymerase chain reactions, which were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The method consisted of two steps. In the first step, two DNA fragments overlapping at the mutation site were generated and purified on an agarose gel. Then, these two fragments were combined to generate the fusion product, which was further amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The product was subsequently purified on an agarose gel, digested with NcoI, and ligated to the pVL1392-PKC-α construct, which was digested with NcoI, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase to prevent self-ligation, and purified on an agarose gel. The mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing of the PKC-α gene using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type PKC-α and mutants were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). Transfection of Sf9 cells with mutant pVL1392-PKC-α constructs was performed using the BaculoGoldTM Transfection Kit from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Prior to transfection, endotoxins were removed from plasmid DNA using LPS extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were incubated for 4 days at 27 °C, and the supernatant was collected and used to infect more cells for the amplification of virus. After three cycles of amplification, high-titer virus stock solution was obtained. Sf9 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in TMN-FH medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For protein expression, cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 500-ml suspension cultures and infected with the multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were then incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. For harvesting, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed once with Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 25 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was homogenized in a hand-held homogenizer chilled on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 50,000 g and 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 100-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with 100 ml of Buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the column was eluted with 200 ml of a linear salt gradient to 0.5 m KCl in Buffer A. Active PKC fractions were pooled, adjusted to 2 m KCl, and loaded onto a 10 ml Poros PE column (Boehringer Mannheim) with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. A linear salt gradient from 2 to 0 m KCl in Buffer A (total volume, 60 ml) was applied. Active PKC fractions were concentrated and desalted in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and stored in Buffer A containing 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Activity of PKC was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm, 0.6 μCi/tube) into the histone III-SS (400 μg/ml) (Sigma). The reaction mixture contained large unilamellar vesicles (0.2 mm), 5 mm MgCl2, 12 nm PKC, and various concentrations of CaCl2 (see under “Results”) in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Protamine sulfate (200 μg/ml) was used as a substrate when the free enzyme concentration was determined by PKC activity assay in vesicle binding measurements (see below). Free calcium concentration was adjusted using a mixture of EGTA and CaCl2 according to the method of Bers (18Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding MgCl2 to the mixture and quenched by adding 50 μl of 1% aqueous phosphoric acid solution after a given period of incubation (e.g. 5 min for histone) at room temperature. Seventy-five-μl aliquots of quenched reaction mixtures were spotted on P-81 ion-exchange papers (Whatman), washed four times with 1% aqueous phosphoric acid solution, and washed once with 95% aqueous ethanol. Papers were transferred into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Sigma), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The linearity of the time dependence of the reaction was checked by monitoring the degree of phosphorylation at regular intervals. The binding of PKC to phospholipid vesicles was measured by a centrifugation assay using sucrose-loaded large unilamellar vesicles (100 nm in diameter) (19Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Sucrose-loaded vesicles were prepared as described elsewhere (20Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipid solution was added to a round-bottomed flask, and organic solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The lipid film was suspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2m sucrose and vortexed vigorously. Unilamellar vesicles were prepared by multiple extrusion through a 0.1 μm polycarbonate filter (Millipore) in a Liposofast microextruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The vesicle solution was diluted 5 times with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m KCl and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the lipid pellet was resuspended in the same buffer solution. The final concentration of vesicle solution was determined by measuring the radioactivity of a trace of [3H]POPC (typically 0.1 mol %) included in all phospholipid mixtures. For binding experiments, PKC (approximately 12 nm) was incubated for 15 min with sucrose-loaded vesicles (0.1 mm), 1 μm bovine serum albumin, and Ca2+ (or EGTA; see under “Results”) in 150 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm KCl. Bovine serum albumin was added to minimize the loss of protein due to nonspecific adsorption to tube walls. Vesicles were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min using a Sorvall RC-M120EX microultracentrifuge. Aliquots of supernatants were used for protein determination by PKC activity assay using protamine sulfate as a substrate. The fraction of bound enzyme was plotted against mol percentage of anionic lipid in vesicles or against free Ca2+ concentration. Surface pressure (π) of solution in a circular Teflon trough was measured using a du Nouy ring attached to a computer-controlled Cahn electrobalance (Model C-32) as described previously (17Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Shen Z. Wu S.-K. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11598-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Mukhopadhyay S. Cho W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The trough (4 cm in diameter × 1 cm deep) has a 0.5-cm-deep well for magnetic stir bar and a small hole drilled at an angle through the wall to allow an addition of protein solution. Five to 10 microliters of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) or chloroform was spread onto 10 ml of subphase (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 containing either 0.1 or 0.5 mm of free Ca2+) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (πo). The subphase was continuously stirred at 60 rpm with a magnetic stir bar. Once the surface pressure reading of monolayer had been stabilized (after approximately 5 min), the protein solution (typically 50 μl) was injected to the subphase, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time at 23 °C. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration at the low concentration range and reached a saturation when the protein concentration was higher than 1 μg/ml. Protein concentrations were therefore maintained above 1.5 μg/ml to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The critical surface pressure (πc) was determined by extrapolating the Δπ versus πo plot to thex axis. Equilibrium dialysis was carried out at room temperature using a MEGATM System microdialyzer (Pierce) with separated sample chambers. Dialysis membranes with 3500 molecular weight cut-off were used. Prior to calcium binding measurements, protein solutions were concentrated in Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter units (Millipore) and repeatedly washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 to remove EGTA and EDTA present in the storage buffer. Twenty-five microliters of PKC-α and selected mutant solutions (final concentration, 10–15 μm) in individual sample chambers were dialyzed against 30 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm45CaCl2 (specific activity of 7 μCi/ml). Controls contained 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, instead of a protein solution. After equilibration for 19 h, free and total Ca2+ concentrations were determined by counting the radioactivity of 5-μl aliquots from control and protein chambers, respectively, from which the radioactivity of bound Ca2+was calculated. According to the model structure of the C2 domain of PKC-α shown in Fig. 1 C, five Ca2+-binding aspartyl residues can be classified into three groups; CBR1 ligands, which primarily coordinate CA1 (Asp187 and Asp193), CBR2 ligands, which mainly coordinate CA2 (Asp248 and Asp254), and Asp246, which coordinates both Ca2+ ions. In addition to Asp246, Asp187 and Asp248 could also be involved in partial coordination to the other Ca2+. Based on this assignment, the mutations of Asp193 and Asp254 would only affect the binding of CA1 and CA2, respectively, whereas the mutations of Asp246 (and possibly Asp187 and Asp248) would have effects on the binding of both Ca2+ ions. Thus, it is possible to systematically analyze the roles of the two Ca2+ ions in the membrane binding and activation of PKC-α by selectively mutating their ligands and separately measuring the effects of mutations on membrane binding and activation. From crystal structures of C2 domains of phospholipase C-δ1 and cytosolic phospholipase A2, it has been proposed that CBR1 and CBR3 are involved in binding to membranes (10Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Grobler J.A. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar): more specifically, CBR3 in membrane penetration and CBR1 in interfacial contact with the lipid head group. There are two relatively conserved tryptophans (Trp245 and Trp247) in the CBR3 of PKC-α: they are absolutely conserved among conventional PKCs and substituted for by either aromatic or hydrophobic residues in other proteins (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Given the importance of tryptophans in membrane-protein interactions (24Lee B.-I. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4231-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Hu W. Lee K.-C. Cross T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Jacobs R.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3421-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the two tryptophans might be involved in penetration into membranes. Also present in CBR3 are two surface-exposed arginines that are relatively conserved among topology I C2 domains (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and might be involved in electrostatic interactions between PKC-α and anionic phospholipids, such as PS. To assess the roles of these residues, we generated two double-site mutants, W245A/W247A and R249A/R252A. Unlike CBR3, CBR1 of PKC-α contains neither conserved hydrophobic nor ionic residues. Because all nine mutated residues are located in loop regions, the above mutations were not expected to cause deleterious conformational changes. Indeed, all seven mutants were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as well as wild type, indicating comparable thermodynamic stability and a lack of gross conformational changes. Furthermore, all mutants exhibited full membrane binding affinity and enzyme activity at saturating Ca2+, PS, and DG concentrations (see below), again demonstrating that the mutations did not significantly disrupt its tertiary structural fold. To systematically analyze the effects of mutations on the Ca2+-dependent membrane binding and activation of PKC-α, we measured the following five properties: Ca2+dependence of vesicle binding, PS content dependence of vesicle binding, Ca2+ dependence of enzyme activity, PS content dependence of enzyme activity, and monolayer penetration. We previously showed (17Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that PKC-α displayed full vesicle binding affinity if the POPS content was > 20 mol % in POPC/POPS vesicles containing 2.5 mol % DG under the conditions employed in these studies (see also Fig. 3). We therefore used POPC/POPS/DG (67.5:30:2.5) vesicles to measure the Ca2+ dependence of vesicle binding for wild type and mutants. The binding of Ca2+ ions to the isolated C2 domain was shown to be consistent with the cooperative Hill model (11Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The concentration of Ca2+ giving rise to half-maximal binding (or activity) ([Ca2+]½) was thus determined from curve fitting of data to a Hill equation, y=aCa2+hCa2+1/2h+Ca2+hEquation 1 where y, a, h, and [Ca2+] are relative binding (or activity), arbitrary normalization constant, Hill coefficient, and free Ca2+ concentration, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutants exhibited a wide range of Ca2+ dependences, and [Ca2+]½ values varied from 2 μmto >1 mm (Table I). A closer examination of the Ca2+ dependences, however, revealed a systematic pattern. Mutations of CBR1 ligands coordinating to CA1 (D187N and D193N) had more significant effects on the vesicle binding than mutations of CBR3 ligands coordinating to CA2 (D248N and D254N). This suggested that although both Ca2+ ions are involved in the Ca2+-dependent vesicle binding of PKC-α CA1 might play a more important role than CA2. Among all Ca2+ ligands, Asp246 appeared to be the most important in the vesicle binding because the D246N mutation showed a much more drastic effect on vesicle binding than any other mutation. This might be due either to close proximity of Asp246 to CA1 or to its coordination to both Ca2+ ions. On the other hand, similar Ca2+ dependences of D248N and D254N suggested that potential coordination of Asp248 to CA1 is not significant. Finally, changes in Hill coefficient (1.2–1.5) for mutants were not large enough to have any physical meaning (data not shown). We then measured the dependence of vesicle binding of wild type and mutants on the PS content of POPC/POPS vesicles containing 1 mol % of DG in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+. This condition was selected to best illustrate the PS dependence because at higher Ca2+ concentrations all PS dependences fell into too narrow a range to compare (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the mutants exhibited a wide range of PS dependences, but the pattern was similar to Ca2+dependences shown in Fig. 2. Because the origin of sigmoidal dependence on PS is not fully understood, the plots were graphically analyzed to determine the PS content resulting in half-maximal binding ([PS]½). As summarized in Table I, [PS]½ values for mutants were in the order of D246N ≫ D187N ≈ D193N > D248N ≈ D254N. Because the membrane binding of PKC-α takes place through the formation of a protein-calcium-lipid complex (note that this does not necessarily implicate the calcium bridge formation), the lower the Ca2+ affinity of a mutant in the presence of vesicles is, the higher PS would be required for vesicle binding. Thus, the PS dependences of vesicle binding further support the notion that Asp246 and CBR1 ligands (and CA1) are essential for the membrane binding of PKC-α.Figure 2Ca2+ dependence of vesicle binding of PKC-α and Ca2+ ligand mutants.

We term this protein human β-filamin. The gene for β-filamin localizes to chromosome 3p14.3-p21.1. β-Filamin mRNA expression was observed in many tissues and in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs); only minimal expression was detected in platelets and the megakaryocytic cell line CHRF-288. Like ABP-280, β-filamin contains an NH2-terminal actin-binding domain, a backbone of 24 tandem repeats, and two “hinge” regions. A polyclonal antibody to the unique β-filamin first hinge sequence identifies a strong 280-kDa band in HUVECs but only a weak band in platelets, and stains normal human endothelial cells in culture andin situ. We have confirmed the interaction of β-filamin and GpIbα in platelet and HUVEC lysates. In addition, using two-hybrid analysis with deletion mutants, we have localized the binding domain for GpIbα in β-filamin to residues 1862–2148, an area homologous to the GpIbα binding domain in ABP-280. β-Filamin is a new member of the filamin family that may have significance for GpIbα function in endothelial cells and platelets.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All four polypeptides of the GpIb complex are also present in human endothelial cells (2Wu G. Essex D.W. Meloni F.J. Takafuta T. Fujimura K. Konkle B.A. Shapiro S.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet GpIb complex mediates the adherence of platelets at the site of vascular injury through the binding of GpIbα to subendothelial von Willebrand factor (vWF).In platelets, the GpIb complex is tightly bound to the actin cytoskeleton via an interaction of GpIbα with actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280) (3Andrews R.K.

ABP-280 cDNA has been cloned from a HUVEC cDNA library (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and mapped to the X chromosome (7Gorlin J.B. Henske E. Warren S.T. Kunst C.B. D'Urso M. Palmieri G. Hartwig J.H. Bruns G.

ABP-280 has sometimes been referred to as human non-muscle filamin.Partial sequence of two other ABP-280-related entities from human sources has been reported. Two partial cDNA fragments of one species, termed actin-binding protein-like protein (ABPL), were cloned by PCR and mapped to chromosome 7; full-length cDNA has not been reported. A second species, termed truncated actin-binding protein (TABP) in one publication (9Leedman P.J. Faulkner J.B. Cram D.S. Harrison P.J. West J. O'Brien E. Simpson R. Coppel R.L. Harrison L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5994-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and filamin homolog-1 in another (10Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been reported. The TABP open reading frame predicts a protein of only 195 residues, whereas only a 291-amino acid sequence has been reported for filamin homolog-1. However, both sequences are homologous to the COOH-terminal region of ABP-280.Here, we report the molecular cloning and full sequence of a new human homolog of chicken filamin, which, like ABP-280, associates with the cytoplasmic tail of GpIbα. It is present in only small amounts in platelets, but in substantial quantities in ECs. We term this new protein human β-filamin, reserving the term α-filamin for ABP-280.DISCUSSIONThe term “filamin” was introduced by Singer's laboratory (17Wang K. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4483-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) to describe a 250-kDa protein isolated from chicken gizzard, normally present as a dimer (18Wang K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), that is capable of inducing actin polymerization (19Wang K. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Filamins have been isolated from a number of organs and cell types from chicken, human and other species (20Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5696-5705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Boxer L.A. Stossel T.P. J. Clin.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but most biochemical studies have been performed using filamins isolated from chicken gizzard, rabbit macrophage or human uterus. In 1990, Gorlin et al. (3Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7144-7147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the sequence of a human endothelial cell cDNA specifying a protein which they termed actin-binding protein 280, or ABP-280. This protein is probably identical to the actin-binding protein purified from human uterus, based on limited amino acid sequence (25Hock R.S. Davis G. Speicher D.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9441-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and on cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and which exists as a 560-kDa dimer (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Because of its 280-kDa size, its ability to dimerize, and its ability to induce actin polymerization, ABP-280 has often been referred to as human non-muscle filamin, although it is present in smooth (uterine) muscle (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 25Hock R.S. Davis G. Speicher D.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9441-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and in skeletal muscle (Ref. 8Maestrini E. Patrosso C. Mancini M. Rivella S. Rocchi M. Repetto M. Villa A. Frattini A. Zoppe M. Vezzoni P. Toniolo D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, this paper, Fig. 5). ABP-280 contains a 274-residue amino-terminal actin-binding domain, followed by 24 internally homologous repeats among which are intercalated two hinge regions, one of 32 residues between repeats 15–16 and one of 34 residues between repeats 23–24 (these figures are based on our sequence alignment of ABP-280, β-filamin, and CRF). Gorlin et al. (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) localized the site of dimerization of ABP-280 to repeat 24. Electron microscopic studies of human uterine actin-binding protein by these investigators suggested that the first hinge region might allow the ABP-280 dimer to form a “Y,” with the COOH-terminal halves of the protein forming a rigid dimeric structure and the NH2-terminal halves, containing the actin-binding domains, forming the separated ends of the Y. The two hinge regions were found to be sites of calpain cleavage, resulting in the formation of 185-, 90-, and 10-kDa fragments (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 26Ezzell R.M. Kenney D.M. Egan S. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13303-13309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In 1993, Barry and co-workers (15Barry C.P. Xie J. Lemmon V. Young A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25577-25586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cloned and sequenced chicken retinal filamin and found it to be highly homologous to ABP-280, with the major exception that the CRF sequence lacked the more NH2-terminal of the two hinge regions present in ABP-280 (15Barry C.P. Xie J. Lemmon V. Young A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25577-25586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If one assumes that CRF and chicken gizzard filamin are identical and that human ABP-280 and rabbit actin-binding protein are also identical, this difference in structure may account for the observations that 1) chicken gizzard filamin produces parallel actin bundles (27Davies P.J. Wallach D. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Yamaguchi M. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4036-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas human ABP-280 induces the formation of branched actin polymers (28Hartwig J.H. Tyler J. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and that 2) chicken gizzard filamin is cleaved by calpain into only two fragments: 240 and 10 kDa (27Davies P.J. Wallach D. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Yamaguchi M. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4036-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Other reports suggest the existence in a single species of more than one filamin. For example, Gomer and Lazarides (29Gomer R.H. Lazarides E. Cell. 1981; 23: 524-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Gomer R.H. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) described an apparent switch in filamin types during chick skeletal muscle development, and Mangeat and Burridge (31Mangeat P.H. Burridge K. Cell Motil. 1983; 3: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) described the presence of two filamin types in HeLa cells. In addition, two other proteins showing homology with CRF and ABP-280 have been isolated from chicken gizzard, the 450-kDa “fulcin” (32Terasaki A.G. Nakagawa H. Kotani E. Mori H. Ohashi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; : 857-868PubMed Google Scholar), and the 260-kDa “ABP-260” (33Tachikawa M. Nakagawa H. Terasaki A.G. Mori H. Ohashi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Partial cDNA sequence is available for each, although in neither case is sequence available for the areas corresponding to the hinge regions.In this paper, we describe a new 280-kDa protein, β-filamin, highly homologous to ABP-280 and CRF. β-Filamin contains the same NH2-terminal actin-binding signatures present in the other two proteins as well as in α-actinin (34Millake D.B. Blanchard A.D. Patel B. Critchley D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), β-spectrin (35Hu R.J. Watanabe M. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18715-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dystrophin (36Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Following the actin-binding domain, β-filamin shares with ABP-280 and CRF a structure (not present in α-actinin, β-spectrin, and dystrophin) consisting of 24 internally homologous repeats (Figs. 2 and 3). However, β-filamin differs from the other two sequenced filamins in the region of the first of the two hinges; its first hinge sequence is totally distinct from that of ABP-280 (Fig. 4), whereas the reported CRF sequence lacks a first hinge completely. β-Filamin does not contain in its first hinge the calpain cleavage sequence PQY↓TYA present in the first hinge of ABP-280 (6Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and is only 44% identical in the second hinge region, suggesting that the two proteins may have different calpain cleavage patterns, a possibility currently under investigation in our laboratory.Three other human sequences have been reported that are closely related to ABP-280 and β-filamin.1) In 1993, Leedman et al. (9Leedman P.J. Faulkner J.B. Cram D.S. Harrison P.J. West J. O'Brien E. Simpson R. Coppel R.L. Harrison L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5994-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using immunoglobulins from Graves' disease patients, reported the cloning from a human thyroid library of a cDNA specifying a 195-amino acid protein homologous to the COOH terminus of ABP-280. This predicted protein has been termed TABP or thyroid autoantigen. It was suggested that TABP may function in concert with ABP in the thyroid to link integral membrane glycoproteins, such as the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, to cytoskeletal actin and thus play a role in signal transduction. However, TABP protein has not been identified in thyroid tissue, and further characterization of TABP has not been done. TABP and β-filamin are probably transcribed from the same gene, because the sequence of TABP and of the corresponding region of β-filamin are almost identical, and the genetic locus of TABP has been identified as chromosome 3 (UniGene accession number Hs. 81008).2) Very recently, Zhang and co-workers (10Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the cytoplasmic loop region of presenilin-1 as bait in a two-hybrid screen, isolated cDNA fragments encoding the 358 COOH-terminal amino acids of ABP-280, as well as an unknown 291-amino acid sequence showing 69% identity with ABP-280, which they termed “filamin homolog 1” (Fh1). They mapped the Fh1 gene to chromosome 3. The sequence they reported is identical to the COOH-terminal 291 amino acids of β-filamin except for two residues (L2312M and G2382E, using the β-filamin residue numbers), making it very likely that it represents the COOH-terminal region (most of repeat 22, repeat 23, the second hinge, and repeat 24) of β-filamin.3) Maestrini et al. (8Maestrini E. Patrosso C. Mancini M. Rivella S. Rocchi M. Repetto M. Villa A. Frattini A. Zoppe M. Vezzoni P. Toniolo D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported two partial cDNA sequences, mapping to chromosome 7, that are homologous to repeats 4–6 and 15–19 of ABP-280. The second of these cDNAs contains the region around the first hinge but lacks any first hinge sequence (Fig. 4). By Northern blotting, an mRNA similar in size to ABP-280 was identified exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscle. We have confirmed by RT-PCR the existence of such a species and its limited tissue distribution. 3T. Takafuta and S. S. Shapiro, unpublished data. We are currently attempting to isolate and sequence a larger region of this protein, particularly the area that spans the second hinge region, to establish the relationship between this entity and the other filamins.Filamin-type proteins are not limited to vertebrates. A closely related actin-binding protein has been identified in Dictyostelium discoideum (37Noegel A.A. Rapp S. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This 120-kDa protein, referred to as ABP-120, consists of an NH2-terminal actin-binding domain followed by six filamin-like 100 residue repeats, but lacks any hinge regions, and exists as a 240-kDa homodimer (37Noegel A.A. Rapp S. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of repeat 4 has been determined by NMR spectroscopy and consists of seven β-sheets arranged in an immunoglobulin-like fold (38Fucini P. Renner C. Herberhold C. Noegel A.A. Holak T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This is the only reported structural analysis of a filamin repeat. ABP-120 appears to modulate pseudopod extension in D. discoideum(39Cox D. Ridsdale J.A. Condeelis J. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).These studies and the present report define a group of filamin-related proteins, which we suggest be termed the filamin superfamily, on the basis of homology with chicken filamin. Within this superfamily, we suggest naming well characterized members by species and by order of discovery and full characterization. Thus, ABP-280 would be termed human α-filamin and our protein would be called human β-filamin. The term “human γ-filamin” should probably be reserved for the chromosome 7 product.The filamins appear to function as promoters of actin polymerization and to connect cell membrane constituents to the actin cytoskeleton. The former function has been demonstrated for filamins from several species (40Weihing R.R. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The latter function has been implied by several immunohistochemical localization studies in chickens (29Gomer R.H. Lazarides E. Cell. 1981; 23: 524-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Terasaki A.G. Nakagawa H. Kotani E. Mori H. Ohashi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; : 857-868PubMed Google Scholar) but investigated in detail only for human ABP-280 (α-filamin). The first membrane protein shown to interact with ABP-280 (α-filamin) was GpIbα (3Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7144-7147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ezzell R.M. Kenney D.M. Egan S. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol.

The interaction appears to involve residues 536–568 of the 96-residue cytoplasmic tail of GpIbα (4Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and an area within residues 1850–2136 (from the end of repeat 16 to the beginning of repeat 20) of ABP-280 (α-filamin) (16Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2914-2919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The interaction of β-filamin with the cytoplasmic tail of GpIbα involves an area within residues 1862–2148 (from the middle of repeat 17 to the middle of repeat 20). Therefore, on the basis of the homology between these two filamins, it is likely that the GpIbα binding sequence is somewhere between the middle of repeat 17 and the beginning of repeat 20.In addition to its interaction with GpIbα, ABP-280 (α-filamin) has been shown to associate with other membrane proteins, including the high affinity IgG receptor FcγRI (42Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 275-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the β2-integrin CD18 subunit (43Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar), presenilin 1 (10Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tissue factor (44Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and the calcium-dependent serine endoprotease furin (45Liu G. Thomas L. Warren R.A. Enns C.A. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as well as with the cytoplasmic protein SEK-1 (46Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J. Stossel T.P. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2620-2628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the binding sites for FcγRI and β2-integrin are not known, the regions of ABP-280 (α-filamin) binding to SEK-1 and furin are contained within residues 2282–2454 (repeats 21–23) and residues 1490–1607 (repeats 13–14), respectively. Furthermore, our data and the data of Zhanget al. (10Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identify repeats 17–20 and 22–24 of β-filamin as distinct binding regions for the cytoplasmic tails of GpIbα and presenilin-1, respectively. Thus, despite their strong internal homology, sufficient unique information resides in different repeats to create specific binding sites for a number of proteins. We are currently investigating the interactions of β-filamin with other cellular constituents.The functions of the filamins are not fully known, but ABP-280 has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in cellular cytoskeletal and membrane organization (47Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and may also be critical for membrane expression of some receptors (48Meyer S.C. Sannan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have published evidence that ECs synthesize and express on their membranes all four components of the GpIb/IX/V complex, although the membrane density of these components in ECs is substantially lower than in platelets (2Wu G. Essex D.W. Meloni F.J. Takafuta T. Fujimura K. Konkle B.A. Shapiro S.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Filamin is expressed in only trace amounts in platelets, and we observed only small amounts of GpIbα bound to β-filamin, consistent with the observations of Ezzell et al. that as much as 90% of platelet GpIbα is bound to ABP-280 (α-filamin) (26Ezzell R.M. Kenney D.M. Egan S. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13303-13309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, substantial amounts of both β-filamin and ABP-280 (α-filamin) are present in ECs, and in ECs we detected relatively large amounts of β-filamin bound to GpIbα. The homology between β-filamin and ABP-280, as well as our findings and those of Zhang et al.(10Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that these two proteins share a number of functions. On the other hand, the differences in structure, particularly in the hinge regions, suggest that β-filamin may have unique effects on membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, an area under active investigation in our laboratory.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All four polypeptides of the GpIb complex are also present in human endothelial cells (2Wu G. Essex D.W. Meloni F.J. Takafuta T. Fujimura K. Konkle B.A. Shapiro S.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet GpIb complex mediates the adherence of platelets at the site of vascular injury through the binding of GpIbα to subendothelial von Willebrand factor (vWF). In platelets, the GpIb complex is tightly bound to the actin cytoskeleton via an interaction of GpIbα with actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280) (3Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol.

Partial sequence of two other ABP-280-related entities from human sources has been reported. Two partial cDNA fragments of one species, termed actin-binding protein-like protein (ABPL), were cloned by PCR and mapped to chromosome 7; full-length cDNA has not been reported. A second species, termed truncated actin-binding protein (TABP) in one publication (9Leedman P.J. Faulkner J.B. Cram D.S. Harrison P.J. West J. O'Brien E. Simpson R. Coppel R.L. Harrison L.C. Proc.

The TABP open reading frame predicts a protein of only 195 residues, whereas only a 291-amino acid sequence has been reported for filamin homolog-1.

In nuclei, endonucleases are presumed to be the main targets of calcium; however, little is known about its role during the cytosolic phase of apoptosis. We used a cell-free system to address this question. Our results show that CaCl2 triggered nuclear apoptosis (i.e. typical morphological change and DNA fragmentation) at concentrations of 5 mm. This concentration was lowered 10-fold by the co-incubation with cytosolic extracts from nonapoptotic cells. Apoptotic changes induced by the incubation of nuclei with CaCl2 in the presence of these cytosols were strongly reduced in the presence of an inhibitor of caspase-3 and to a lesser extent by an inhibitor of caspase-1. We also show that calcium-induced apoptosis is affected by protease inhibitors such as N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, but not by calpain or several lysosomal protease inhibitors. The addition of CaCl2 to the cell-free system increased a caspase-3 activity in nonapoptotic cytosols as shown by specific antibodies and an enzymatic assay. No activation of a caspase-3-like activity by the addition of cytochrome c was observed in these extracts under similar conditions. The enhanced caspase-3 activity induced by calcium was inhibited by protease inhibitors affecting morphological nuclear apoptosis except for those responsible for the degradation of lamin A. These results suggest that CaCl2 could trigger, in normal cells, an apoptotic cascade through the activation of cytosolic caspase-3 activity.

These results suggest that CaCl2 could trigger, in normal cells, an apoptotic cascade through the activation of cytosolic caspase-3 activity. Apoptosis is a cell death program originally characterized by specific morphological and biochemical modifications in higher eukaryotic cells (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar, 2Kerr J. Wyllie A. Currie A. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar). These structural changes such as plasma and nuclear membrane blebbings, chromatin condensation, proteases activation, and DNA fragmentation are considered as landmarks of the apoptotic process (3Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis plays an important role in the normal physiology of the cell, and in many pathological situations, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation and/or in the execution of this program (4Vaux D.L. Stasser A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 5Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Specific proteases called caspases and protein members of the proto-oncogene BCL-2 family have been shown to be the key elements of the executive/terminal phase of apoptosis (6Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar, 7Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 8Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The caspases involved in apoptosis are generally divided into initiators and excecutioners (9Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The initiators caspases (e.g. caspase-1 or -8) are implicated in the activation of the executioners (e.g.caspase-3 or -6), which in turn are responsible for the terminal phase of apoptosis along with other enzymes such as proteases, nucleases, kinases, and so forth (reviewed in Refs. 9Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 10Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J.

Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that BCL-2-like proteins regulate the activation of caspases through complex interactions with other proteins (7Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) and/or through the control of ion fluxes across membranes of organelles (12Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S.

Indeed, since BCL-2 overexpression has been shown to inhibit apoptosis-associated Ca2+ waves in the endoplasmic reticulum or the nuclear membranes, it has been proposed that members of the BCL-2 family could regulate the cellular calcium homeostasis (14Baffy G.

Numerous data have shown the involvement of Ca2+homeostasis in apoptosis and in particular the prelethal increase of its intracellular concentration (reviewed by McConkey and Orrenius (19Mc Conkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar)). Indeed, the addition of Ca2+ to isolated nuclei can directly promote apoptotic nuclear changes by a mechanism apparently involving nuclear endonucleases and proteases (20McConkey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22398-22406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, despite the accumulation of data, the link between intracellular calcium homeostasis and the activation of the apoptotic program remains unknown. We have shown, using a cell-free system, that calcium could play an important role in the induction of caspase-3-like activity by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, a protein linked to the activation of caspases. 1P.

The chemicals used in this study unless otherwise specified were obtained from Sigma (St. Quentin, France). Antibodies against cytochrome c were obtained from Pharmingen (Clinisciences, France), anti-procaspase-3 were from Transduction Laboratories (Medgene Science, France), and anti-procaspase-8 were from Santa Cruz (TEBU, France).Purification of Nuclei and Obtention of Cytosolic ExtractsRat liver nuclei were prepared according to Newmeyer and Wilson (22Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The rat glioblastoma cell line A15A5 and the human promyelocyte leukemic cells HL60 were grown to confluency at 37 °C and in 5% CO2. Apoptosis was then induced in these cells by a short UV-B treatment (1 min). Most of the cells displayed, after 48 h, characteristic morphological apoptotic changes. The cytosol extracts (CE), from both control (CCE) or apoptotic cells (ACE), were obtained as described in Cotter and Martin (23Cotter T.G. Martin S.J. Techniques in Apoptosis: A User's Guide. Portland Press, Colchester, UK1996Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, the resulting pellet was resuspended in the cell extract buffer (CEB) (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmcytochalasin B) supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in order to minimize proteolysis degradation in the extracts. Cells or apoptotic bodies were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were transferred to a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer in the remaining CEB. Cells were allowed to swell in a 1:1 dilution in CEB for 30 min on ice. Cells were lysed gently with 30 strokes with a B-type pestle. The cell lysate was then transferred to a 1-ml tube and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The cytosol was removed and kept frozen at a concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml at −80 °C.Analysis of DNA Content and Caspase-3-like ActivityCell-free reactions (50 μl) were carried out as follows. Cytosols were diluted to the desired concentrations in the reaction mixture which contained 2 × 105 rat liver nuclei, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 10 mm malate, 8 mm succinate, and 250 mm sucrose. Calcium and peptides were then added, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, a small aliquot of the mix was removed and stained for 10 min with Hoechst 33342 (2.5 μm) at room temperature and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, BX 60). The rest of the mix was analyzed for intranucleosomal degradation of the DNA and caspase-3 activity. After centrifugation of the samples (15 min, 400 × g at 4 °C), caspase-3 activity was measured in the supernatant and DNA fragmentation in the pellet. DNA was purified and analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel after staining by ethidium bromide. Caspase-3 activity was measured in the supernatant by following the cleavage of 50 μm peptide Ac-DEVD-AMC. The fluorescence of the cleaved substrate was determined every 30 min using a spectrophotometer (Fluorolite 1000, Dynatech Laboratories) set at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 465 nm (24Nicholson D.W.

The antibodies bound to Immobilon-P (Millipore, France) were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, France) and the amounts of procaspases after scanning with a Appligene-Oncor Imager (Strasbourg, France) were quantified with IPLab Gel Program (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA).DISCUSSIONSince apoptosis does not always require protein synthesis, elements involved in this process have to be already present in nonapoptotic cells. Our data show that calcium could induce apoptotic-like changes in isolated nuclei and that these changes were potentiated by the addition of nonapoptotic cytosols. Different CCEs were analyzed derived either from human hematopoietic cell lines (HL60 and K562) or from cells derived from rat nervous tissues (A15A5 and PC12). We have also shown that addition of calcium to these extracts activated a DEVD cleaving protease. As caspase-3 inhibitors blocked the calcium-induced apoptosis in the presence of CCEs, proteases belonging to this family were likely to be involved in this potentiation. Inhibition of the NSP or the addition of GSH blocked the calcium-induced nuclear apoptosis in the presence of cytosol but not the DEVDase activity. These results suggest that an antioxidant process as well as a resident mechanism of nuclear degradation involved in nuclear apoptosis functions downstream of cytosolic caspase activation. Recently, Liu et al. (34Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar) isolated a heterodimeric protein called DFF (DNA fragmentation factor) which could provide a link between activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. This factor, which is not regulated by calcium, induces DNA fragmentation in HeLa cells after cleavage by caspase-3.The DEVDase activity appears to be rapidly induced by calcium at very low concentrations of CCEs. Under the same conditions, cytochromec and dATP had little effect on DEVDase activation. However, cytochrome c activation of DEVDase can be observed with higher concentrations of CCEs, indicating different thresholds of activation for calcium and cytochrome c, which probably thus rely on different mechanisms. 3M. Pelletier and F. M. Vallette, manuscript in preparation. Of all the nonanticaspase agents, only TPCK appears to specifically and efficiently inihibit the calcium induced DEVDase activity (Fig. 7). Recently, TPCK has been shown to to block the conversion of the inactive 32-kDa caspase-3 precursor into the mature caspase-3 (35Han Z. Hendrickson E.A. Bremner T.A. Wyche J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13432-13436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), thus providing an explanation of its inhibitory effect on apopotosis reported in several studies (11Sukharev S.A. Pleshakova O.V. Sadovnikov V.B. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, under our conditions, no increase in a chymotrypsin activity was observed (Fig. 6), ruling out a general proteolytic activation by calcium which in turn would lead to an nonspecific activation of a DEVDase activity.The calcium induced DEVDase activity was attributed to caspase-3, as no YVADase (caspase-1-like) activity was found, the amount of procaspase-3 was specifically affected by calcium (Fig. 8) and as the inhibition of caspase-6 did not interfere with this activity (Fig. 7). The nature of this activation remains to be established, in particular the intervention of other proteases (including other caspases) and/or cytoplasmic components in this process. Even if the calcium concentrations used in our study are elevated compared with resting intracellular calcium concentrations, one could postulate that, under certain circumstances, the release of calcium from intracellular organelles could lead to high local cytosolic concentration which could activate a caspase-3-like protease. Our observation could thus be relevant in certain physiopathological situations. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that the glutamate-induced apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons, which is characterized by a sustained intracellular rise of Ca2+, is mediated by a post-translational activation of a caspase-3-like protease (36Du Y. Bales K.R. Dodel R.C. Hamilton-Byrd E. Horn J.W. Czilli D.L. Simmons L.K. Binhui N. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11657-11662Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a cell death program originally characterized by specific morphological and biochemical modifications in higher eukaryotic cells (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar). These structural changes such as plasma and nuclear membrane blebbings, chromatin condensation, proteases activation, and DNA fragmentation are considered as landmarks of the apoptotic process (3Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis plays an important role in the normal physiology of the cell, and in many pathological situations, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation and/or in the execution of this program (4Vaux D.L. Stasser A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 5Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Specific proteases called caspases and protein members of the proto-oncogene BCL-2 family have been shown to be the key elements of the executive/terminal phase of apoptosis (6Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar, 7Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 8Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The caspases involved in apoptosis are generally divided into initiators and excecutioners (9Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The initiators caspases (e.g. caspase-1 or -8) are implicated in the activation of the executioners (e.g.caspase-3 or -6), which in turn are responsible for the terminal phase of apoptosis along with other enzymes such as proteases, nucleases, kinases, and so forth (reviewed in Refs. 9Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 10Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J.

Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that BCL-2-like proteins regulate the activation of caspases through complex interactions with other proteins (7Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) and/or through the control of ion fluxes across membranes of organelles (12Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S.

Indeed, since BCL-2 overexpression has been shown to inhibit apoptosis-associated Ca2+ waves in the endoplasmic reticulum or the nuclear membranes, it has been proposed that members of the BCL-2 family could regulate the cellular calcium homeostasis (14Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J.

Numerous data have shown the involvement of Ca2+homeostasis in apoptosis and in particular the prelethal increase of its intracellular concentration (reviewed by McConkey and Orrenius (19Mc Conkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar)). Indeed, the addition of Ca2+ to isolated nuclei can directly promote apoptotic nuclear changes by a mechanism apparently involving nuclear endonucleases and proteases (20McConkey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22398-22406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, despite the accumulation of data, the link between intracellular calcium homeostasis and the activation of the apoptotic program remains unknown. We have shown, using a cell-free system, that calcium could play an important role in the induction of caspase-3-like activity by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, a protein linked to the activation of caspases. 1P.

The chemicals used in this study unless otherwise specified were obtained from Sigma (St. Quentin, France). Antibodies against cytochrome c were obtained from Pharmingen (Clinisciences, France), anti-procaspase-3 were from Transduction Laboratories (Medgene Science, France), and anti-procaspase-8 were from Santa Cruz (TEBU, France).Purification of Nuclei and Obtention of Cytosolic ExtractsRat liver nuclei were prepared according to Newmeyer and Wilson (22Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The rat glioblastoma cell line A15A5 and the human promyelocyte leukemic cells HL60 were grown to confluency at 37 °C and in 5% CO2. Apoptosis was then induced in these cells by a short UV-B treatment (1 min). Most of the cells displayed, after 48 h, characteristic morphological apoptotic changes. The cytosol extracts (CE), from both control (CCE) or apoptotic cells (ACE), were obtained as described in Cotter and Martin (23Cotter T.G. Martin S.J. Techniques in Apoptosis: A User's Guide. Portland Press, Colchester, UK1996Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, the resulting pellet was resuspended in the cell extract buffer (CEB) (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmcytochalasin B) supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in order to minimize proteolysis degradation in the extracts. Cells or apoptotic bodies were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were transferred to a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer in the remaining CEB. Cells were allowed to swell in a 1:1 dilution in CEB for 30 min on ice. Cells were lysed gently with 30 strokes with a B-type pestle. The cell lysate was then transferred to a 1-ml tube and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The cytosol was removed and kept frozen at a concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml at −80 °C.Analysis of DNA Content and Caspase-3-like ActivityCell-free reactions (50 μl) were carried out as follows. Cytosols were diluted to the desired concentrations in the reaction mixture which contained 2 × 105 rat liver nuclei, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 10 mm malate, 8 mm succinate, and 250 mm sucrose. Calcium and peptides were then added, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, a small aliquot of the mix was removed and stained for 10 min with Hoechst 33342 (2.5 μm) at room temperature and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, BX 60). The rest of the mix was analyzed for intranucleosomal degradation of the DNA and caspase-3 activity. After centrifugation of the samples (15 min, 400 × g at 4 °C), caspase-3 activity was measured in the supernatant and DNA fragmentation in the pellet. DNA was purified and analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel after staining by ethidium bromide. Caspase-3 activity was measured in the supernatant by following the cleavage of 50 μm peptide Ac-DEVD-AMC. The fluorescence of the cleaved substrate was determined every 30 min using a spectrophotometer (Fluorolite 1000, Dynatech Laboratories) set at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 465 nm (24Nicholson D.W.

The interaction facilitates ligand binding and signaling via A1R, but it is not known whether it has a role in homologous desensitization of A1Rs. Here we show that chronic exposure of DDT1MF-2 cells to the A1R agonist,N6-(R)-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA), caused a rapid aggregation or clustering of A1 receptor molecules on the cell membrane, which was enhanced by pretreatment with ADA. Colocalization between A1R and ADA occurred in the R-PIA-induced clusters. Interestingly, colocalization between A1R and ADA also occurred in intracellular vesicles after internalization of both protein molecules in response to R-PIA. Agonist-induced aggregation of A1Rs was mediated by phosphorylation of A1Rs, which was enhanced and accelerated in the presence of ADA. Ligand-induced second-messenger desensitization of A1Rs was also accelerated in the presence of exogenous ADA, and it correlated well with receptor phosphorylation. However, although phosphorylation of A1R returned to its basal state within minutes, desensitization continued for hours. The loss of cell-surface binding sites (sequestration) induced by the agonist was time-dependent (t½= 10 ± 1 h) and was accelerated by ADA. All of these results strongly suggest that ADA plays a key role in the regulation of A1Rs by accelerating ligand-induced desensitization and internalization and provide evidence that the two cell surface proteins internalize via the same endocytic pathway.

Adenosine is an autacoid that exerts its physiological actions through specific cell surface receptors. Four adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, have been cloned and pharmacologically characterized (1Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Neuropharmacol. 1995; 34: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Acting through different adenosine receptors, adenosine is a neuromodulator in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (2Fredholm B.B. Dunwiddie T.V. Trends Pharmacol.

Neuropharmacol. 1995; 34: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A1R displays two different affinities for agonist, which have classically been attributed to a different coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins (12Lohse M.J. Lenschow V. Swabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). According to this two-independent site model, coupled receptor-G protein complexes display high affinity for agonists (Kd = 0.1–0.2 nm), and uncoupled receptors display low affinity (1–2 nm) (12Lohse M.J. Lenschow V. Swabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar,13Casadó V. Canti C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluı́s C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recently reported cluster-arranged cooperative model predicts that the high and low affinity sites are a consequence of the negative cooperativity of agonist binding and do not seem to be related to the content of free and G protein-coupled receptors (14Franco R.

According to the cluster-arranged cooperative model, the agonist-induced conversion of the high to the low affinity state may partially explain the ligand-induced desensitization of A1R (14Franco R.

Receptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family are desensitized and down-regulated in response to agonist stimulation. β2-Adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs) constitute the best characterized system within the G protein-coupled receptor family. Agonist-induced β2-AR desensitization is caused by a conformational change of the agonist-occupied receptor that facilitates receptor phosphorylation by second messenger-activated kinases or G protein-coupled receptor kinases (16Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 17Post S.R. Aguila-Buhain O. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 895-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following β2-AR phosphorylation, β-arrestin binds to the phosphorylated receptor and uncouples the receptor from the heterotrimeric G proteins (18Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G.

Although sequestration is not required for phosphorylation and desensitization, it appears to be necessary for dephosphorylation and resensitization of β2-ARs (22Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J.

Like other G protein-coupled receptor members, A1R expression is regulated in response to agonist or antagonist stimulation. Desensitization of A1R has been described in intact animals and in cell cultures. Prolonged administration of A1R agonists to animals leads to functional desensitization of A1R in guinea pig heart (24Dennis D.M. Shryock J.C. Belardinelli L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The reduced functional response is due to a net loss of A1Rs or down-regulation, a decrease in the proportion of A1R displaying the high affinity state for agonists and a decrease in the content of Gi proteins. Growth of rat adipocytes or smooth muscle DDT1MF-2 cells in the presence ofN6-(R)-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA) leads to the desensitization and down-regulation of A1R (29Ramkumar V. Olah M.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that treatment of DDT1MF-2 cells with the agonist R-PIA induces a rapid phosphorylation and clustering of A1Rs. The loss of binding sites on the cell membrane due to internalization of A1R is a slower event occurring within hours. Since activators of protein kinase A or C mimicked the effect of the ligand, Ser/Thr phosphorylation seems to be related to short term clustering and desensitization as well as to long term internalization of A1R (32Ciruela F. Saura C Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A new perspective on the coupling of A1R to G proteins has recently been provided. Ecto-adenosine deaminase (ecto-ADA; EC3.5.4.4), which is capable of degrading adenosine to inosine on the cell surface (for a review, see Ref. 33Franco R. Casadó V. Ciruela F. Saura C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was shown to modulate ligand binding and signaling through A1Rs on DDT1MF-2 cells (34Ciruela F. Saura C. Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Irrespective of its catalytic activity, ADA seems to be necessary for a high affinity binding of agonists to A1R (35Saura C. Ciruela F. Casadó V. Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 675-682Google Scholar). Here the effect of ADA on the ligand-mediated regulation of A1R in DDT1MF-2 cells has been studied. ADA affected both desensitization and internalization of A1Rs. Moreover, by means of immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry using antibodies against A1R and ADA, we found that A1R and ADA colocalize and that, after receptor activation, they cluster on the cell surface and internalize via the same pathway. All of these results provide evidence for concerted modulation of ADA and A1R in response to receptor agonists. [Adenine-2,8-3H,ethyl-2-3H]phenylisopropyladenosine ([3H]R-PIA) (36 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Nuclear Iberica, Madrid, Spain). [32P]orthophosphate (32Pi) was from NEN Life Science Products. 1,3-Dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine was from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). R-PIA, pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Fura-2/AM, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine isothiocyanate, and calf adenosine deaminase (ADA) were purchased from Sigma. ADA was desalted with a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to all assays. A unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 130 nmol of ADA protein. Electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Boehringer Manheim. Sephadex G-25 and protein A-Sepharose CL4B were from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology (Uppsala, Sweden). All other products were obtained from Merck. Antisera against purified calf ADA and against peptides of A1 adenosine receptor (PC10 and PC20) were generated by immunization of female New Zealand White rabbits by the Biokit Company (Barcelona, Spain). Antibodies against A1Rs (PC11 and PC21) were purified from serum by affinity chromatography (peptide coupled to thiol-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). Anti-ADA antibody was purified using ADA coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity of antibodies for their respective antigens and extensive characterization of anti-ADA and anti-A1R antibodies (PC11 and PC21) have been previously reported (36Aran J.M. Colomer D. Matutes E. Vives-Corrons J.L. Franco R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Ciruela F. Casadó V. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 818-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PC11 and PC21 antibodies do not recognize ADA from DDT1MF-2 cell extracts by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, or immunocytochemistry (34Ciruela F. Saura C. Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PC21 and PC11 A1R antibodies were shown to be specific for cells expressing A1Rs (32Ciruela F. Saura C Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fluorescence probes were obtained by reacting (for 2 h at 20 °C) 0.1 mg of fluorescein or rhodamine isothiocyanate with 1 mg of purified protein in coupling buffer (50 mmH3BO3, 200 mm NaCl, pH 9.2). Unbound fluorochrome was removed by rapid filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fractions were tested for protein content. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells derived from a steroid-induced leiomyosarcoma of Syrian hamster vas deferens were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured (at 37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Whittaker, Walkersville, NY), 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 5% (v/v) horse serum, and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Desensitization and internalization assays were performed with cells growing in the absence or in the presence of 65 nm ADA and/or 50 nm R-PIA. At the indicated incubation times, cells were harvested and washed exhaustively in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before binding, immunocytochemistry, and intracellular calcium mobilization assays. Protein content was measured by the BCA method (Pierce), as described by Sorensen and Brodbeck (38Sorensen K. Brodbeck U. Experentia. 1986; 42: 161-162Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For binding assays, untreated or treated DDT1MF-2 cells (1 mg/ml) were resuspended in serum-free DMEM buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and preincubated with 65 nm ADA for 30 min at 4 °C. Radioligand binding was performed in the presence of 5 nmof [3H]R-PIA for 4 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was performed in the presence of a 400-fold excess of R-PIA. Nonspecific binding with a 500-fold excess of the selective A1R antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine resulted in similar displacement of [3H]R-PIA binding. When equilibrium had been reached, incubates were filtered through glass fiber filters (GF/C filters, Whatman, Kent, United Kingdom) in a Brandel cell harvester (Biomedical Research and Development Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and transferred to vials containing 10 ml of scintillation solution EcoscintH (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). After overnight shaking, vials were counted using a Packard 1600 TRI-CARB scintillation counter with 50% efficiency. All points represent the mean of 3–5 independent experiments performed in triplicate. A1R phosphorylation was induced by 65 nm ADA and/or 50 nm R-PIA treatment after the cellular ATP pool had been labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Briefly, DDT1MF-2 cells washed twice and resuspended in phosphate-free DMEM (buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were incubated (106cells/ml, 37 °C, 2 h) with 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Loaded cells were resuspended (1 × 106 cells/ml) in serum-free DMEM and incubated with the indicated reagents at 37 °C. After the corresponding incubation times, cells were centrifuged (10 s, 14,000 rpm) in a microcentrifuge and washed twice in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS before disruption and solubilization (1 h at 4 °C) in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; 100 mm NaCl; 1 mm Na3 VO4; 50 mm NaF; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and antipain). The solubilized preparation (0.2 mg/ml) was immediately processed for immunoprecipitation with the anti-A1R antibody (PC11, 50 μg/ml) and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitated material was washed four times in lysis buffer (1 × 1%, 2 × 0.1%, and 1 × 0% Nonidet P-40) before resuspension in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described elsewhere (37Ciruela F. Casadó V. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 818-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated bands were quantified with a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For immunofluorescence staining, treated and untreated cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes in PBS containing 20 mmglycine (buffer A) and in buffer A containing 1% bovine serum albumin (buffer B), cells were incubated with the rhodamine-conjugated anti-A1R antibody (PC21-TRITC, 75 μg/ml) and the fluorescein-conjugated anti-ADA antibody (anti-ADA-FITC, 75 μg/ml) or, alternatively, with the fluorescein-conjugated anti-A1R antibody (PC21-FITC, 75 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Three washes in buffer B were performed before mounting the samples in immunofluorescence medium (ICN Biomedical Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Internalization was analyzed by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. To follow dynamic internalization, unfixed cells growing on glass coverslips were incubated (37 °C, 20 min) with 65 nm bovine serum albumin-FITC, with PC21-FITC (10 μg/ml), and with 65 nm ADA-FITC and/or PC21-TRITC (10 μg/ml) and then treated with 50 nm R-PIA at 37 °C for 24–72 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and again washed twice in PBS 20 mmglycine. Glass coverslips were mounted as described above. Cells were examined with a LEICA TCS confocal scanning laser microscope attached to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg). Images shown are representative of at least three experiments. Internalization measurements for A1Rs and cell surface ADA (ecto-ADA) were performed by immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis. Cells were grown in complete medium in the absence or presence of 50 nm R-PIA for 0–48 h. In some experiments, ADA (65 nm) was prebound by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C; unbound enzyme was eliminated by washing twice in PBS. Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in buffer A and buffer B for 20 min before staining with anti-ADA-FITC (75 μg/ml) or PC21-FITC (75 μg/ml). Three washes in buffer B were performed before analyzing the mean fluorescence intensity from 5000–10,000 cells on an EPICS Profile flow cytometer (Coulter, Hieleah, FL). Similar assays were performed for cells incubated (30 min to 48 h at 37 °C) with 65 nm fluorescein-conjugated ADA (ADA-FITC) in the absence or presence of 50 nm R-PIA. In order to remove as much of the cell surface-bound ADA as possible, cells were washed once in PBS and once in PBS/HCl, pH 2, for 15 min according to the method of Yang et al. (39Yang E-B Wang D-F. Mack P. Cheng L-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed and processed for flow cytometry as described above. For establishing comparisons in internalization studies, the mean of fluorescence intensity taken as reference was that found in cells incubated with 65 nmADA-FITC for 15 min at 37 °C. This fluorescence intensity was similar to that found in cells incubated with 65 nmADA-FITC at 4 °C for 2 h, which was considered as the background signal. Higher intensities would reflect internalization of ADA-FITC. Cells were washed and resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS containing 1.2 mmCaCl2 and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in HBSS (1 × 106 cells/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were placed in a cuvette (106 cells/2 ml of HBSS, 25 nm ADA), and calcium peak induction was achieved by treatment with 50 nm R-PIA at 30 °C. For short term desensitization assays (1–15 min), cells were loaded and washed before resuspension in prewarmed (37 °C) serum-free DMEM (1 × 106cells/ml) and incubated with the indicated reagents. Cells were washed three times in HBSS buffer to remove reagents before resuspension in the same buffer and R-PIA induction of calcium mobilization as indicated above. After these three washes [Ca2+] base-line levels were similar irrespective of the type of pretreatment. Therefore, differences in calcium mobilization were not a consequence of different calcium base-line levels in response to pretreatments. For long term desensitization (12, 24, and 48 h), incubations were performed before loading with Fura-2/AM. Calcium concentration was determined in a dual wavelength Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer by using the ratio of excitation wavelengths 334/366 nm with emission cut-off at 500 nm. Free calcium concentration was calculated as described previously (40Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Time course curves were fitted to a single-phase exponential decay equation, in the case of [3H]R-PIA binding. Statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p was <0.05. A1adenosine receptor (A1R) distribution on the surface of DDT1MF-2 cells was examined by immunocytochemistry and confocal analysis. Untreated and R-PIA-treated cells were fixed, incubated with fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-A1R antibody (PC21-FITC), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The PC21 antibody is directed against the second extracellular loop of A1R and its specificity for cell surface-expressed A1R has been previously demonstrated (32Ciruela F. Saura C Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Receptor distribution in untreated cells revealed homogenous bright staining on the surface of DDT1MF-2 cells (Fig. 1 A). No major differences in receptor distribution were observed in the presence of exogenous ADA (65 nm) for 15 min (Fig. 1 B). A 5-min exposure of cells to the A1R agonist R-PIA (50 nm) induced the appearance of bright accumulations of antigen on the plasma membrane, suggesting aggregation or clustering of receptor molecules (Fig. 1 C). Clustering of A1Rs was more evident after 15 min of R-PIA exposure, when brighter clusters were found (Fig. 1, compare C andE). Incubation of DDT1MF-2 cells with ADA andR-PIA changed the pattern of cell surface A1R distribution dramatically. In the presence of ADA, clusters of A1R were already evident at 2 min, and the label was found as intense bright punctate accumulations at 5 or 15 min ofR-PIA treatment (Fig. 1, D and F). This clearly shows the involvement of ecto-ADA in the regulation of theR-PIA-induced aggregation of cell surface A1R molecules. All images shown in Fig. 1 represent reconstructions of multiple sections at different levels. When middle sections were analyzed, only the cell surface staining was observed, thus ruling out intracellular staining (data not shown; see Ref. 32Ciruela F. Saura C Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To analyze the codistribution of A1R and ADA on the plasma membrane of DDT1MF-2 cells, ADA-treated cells were incubated with or without 50 nm R-PIA for 15 min. Cells were fixed, washed, and stained by double immunofluorescence using the fluorescein-conjugated anti-ADA antibody (anti-ADA-FITC) and the rhodamine-conjugated anti-A1R antibody (PC21-TRITC). Homogenous distribution of ADA and A1R on the cell surface was observed in untreated cells (Fig. 2,top). Superimposition of images by confocal analysis showed extensive colocalization (yellow) of both proteins on the plasma membrane. When cells were treated (15 min) withR-PIA, a redistribution of ADA and A1Rs, which is consistent with clustering, was observed. R-PIA induced aggregation of both proteins in clusters seen as punctate accumulations of fluorescence and where colocalization between A1R and ecto-ADA was very high (Fig. 2, bottom). In a previous study, we have shown that ligand-induced phosphorylation of A1R correlates with the clustering of receptors on the DDT1MF-2 cell surface (32Ciruela F. Saura C Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether the potentiation of the clustering by ADA could involve changes in receptor phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated the receptor from cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Exogenous ADA by itself had only a slight effect on A1R phosphorylation. R-PIA (50 nm) induced, in the absence of ADA, a steady increase of A1R phosphorylation from basal levels to a 2.1-fold increase at 15 min. Interestingly, in the presence of exogenous ADA (65 nm), R-PIA induced a rapid increase in A1R phosphorylation with a maximum rise (3-fold increase) after 1 min; thereafter (5 and 15 min), the level of phosphorylation declined (Fig. 3). In the presence of ADA, receptor phosphorylation diminished to basal level after 15–30 min, whereas for cells treated with R-PIA in the absence of the enzyme the return to basal levels of phosphorylation was slower. Activation of A1Rs with adenosine or analogs leads to both Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation and intracellular calcium mobilization in DDT1MF-2 cells (41Gerwins P. Fredholm B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16081-16087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dickenson J.M. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To correlate changes in agonist-induced A1R phosphorylation with possible changes in second messenger production, we analyzed the effect of ADA and/or R-PIA on agonist-induced mobilization of intracellular calcium. Cells were exposed to vehicle (control) or to 65 nm ADA and/or 50 nm R-PIA. After extensive washes, calcium mobilization was induced by 50 nm R-PIA. R-PIA caused a transient Ca2+peak in naive (vehicle-treated) cells (Fig. 4 A). Desensitization of the [Ca2+] response in R-PIA- orR-PIA/ADA-treated cells occurred rapidly (in minutes) and was sustained for at least 48 h (Fig. 4 B).R-PIA pretreatment reduced the maximum intracellular calcium concentration by 2, 30, and 44% at 1, 5, and 15 min, respectively. This effect was, however, potentiated in the presence of ADA, since the maximum desensitization (60%) was achieved at 5 min and maintained for up to 48 h (Fig. 4, A and B). No significant differences in maximum effect were observed when R-PIA pretreatment was done in the presence or in the absence of ADA (Fig. 4 B). It should be noted that ADA pretreatment in the absence of R-PIA led to a significant and sustained desensitization (25–45% reduction of the response). Characterization of A1Rs by radioligand binding using the agonist [3H]R-PIA indicated the p"

Transfection was accomplished by electroporation using an hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GLUT4 as a reporter protein. In cells expressing HA-GLUT4 alone, insulin results in an ≈7-fold increase in cell surface anti-HA antibody binding. Studies with wortmannin indicate that the kinetics of HA-GLUT4-trafficking parallel those of the native GLUT4 and in addition, that newly synthesized HA-GLUT4 goes to the plasma membrane before being sorted into the insulin-responsive compartments. Short term (4 h) coexpression of dynamin-K44A and HA-GLUT4 increases the amount of cell surface HA-GLUT4 in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states. Under conditions of maximal expression of dynamin-K44A (24 h), most or all of the intracellular HA-GLUT4 appears to be present on the cell surface in the basal state, and insulin has no further effect. Measurements of the kinetics of HA-GLUT4 endocytosis show that dynamin-K44A blocks internalization of the glucose transporters. In contrast, expression of dynamin wild type decreases the amount of cell surface HA-GLUT4 in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states. These data demonstrate that the endocytosis of GLUT4 is largely mediated by processes which require dynamin.

In the basal state, where the rate of exocytosis is relatively low, the vast majority of the GLUT4 glucose transporters reside in an as yet poorly characterized intracellular compartment (1Satoh S.

After clearance of the hormone, the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis decreases and the steady state distribution shifts back to the intracellular compartment. The primary focus of recent investigations has been the identification and characterization of signaling molecules (e.g. p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and other cellular components (e.g. soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs)) possibly involved in the regulated exocytosis of GLUT4 (6Hara K.

However, little is known about the mechanism of GLUT4 endocytosis. Previous reports provided indirect evidence that GLUT4 might be internalized by a mechanism involving clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Potassium depletion, known to disrupt formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (12Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), results in a decreased internalization of GLUT4 and mannose-6-phosphate receptors in rat adipose cells (13Nishimura H. Zarnowski M.J. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19246-19253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GLUT4 has been shown to co-purify with clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the plasma membrane after treatment of the cells with the fungal toxin brefeldin A (14Chakrabarti R. Buxton J. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7926-7933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous morphological analysis showed association of GLUT4 with clathrin-coated pits (4Robinson L.J. Pang S. Hairns D.A. Heuser J. James D.E. J.

Dwyer N.K. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Cushman S.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since no functional studies involving components of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in insulin target cells have been reported, the mechanism of GLUT4 internalization still remains unclear. The dynamins belong to a family of 100-kDa GTPases that mediate the initial stages of endocytosis (15Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B.

Dynamin−1 is found in neurons, dynamin−2 is expressed ubiquitously, and dynamin−3 is enriched in testis (15Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B.

Although the distinct functions of these different dynamin proteins are not fully understood, considerable evidence now indicates that dynamin−1 participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin−1 colocalizes with clathrin in intact cells on the light and electron microscopy levels (22Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J.

Furthermore, transfection of cultured mammalian cells with dominant-negative dynamin−1 mutants results in the accumulation of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane (18van der Bliek A.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), whereas internalization of transferrin receptors, epidermal growth factor receptors, and β2-adrenergic receptors is inhibited (17Herskovits J.S.

Even though a role of dynamin−2 in endocytosis remains unclear, a recent report suggests that dynamin−2 might also be localized to coated pits on the plasma membrane (26Warnock D.E. Baba T. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, considering the high degree of amino acid sequence homology between dynamin−1 and dynamin−2 and the ability of dynamin−1 mutants to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis even in nonneuronal cells, both isoforms might act as functional homologues in endocytosis in nonneuronal cells (17Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 18van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.J. Schmid S.L.

McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Maier O. Knoblish M. Westermann P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To characterize the mechanism of GLUT4 endocytosis, we have overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin−1 in isolated rat adipose cells. The effects of dynamin−1 on GLUT4- trafficking in vivo were monitored by utilizing a co-transfected recombinant GLUT4 containing an HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; TGN, trans-Golgi network. epitope tag in the first exofacial loop (30Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All constructs were generated in the pCIS2 mammalian expression vector (a generous gift from Dr. C. Gorman). cDNAs for HA epitope-tagged dominant-negative K44A dynamin−1 and HA-tagged wild-type dynamin−1 (a generous gift from Drs. H. Damke and S. L. Schmid) were subcloned into the expression vector. Construction of the HA-tagged GLUT4 has been described previously (30Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, the plasmids were purified in mg quantities using a maxiprep kit (Qiagen). Preparation of isolated rat epididymal adipose cells from male rats (CD strain, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc.) was performed as described previously (31Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn C.R. Harrison I.C. The Insulin Receptor. II. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 171-187Google Scholar). Isolated cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, 4 mml-glutamine, 200 nm(−)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine, and 75 μg/ml gentamycin, and resuspended to a cytocrit of 40% (≈5–6 × 106 cells/ml). 200 μl of the cell suspension were added to 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg of carrier DNA (sheared herring sperm DNA; Boehringer Mannheim) and expression plasmids as indicated. The total concentration of plasmid DNA in each cuvette was adjusted to 5 μg/cuvette with empty pCIS2. Electroporation was carried out in 0.4-cm gap-width cuvettes (Bio-Rad) using a T810 square wave pulse generator (BTX). After applying three pulses (12 ms, 200 V), the cells were washed once in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pooled in groups of 4–10 cuvettes, and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3.5% bovine serum albumin. Rat adipose cells were harvested 3.5 or 20–24 h post-transfection and washed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 200 nm adenosine (KRBH buffer) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Samples corresponding to the cells from one cuvette were distributed into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. After stimulation with 67 nm (1 × 104 microunits/ml) insulin for 30 min at 37 °C, subcellular trafficking of GLUT4 was stopped by the addition of 2 mm KCN (32Kono T. Suzuki K. Dansey L.E. Robinson F.W. Blevins T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6400-6407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the following steps were performed at room temperature. A monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Berkeley Antibody Co.) was added at a dilution of 1:1000, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. Excess antibody was removed by washing the cells three times with KRBH, 5% bovine serum albumin. Then 0.1 μCi of 125I-sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each reaction, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. Finally, the cells were spun through dinonylphtalate oil to remove the unbound antibody (31Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn C.R. Harrison I.C. The Insulin Receptor. II. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 171-187Google Scholar), and the cell surface-associated radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. The resulting counts were normalized to the lipid weight of the samples (31Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn C.R. Harrison I.C. The Insulin Receptor. II. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 171-187Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, the values obtained for pCIS-transfected cells were subtracted from all other values to correct for nonspecific antibody binding. Antibody binding assays were performed in duplicate or quadruplicate. To increase the insulin response of rat adipose cells transfected with epitope-tagged GLUT4 above that observed with the original technique (30Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we tested the experimental procedure as follows. Rat adipose cells were transfected with various amounts of HA-GLUT4 expression plasmid and analyzed at different time points for basal and insulin-stimulated cell surface HA-GLUT4 using the anti-HA antibody binding assay. The tagged glucose transporters become detectable at the cell surface in response to insulin as early as 2 h post-transfection. Synthesis of HA-GLUT4 continues until about 16 h post-transfection, at which time its level stays relatively constant and maximal to 24 h post-transfection (data not shown). As judged by immunohistochemistry using the same monoclonal anti-HA antibody and nonpermeabilized, insulin-stimulated cells, the electroporation procedure yields ≈10% HA-positive cells (Ref. 33Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, after culturing the transfected rat adipose cells for 3.5 h, acute (30 min) insulin typically resulted in a 7–10-fold increase in cell surface anti-HA antibody binding after correction for transfection with the empty vector alone (Fig. 1 A). Prolonged expression of the tagged GLUT4 (24 h) resulted in higher amounts of HA-GLUT4 at the plasma membrane in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states (Fig. 1 B). Compared with 3.5 h of expression, the amount of insulin-stimulated cell surface HA-GLUT4 with 24 h of expression was increased about 4–5-fold. However, because the -fold increase in basal cell surface HA-GLUT4 from 3.5 to 24 h of expression was greater than that observed in the insulin-stimulated state, insulin stimulation resulted only in a 2–3-fold increase in cell surface glucose transporters. As a compromise between signal strength and insulin response, we selected transfection using 0.5 μg of plasmid/cuvette and 3.5 h of protein expression as our standard conditions. To determine the extent of overexpression of GLUT4, total membrane fractions from adipose cells transfected with 0.1 to 5 μg of HA-GLUT4 plasmid/cuvette and cultured for 24 h were analyzed by Western blotting (data not shown). Both endogenous and recombinant GLUT4 were detected using the same polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of GLUT4. Quantitation of the blots shows that the amount of GLUT4 was increased by 1.1–2-fold compared with pCIS-transfected cells. Thus, taking into account that only ≈10% of the cells are transfected (33Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), overexpression of GLUT4 in transfected cells ranged from <2- to 10-fold of endogenous GLUT4 levels, depending on the amount of expression plasmid used. To study the effects of dynamin overexpression on the subcellular distribution of epitope-tagged GLUT4, rat adipose cells were co-transfected with HA-GLUT4 and various concentrations of expression plasmids for wild-type and mutant dynamin. Fig. 2 illustrates the data when protein expression is carried out for 3.5 and 20 h. At 3.5 h post-transfection in dynamin-K44A-transfected cells, the basal cell surface level of HA-GLUT4 was increased as much as 2.6 ± 0.1-fold (mean ± S.D.) compared with cells transfected with HA-GLUT4 alone (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, a concomitant increase in cell surface HA-GLUT4 in the insulin-stimulated state was observed. (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, expression of wild-type dynamin decreased the amount of cell surface HA-GLUT4 in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states to 51 ± 4 and 58 ± 13% that of the controls, respectively. After 20 h of expression of the dynamin mutant, the basal level of cell surface HA-GLUT4 equaled that for the insulin-stimulated state (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the absolute amount of cell surface HA-GLUT4 was increased by about 30–40% (37 ± 1% and 32 ± 12% in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively) compared with the insulin-stimulated control. Prolonged overexpression (20 h) of the wild-type dynamin decreased the amount of cell surface HA-GLUT4 in the insulin-stimulated state compared with both the control cells and the cells transfected with mutant dynamin and decreased the basal level compared with cells transfected with mutant dynamin (Fig. 2 B), as shown for 3.5 h of expression (Fig. 2 A). To verify that expression of the dynamins affects the endocytosis of GLUT4 in rat adipose cells, we analyzed the redistribution of cell surface HA-GLUT4 in the presence of the fungal metabolite wortmannin (7Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kanai F. Ito K. Takoda M. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Ishii K. Okada T.

J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Acting as an inhibitor of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (36Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneige S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), wortmannin blocked the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 from its basal compartment to the plasma membrane (7Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem.

When added simultaneously with insulin, wortmannin (100 nm) also blocked translocation of epitope-tagged HA-GLUT4 to the cell surface in transfected cells (data not shown). Previously, Holman and co-workers (38Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and a study from our laboratory (39Malide D. St-Denis J.F. Keller S.R. Cushman S.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that this inhibition of GLUT4 translocation does not affect the early steps of GLUT4 endocytosis. Thus, the addition of wortmannin to insulin-stimulated cells inhibited further translocation of GLUT4 from its intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane, thereby allowing measurements of the kinetics of GLUT4 endocytosis. Fig. 3demonstrates the results of such wortmannin experiments. In insulin-stimulated rat adipose cells transfected with HA-GLUT4 alone, the amount of recombinant glucose transporters present on the cell surface increased over time (Fig. 3 A). A similar time course of expression of luciferase activity was observed when cells were transfected with a pCIS2-luciferase construct (40Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L.X. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J. Klinghoffer R. Kazlauskas A. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) under the same conditions (data not shown). Fig. 4illustrates that the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide together with insulin prevents the increase of cell surface HA-GLUT4 with a lag time typical of the action of this reagent. A similar inhibitory effect of cycloheximide on cell surface HA-GLUT4 was observed in basal cells (data not shown). Thus, the increase of cell surface HA-GLUT4 with time apparently reflects the ongoing synthesis of recombinant glucose transporters during the assay. Nonetheless, addition of wortmannin to insulin-stimulated cells led to a decrease in cell surface HA-GLUT4 with a time course similar to that observed with native GLUT4 as previously reported (Fig. 3 B) (1Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated cells transfected with wild-type dynamin showed a time course of HA-GLUT4 clearance from the plasma membrane after wortmannin treatment that was similar to that observed in cells transfected with HA-GLUT4 alone (Fig. 3 D). However, cell surface HA-GLUT4 levels in dynamin-K44A cells were not decreased by the addition of wortmannin after insulin but continued to increase in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3 C). Fig. 3 Eshows the time course data corrected for the synthesis of HA-GLUT4 during the assay. The addition of wortmannin to insulin-stimulated cells expressing dynamin-K44A did not change the cell surface level of the tagged glucose transporters; thus, all of the HA-GLUT4 appears to remain on the cell surface. Evidently the protein synthesis-associated increase in cell surface glucose transporters in rat adipose cells utilizes a wortmannin-insensitive trafficking pathway. As shown in Fig. 3 C, newly synthesized HA-GLUT4 still appeared on the cell surface in the presence of mutant dynamin and wortmannin. Under these conditions, the endocytosis of GLUT4 was inhibited by the dynamin mutant, leading to an accumulation of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 E). Likewise, the translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane was inhibited by wortmannin. To further investigate the site at which the newly synthesized glucose transporters enter their recycling compartments, we studied the effects of wortmannin on the cell surface level of HA-GLUT4 under basal conditions. To increase the antibody binding signal, the incubation time with wortmannin was extended to 2 h. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5. In HA-GLUT4-transfected basal rat adipose cells, the amount of recombinant glucose transporter present on the cell surface increased 2.5-fold over 2 h of cell culture (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, a 3.5-fold increase in basal HA-GLUT4 levels was observed in dynamin-K44A-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B). In insulin-stimulated cells expressing HA-GLUT4 only, cell surface glucose transporters doubled within 2 h of incubation (Fig. 5 C). The addition of wortmannin to the latter cells leads to a decrease in cell surface HA-GLUT4 as described before (Fig. 3). In contrast, the addition of wortmannin to basal cells did not affect the protein synthesis-dependent increase in cell surface HA-GLUT4 either in the absence or presence of dynamin-K44A expression (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). Thus, whereas wortmannin blocked GLUT4 translocation from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane, it had no effect on the observed protein synthesis-associated increase in cell surface glucose transporters. To study the subcellular trafficking of GLUT4 in an insulin target cell, we have transfected rat adipose cells with a recombinant glucose transporter containing an HA epitope tag in the first exofacial loop (30Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The HA-GLUT4 was detected on the cell surface of transfected cells by the binding of an antibody against the HA epitope. The observed insulin response of HA-GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane is markedly reduced when the amount of expression plasmid is increased and/or the time period of protein expression is extended (the latter reflecting the experimental conditions as described in the original protocol; cf. Ref. 30Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the magnitude of the insulin response is a function of the total amount of GLUT4 pr"
https://openalex.org/W2044872063,"The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays an important regulatory role in developing and adult nervous systems. With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, all of the cloned serotonin receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Subtypes 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 couple to stimulation of adenylyl cyclases through Gs and display high affinities for antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. In the brain, mRNA for 5-HT6 is found at high levels in the hippocampus, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. 5-HT7 mRNA is most abundant in the hippocampus, neocortex, and hypothalamus. To better understand how serotonin might control cAMP levels in the brain, we coexpressed 5-HT6 or 5-HT7A receptors with specific isoforms of adenylyl cyclase in HEK 293 cells. The 5-HT6receptor functioned as a typical Gs-coupled receptor in that it stimulated AC5, a Gs-sensitive adenylyl cyclase, but not AC1 or AC8, calmodulin (CaM)-stimulated adenylyl cyclases that are not activated by Gs-coupled receptors in vivo. Surprisingly, serotonin activation of 5-HT7Astimulated AC1 and AC8 by increasing intracellular Ca2+. 5-HT also increased intracellular Ca2+ in primary neuron cultures. These data define a novel mechanism for the regulation of intracellular cAMP by serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W2077760444,"The study of signaling cascades and of functional interactions between 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor pathways with heterogenous brain cell populations remains an arduous task. We took advantage of a serotonergic cell line to elucidate cross-talks between 5-HT receptors and to demonstrate the involvement of two 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in the regulation of 5-HT1B/1D function. The inducible 1C11 cell line has the unique property of acquiring within 4 days a complete serotonergic phenotype (1C11* cells), including three 5-HT receptors. 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2B receptors are expressed since day 2 of the serotonergic differentiation while 5-HT2A receptors are induced at day 4. We first established that 5-HT2B receptors are coupled with the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated release of arachidonic acid (AA) and that the activation of 5-HT2B receptors in 1C11*d2 cells inhibits the 5-HT1B/1D receptor function via a cyclooxygenase-dependent AA metabolite. At day 4, this 5-HT2B-mediated inhibition of the 5-HT1B/1D function can be blocked upon concomitant 5-HT2A activation although a 5-HT2A/PLA2 positive coupling was evidenced. This suggests the existence in 1C11*d4 cells of pathway(s) for 5-HT2A receptors, distinct from PLC and PLA2. Finally, this study reveals the antagonistic roles of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors in regulating the function of 5-HT1B/1D, a receptor involved in neuropsychiatric disorders and migraine pathogenesis.

We first established that 5-HT2B receptors are coupled with the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated release of arachidonic acid (AA) and that the activation of 5-HT2B receptors in 1C11*d2 cells inhibits the 5-HT1B/1D receptor function via a cyclooxygenase-dependent AA metabolite. At day 4, this 5-HT2B-mediated inhibition of the 5-HT1B/1D function can be blocked upon concomitant 5-HT2A activation although a 5-HT2A/PLA2 positive coupling was evidenced. This suggests the existence in 1C11*d4 cells of pathway(s) for 5-HT2A receptors, distinct from PLC and PLA2. Finally, this study reveals the antagonistic roles of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors in regulating the function of 5-HT1B/1D, a receptor involved in neuropsychiatric disorders and migraine pathogenesis. In view of the pivotal role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-CT, 5-carboxamidotryptamine; AA, arachidonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP; CCA, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DOI, (±)-1-(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane; FScA, forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation; Gi, GTP-binding protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; IP, inositol phosphates; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKC, protein kinase C; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PLC, phospolipase C. 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-CT, 5-carboxamidotryptamine; AA, arachidonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP; CCA, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DOI, (±)-1-(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane; FScA, forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation; Gi, GTP-binding protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; IP, inositol phosphates; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKC, protein kinase C; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PLC, phospolipase C. in neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, to identify the mechanisms that mediate the cellular functions controlled by 5-HT is a major challenge. To achieve this goal, the study of signaling cascades and of functional interactions between 5-HT receptor pathways with heterogenous brain cell populations still appears impractical. An alternative is to use a clonal cell line, such as 1C11, expressing a definite set of 5-HT receptors (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 1C11 clone was derived from F9 multipotential embryonal carcinoma cells through immortalization and differentiation (2Kellermann O. Kelly F. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Buc-Caron M.-H. Launay J.-M. Lamblin D. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The 1C11 clone has the properties of a neuroectodermal progenitor able to differentiate into 5-hydroxytryptaminergic cells (1C11*) by induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) and cyclohexane carboxylic acid (CCA). The switch from the undifferentiated committed 1C11 cell type to the 1C11* serotonergic cells occurs within 4 days in more than 90% of the cell population. We recently demonstrated that, in addition to the onset of 5-HT metabolism, storage, and transport, 1C11* cells also acquire 5-HT1B/1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Binding and transductional experiments excluded the functional presence of any other 5-HT receptor subtypes. On day 2 of the serotonergic differentiation, 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2B receptors became expressed and remained functional until at least day 4, at which time the 5-HT2A receptor was induced. The appearance of the latter receptor coincided with the onset of an active 5-HT transport system. This sequence of events in the inducible 1C11 cell line offers the possibility of exploring cross-talks between the signaling pathways of these three G-protein coupled receptors within a complete serotonergic phenotype. Many studies have established that 5-HT1B/1D receptors are negatively coupled with adenylate cyclase through Gi (GTP-binding protein) (4Hoyer D. Schoeffter P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 147: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Acting as terminal or somatodendritic autoreceptors, they mediate and modulate serotonergic neurotransmission (5Glennon R.A. Westkaemper R.B. Drug. News. Perspect. 1993; 6: 390-405Google Scholar). They can also function as terminal heteroreceptors by inhibiting, after agonist stimulation, the release of other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (6Raiteri M. Maura G. Bonanno G. Pittaluga A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 237: 644-648PubMed Google Scholar, 7Galloway M.P. Suchowski C.S. Keegan M.J. Hjorth S. Synapse. 1993; 15: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Iyer R.N. Bradberry C.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 40-47PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, signals interfering with the Gi-coupled 5-HT1B/1D system may act widely on neuronal responses. In addition, 5-HT1B/1D receptors are involved in cardiovascular functions, vasospasm, and migraine (9Fozard J.R. Kalkman H.O. Curr. Opin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1992; 5: 496-502PubMed Google Scholar). Because of both the pivotal role of 5-HT1B/1D receptors in neurotransmission and the clinical impact of 5-HT1B/1D receptors agonists like sumatriptan (10Branchek T. Audia J.E. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 1997; 32: 1-10Google Scholar) in the acute treatment of migraine, studying the regulatory aspects of 5-HT1B/1D receptor function is of great importance. Two distinct receptors of the 5-HT2 class are also induced during the serotonergic differentiation of 1C11 cells. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors display a strong amino acid sequence homology and share close but distinct pharmacological profiles (11Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these receptors have been described as mediating phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis through activation of phospholipase C (PLCβ). The 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) thus obtained activates PKC (12Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar), whereas inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) increases intracellular Ca2+ (13Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the 5-HT2B receptor fails to significantly stimulate PI hydrolysis in rat stomach (14Cohen M.L. Wittenauer L.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1987; 10: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as in rat vasculature (15Ellis E.S. Byrne C. Murphy O.E. Tilford N.S. Baxter G.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggests that signaling processes coupled to 5-HT2B receptors, but distinct from PLC, may also occur in vivo. Accordingly, Launay et al. (16Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.-S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have reported a 5-HT2B-dependent activation of the p21ras/MAP kinase signaling cascade. In addition, 5-HT2 receptor subtypes are found in regions of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex where 5-HT stimulates the neuronal secretion of arachidonic acid (AA) (17Pazos A. Cortes R. Palacios J.M. Brain Res. 1985; 346: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 18Felder C.C. Kanterman R.Y. Ma A.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, which is a third member of the 5-HT2 receptor family, are likely to be involved in this release because the stable transfection of CHO cell lines with the corresponding human cDNAs activates the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated AA release (19Berg K.A. Clarke W.P. Sailstad C. Saltzman A. Maayani S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 477-484PubMed Google Scholar, 20Berg K.A. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1017-1023PubMed Google Scholar). The PLA2/AA pathway could also be sensitive to 5-HT2B as indicated by the colocalization of this receptor with the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C ones in the hippocampus (21Palacios J.M. Waeber C. Hoyer D.

Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this report, we establish that the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors of 1C11*cells are coupled with a PLA2-mediated release of arachidonic acid. Moreover, activation of the 5-HT2B receptor inhibits the 5-HT1B/1D receptor function, via a cyclooxygenase dependent AA metabolite. This 5-HT2B-mediated inhibition of the 5-HT1B/1D function can be blocked by a concomitant 5-HT2A activation. Forskolin was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); myo-[3H]inositol (≈ 20.9 Ci/mmol); [14C]AA (≈ 57 mCi/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products; 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), 5-HT HCl, and DOI from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). Indomethacin came from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA); and mepacrine, melittin, and hygromycin came from Sigma. Rolipram and LY266070 were synthesized in Hoffman-La Roche AG (Basel, Switzerland) according to the procedure described by Audia et al. (24Audia J.E. Evrard D.A. Murdoch G.R. Droste J.J. Nissen J.S. Schenck K.W. Fludzinski P. Lucaites V.L. Nelson D.L. Cohen M.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2773-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) for LY266070. All tissue culture reagents and HBSS (Hanks' balanced salt solution) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other drugs and chemicals (reagent grade) were produced by Sigma. 1C11 cells were grown and induced to differentiate in the presence of 1 mm Bt2cAMP and 0.05% CCA (3Buc-Caron M.-H. Launay J.-M. Lamblin D. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Due to the sequential onset of 5-HT receptors after differentiation (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), 1C11* cells were used 2 days (1C11*d2 cells) (5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2B) or 4 days (1C11*d4 cells) (5-HT1B/1D, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2A) after addition of the inducers. Cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 5-HT-depleted fetal calf serum (10%) (16Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.-S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and 300 μg/ml hygromycin. For all experiments, cells were seeded onto 12- or 24-well tissue culture vessels at a density of 4 × 104cells/cm2. After a 24-h plating period, cells were washed with HBSS and grown for 24-h, before all experiments, in serum-free medium (DMEM/F-12 (1:1) with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 30 nm selenium, 20 nm progesterone, and 100 μm putrescine). Cells were washed twice with HBSS (with calcium and magnesium) containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and then preincubated in 500 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (wash buffer) per well for 15 min in a CO2 incubator (5% at 37 °C). Where indicated, inhibitors were added during this preincubation period. 5-HT1B/1D receptor-mediated response was followed by measuring (15 min at 37 °C) the 5-CT-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulated in the presence of 1 μm forskolin and 0.1 mmrolipram, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Cellular cAMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and normalized to protein content as determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Chichester, UK). For each experiment, data were expressed according to the response obtained with 1 μm forskolin (100%). Cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in serum-free medium for 24 h at 37 °C. Total IP (inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and IP3 are collectively referred to as IP) accumulation in response to agonist stimulation in the presence of 20 mmLiCl for 10 min at 37 °C was determined as described previously (25Berthou L. Corvaı̈a N. Geoffroy C. Mutel V. Launay J.-M. Alouf J.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 377-382PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled IP was separated according to the ion exchange method of Berridge et al. (26Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [14C] AA for 4 h at 37 °C (5% CO2). Under these conditions, more than 90% of total radioactivity was taken up by the cells. After labeling, cells were washed three times with HBSS containing calcium and magnesium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) (experimental medium). For calcium-free experiments, cells were washed with the same experimental medium without calcium. Between two washes, cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After the last wash, cells in 1 ml of experimental medium were exposed to the indicated drugs, and aliquots (100 μl) were removed after 10 min for [14C] measurement. Concentration-response data were fitted by non-linear regression to the model: R = (Rmax)/[1 + (EC50/A)n], whereE is the measured response at the given agonist concentration A, Rmax is maximal response, EC50 is the concentration of agonist producing half-maximal response, and n is the slope index. The non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test) was used for statistical comparisons. 1C11 cells were preincubated with 0.1 μCi/ml [14C]AA for 4 h, washed, and later exposed either to 5-HT or to the 5-HT2 receptor agonist (±)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI). Total [14C] released from the cells into the medium was measured after 10 min. With undifferentiated 1C11 cells, no [14C] release could be detected. In contrast, at day 2 of the serotonergic differentiation, when 5-HT2B and 5-HT1B/1D receptors had become induced, a basal level of [14C] release (48 ± 5 nm) was observed. In addition, 1C11*d2 cells released higher amounts of [14C] radioactivity in response to 5-HT or DOI (Fig. lA). As assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, [14C] AA contributes to 90% of the total [14C] release. This release increased with the drug concentration, with a maximal response to 5-HT reaching 126 ± 10% (108.5 ± 4.8 nm) above the basal release and an associated EC50 value of 1.67 μm (p EC50 = 5.78 ± 0.14; mean ± S.E., n = 4). DOI behaved as a partial agonist by eliciting a maximal response of 87 ± 9% above basal release with an EC50 value of 29 nm (pEC50 = 7.54 ± 0.12; mean ± S.E.,n = 6). These two EC50 values are similar to those previously obtained for 5-HT and DOI-mediated IP3 accumulation in 1C11*d2 cells (27Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation of 1C11*d2 cells for 10 min with 2.5 μg/ml melittin, a direct activator of PLA2 (28Clark M.A. Conway T.M. Schorr R.G.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4402-4406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the release of 14C radioactivity increased up to 252 ± 19% above the basal release (mean ± S.E., n = 4). To determine whether the observed [14C]AA release originated from activation of PLA2 or derived from the PLC/DAG lipase pathway, 14C-labeled 1C11*d2 cells were exposed for 15 min to 100 μm mepacrine, a PLA2 inhibitor, prior to the addition of agonists. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this completely inhibited the effect of up to 10 μm 5-HT on the release of [14C] radioactivity. The involvement in [14C] release of 5-HT2B receptors via PLA2 coupling could be further evinced by using DOI treatment (1 μm). DOI-mediated AA release was also fully blocked by mepacrine (Fig. lB). Mepacrine, however, had no significant effect on DOI-mediated PI hydrolysis. Cellular IP accumulation measured after DOI treatment in the presence of 100 μm mepacrine, amounted to 124 ± 18% above the basal level (mean ± S.E.,n = 5, p > 0.05). Accumulation was very similar in the absence of mepacrine (117 ± 16%). Mepacrine alone had no effect on IP accumulation, as well as on basal AA release. Unlike phospholipase C or phospholipase D, cytosolic PLA2 requires extracellular calcium for its activity (29Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when calcium was removed from the incubation medium of 1C11*d2 cells, 5-HT-mediated AA release was reduced to 11 ± 7% above the basal level (mean ± S.E., n = 4). We verified that the basal [14C] release level was not sensitive to the deprivation of calcium. All these data indicate that the 5-HT2B receptor of 1C11*d2 cells is coupled with the cytosolic PLA2 activity. 5-HT1B/1D receptors are linked to Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (11Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar) and become expressed on day 2 of 1C11 cell differentiation (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 5-CT, as do other 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (FScA). In contrast, the addition of 5-HT2 receptor agonists had no effect on FScA as well as on the basal cAMP cellular level (27Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the IP3 content of 1C11* cells does not respond to the addition of 5-HT1B/1D agonists (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggests that the IP3 hydrolysis pathway mediated by 5-HT2B activation does not interfere with the negative coupling of adenylate cyclase with 5-HT1B/1D receptor. As shown in Fig. 2, 5-CT (5 nm) inhibits FScA by 50%. The extent of inhibition remains similar with higher 5-CT concentrations. Activation of 5-HT2B receptors by 1 μm DOI completely abolished the 5-CT-mediated inhibition of FScA (Fig. 2). This behavior could be related to PLA2 since the direct addition of melittin (2.5 μg/ml) mimicked the action of DOI on the 5-HT1B/1D receptor signaling pathway (Fig. 2). In the presence of 100 μm mepacrine, this effect of DOI was not observed any more. This indicates that the PLA2/AA signaling cascade governs the 5-HT2B-dependent inhibition of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor pathway. Since multiple pathways including cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P-450, and autooxidation (30Shimizu T. Wolfe L.S. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) may couple AA metabolism with the 5-HT1B/1D receptor response, we investigated the effect of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Addition of a 2 μm amount of this substance not only blocked the action of DOI but also enhanced the 5-CT-mediated inhibition of FScA (Fig. 2). 1C11*d2 cells were treated with either 100 μm mepacrine or 2 μm indomethacin prior to the addition of melittin (2.5 μg/ml). In both cases, the 5-CT-mediated inhibition of FScA disappeared, as observed in the presence of melittin alone. Thus, by suppressing cyclooxygenase activity, indomethacin can block the inhibition of 5-HT1B/1D function triggered by either 5-HT2B receptor stimulation or the direct activation of PLA2. These data suggest that a cyclooxygenase-dependent metabolite of AA sustains the negative regulation of the 5-HT1B/1D response by 5-HT2B receptors. Between days 2 and 4 of 1C11* differentiation, the number and the pharmacological profiles of 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2B receptors did not vary. On day 4, functional 5-HT2A receptors became induced (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, with 1C11*d4 cells, it was possible to study the combined effects of these two members of the 5-HT2 receptor class on 5-HT1B/1D receptor function and signaling. Incubation during 10 min of [14C]AA-labeled 1C11*d4 cells with 10 μm 5-HT induced a release of [14C] radioactivity equal to 204 ± 19% above the basal release (mean ± S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 3). The released radioactivity is markedly greater than that measured at day 2 (144 ± 12%) (Fig. 1). However, the release could also be fully antagonized by pretreatment with mepacrine (8 ± 9% above basal release; mean ± S.E., n = 6). According to previous reports (18Felder C.C. Kanterman R.Y. Ma A.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Berg K.A. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1017-1023PubMed Google Scholar), the larger increase in [14C] release observed at day 4 can be partly attributed to an activation of PLA2 by the newly expressed 5-HT2A receptor. A contribution of the PLC pathway may be ruled out by verifying that the pretreatment of 1C11* d4 cells with mepacrine did not change the DOI-mediated PI hydrolysis. Finally, an involvement in AA release of both 5-HT2 receptor subtypes could be firmly established by using 5-HT2 antagonists with different specificities. LY266070 (1 nm), a selective antagonist of the 5-HT2B receptor (24Audia J.E. Evrard D.A. Murdoch G.R. Droste J.J. Nissen J.S. Schenck K.W. Fludzinski P. Lucaites V.L. Nelson D.L. Cohen M.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2773-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), reduced by 52% the AA release measured at day 4, whereas it abolished PLA2 activation at day 2 by nearly 100% (Fig. 3). Ketanserin (5 nm), which has only a small effect on the 5-HT2B receptor response at day 2, reduces the [14C]AA release at day 4 by 54% (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist property of ketanserin, as already described (11Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast with the situation at day 2, addition of DOI (1 μm) at day 4 had no effect any more on the 5-CT-mediated inhibition of FScA (Fig. 4) (48 ± 5% and 47 ± 4%, in the presence or absence of DOI, respectively; mean ± S.E.,n = 4). This behavior suggests that the newly expressed 5-HT2A receptor can antagonize the negative regulation exerted by 5-HT2B on the 5-HT1B/1D function. This was reasserted because the effect of DOI on the 5-CT-mediated inhibition of FScA was restored in the presence of 5 nm ketanserin (not shown). To know whether the blocking by 5-HT2A of the 5-HT2B-dependent regulation occurred through the PLA2 pathway, 1C11* d4 cells were at first treated with melittin (2.5 μmol/ml) for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 4, this only induced a small relative decrease (16 ± 4%) of the 5-CT-mediated inhibition of FScA. In contrast, when the cells were pretreated with both melittin and DOI, the inhibition of cAMP accumulation increased by 46 ± 9% above controls (100%) (mean ± S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 4). These results strongly indicate that the 5-HT2A-mediated DOI effect can only be partly accounted for by the PLA2 signaling cascade and that additional transduction pathway(s) must also be involved in the control of 5-HT1B/1D receptor function within the 1C11 serotonergic cell line. So far, the diversity of 5-HT receptors observed in vivo or in heterogeneous primary cultures has rendered difficult the determination of their precise role in the signaling networks that mediate the 5-HT physiological functions. Consequently, most of the possible functional coupling(s) associated with one given receptor subtype could be defined only by using cDNA-transfected heterologous cell lines. With newly established neuronal cell lines expressing a definite set of receptors, studies may be carried out in conditions closer to in vivo physiological circumstances, particularly concerning active stoichiometries and pathways of G protein coupling. The 1C11 neural-like stem cell is at present a uniquein vitro clonal model able to acquire three 5-HT receptors during its serotonergic differentiation program (1Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, this model appears suitable to define the transductional pathways related to the activation of all 5-HT1B/1D, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2A receptors within the same serotonergic context. The sequential onset of these three receptors along the differentiation process makes it possible to follow the functional interaction(s) between their associated signaling cascades at day 2, when 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2B receptors are coexpressed, and at day 4, when 5-HT2A has also been induced. The in vivo signaling pathways that mediate the physiological functions of 5-HT2B receptors remain largely unknown (14Cohen M.L. Wittenauer L.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1987; 10: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,15Ellis E.S. Byrne C. Murphy O.E. Tilford N.S. Baxter G.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the PLA2/AA pathway because 5-HT was already known to stimulate the direct release of AA via 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in hippocampal neurons (18Felder C.C.

Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 117-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). As early as day 2 of the 1C11 differentiation, the activation of 5-HT2B receptors with 5-HT or DOI stimulates the release of AA. The PLA2 inhibitor mepacrine completely inhibits this behavior while having no effect on the 5-HT2B-mediated PI hydrolysis (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the 5-HT2B receptor-mediated AA release observed here may be responsible for the direct activation of the PLA2 activity and does not derive from the phospholipase C- or D-induced PLA2 activation. Indeed, it was totally dependent on extracellular calcium. Thus, inside the 1C11* cells, in addition to its role in activation of PI hydrolysis (27Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar), p21ras/MAP kinase signaling (16Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.-S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol.

Launay, unpublished data. the 5-HT2B receptor can also control AA release through the activation of PLA2. All members of the 5-HT2 receptor family have been detected in those regions of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus where 5-HT stimulates the release of AA (17Pazos A. Cortes R. Palacios J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2095238965,"A 150-kDa transferrin-like protein (Ttf) is associated with the plasma membrane of the halotolerant unicellular alga Dunaliella salina (Fisher, M., Gokhman, I., Pick, U., and Zamir, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1565–1570). The Ttf level rises with medium salinity or upon iron depletion. Evidence that Ttf is involved in iron uptake by Dunaliellais presented here. Algal iron uptake exhibits characteristics resembling those of animal transferrins: high specificity and affinity for Fe3+ ions, strict dependence on carbonate/bicarbonate ions, and very low activity in acidic pH. Reducing the level of Ttf by mild proteolysis of whole cells is accompanied by lowered uptake activity. Conversely, accumulation of high levels of Ttf is correlated with an enhancement of iron uptake. Kinetically, iron uptake consists of two steps: an energy-independent binding of iron to the cell surface and an energy-dependent internalization. Salinities as high as 3.5 m NaCl do not inhibit iron uptake or decrease the apparent affinity for Fe3+ ions, implying that Ttf activity is not affected by high salt. These results indicate that transferrins, hitherto identified only in animals, are present and function in iron transport also in plant systems. A 150-kDa transferrin-like protein (Ttf) is associated with the plasma membrane of the halotolerant unicellular alga Dunaliella salina (Fisher, M., Gokhman, I., Pick, U., and Zamir, A. (1997) J.

These results indicate that transferrins, hitherto identified only in animals, are present and function in iron transport also in plant systems. Transferrins are the universal iron-carrier proteins in animal cells and function in binding, mobilizing, and delivering ferric ions (1Welch S. Transferrin: The Iron Carrier. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). However, until recently no eukaryotic type transferrin has been detected outside the animal kingdom. Typical animal transferrins, are ∼80-kDa soluble proteins consisting of two internal repeats, each forming an iron binding lobe. Serum transferrin transports Fe3+ ions into target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Another class of transferrins, exemplified by human melanotransferrin, p97, is attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor and plays a role in receptor-independent iron uptake (2Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the identification of a transferrin-like protein in the unicellular green alga Dunaliella salina (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Algae belonging to the genus Dunaliella are outstanding in their ability to proliferate in extremely varied salinities, up to saturated NaCl. In a search for salt-induced proteins, we identified a plasma membrane-associated 150-kDa protein, p150, whose level rises with external salinity. Based on its cDNA-deduced sequence, p150 is a transferrin-like protein distinct from other transferrins in containing three rather than two internal repeats. Reflecting its unique structure, p150 was designated Ttf, for triplicatedtransferrin. That the function of Ttf could be related to iron metabolism was first indicated by the accumulation of the protein in cells grown in iron-deficient media as well as thein vivo labeling of the protein with 59Fe (4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we proposed that Ttf acted in algal iron uptake and, furthermore, that its induction permitted the cells to overcome a limitation in iron availability brought about by high salinity. The present study examines the role of Ttf in iron acquisition by measurements of 59Fe uptake into D. salinacells. The uptake characteristics exhibit features of iron binding to transferrins in general, and of melanotransferrin-mediated uptake in particular. These results are intriguing, since there have been no previous indications for the presence of transferrins or their involvement in iron acquisition in plants and algae. The origin and growth conditions of D. salina were as described (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Fisher M. Gokhman I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17718-17723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The media contained 0.5 or 3.5 m NaCl. To deplete iron, the cells were incubated in a medium without Fe3+-EDTA (4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). D. salina cells were grown to a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml and harvested by centrifugation. The freshly harvested cells were suspended in the same medium they were grown in, but without Fe-EDTA, and preincubated in the light (40 W m−2) at 23 °C for 10–15 min. The iron uptake assay was initiated by the addition of59Fe3+-citrate (prepared by mixing 10 mm sodium citrate with 30–100 μm59FeCl3 in 0.1 n HCl, followed by neutralization with Tris base) to a final concentration of 3–10 μm59Fe3+ and 1 mmsodium citrate. The final cell density in the assay was 108cells/ml. At the indicated times, aliquots of 0.1 ml were removed into 2 ml of ice cold stop solution. The stop solution used for cells grown in 0.5 m NaCl contained 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm Na-EDTA and 20 mmNa-MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; SF-6847, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidenemalonitrile; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. pH 5.5; the stop solution for cells grown in 3.5 m NaCl contained 3.5m NaCl (or 0.35 m NaCl together with 4.1m glycerol), 10 mm Na-EDTA and 50 mm Na-MES, pH 6.0. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 3 min at 5000 × g, washed once in stop solution, and counted in a γ-counter. Iron binding was measured under the same conditions except that the incubation was carried out in complete darkness at 1 °C, the cell aliquots removed contained 2 × 107 cells, and the stop solution contained no Na-EDTA. (Uptake and binding assays were adapted from studies of melanotransferrin-mediated iron uptake in animal cells (2Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). Cells were digested with 2 mg/ml Pronase for 1 h at 30 °C essentially as described (4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis with anti-Ttf antibodies was carried out as described previously (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ATP content was analyzed by the luciferase assay in a Lumac 3M photon counter. Iron uptake activity of D. salina cells was measured by following the accumulation of 59Fe from59Fe3+-citrate in standard growth media containing different concentrations of NaCl. The time course and temperature dependence of iron uptake at 0.5 m NaCl are shown in Fig. 1 A. At 24 °C, iron accumulation proceeded for 2–3 h and reached a level of ∼6 nmol/109 cells. Very little accumulation occurred at 1 °C, indicating that the uptake was temperature-dependent. The accumulated iron was not lost when the cells were treated with Pronase (see below) or when a large excess of nonradioactive iron was included in the stop solution (data not shown). These observations support the conclusion that the iron had been internalized. To determine the dependence on Fe3+concentration, iron-citrate in the medium was varied from 0.2 to 4 μm (Fig. 1 B). iron uptake saturated at ∼4 nmol/109 cells. The apparent Km for iron-citrate, calculated from an Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 1 B, inset), is 0.6 μm. Analysis of the effect of pH on iron uptake (Fig. 1 C) indicated a broad pH optimum peaking at approximately pH 8.0 and sharply dropping below pH 7.0. The specificity of the uptake system for Fe3+ ions was tested in a competition experiment, whereby Me2+ or Me3+ ions in 100-fold excess over Fe3+ were added as citrate complexes to the uptake medium (TableI). None of the tested metal ions effectively inhibited iron uptake, suggesting a very high selectivity of the transport system for Fe3+ ions. The specificity for Fe3+ over Fe2+ was indicated in uptake assays conducted in the presence of a synthetic chelator preferably chelating Fe2+ (bathophenantroline disulfate) or Fe3+(synthetic trisoxamides). At 10 μm chelator, the uptake was >90% inhibited by Fe3+ chelators but only 5% inhibited by Fe2+ chelators (data not shown). These results indicate a strong preference of the uptake system for Fe3+over Fe2+ ions.Table ICompetition of different metal ions with Fe3+Metal ionIron uptake (percentage of control)%None100 ± 11Cu2+137 ± 25Zn2+81 ± 16Mn2+79 ± 14Cd2+83 ± 18Cr3+112 ± 14Al3+117 ± 9Tb3+92 ± 10Metal ions were added as citrate complexes to final concentrations of 100 μm metal and 1 mm citrate. Fe3+concentration in all samples was 1 μm Open table in a new tab Metal ions were added as citrate complexes to final concentrations of 100 μm metal and 1 mm citrate. Fe3+concentration in all samples was 1 μm Binding of Fe3+ ions to animal transferrins requires, and occurs synergistically with, binding of bicarbonate/carbonate ions. If Ttf plays a role in iron uptake in Dunaliella, one expects the uptake activity to depend on carbonate/bicarbonate ions. To examine this possibility, the uptake medium was first extensively depleted of CO2 and then supplemented with varying concentrations of bicarbonate. The results (Fig. 2 A) clearly indicate a strict dependence of iron uptake on added bicarbonate ions. The specificity for bicarbonate/carbonate was tested by comparison with several other anions. Only oxalate was found to partially substitute for bicarbonate/carbonate in stimulating iron uptake (Fig. 2 B). In order to gain further insights into the uptake mechanism, a distinction was made between iron bound to the cell surface and intracellular iron. The total amount of 59Fe in both compartments was estimated by stopping the uptake assay with an isotonic solution devoid of EDTA. The difference between this value and the internalized (EDTA-resistant) radioactivity provided an estimate of the externally bound iron. An analysis of the effect of temperature was performed with cells incubated with Fe3+ for 50 min at 1 °C in the dark and subsequently transferred to 24 °C in the light (Fig. 3 A). The results indicate a relatively rapid binding of 59Fe in the cold, which remained practically unaltered after transfer to 24 °C. A rather different course was observed for iron internalization; it was barely evident in the cold and started only after transfer to 24 °C, finally reaching a level severalfold higher than the amount bound at any given time. To test whether iron binding precedes uptake, cells were first incubated with 59Fe at 1 °C in the dark for 1 h, and unbound iron was removed by washing with an isotonic solution devoid of Na-EDTA. The cell suspension was subsequently incubated at 24 °C in the light. The results (Fig. 3 B) indicate that all of the 59Fe bound in the first step is internalized in the second step. No internalization is evident when the suspension is left in the cold. Further evidence that iron binding is part of the uptake pathway was provided by comparing the effect of several parameters on binding and uptake. The results (Table II) indicate that both activities show a similar requirement for carbonate/bicarbonate and respond similarly to changes in pH. Periodate anions, previously reported to inhibit iron binding to transferrins (6Azari P. Phillips J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 138: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), also inhibited both iron binding and uptake inDunaliella. Binding and uptake also show similarKm values for iron-citrate.Table IICharacteristics of iron binding and iron uptakeAssay conditionPercentage of controlIron bindingIron uptake%pH 6.016 ± 79 ± 5pH 7.0100 ± 21100 ± 11pH 8.0175 ± 30141 ± 15Without bicarbonate24 ± 1210 ± 8With KIO432 ± 1051 ± 19Km for iron-citrateIron bindingIron uptakeμmKm0.3 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.2Iron binding and iron uptake were measured as described under “Materials and Methods” at the indicated conditions.

Control activities were 380 pmol/109 cells and 3.2 nmol/109 cells/h for iron binding and iron uptake, respectively. The results described above pointed to an obligatory energy requirement of the internalization but not the binding step. To further examine this issue, we tested the effect of metabolic inhibitors on the binding and internalization steps. Treatment of cells with the protonophore SF-6847 or with iodoacetamide and cyanide (glycolytic and respiratory inhibitors, respectively), which drastically decrease the cellular ATP level, inhibited uptake and internalization but not binding of Fe3+ ions (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, incubation in the dark lowered both the ATP level and internalization by 20–60% (not shown). These results support the conclusion that Fe3+ internalization, but not binding, is energy-dependent. Iron uptake and binding activities were compared in cells containing variable levels of Ttf. Cells were induced to accumulate the protein by high salinity or iron depletion (3Sadka A. Himmelhoch S. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, cells grown in the absence of added iron in a medium with 0.5 m NaCl, or in 3.5 mNaCl in the presence of Fe-EDTA were 50% or 100% more active, respectively, in iron uptake than cells grown in 0.5 m NaCl in the presence of iron (Fig. 4, top). The corresponding levels of Ttf increased by about 2- or 3-fold, respectively, compared with control cells (bottom). Iron binding activity at 1 °C increased by 5–6-fold in the high salt-grown and iron-depleted cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 5). These results indicated a general correspondence between the increase in Ttf level and iron uptake and binding activities.Figure 5Effect of growth in high salinity and in iron-deficient medium on iron binding. Cell cultures in iron-sufficient (C) or iron-deficient 0.5 m NaCl media (−Fe) or in a 3.5 m NaCl medium were analyzed for iron binding. Means of two (−Fe; 3.5m NaCl, S.D. < 0.6 nmol/109 cells) or four (control, S.D. < 0.1 nmol/109 cells) measurements are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test the correlation between Ttf and iron uptake, cells were subjected to proteolytic digestion under conditions that removed Ttf without disrupting cell integrity. Preincubation with Pronase prior to the uptake assay brought about partial digestion of Ttf and a concomitant reduction in uptake activity (Fig. 6 A). Conversely, when Pronase treatment followed the uptake assay, no reduction in internalized iron level was evident (Fig. 6 B). We previously proposed that Ttf accumulated in high salinity in response to restricted iron availability under these conditions (4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Iron limitation could arise, for example, from salt inhibition of Ttf-mediated iron uptake or from a reduction in Fe3+ ion solubility in high salt. In order to examine whether high salt directly limited iron availability, a medium with 3.5 m NaCl was supplemented with 100 μm Fe3+-citrate. Cells grown in this medium were compared with cells grown with in the same salinity but with the standard 2 μm Fe-EDTA. Cells grown in the iron-enriched medium contained a considerably lower level of Ttf as compared with cells grown in standard medium or a medium supplemented only with citrate (Fig. 7). These results imply that high salinity per se does not trigger Ttf accumulation but exerts its effect indirectly by lowering iron availability. A direct examination of the effect of salt on iron uptake/binding was carried out by varying the salt concentration in the assay medium. The analysis was performed with cells grown in 3.5 m NaCl in standard medium. The assays were conducted in media where the NaCl was gradually replaced by osmotically equivalent glycerol. The isoosmotic mixtures compared varied in salinity between 0.35 m NaCl (with 4.1 m glycerol) and 3.5 m NaCl (no glycerol). The kinetics of iron binding and uptake in four different NaCl/glycerol mixtures shows that salt reduces the rate of iron binding at low temperature but does not significantly decrease its extent (Fig. 8 A). Conversely, the rate of iron uptake at 24 °C is not affected at all by high salt (Fig. 8 B). The affinity for iron ions is also hardly affected by high salt. The apparent Km for iron-citrate in 3.5m NaCl salt is 0.19 μm compared with 0.23 μm in 0.35 m NaCl. The correspondingVmax values are also quite similar (11.7 and 9.8 nmol Fe/109 cells/h, respectively; not shown). These results show that high salt does not interfere with the binding and internalization of Fe3+ ions by Dunaliellacells. Hence, the activity of Ttf is probably insensitive to high salt concentrations. Iron uptake in Dunaliella exhibits kinetic and specificity characteristics typical to transferrins, in general, and to melanotransferrin, in particular. The apparent Kmfor iron-citrate, 0.2–0.6 μm, corresponds to a calculated free Fe3+ concentration of 2.3 × 10−19m: [Fe3+]free= 3.8 × 10−13 [Fe]total at pH 7.4 (7Martin R.B. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1986; 28: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Such high affinity combined with a high selectivity for Fe3+ ions over Fe2+ and other transition metal ions is characteristic for soluble animal transferrins (1Welch S. Transferrin: The Iron Carrier. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). The calculated Vmax and Km (for iron-citrate) for iron uptake in Dunaliella, 15,000–30,000 iron ions/cell/min and 0.6 μm, respectively, are comparable with corresponding values of 60,000 Fe/cell/min and 2.6 μm for melanotransferrin-mediated uptake measured in Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing melanotransferrin (2Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Strict dependence on the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate is a hallmark of iron binding to transferrins. The selectivity for these anions exhibited by the algal uptake system also closely resembles that of mammalian Tfs (8Schlabach M.R. Bates G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2182-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sharp drop in iron binding/uptake at acidic pH and the inhibition of iron binding and uptake by periodate are also characteristic of mammalian Tfs (6Azari P. Phillips J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 138: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Chasteen N.D. Williams J. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, algal iron binding and uptake activities are correlated with the cellular level of Ttf. These results clearly point to the involvement of Ttf in iron uptake byDunaliella. The Ttf-mediated uptake of iron is initiated by its binding to extracellular sites, most likely on Ttf, followed by internalization. The sensitivity of iron internalization to temperature and to metabolic inhibitors indicates that the internalization of iron ions is an energy-requiring process. Internalization is the rate-limiting step in iron uptake; even at 1 °C, iron binding is faster than internalization. A similar general pathway has been proposed for melanotransferrin (2Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The observation that an increase in available iron supply diminishes the accumulation of Ttf in high salt-grown cells complements the earlier observation of Ttf accumulation in iron-deficient cells. Together these results further support the conclusion that high salinity limits iron availability to the cells. The mechanism by which high salt interferes with iron availability in standard media is still unclear. We have previously proposed that salt may decrease iron solubility or affect the activity of the uptake machinery (4Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The latter possibility is largely eliminated by the present results indicating that high salt affects neither the affinity nor the rate of iron uptake. Hence, high salt does not significantly restrict iron association with Ttf, except for the minor decrease in the rate of iron binding at low temperature. The observation that salt affects iron binding but not iron uptake is consistent with the idea that the binding step is not a rate-limiting step in iron uptake. These results bear several important implications concerning the role of Ttf particularly under iron-limiting conditions. Under such conditions, the extremely high affinity for iron ions and the high accumulation capacity (∼3 nmol of iron/109 cells, equivalent to ∼2 × 106 iron ions/cell) ensure efficient iron binding and acquisition even at extremely low iron concentrations. The fact that iron binding and uptake in Dunaliella are hardly affected by high salt is of crucial importance for an organism thriving over practically the entire range of salt concentrations. In its apparent salt tolerance, Ttf differs from animal transferrins, in which salt alters the properties of iron binding (11Chasteen N.D. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1983; 5: 210-233Google Scholar, 12Egan T.J. Ross D.C. Purves L.R. Adams P.A. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 31: 1994-1998Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Zak O. Aisen P. Crawley J.B. Joannou C.L. Patel K.J. Rafiq M. Evans R.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14428-14434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proteins similar to Ttf may exist and function in iron uptake in other algae. A detailed kinetic characterization of iron uptake in two coastal phytoplanktons (10Hudson R.J.M. Morel F.M.M. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1990; 35: 1002-1020Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar) revealed similar affinity, specificity, and energetic requirements to those of Ttf-catalyzed iron uptake inDunaliella. Moreover, screening with anti-Ttf antibodies revealed a cross-reacting protein of ∼120 kDa in the microalgaNanochloropsis and a ∼100-kDa cross-reacting protein in the macroalga Ulva (data not shown). Thus, transferrin-like proteins may participate in a ubiquitous mechanism of iron uptake in algae. The results presented here bear special significance in view of the fact that iron availability is a critical limiting factor for marine phytoplankton photosynthesis in oceans and hence global biomass productivity (14Martin J.H. Fitzwater S.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 341-343Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 15Kolber Z.S. Barber R.T. Coale K.H. Fitzwater S.E. Greene R.M. Johnson K.S. Lindley S. Falkowsky P.G. Nature. 1994; 371: 145-149Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intriguing similarity between Ttf and melanotransferrin-mediated iron uptake in animal cells suggests the operation of an evolutionarily conserved pathway. The elucidation of the algal mechanism may therefore shed light on the mechanism of action of membrane-anchored transferrins in general. We thank Dr. A. Katz, M. Weiss, and M.

https://openalex.org/W1973309410,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E2 is often associated with low levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high levels of plasma triglycerides in humans. Mice expressing apoE2 also have low LDL levels. To evaluate the possible role of the LDL receptor in the cholesterol-lowering effect of apoE2, we bred transgenic mice expressing low levels of apoE2 with LDL receptor-null mice (hE2+/0,LDLR−/−). Even in the absence of the LDL receptor, plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels decreased progressively with increasing levels of plasma apoE2. At plasma apoE2 levels >20 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol was ∼45% lower than in LDLR−/− mice. Thus, the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of apoE2 is independent of the LDL receptor. In contrast, plasma triglyceride levels increased (mostly in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL)) progressively as apoE2 levels increased. At plasma apoE2 levels >20 mg/dl, triglycerides were ∼150% higher than in LDLR−/− mice. Furthermore, in apoE-null mice (hE2+/0, mE−/−), apoE2 levels also correlated positively with plasma triglyceride levels, suggesting impaired lipolysis in both hE2+/0,LDLR−/− and hE2+/0,mE−/− mice. Incubating VLDL or IDL from the hE2+/0,LDLR−/− or the hE2+/0,mE−/− mice with mouse postheparin plasma inhibited lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis of apoE2-containing VLDL and IDL by ∼80 and ∼70%, respectively,versus normal VLDL and IDL. This observation was confirmed by studies with triglyceride-rich emulsion particles, apoE2, and purified lipoprotein lipase. Furthermore, apoE2-containing VLDL had much less apoC-II than normal VLDL. Adding apoC-II to the incubation partially corrected the apoE2-impaired lipolysis in apoE2-containing VLDL or IDL and corrected it completely in apoE2-containing emulsion particles. Thus, apoE2 lowers LDL cholesterol by impairing lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (mostly by displacing or masking apoC-II). Furthermore, the effects of apoE2 on both plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are dose dependent and act via different mechanisms. The increase in plasma cholesterol caused by apoE2 is due mostly to impaired clearance, whereas the increase in plasma triglycerides is caused mainly by apoE2-impaired lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

E polymorphism is one of the common genetic factors responsible for interindividual differences in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in humans. The majority of apoE2 homozygotes, who do not display overt type III hyperlipoproteinemia, have lower plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apoB levels but higher plasma triglyceride and apoE levels than apoE3 homozygotes. In contrast, apoE4 is associated with higher plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB levels but lower apoE levels (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

In contrast, apoE2 seems to reduce the risk for coronary heart disease, probably due to lower plasma and LDL cholesterol levels, but only in subjects without type III hyperlipoproteinemia (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar, 4Davignon J. Gregg R.E.

Those apoE2 homozygotes who develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia because of secondary precipitating factors are at increased risk for both coronary and peripheral artery atherosclerosis (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar). Although the cholesterol-lowering effect of apoE2 has been confirmed in several populations, the mechanism is not completely understood. One hypothesis is that defective LDL receptor binding of apoE2 lowers the transport of cholesterol-rich remnant particles into the liver, up-regulating hepatic LDL receptors and thereby accelerating the clearance of plasma LDL (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar, 4Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, some experimental evidence shows that the number of hepatic LDL receptors is not increased in either human apoE2 (hE2) transgenic rabbits or apoE-null (mE−/−) mice (12Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22685-22694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Woollett L.A. Osono Y. Herz J. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12500-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is that apoE2-containing very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) compete poorly with apoB-containing LDL for binding to the hepatic LDL receptor, speeding LDL clearance (13Woollett L.A. Osono Y. Herz J. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12500-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and thereby decreasing plasma LDL. A third hypothesis is that apoE2 impairs lipolytic conversion of VLDL to LDL (14Chait A. Brunzell J.D. Albers J.J. Hazzard W.R. Lancet. 1977; 1: 1176-1178Abstract PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Chait A. Hazzard W.R. Albers J.J. Kushwaha R.P. Brunzell J.D.

Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1148-1159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps by directly inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity (16Ehnholm C. Mahley R.W. Chappell D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Ludwig E. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5566-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, we generated apoE2 transgenic mice in which moderate expression of apoE2 (10–30 mg/dl) on the wild-type mouse background produced a hypolipidemic phenotype, somewhat mimicking the hypocholesterolemia in humans with apoE2; lower expression of apoE2 (<10 mg/dl) did not alter plasma lipid levels significantly (18Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crossing hypolipidemic apoE2 mice (apoE2 ∼20 mg/dl) with LDL receptor-null (LDLR−/−) mice resulted in a typical type III hyperlipoproteinemic phenotype, characterized by increased levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides and by the accumulation of both apoE2 (50–60 mg/dl) and β-VLDL in plasma (19Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that low LDL receptor number is one genetic factor responsible for converting apoE2-induced hypolipidemia into an overt type III hyperlipoproteinemic phenotype. Furthermore, the LDL cholesterol levels were lower in the LDLR−/− mice expressing apoE2 than in the LDLR−/− mice, suggesting that the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of apoE2 might occur even in the absence of the LDL receptor (19Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, this latter conclusion was tenuous because of the marked increase in remnants and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) in these mice. In the present study, we evaluated in detail the potential role of the LDL receptor in apoE2-induced low LDL cholesterol by crossing transgenic mice expressing low levels of apoE2 (2–10 mg/dl) with LDLR−/− mice. Our data demonstrate that apoE2 consistently lowered the LDL cholesterol level in the absence of the LDL receptor. In vitro lipolytic studies indicated that low LDL cholesterol is caused by impairment of LPL-mediated lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Furthermore, data obtained from hE2+/0,mE−/− mice demonstrated that the effects of apoE2 on plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are dose dependent and act via different mechanisms. A Superose 6 column, purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden), was used on a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. Centricon concentration filters were from Amicon (Lexington, MA). Cholesterol and triglyceride standards were from Abbott (North Chicago, IL) and Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN), respectively. An automated system (Kinetic Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) was used for lipid analysis. Bovine milk LPL was from Sigma. Human apoC-II was provided by Dr. Karl H. Weisgraber (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA). The LFS Lipogel assay kit was from Zaxis (Hudson, OH). All reagents for lipoprotein-agarose gels were from Ciba Corning (Palo Alto, CA). The ECL chemiluminescence detection kit for Western blots was from Amersham Life Science (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Hemizygous human apoE2 transgenic mice with endogenous mouse apoE (hE2+/0, ICR strain) were produced previously in our laboratory (18Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). LDLR−/− and mE−/− mice (both C57BL/6 strain) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Female apoE2 mice from three low-expressing lines (apoE2 = 2, 5, and 10 mg/dl) were crossed with male LDLR−/− mice. The resulting obligate heterozygotes (LDLR+/−) expressing apoE2 (hE2+/0, LDLR/−) were then crossed with LDLR−/− mice to yield apoE2 transgenic mice lacking LDL receptors (hE2+/0,LDLR−/−). Thus, the genetic background of these mice was 75% C57BL/6 and 25% ICR. To create apoE2 transgenic mice without endogenous mouse apoE (hE2+/0,mE−/−), female apoE2 mice from three different lines (apoE2 = 2, 10, and 20 mg/dl) were crossed with male mE−/− mice. The resulting obligate heterozygotes (mE+/−) expressing apoE2 (hE2+/0,mE+/−) were then crossed with mE−/− mice to yield apoE2 transgenic mice without mouse apoE (hE2+/0,mE−/−). Thus, the genetic background of the mice was also 75% C57BL/6 and 25% ICR. The human apoE2 transgene was identified by immunoblotting of 1 μl of plasma with human-specific anti-apoE antiserum (18Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6941-6945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Western blot assay, human apoE2 was semiquantitated by comparing the densitometry readings of the sample bands with those of different concentrations of purified human apoE2. LDL receptor deficiency was assessed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers designed according to the knockout gene construct. Mouse apoE deficiency was assessed by Western blotting with mouse-specific anti-apoE antiserum (19Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Committee on Animal Research, University of California, San Francisco. Blood was collected from the tails of 8–12-week-old mice that had been fasted for 5 h. EDTA was used as anticoagulant (final concentration, 10 mm). Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (microcentrifuge) for 10 min at 4 °C, and samples were stored for no more than 3 days at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as a protease inhibitor. Cholesterol and triglycerides were measured on total plasma and on chromatographic fractions by an enzymatic colorimetric method adapted for use with a microplate reader (21Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Ji Z.-S. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Horie Y. Fazio S. Westerlund J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins in 100 μl of plasma were separated by chromatography on a Superose 6 column, as described previously (18Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major lipoprotein classes eluted from the column were pooled and concentrated with Centricon filters (fractions 16–18, VLDL; fractions 19–22, IDL; fractions 23–27, LDL and a subclass of high density lipoproteins (HDL1); and fractions 28–33, HDL). For agarose gel electrophoresis, 2-μl aliquots of concentrated lipoproteins were run on precast agarose gels (1%) for 45 min at 90 V. The gels were dried and stained with Fat Red 7B. In some cases, to analyze the distribution of apoE2 in various lipoproteins, the pooled samples representing different lipoprotein classes were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel followed by immunoblotting with anti-human apoE antiserum. For analysis of chemical compositions and lipolysis of VLDL, the VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) were isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation at 98,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge (23de Silva H.V. Más-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins were separated on 3–20% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient gels. The amounts of human apoE2, mouse apoE, or mouse apoC-II were determined by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against human apoE, mouse apoE, or mouse apoC-II, respectively. Purified human apoE2, mouse apoE, and mouse apoC-II were used as standards, respectively. Alternatively, lipoproteins in 8 μl of plasma were separated by LFS Lipogel electrophoresis (Zaxis, Hudson, OH), fractionated according to their particle size in a 0.5–30% polyacrylamide gradient gel, and stained for cholesterol. The distribution of cholesterol in various lipoproteins was determined by densitometry at 600 nm. The cholesterol levels in various lipoproteins were calculated from the plasma total cholesterol determined by an enzymatic colorimetric method. For five normal human plasma standards, the intra-assay coefficients of variation were 9.8, 5.3, and 6.4% for VLDL/IDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, respectively; the inter-assay coefficients of variation were 14.2, 7.1, and 8.3%, respectively. To determine the ability of normal and apoE2 VLDL to serve as substrates for lipase-mediated lipolysis, 30 μg of VLDL or IDL triglyceride was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μl of VLDL-depleted postheparin mouse plasma, which was collected from normal mice 10 min after intravenous injection of heparin (50 units/kg). The incubation was performed in the presence of 1.2 m NaCl (to measure hepatic lipase) or in its absence (to measure total lipolytic activity). In some cases, specific amounts of purified human apoC-II were included in the incubation. After incubation, the levels of released free fatty acids were determined by an enzymatic colorimetric method (24Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Vezina C. Hegele R.A. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20554-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). The LPL-mediated lipolysis was calculated as the difference between total lipolysis and hepatic lipase-mediated lipolysis (25Iverius P.-H. Lindahl U. Egelrud T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The triglyceride-rich emulsion particles were prepared as described previously (26Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D.

The pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmEDTA and 100 mm KCl and then sonicated. The resulting emulsion particles were similar in size to native human VLDL (27Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27063-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of apoE2 on LPL-mediated lipolysis, the triglyceride-rich emulsion particles (50 μl) were incubated at 37 °C first with 4 μg of human apoC-II for 30 min and then with different amounts of apoE2 and 0.5 μg of bovine milk LPL (Sigma) for 30 min. To determine the effect of apoC-II on LPL-mediated lipolysis, the triglyceride-rich emulsion particles (50 μl) were incubated at 37 °C first with 4 μg of human apoE2 for 30 min and then with different amounts of apoC-II and 0.5 μg of bovine milk LPL (Sigma) for 30 min. After incubation, the lipolytic activity was determined as described above. Mean lipid levels are reported as the mean ± S.D. Differences in lipid levels were evaluated byt test. Correlations of plasma apoE2 and lipid levels were assessed by regression analysis. To generate LDLR−/−mice expressing different levels of apoE2, we mated LDLR−/− mice with three mice expressing low levels of apoE2. Table I summarizes the plasma levels of lipids and lipoproteins in hE2+/0,LDLR−/− and hE20/0,LDLR−/− mice. As reported previously (30Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar), both male and female LDLR−/− mice had significant hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol levels about double those of nontransgenic controls) and slightly increased triglyceride levels (25% higher than in nontransgenic controls) (data not shown for nontransgenic mice). Gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Fig. 1 A) and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) demonstrated that the hypercholesterolemia in the LDLR−/− mice was due mainly to an accumulation of LDL cholesterol.Table IPlasma levels (mg/dl) of lipids and lipoproteins in LDLR−/−mice expressing different levels of apoE2hE20/0,LDLR−/−hE2+/0,LDLR−/−hE2 < 10 mg/dlhE2 < 10–20 mg/dlhE2 > 20 mg/dlMale n811116 ApoE206 ± 215 ± 327 ± 5 TC219 ± 13199 ± 19ap < 0.05 versushE20/0,LDLR−/− mice.189 ± 12bp < 0.001 versushE20/0,LDLR−/− mice.176 ± 6bp < 0.001 versushE20/0,LDLR−/− mice.

Differences were evaluated by t test. The hE2+/0,LDLR−/− mice expressing apoE2 at <10 mg/dl had lower total cholesterol (9 and 7% for males and females, respectively) than hE20/0,LDLR−/−mice (Table I). The decrease was due to reductions of about 15% in both LDL and HDL cholesterol, which were partially offset by an increase in VLDL/IDL cholesterol (males, 39%; females, 30%) (Table I, Fig. 1 B, and Fig. 2). Plasma triglyceride levels were higher in both males (32%) and females (42%) than in hE20/0,LDLR−/− mice (Table I). Mice expressing apoE2 at 10–20 mg/dl had a greater decrease in total cholesterol (14 and 13% for males and females, respectively) than hE20/0,LDLR−/− mice (Table I). Again, the decrease was due to reductions of both LDL (males, 32%; females, 29%) and HDL (males, 24%; females, 19%) cholesterol; however, the hE2+/0,LDLR−/− mice had higher VLDL/IDL cholesterol (males, 64%; females, 40%) (Table I, Fig. 1 C, and Fig. 2). Plasma triglyceride levels were increased significantly in both male (62%) and female (85%) mice (Table I), and triglyceride-enriched LDL appeared (Fig. 1 C). Mice expressing apoE2 at more than 20 mg/dl had an even greater decrease in total cholesterol (males, 20%; females, 17%) but more severe hypertriglyceridemia (males, 131%; females, 167%) than hE20/0, LDLR−/− mice (Table I). Their LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were about half of those in hE20/0,LDLR−/− mice (Table I); most significantly, the distribution of plasma cholesterol was shifted predominantly to VLDL/IDL fractions (Fig. 1 D and Fig. 2). Thus, in general, there was a strong negative correlation between plasma apoE2 concentrations and plasma total cholesterol levels (males,r = −0.81, p < 0.001; females,r = −0.87, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, there was a negative correlation between apoE2 and LDL cholesterol (males,r = −0.89, p < 0.001; females,r = −0.92, p < 0.001) or HDL cholesterol (males, r = −0.72, p < 0.001; females, r = −0.81, p < 0.001) (data not shown). On the other hand, there was a strong positive correlation between plasma apoE2 concentrations and VLDL/IDL cholesterol (males, r = 0.68, p < 0.001; females, r = 0.78, p < 0.001) and plasma triglyceride levels (males, r = 0.74,p < 0.001; females, r = 0.84,p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 B). We have previously shown that hE2+/0,LDLR−/− mice expressing 50–60 mg/dl apoE2 have a hypercholesterolemia characterized by a marked increase in β-VLDL (19Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W.

A differential display polymerase chain reaction was employed to evaluate mRNA expression differences between the LNCaP sublines in order to define the differences in gene expression between the androgen-sensitive, nontumorigenic LNCaP cell line and the androgen-insensitive, metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. An amplicon, BG16.21, was isolated that showed increased expression in the androgen-independent and metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B.

An experimental model system to study advanced and metastatic prostate cancer has been developed based on the observation that nontumorigenic bone or prostate fibroblasts, when co-inoculated with the nontumorigenic, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 1The abbreviations used are: PSA, prostate-specific antigen; DD, differential mRNA display; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; UTR, untranslated region; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. -secreting cell line LNCaP, induced prostate adenocarcinoma growth in vivo in nude mice (1Gleave M.E.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3753-3761PubMed Google Scholar). By manipulating the androgen status of the hosts, the laboratory was able to generate various LNCaP sublines from the primary tumors (3Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E.

Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The direct lineage-related sublines C4, C4–2, and C4–2B4 share cytogenetic markers and HLA haplotype with parental LNCaP, but otherwise possess distinct biologic and biochemical profiles. Most importantly, the sublines exhibit progressive tumorigenicity, metastatic potential, and androgen independence. C4, the first subline derived from LNCaP, forms tumors in intact nude mice without the need for a co-inoculum of bone fibroblasts or Matrigel®; while growth in castrated hosts still requires a co-inducer. C4-2 is a subline derived from C4, which is highly tumorigenic in intact or castrated nude mice without a co-inducer. C4-2B4 is a bone metastatic subline derived from orthotopic injection of C4-2 and has demonstrated an increased aggressiveness as compared with C4-2. The isolation of novel prostate cancer progression related genes may lead to new prognostic markers and/or therapeutic targets. Therefore, this lineage-related progression model represented an ideal system to screen for prostate cancer progression associated genes. Differential mRNA display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) (5Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 6Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) was used to screened the LNCaP sublines for differences in gene expression. Sixty-nine amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and screened by RNA blot hybridization. One amplicon demonstrated increased expression with increasing metastatic potential in the LNCaP sublines. Screening of a cDNA library from C4-2 cells, where the amplicon expression was elevated, resulted in the isolation of clones of two lengths, ∼600 and ∼700 bp. Sequence analysis and GenBankTM homology search revealed the two genes to be related to the GAGE family of melanoma associated antigens. Herein, we report the isolation and preliminary characterization of these GAGE-related genes:PAGE-1 (prostate-associated gene), andGAGE-7. The LNCaP, C4, C4-2, and C4-2B4 cell lines were cultured in T medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum as described previously (7Chang S.M. Chung L.W. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Chung L.W.K. Chang S.M. Bell C. Zhau H.E. Ro J.Y. von Eschenbach A.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm culture dishes in a 37 °C incubator equilibrated with 5% CO2 in humidified air. DD-PCR was performed essentially as described elsewhere (5Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 6Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated from confluent cultures of the LNCaP, C4, C4-2, and C4-2B4 cell lines using RNAzolB® (TelTest Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX) based on the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). To remove genomic DNA, the 60 μg of each total RNA sample were incubated with 7.5 units of fast protein liquid chromatography-purified RNase-free DNase I (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 15 units of RNase inhibitor (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After digestion, the reaction mixture was organically extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1). A 0.2-μg aliquot of DNase I-treated RNA from each of the four cell lines was reverse transcribed. Briefly, 0.2 μg of RNA was placed in solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Pharmacia Biotech), 20 μm dNTPs (Pharmacia Biotech), 1 μm T12-MN downstream primer, where M = A, G, or C bases and N = A, G, C, and T bases (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA). The reaction was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. 30 units (1.5 ml) of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. DD-PCR reactions were then carried out. The downstream primer used was the same T12-MN primer used in the reverse transcription reaction. The upstream primer, OPA-n, was an arbitrary 10-mer with 60–70% GC base content and no self-complementarity (OPA primer set, Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA). One tenth (2 μl) of reverse transcription reaction was used for each DD-PCR reaction. Reactions were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 μmappropriate T12-MN downstream primer, 0.5 μm OPA-n upstream primer, 0.50 μm α-35S-labeled dATP (Amersham Corp.), 0.0625 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in nuclease-free water. The samples were then placed in a thermal cycler (model 2800, Perkin-Elmer) for the following profile: denature at 94 °C, 2 min; followed by 40 cycles of denature at 94 °C, 30 s; anneal at 42 °C, 2 min; and extension at 72 °C, 30 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. 4 μl of sequencing stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mmEDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol-ff) were added. The DD-PCR products were resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After drying the gel on 3-mm blotting paper, an autoradiograph was exposed for 48 h. Differentially expressed bands (amplicons) between the parental LNCaP and the C4-2 and C4-2B sublines were selected and excised. The DNA was eluted by boiling for 15 min and recovered by adjusting the sodium acetate concentration to 0.3m followed by ethanol precipitation. The amplicons were reamplified by PCR using the same primers and conditions as described for DD-PCR above, except that no radioactive label was added and the dNTP concentration was 20 μm. Successful reamplification was confirmed by running a small aliquot of the sample on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The reamplified amplicons were then cloned by the TA system into the pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Cloned amplicons and phage inserts were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52761) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Corp.). Initial cDNA characterization and translation was performed using MacVector DNA analysis software (Oxford Molecular Group, Campbell, CA). Homology search in the GenBankTM data base was carried out using the FASTA algorithm as implemented in the GCG Wisconsin version 8.01 software package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Multiple sequence alignments, DNA, and protein were made using Pileup and edited using Lineup features of the GCG Wisconsin version 8.01 software package with a weighted representation of the first methionine codon. Publication output for multiple sequence alignments was generated using ALSCRIPT (11Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Expression of novel amplicons (no match in GenBankTM) was evaluated by formaldehyde denatured RNA blotting essentially as described (12Sikes R.A. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3174-3181PubMed Google Scholar). Because DD-PCR performed as described generates a cloned cDNA fragment representing the 3′-polyadenylated end of the mRNA, the sense strand is known. Therefore, [32P]CTP-labeled antisense riboprobes of the cloned amplicons were generated from either the Sp6 or T7 transcription sites on the pCRII plasmid as appropriate. Riboprobes were generated as recommended by the manufacturer in the SP6/T7 transcription kit (Boehringer Mannheim). 5 μl of CTP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was used in the labeling reaction. For Northern blots, 30 μg of total RNA from each of the four cell lines were loaded per lane. The RNA was transferred to ZetaProbe®-charged nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by electrotransfer for 16 h at 15 mA and 4 °C in a Hoefer TE-42 transphor tank system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Blots were hybridized at 65 °C in Rapid Hyb® solution (Amersham Corp.). 1 × 106 dpm of riboprobe were added per ml of hybridization solution. Blots were hybridized overnight and washed in SSC/SDS solutions of increasing stringency as appropriate. RNase digestion (riboprobes only) of the blots was performed in order to confirm hybridization specificity and differential mRNA expression. The membranes were placed in 2× SSC containing RNase at a concentration 0.5 μg/ml. After autoradiography, expression levels were evaluated by semiquantitative densitometry and normalized to GAPDH expression. Expression of sequences recovered by library screening was evaluated as described above, except that cDNA probes were used. In the course of DD-PCR, a novel amplicon, BG16.21, demonstrated greatly increased expression in C4-2 and C4-2B4. It was therefore decided to recover the full gene sequence from a λ gt11 expression library using BG16.21 as a probe. A custom C4-2 cell line λ gt11 phage library was constructed from poly(A)+-selected RNA using Invitrogen Custom Services (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). Briefly, poly(A)+-selected RNA was primed using oligo(dT) primers. cDNAs were made double-stranded and were ligated toNotI/EcoRI open reading frame adapters. The cDNA smear started at 500 bp and was continous to 12 kb. Size selection was made for greater than 500 bp. Adapted cDNAs were ligated into λ gt11 arms and packaged. The final titer of the amplified library was 8.8 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Nineteen independent phage were analyzed for the presence of inserts. All 19 phage had inserts with an average size of 1.1 kb. A single colony of Y1090 bacteria was expanded in 15 ml of LB broth containing 10 mm MgSO4 and 0.2% maltose. Host bacteria were diluted in 10 mm MgSO4 toA600 = 0.5 absorbance units. Bacteria were infected with 10 μl of a 5 × 103 plague-forming units/μl phage stock in SM buffer (13) plus 5% chloroform. Initial screening of the C4-2 library was accomplished by hybridizing32P-labeled double-stranded cDNA from the amplicon BG16.21 against 1 × 106 phage plaques from 20 dishes. Two filter replicates were generated per plate using 150-mm BA-85 nitrocellulose. The filters were denatured in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mNaOH for 2 min at room temperature; neutralized in 1.5 mNaCl, 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 8 for 5 min at room temperature; and rinsed with 2× standard saline citrate (SSC), 0.2 mTris-Cl, pH 7.5, for 30 s. Filters were baked for 1.5 h at 80 °C in vacuo. More than 50 plaques were positive. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C using 1 × 106dpm denatured [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe/ml of RapidHyb® buffer (Amersham Corp.). Twenty plaques were pulled and stored. Eight plaques were chosen at random for further purification. These eight plaque cores were titered and replated at a density approaching 5000 plaque-forming units/150-mm dish. Replica filters were generated and hybridized to BG16.21 32P-labeled cDNA as described. Pure plaques, approaching 100% hybridization, were obtained after three rounds of screening. Preparation of phage DNA was accomplished by eluting phage from the purified plaques essentially as described previously (13) by placing the plaques into 500 μl of SM buffer overnight at room temperature. 100 μl of phage elution was then incubated with 100 μl of saturated Y1090 bacteria. These were shaken at 37 °C in 50 ml of NCZYM broth until lysis was observed (about 4 h). At this point 1.5 ml of chloroform was added to lyse the remaining intact bacteria. The cultures were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C using 3600 rpm in a Dupont RT6000B tabletop centrifuge in an HB3600 rotor. Cleared phage lysates were treated for 2 h at 37 °C with 50 μg of DNase I and 250 μg of RNase A. Lysates were transferred to 30-ml OakRidge centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 3 h, 40 min at 30,000 rpm at 4 °C to pellet the phage. Phage were resuspended in 200 μl of Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. A PCR was performed on the purified phage to determine the insert size. Briefly, 2 μl of purified phage was used for each 50-μl PCR reaction. Reaction buffer consisted of 3 mm final MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP mixture, 200 ng of λ forward primer, 200 ng of λ reverse primer, 1× Boehringer Mannheim PCR buffer, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The thermal cycle conditions were denature 94 °C, 40 s; annealing 56 °C, 1 min 40 s; extension 72 °C, 2 min for 35 cycles with a 7-min, 72 °C final extension. 20% of the reaction was loaded onto 1% agarose, TAE (0.04m Tris-acetate, 0.01 m EDTA) gel for examination. PCR products were TA-cloned into pCRII per the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen Corp.) and were sequenced. 5′-RACE was performed using theCLONTECH kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 1 mg of total RNA from the C4-2 cell line was reverse transcribed. The RNA was digested and a second strand was made. The 5′ adapter was then ligated to the double-stranded cDNAs. A PCR was performed with a 5′ adapter-specific upstream primer and a gene-specific downstream primer per the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR products were evaluated with a 1% agarose, 0.5 × TAE gel. PCR products were gel-purified, TA-cloned as described above, and sequenced. An antigenic peptide AL5–30 from amino acid 21–41, EESSDEQPDEVESPTQSQDST, was chosen based on the antigenicity of the translated PAGE-1(AL5) polypeptide (MacVector DNA analysis software, Oxford Molecular Group, Campbell CA) and was synthesized in the Baylor College of Medicine Peptide Synthesis Core Facility. Briefly, the peptide was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (14Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 432 peptide synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer). The peptide was linked to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) in a four-branch procedure. MAP-conjugated peptide was used to immunize primed murine hosts for the generation of polyclonal antibodies according to established protocols (15Mahana W. Paraf A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 161: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Kurpisz M. Gupta S.K. Fulgham D.L. Alexander N.J. J. Immunol.

Briefly, male Balb/c mice, age ≥90 days, were immunized with 25 μg of purified peptide in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. The immunizations were repeated for a total of three times on day 0 intradermally, day 28 subcutaneously, and day 50 subcutaneously. The last two injections used incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mice were injected at day 70 intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of pristane followed 3 days later with an additional challenge by the MAP-conjugated AL5 peptide (25 μg of peptide in phosphate-buffered saline intraperitoneally. Four days later mice were injected with 6 × 106 mouse myeloma cells per mouse intraperitoneal ascites was collected at days 15–20 after the last presentation of antigen. Ascites were screened for immunoreactivity using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays in peptide-coated plates as described previously (15Mahana W. Paraf A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 161: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed on the dish in 3× SDS sample buffer (3% SDS, 0.6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.035% bromphenol blue). For immunoblot analysis, 100 μg of total cellular protein were separated electrophorectically in 12.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at 4 °C overnight. Murine serum was used at 1:250 dilution, and the secondary antibody were used at the dilution recommended by the manufacturer for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) antibody detection (Amersham Corp.). Using DD-PCR, an amplicon, BG16.21, was observed that appeared to be differentially expressed, with expression observed in the C4-2 and C4-B4 lanes (Fig. 1). Reamplification, cloning, and sequencing of this amplicon revealed it to be a typical DD-PCR product that represented the 3′ end of a mRNA transcript. A second amplicon, slightly larger than BG16.21 on the polyacrylamide gel was in fact shown by sequencing to be identical to BG16.21 (Fig. 1,arrows). Such doublets due to the slightly different electrophoretic mobility of the complementary strands of the same species of DNA under denaturing conditions have been observed previously (19Bauer D. Müller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthoe P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Differential expression of the BG16.21 amplicon was confirmed by Northern blot using riboprobes under the conditions described above. It was observed that expression increased progressively from LNCaP through C4-2B4 (data not shown). At the time of initial isolation, BG16.21 had no significant homology to sequences in the GenBankTM data base. It was therefore decided to recover the full-length cDNA sequence by screening a λgt11 cDNA expression library of the C4-2 cell line. Of the eight individual phage chosen after three rounds of plaque purification, two insert sizes of ∼600 (AL4) and ∼700 bp (AL5) were observed (data not shown). Both phage inserts were PCR-amplified, TA-cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen Corp.), and sequenced (see below). The 3′ end of the 524-bp (AL4) insert had approximately 80% homology at the nucleotide level to the DD-PCR amplicon, BG16.21, while the 3′ end of the 676-bp (AL5) insert matched exactly the BG16.21 amplicon. On Northern blot, using the 524-bp (AL4) and 676-bp (AL5) inserts as cDNA probes, it was found that the shorter insert (AL4) had similar levels of expression in LNCaP and the three lineage-related sublines (Fig. 2 A). The expression of the longer insert (AL5) increased progressively in the LNCaP sublines as had been observed with the shorter BG16.21 riboprobe (Fig. 2 B). By semiquantitative densitometry, the up-regulation of the AL5 transcript was 5-fold. The estimated transcript sizes on Northern blot corresponded to the size of the phage inserts observed (Fig. 2). Both strands of the cDNAs for AL4 and AL5 were sequenced (Fig. 3, A and B). 5′-RACE (CLONTECH) was used to confirm the 5′ ends of the cDNAs. The 5′-RACE reaction yielded an additional 21 bp of 5′-UTR for AL5 (Fig. 3 B, underlined). FASTA alignment (GCG8, Madison, WI) revealed significant homology of these genes to the GAGE family of melanoma antigens (data not shown). Multiple sequence alignment found the highest homology, >99% at the DNA level in the coding sequence (Fig. 4 B) and 99% at the polypeptide sequence (Fig. 4 C), between AL4 andGAGE-4. The difference amounts to a single amino acid substitution in the coding sequence, Asp → His at position 118, Fig. 4 C (amino acid 76, Fig. 3 A), in (AL4)GAGE-7 as compared with GAGE-4. This amino acid substitution appears to be the result of a single G → C transversion at position 469, Fig. 4 B (Fig. 3 A, nucleotide 302). The same substitution of Asp76 → His76 at position 118 was observed in GAGE-2 but not GAGE-4. The extended 5′-UTR of(AL4)GAGE-7 when compared with GAGE-4 may be due only to the isolation of a longer cDNA since the remaining 5′-UTR was perfectly homologous. Analysis of the predicted peptide using MacVector DNA analysis software (Oxford Molecular Group, Campbell, CA) predicted a peptide of 117 amino acids, having a molecular mass of 12,997 daltons and an isoelectric point of 4.10. A motif search of the predicted polypeptide showed three potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (data not shown), two potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4 C, boxed), and one potential N-myristoylation site (Fig. 4 C,blue shading). These features were found to be common to all GAGE family members and were maintained in the sequence alignment.Figure 4Comparison of the homology between(AL4)GAGE-7, (AL5)PAGE-1, and the other members of the GAGE melanoma- associated tumor antigen gene family.

Striking differences were noted in the 3′-UTR and a midsequence insertion of 126 bp (42 amino acids) that appears to be a duplication of the sequence that immediately follows with some divergence. (AL5)PAGE-1 also has an 8-amino acid gap followed by a 4-amino acid gap in the N-terminal area (amino acids 21–28 and 35–38 of GAGE-2) when compared with all other members of the GAGE family. Although no significance of this region has been elucidated, the gap has lost 3 Pro and 3 charged residues. Translation of the (AL5)PAGE-1 coding sequence predicted a peptide of 143 amino acids, having a molecular mass of 16,133 daltons and a pI = 3.95. Based on the divergence of AL5 from the GAGE family it was renamed PAGE-1 (prostateassociated gene-1). By comparison to the peptide motifs found for (AL4)GAGE-7 and the other GAGE family members, (AL5)PAGE-1 had several differences. There were found to be 6 potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (data not shown), 1 potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Fig. 4 C,boxed) and 3 potential N-myristoylation sites (Fig. 4 C, blue shading). Both of the consensus protein kinase C sites found in the GAGE family were not found in (AL5)PAGE-1. The loss of the protein kinase C motifs was due to the N-terminal divergence of PAGE-1 while a new protein kinase C motif was generated in the central, nonhomologous duplication in thePAGE-1 gene. The additional N-myristoylation sites were generated by the centrally located sequence duplication observed in the PAGE-1 gene. The mRNA expression of (AL5)PAGE-1 and, albeit to a lesser degree, (AL4)GAGE-7 were examined by RNA blotting to determine their hormonal regulation, cancer cell line expression, and normal tissue distribution. Levels of PAGE-1 mRNA expressed were unaffected by androgen treatment (Fig. 5) following a 24-h exposure to 10 nm dihydrotestosterone. When compared with hybridization for GAPDH as a loading control, the difference in expression with dihydrotestosterone treatment was less than 2-fold.(AL5)PAGE-1 and (AL4)GAGE-7 mRNA"

We have determined the crystal structure of PotF protein in complex with the substrate at 2.3-Å resolution. The PotF molecule has dimensions of 54 × 42 × 30 Å and consists of two similar globular domains. The PotF structure is reminiscent of other periplasmic receptors with a highest structural homology to another polyamine-binding protein, PotD. Putrescine is tightly bound in the deep cleft between the two domains of PotF through 12 hydrogen bonds and 36 van der Waals interactions. The comparison of the PotF structure with that of PotD provides the insight into the differences in the specificity between the two proteins. The PotF structure, in combination with the mutational analysis, revealed the residues crucial for putrescine binding (Trp-37, Ser-85, Glu-185, Trp-244, Asp-247, and Asp-278) and the importance of water molecules for putrescine recognition.

Natural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are ubiquitous in almost all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These small aliphatic cations are protonated at a physiological pH and, thus, in the cell they easily bind to nucleic acids. Through these interactions, polyamines are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins and to mediate the cell growth and proliferation (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar,2Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, spermidine was found to donate a portion of its molecule for the enzymatic biosynthesis of hypusine, a unique amino acid that plays a crucial role in cell proliferation (3Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 475-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the past few years, polyamines have been shown to modulate and to block a number of K+ channels and glutamate receptors, thereby controlling the resting membrane potential and the excitability of various cells (4Johnson T.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5Williams K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Studies of the factors that regulate the cellular polyamine content, therefore, are important for both basic science and medicine. The intracellular polyamine content is controlled through the polyamine metabolism and by the uptake/excretion activities of polyamine transport systems in a concerted manner. Thus, the inhibitors of both pathways would be the potential drugs in the therapy of cancer in which the polyamines play a pathogenic role (6Seiler N. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of polyamine biosynthesis/degradation have been extensively studied at the molecular level, little is known about polyamine transport. No genes responsible for the transport of polyamines in mammalian cells have been isolated (6Seiler N. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, three polyamine transport systems inEscherichia coli were recently characterized (7Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these systems possesses putrescine uptake and excretion activities and consists of one transmembrane protein, PotE (8Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The other two consist of four proteins each and have only the uptake activity, with specificity to the different polyamines. The PotA, PotB, PotC, and PotD proteins constitute the spermidine/putrescine transport system, with strong preference to spermidine (9Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the PotF, PotG, PotH, and PotI proteins belong to the putrescine-specific transport machinery (11Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these two systems, PotF (PotD) is the primary putrescine (spermidine/putrescine) receptor in the periplasmic space. PotH and PotI (PotB, PotC) are the transmembrane components, which form the channel for the polyamines in the membrane. PotG (PotA) is the membrane-associated, ATP-binding protein that provides the energy for polyamine uptake. PotF (PotD) belongs to the family of periplasmic binding proteins involved in active transport and chemotaxis in Gram-negative bacteria (12Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol.

Science. 1994; 264: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), have been determined in the past few years. Despite the lack of significant sequence homology, all of these proteins share a similar fold and structural topology. They consist of two globular domains with a narrow interdomain groove, which constitutes the substrate binding site. Recently, the periplasmic receptors were classified in two groups, on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. The group I proteins have three interdomain linker segments, whereas the group II proteins have only two (12Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the PotD protein, which has high affinity to spermidine (Kd = 3.2 μm) and lower affinity to putrescine (Kd = 100 μm), was solved in complex with spermidine (32Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Sugiyama S. Matsuo Y.

The atomic model and the mutational analysis (34Kashiwagi K. Pistocchi R. Shibuya S. Sugiyama S. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) of the protein residues in the vicinity of the substrate binding site revealed the mechanism of spermidine recognition by the protein. However, the reason why spermidine and putrescine bind to PotD with different affinities remained obscure. The PotF and PotD proteins have 35% homology in their amino acid sequences. In addition, most of the residues involved in spermidine recognition by the PotD protein are conserved between the two proteins. Nevertheless, the PotF protein possesses a high binding affinity to only putrescine (Kd = 2.0 μm) and does not bind other polyamines. To elucidate the mechanism of substrate binding and specificity of the PotF protein, we have determined the crystal structure of PotF in complex with putrescine at a 2.3-Å resolution. The mutational analysis of PotF combined with the comparison of the PotF and PotD structures provides the insight into the mechanism by which the PotF protein discriminates between the closely related putrescine and spermidine molecules. The spermidine uptake- and polyamine biosynthesis-deficient mutant E. coli KK313 (7Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

Yamaguchi Y. Sakai Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8387-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pPT79 (containing the potFGHI genes), pPT104 (containing thepotABCD genes), pPT79.3 (containing the potGHIgenes), and pUCpotF were prepared as described previously (7Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N.

Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMWpotF was prepared by inserting the 1.7-kilobase EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pUCpotF into the same restriction site of pMW119 (36Yamaguchi K. Masamune Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli cells with plasmids was carried out according to the method of Maniatis et al. (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 250-251Google Scholar). Appropriate antibiotics (30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin) were added during the culture ofE. coli. PotF was crystallized, and two Pt derivatives were prepared as described previously (38Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 132-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PotF crystals belong to the space group P21212, with unit cell dimensions a = 269.4 Å, b = 82.33 Å, and c = 93.74 Å. There are four PotF molecules in the asymmetric unit. Attempts to solve the PotF structure using molecular replacement and the PotD molecule as a search model failed. The PotF structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement method, in combination with 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging (see Table I). Two crystals of the HgI4derivative were prepared by soaking native crystals for 2 and 4 days in solutions containing 2 mm and 0.5 mmHgI4, respectively. The heavy atom sites for all four derivatives were refined with the MLPHARE program (39Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend, 25–26 January 1991. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1991: 80-86Google Scholar). 1This program was modified by D. G. Vassylyev. The final figure of merit at 3-Å resolution was 0.64. The multiple isomorphous replacement electron density map was improved by solvent flattening, and a rough partial poly(A)LA model was built for each of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit using the O program (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). This partial model provided an initial matrix for the noncrystallographic symmetry-related PotF molecules. The noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, in combination with solvent flattening and histogram matching (1000 cycles), was applied using the DM program (41Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Almost all of the side chains and the main chain oxygens were clearly seen in the final electron density map. The atomic model was easily built in this map for one PotF molecule, using the O program (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10-12Google Scholar) containing either pUCpotF or pUC mutated potF, according to the method of Oliver and Beckwith (48Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The PotF protein represented approximately 50% of the total periplasmic protein content, and this was used as the PotF protein source (see Fig. 3 A). The reaction mixture (0.1 ml) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm KCl, 10 μg of PotF protein, and 4 μm[14C]putrescine (2.24 GBq/mmol) was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The PotF protein was collected on membrane filters (cellulose nitrate, 0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo), and the radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (49Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coliKK313potF::Km containing pPT79.3 and pMWpotF (or pMW mutated potF) was grown in medium A until the A540 reached 0.3. The assay for putrescine uptake was performed as described previously (50Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μm [14C]putrescine (370 MBq/mmol) as the substrate. PotF consists of 370 amino acids (41 kDa), including a 26-amino acid signal peptide, which is cleaved after biosynthesis and was not included in the sample used for crystallization. The PotF crystal structure lacks three amino acids, two N-terminal and one C-terminal, which are disordered in the crystal. The PotF molecule has an ellipsoidal shape, with approximate dimensions of 54 × 42 × 30 Å, and belongs to the α/β type of proteins. It consists of two structurally similar globular domains. Each domain is composed of a central, five-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked on both sides by six and eight α-helices in the N- and C-domains, respectively (Fig. 1). Both domains consist of two distinct amino acid segments. Residues 29–133 and 279–332 constitute the N-terminal domain, whereas residues 139–273 and 347–369 form the C-terminal domain. Thus, PotF has three interdomain linker segments and belongs to group I of the periplasmic receptors according to the classification (12Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Linkers 1 (residues 134–138) and 2 (residues 274–278) form a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet at the center of the molecule, which makes up the floor of the interdomain cleft. Linker 3 (residues 333–346) is located on the molecular surface and consists of two α-helices joined by a short loop. One disulfide bridge is formed between Cys-175 and Cys-239, which stabilizes the conformation of the C-domain. There are four PotF molecules (r.m.s.d. 2The abbreviation used is: r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. = 0.72 Å between all of the atoms of the monomers) in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which are arranged as a pair of dimers. Surprisingly, the noncrystallographic symmetry, which connects the molecules within the dimer, is substantially different between the two dimers. Thus, although the dimer formation involves the same protein segments in both dimers, the hydrogen bond network is considerably different. The putrescine binding site is located in the deep cleft (26 × 6 × 10 Å) at the interface between the two PotF domains. The putrescine is almost completely engulfed in the cleft and makes multiple polar and van der Waals interactions with the PotF residues (Fig. 2). The PotF residues from both domains are involved in putrescine binding. Two putrescine amino groups are recognized through hydrogen bonds with adjacent acidic residues and main chain carbonyl oxygens. In total, there are six direct and six water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the putrescine amino nitrogens and the PotF residues. The N1 putrescine atom at the entrance of the binding cavity is hydrogen bonded to Ser-38, Asp-39, and Asp-247 and interacts with Ser-38, Asp-247, and Ser-226 through the triad of water molecules, which is conserved in all four PotF molecules (Fig. 2). The N2 atom of putrescine is completely buried in the cleft and makes strong hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl oxygens of Asp-278 and with a water molecule (W4, Fig. 2), which in turn is tightly bound to the adjacent Ser-85 and Glu-185. This water molecule (average B-factor = 30 Å2) is conserved among the four independent PotF. The affinity of PotF to putrescine is enhanced through the 36 nonspecific van der Waals interactions between the putrescine atoms and the five hydrophobic PotF residues (Fig. 2). The putrescine backbone lies inside the hydrophobic cylinder, with an approximate radius of 3.6 Å formed by the PotF side chains of Trp-37, Tyr-40, and Tyr-314 from the N-domain, Trp-244 from the C-domain, and Phe-276 in the linker region. The crystal structure of the PotF protein in complex with putrescine revealed the protein residues involved in putrescine binding. To elucidate the functional roles of these residues in putrescine binding, mutant proteins were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and their putrescine affinities and uptake activities were measured (Fig. 3). Among the mutated residues, 13 corresponded to those of the spermidine binding site in the homologous PotD protein, whereas Asp-247 lacked an analogue in PotD (Fig. 4). Putrescine binding to the mutated PotF protein was measured using 4 μm putrescine as the substrate and the periplasmic fraction prepared from E. coli JM105/pUC-mutatedpotF. The normal and mutated PotF represented about 50% of the total periplasmic protein (Fig. 3 A). The putrescine binding activity was greatly decreased with the mutated PotF proteins W37L 3The mutated PotF protein W37L contains leucine instead of tryptophan at position 37 from the initiator methionine. , D278N, W244L, and D247A in which closely located hydrophobic amino acids or acidic residues interacting with the amino groups of the putrescine are modified. The binding affinity for putrescine was also substantially decreased in the PotF mutants S38A, Y40A, Y314A, S87A, and F276L (Figs. 3 B and 4 A). Interestingly, the E185Q and S85A mutations significantly impaired putrescine binding to PotF. These amino acids correspond to Glu-171 and Ser-83 of the PotD protein (Fig. 4 B) and make hydrogen bonds with the primary amine of the spermidine aminopropyl moiety, but they lack direct contacts with putrescine in the PotF binding site. The PotF binding activity results were further confirmed by experiments with the putrescine uptake activities of intact cells containing the mutated protein. The putrescine uptake activities were measured withE. coli KK313potF::Km containing pPT79.3 and pMW-mutated potF. In this strain, the activity of the PotF protein is thought to be rate-limiting, because the copy number of the plasmid pPT79.3 is much higher than that of the pMW mutated potF. The putrescine uptake activity was greatly diminished in the PotF mutants W37L, D278N, W244L, D247A, E185Q, and S85A (Fig. 3 C). The activity was also decreased in the mutated PotF proteins S38A, Y40A, Y314A, and S87A. The two domain architecture and the topology of each domain of PotF resemble the structures of other periplasmic receptors (12Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Among these, the PotF structure was most similar to its closest homologue, PotD (35% sequence identity), which in turn was shown to be similar to the maltodextrin-binding protein in the ligand-bound form (32Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. between all Cα atoms of PotF and PotD was only 1.5 Å (Fig. 5). At the same time the N-domains of the two proteins exhibited better structural homology (r.m.s.d. = 1.1 Å) than their C-domains (r.m.s.d. =1.7 Å), as was also found in other periplasmic binding proteins. In contrast to PotD, PotF contains one disulfide bridge, formed between Cys-175 and Cys-239. These two cysteines are located at the beginning of two adjacent β-strands in the central β-pleated sheet of the C-domain and thus may stabilize the conformation of this β-sheet. Substrate binding by periplasmic receptors is accompanied by the structural transition of the protein from the “open” ligand-free form to the “closed” ligand-bound conformation. The soaking of leucine into crystals of a ligand-free leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein has shown the presence of ligand-bound open form in which the substrate is bound to only one domain of the receptor (23Sack J.S. Saper M.A Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of some other substrate-bound periplasmic proteins revealed that, in general, one domain of the receptor donates more residues for the binding of ligand than the other (17Zou J. Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Oh B. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 51Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus, it is now believed that the substrates first bind to one domain of the open receptor and then stabilize the closed conformation through the interactions with the other domain. In the case of PotF, five residues of the N-domain (Trp-37, Ser-38, Asp-39, Tyr-40, and Tyr-314) are involved in putrescine binding, whereas only two residues from the C-domain (Trp-244 and Asp-247) interact with the substrate (Fig. 4 A). Thus, it is likely that putrescine binds first to the N-domain, whereas PotF has the open conformation. There are two additional residues (Phe-276 and Asp-278) important for putrescine binding (Figs. 2 and 3), which belong to the hinge region between the two domains. The main chain torsion angle rotations of the residues in the linker regions are believed to be the major factor mediating the hinge motion between the open and closed forms in the periplasmic receptors (12Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that in PotF, the initial contacts of putrescine with Phe-276 and Asp-278 would induce the transformation of the protein from the open to the closed conformation. PotD can bind not only spermidine but also putrescine with lower affinity. After superposition of the PotF and PotD molecules, the putrescine bound to PotF coincides well with the diaminobutane moiety of the spermidine bound to PotD (Fig. 5). Among the 13 amino acid residues that were shown to be important for spermidine binding by PotD (Fig. 4 B), seven residues (Trp-37, Tyr-40, Ser-85, Glu-185, Trp-244, Asp-278, and Tyr-314) are absolutely conserved in the PotF sequence, and their side chains overlap well in the three-dimensional structures (r.m.s.d. = 0.8 Å). All of these residues are crucial for the putrescine binding and uptake activities of PotF (Figs. 3 and 4 A). Surprisingly, the mutations of Ser-85 and Glu-185, which do not directly contact with putrescine, substantially impaired the PotF activities. On the other hand, they interact with the putrescine amino group through the water molecule W4 (Fig. 2 and 4 A). The presence of this water molecule is important as it makes a barrier for putrescine in the binding cleft. The displacement of the water W4 would facilitate the penetration of putrescine deeper into the cleft and would disturb the interactions of the substrate with the major amino acid residues involved in putrescine recognition. One feasible role of Ser-85 and Glu-185 is to fix the position of the water W4, and thus, to stabilize the volume and the shape of the binding cavity. The carboxyl oxygens of Glu-185 form strong hydrogen bonds (3.0 and 3.6 Å) with the Nε1 atom of Trp-244, which stacks on the substrate. Therefore, a second possible role of Glu-185 is to maintain the favorable orientation of the Trp-244 side chain. Among 36 van der Waals contacts between putrescine and the PotF aromatic side chains, 21 interactions are made with Trp-37 and Trp-244, which is in good agreement with the mutational analysis (Fig. 3). Two residues in PotD, Thr-35 and Glu-36, the side chains of which hydrogen bond to the amino nitrogen N1 of spermidine (Fig. 4 B), are replaced by Ser-38 and Asp-39 in PotF, respectively. In contrast to PotD, putrescine hydrogen bonds not with the side chains of Ser-38 and Asp-39 but with the main chain carbonyl oxygens of these two residues (Fig. 2 and 4 A). The side chain of Ser-38 interacts with the N1 atom of putrescine through the water molecule, W2, which explains the appreciable loss of the activity by the PotF mutant S38A (Fig. 3). Moreover, in PotF, the carboxyl oxygens of Asp-247 make two strong direct (2.8 Å, 3.5 Å) and one water-mediated (W1, Fig. 2) hydrogen bonds with the N1 atom of putrescine. The binding of putrescine by PotF at the N1 amino group is additionally stabilized by the water-mediated (W1, Fig. 2) hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-226. Thus, the binding at the N1 site of putrescine by PotF is much stronger than was observed in PotD with the similar atom of spermidine. In total, there are four direct and three water-mediated hydrogen bonds in PotF, in contrast to only two hydrogen bonds in PotD. This observation would explain the lower affinity (50 times) of PotD to putrescine than that of PotF, as the other interactions of the proteins with putrescine (the diaminobutane portion of spermidine) are very similar. Why does PotF bind only putrescine? Judging by the structure of PotD, the most logical explanation is that PotF recruits some bulky side chain that protrudes deeply into the binding cavity and prevents the spermidine binding by steric hindrance with the spermidine aminopropyl moiety. The alignment of the PotF and PotD sequences shows that the Gln-327 side chain in PotD, which is involved in binding to the amino group of the aminopropyl portion of spermidine, is replaced by the longer side chain of Lys-349. On the basis of the PotD structure, the PotF model was constructed in which Lys-349 blocks the binding of spermidine to PotF (33Sugiyama S. Matsuo Y. Maenaka K. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1984-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, this model disagrees with the PotF crystal structure. The structural alignment of the PotF and PotD sequences shows that the actual counterpart of Gln-327 (PotD) in PotF is Leu-348, the side chain of which is far from the binding site, due to the difference in the local conformations between PotD and PotF. In PotF, the position of the N1 atom of putrescine is strictly fixed, whereas in PotD, the N1 atom of spermidine is more flexible, as discussed above. To understand whether this difference may prevent spermidine binding to PotF, we made a docking model of the spermidine molecule with a fixed position of its N1 amino group. There was no conformation that lacked steric hindrance with some protein residues in the PotF binding site. Thus, we presume that the substrate selectivity of PotF is primary dominated by the unique hydrogen bond network with the polyamine N1 amino group, so that polyamines larger than putrescine are not able to fit to the shape of the PotF binding cavity. In conclusion, the crystal structures of the PotF and PotD proteins provide the first insight into the mechanism of specific binding and discrimination between different polyamines by biological macromolecules. The structural results, in combination with the mutational analysis, revealed that polyamine recognition could be achieved by the cooperation of multiple polar and hydrophobic interactions. The arrangement and the chemical properties of amino acids in the PotF (PotD) binding site may be used as a template for studies of other polyamine-binding proteins. One encouraging example is that a sequence comparison with PotD revealed the residues crucial for polyamine binding in a glutamate receptor (52Williams K. Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Igarashi K. Mol.

Two peptides modeled after the CaM binding domain of CaM-kinase II were previously shown to kinetically resemble CaM binding to phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the enzyme, thus providing a model system with which to define the molecular basis of CaM trapping. In this report, the specific contribution of each amino acid to the rates of association and dissociation, and the overall Kd of CaM binding to CaM-kinase II was determined using an overlapping peptide family, and a fluorescently labeled CaM.

In contrast, the dissociation rate constants for the peptides varied by >3500-fold and ranged from 0.26 to 7 × 10−5 s−1. These rate constants yield overall Kd values for binding CaM to the peptides that range from 2 × 10−9m to 2 × 10−13m.

P11275). (1). Ca2+/CaM can be removed from the autophosphorylated enzyme, and it will continue to phosphorylate substrate proteins, although at a reduced rate (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was recently shown that autophosphorylation of Thr286 also leads to a change in the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+/CaM (2Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 3Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was termed “CaM trapping” by Meyer et al. (2Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) to convey the point that the increase in CaM binding is robust with the affinity increasing by several orders of magnitude. Synthetic peptides have proved to be useful models for elucidating the mechanistic details of CaM binding to CaM-kinase II (4Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R.

We recently showed that synthetic peptides can kinetically mimic low affinity (unphosphorylated) and high affinity (phosphorylated) binding of CaM-kinase II to CaM (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The low affinity peptide encompassed amino acids 296–312, while the high affinity peptide encompassed residues 290–314. Since the high affinity peptide, CKII(290–314), 3All CaM-kinase II synthetic peptides used in this study are designated CKII with the corresponding primary amino acid sequence number given in parentheses. did not contain the sequences surrounding the autophosphorylation site (Thr286), we hypothesized that autophosphorylation alters the conformation of the enzyme such that new points of contact with Ca2+/CaM are exposed, leading to the increased CaM-binding affinity of the enzyme. Residues in CaM-kinase II, which likely interact with CaM and lead to high affinity binding, were identified based on the crystal structure of Ca2+/CaM bound to CKII(290–314) (10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This structure shows that amino acids 293–310, with the exception of Asn294, are in direct contact with Ca2+/CaM. We thus proposed that residues293Phe-Asn-Ala295, which are not present in the low affinity peptide CKII(296–312), were necessary for high affinity binding of peptides to CaM. In the present study, we identify and quantitate the contribution of individual amino acids to the increased CaM-binding affinity by utilizing a family of synthetic peptides that mimic the sequence of CaM-kinase II. The data show that the peptides exhibit a range of affinities for CaM that span four orders of magnitude (10−9 to 10−13m). This is analogous to the change in the affinity of CaM-kinase II for CaM following autophosphorylation. The data further reveal that the293Phe-Asn-Ala295 motif is necessary but insufficient for high affinity CaM binding, and that it appears to act in synergy with the basic sequence of amino acids296Arg-Arg-Lys298. Based on these data, we propose a four-step model to explain the transition of CaM-kinase II from a low to a high affinity CaM-binding enzyme. These procedures were identical to those described previously (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Lys residue at amino acid position 75 of the cDNA encoding chicken CaM was changed to a Cys residue to create CaM(C75). The mutation was verified by sequencing. The protein was then expressed in bacteria from a plasmid driven by the λ PL promoter. Purification of CaM(C75) from the soluble fraction of lysed bacteria was as described previously (11Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final product was greater than 95% pure when a fraction was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Acrylodan (Molecular Probes) was dissolved inN,N′-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 100 mm. CaM(C75) at a concentration of 2–2.5 mg/ml was made 5 mm in dithiothreitol and then desalted into 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm CaCl2with 6 m urea. Acrylodan was added in a 2-fold molar excess and allowed to react overnight at room temperature followed by exhaustive dialysis against 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5. Final protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) with CaM as the standard. The amount of bound probe was determined by absorbance spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient at 391 nm of 20,000 m−1 cm−1. Probe to protein ratios were 0.9 to 1.0. The labeling of CaM(C75) with IAEDANS was described in Putkey and Waxham (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized either by the Analytical Chemistry Center at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston or by Research Genetics Inc. All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the final products were analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Peptides were quantified by absorbance at 215 nm. Determination of slow dissociation rates were made using a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorimeter. Fluorescence excitation and emission maxima for CaM(C75)ACR were 370 and 470 nm, respectively. Slit widths were typically maintained at 1–2 and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Addition of components were made manually to a cuvette with a 1-ml volume. The standard buffer for fluorescence experiments was 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. CaM(C75)ACR was used at a concentration of 0.06 μm. For measuring CaM dissociation, peptide was mixed at a saturating concentration with CaM and Ca2+ (0.5 μm final concentration). After measuring emission for 2 min, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled CaM was added to the cuvette. To minimize photobleaching during extended data collection periods, a computer-controlled rotating cuvette turret was utilized to expose a given sample to incident light for a 2-s data collection period every 60 s. A cuvette containing the same sample but lacking excess CaM served as a monitor for photobleaching and variations in lamp intensity in each of these experiments. All such measurements were performed at least two times with each peptide, and the data were fit with a single or double exponential function and averaged to determine the value of koff for CaM. On rates and fast off rates were measured using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SV.17 MV sequential stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with a dead time of 1.7 ms. Excitation was at 370 nm with 5-nm slit widths, and emitted light was collected using a 470-nm cutoff filter. Samples were excited with a 150-watt xenon lamp. Off rates were determined by rapid mixing of equal volumes of solutions from two syringes. Typically, one syringe contained the standard buffer (without EGTA) including 200 μm CaCl2 with CaM(C75)ACR at a concentration of 0.26 μm and an equimolar peptide which achieved maximal fluorescence intensity. The second syringe contained excess unlabeled CaM (10 μm) in the same buffer. Data from five to six injections were averaged and then fit with a single exponential function. All stopped-flow measurements were made at 4–6 °C. On rates were determined in a similar fashion. One syringe was filled with 0.25 μmCaM(C75)ACR in standard buffer containing 200 μm CaCl2, and the second syringe contained peptide in the same buffer. The peptide concentration was varied from 0.25 to 8 μm in 2-fold steps. Data from five to six injections were averaged for every peptide concentration, and each average was then fit with a single exponential. On rate constants were calculated for each peptide by determining the slope of a plot of peptide concentration versus observed association rate, where kobs =kon[peptide] + koff. A minimum of four peptide concentrations were included in each plot. We previously established that CaM(C75)IAE, which has an IAEDANS fluorescent probe covalently coupled to a single Cys residue at position 75, proved a useful tool to measure CaM dissociation rates from synthetic peptides and holoCaM-kinase II (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, preliminary experiments (data not shown) showed that the fluorescence quantum yield from IAEDANS-labeled CaM was insufficient to determine association rates using dilute CaM solutions. We therefore coupled acrylodan, a fluorescent probe with higher quantum yield than IAEDANS, to CaM(C75) to produce CaM(C75)ACR. The emission spectra for CaM(C75)ACR in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and the CaM-kinase peptide CKII(290–312) are shown in Fig. 1. Addition of Ca2+ to apoCaM(C75)ACR induces an ∼90% increase in fluorescence intensity. Subsequent addition of CKII(290–312) results in a further increase in fluorescence intensity of ∼185% relative to apoCaM(C75)ACR and a slight blue shift in the peak of fluorescence intensity (λmaxapproximately 470 nm). The increase in fluorescence intensity due to peptide binding likely involves two mechanistic steps with distinct kinetic parameters. First, binding of the peptide to CaM must occur (k1) followed by a subsequent direct or indirect change in the microenvironment of the fluorescent probe (k2). In these studies, we assume thatk2 is much faster thank1. Thus, all time-dependent changes in fluorescence measured in the experiments described below are assumed to reflect the rate of peptide association or dissociation. The Ca2+ and peptide-induced increase in fluorescence intensity and shift in λmax are qualitatively similar to those seen for IAEDANS-labeled CaM(C75) (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As expected, on a molar basis, CaM(C75)ACR provided a fluorescent indicator that was approximately 6-fold more sensitive than CaM(C75)IAE. CaM(C75)IAE does not alter the activation of CaM-kinase II when compared with unmodified CaM (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CaM(C75)ACR was similarly tested for its ability to activate CaM-kinase II. The half-maximal activation of the enzyme was determined to be 34 nm for CaM and 110 nm for CaM(C75)ACR. There was also a 15% decrease inVmax utilizing CaM(C75)ACR compared with CaM. Thus, CaM(C75)ACR was about 3-fold less potent at activating the enzyme than CaM or CaM(C75)IAE. This decreased effectiveness could be due either to decreased binding affinity or decreased capacity to activate the enzyme and is possibly due to the charge difference of the acrylodan moiety in relation to IAEDANS. Meyer et al. (2Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), reported that randomly dansylated CaM had an approximately 3-fold lower binding affinity than CaM when assayed by competitive binding studies. Dansylated CaM was used successfully in their studies to measure the association and dissociation rates of CaM from CaM-kinase II. To address the issue of binding affinity in more detail, the rate of dissociation of CKII(296–312) from CaM(C75) was determined using CaM(C75)IAE or CaM(C75)ACR (Fig. 2). The dissociation rate for CaM(C75)IAE was 0.14 s−1 and the rate for CaM(C75)ACR was 0.16 s−1. Similar experiments were accomplished with several other peptides and no significant differences were detected in the dissociation rates using CaM labeled with the two different fluorescent probes (data not shown). We conclude that CaM(C75)ACR can be reliably utilized to measure the rates of association and dissociation between CaM and synthetic peptides that mimic the CaM-binding domain of CaM-kinase II. We previously showed that CKII(296–312), with a C-terminal Gly-Cys extension, exhibited a CaM dissociation rate constant of 5.0 s−1, while CKII(290–314) exhibited a dissociation rate constant of 3.4 × 10−5 s−1 (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). From this data, we postulated that residues immediately N-terminal from amino acid 296 play a dominant role in the decreased rate of dissociation. Specifically, we hypothesized that amino acids 293Phe-Asn-Ala295(see Table I) contributed to the large decrease in off rate. We therefore produced a family of overlapping peptides to test specifically the relative contribution of each amino acid between 290 and 296 to the overall affinity of the peptides for CaM. We used Asn312 as the common C-terminal amino acid for all peptides in this study.Table ISummary of kinetic parameters and derived equillibrium constantsPeptideSequencekon × 107koff × 10−5Kd × 10−13ΔG0290 295 310 ⬇ ⬇ ⬇k1k2M−1s−1s−1Mkcal/MCKII(296–312)RRK–TRN1326,00020,000−11.7CKII(295–312)ARRK–TRN1525,00017,000−11.8CKII(294–312)NARRK–TRN7400570−13.8CKII(293–312)FNARRK–TRN122017−15.9CKII(292–312)KFNARRK–TRN2110130 (16)5−16.7CKII(291–312)KKFNARRK–TRN327110 (13)2−17.1CKII(290–312)LKKFNARRK–TRN27985 (21)3−16.9CKII(296–312)*AAA–TRN0.67,000120,000−10.7CKII(293–312)*FNAAAA–TRN1.910,00052,000−11.2Experimental data, such as that shown in Figs. 3 and 4, were fit to the exponential equation F = ((F1 × e−k1t) + (F2 × e−k2t)) +F1, where F is the observed fluorescence intensity at time, t, which were measured at room temperature.

All rate constants were measured at 5 °C except the off rates for CKII(293–312), CKII(292–312), CKII(291–312), and CKII(290–312) Utilizing stopped-flow techniques, we first determined the rate of association of each peptide with CaM by monitoring the time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity upon peptide binding to CaM(C75)ACR. At least five concentrations of each peptide, typically ranging from 0.25 to 8 μm, were rapidly mixed with CaM(C75)ACR and the second order rate constant (kon) was obtained from the slope of the secondary plot. A representative example of this type of analysis is shown for CKII(293–312) in Fig. 3. Rates of up to approximately 600 s−1 could be reliably measured. Table I summarizes the association rate constants derived for the entire family of peptides. Association rate constants for the native peptides did not vary greatly, ranging from 8 × 107to 32 × 107m−1s−1. These values are similar in magnitude to the association rate constant of 88 × 107m−1 s−1 (measured at 21 °C) reported by Torok and Trentham (12Torok K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for the binding of fluorescently labeled CaM to a peptide that mimics the CaM binding domain of myosin light chain kinase. These on rates are also generally consistent with the results of Meyer et al. (2Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) who reported the association rate constant for dansylated CaM with CaM-kinase II at 30 °C was ∼5 to 15 × 107m−1s−1, depending on the phosphorylation status of the enzyme. Together these data suggest that the affinity of CaM for various target peptides is primarily determined by differences in off rates. Somewhat slower association rates were measured for the Ala-substituted peptides, CKII(296–312)* and CKII(293–312)* (TableI). This could be due to altered conformations of the free form of these peptides induced by the hydrophobic N-terminal amino acids. Nevertheless, both these mutant peptides exhibited linear concentration-dependent increases in association rates. Rates of dissociation of synthetic peptides from CaM(C75)ACR were by monitoring the rate of decrease in fluorescence as CaM(C75)ACR bound to peptide is exchanged for unlabeled excess CaM. Stopped-flow or conventional fluorimeters were used as dictated by the overall time necessary to achieve complete exchange of peptides with CaM(C75)ACR. For technical reasons, experiments using the conventional fluorimeter were performed at room temperature rather than at 5–6 °C, the temperature at which all of the stopped-flow data were collected. The elevated temperature would be expected to enhance the dissociation rates from 2- to 4-fold, which should be taken into account when making comparisons between the dissociation rate constants calculated for the stopped-flow data versus the conventional fluorimeter data. Fig. 4 shows typical data for peptides that exhibit fast and slow dissociation rates. Table I summarizes the rate constants for all peptides. The dissociation rates for CKII(296–312) and CKII(295–312) were fast and essentially identical (0.26 s−1 versus 0.25 s−1), indicating that Ala295 by itself has little effect on CaM binding affinity. Addition of Asn294 in CKII(294–312) and293Phe–Asn294 in CKII(293–312) resulted in 60- and 1000-fold decreases in the CaM dissociation rate, respectively, relative to CKII(295–312). This is a minimal estimate since the dissociation rate for CKII(295–312) would be 2–4-fold faster if measured at 22 °C. Further extension of the peptides N-terminal to Phe293 resulted in an additional slight decrease in dissociation rate constants relative to CKII(293–312). Thus, the slow CaM dissociation rate of phosphorylated CaM-kinase II can be largely mimicked by CKII(293–312), and requires293Phe-Asn-Ala295. The raw data for peptides CKII(292–312), CKII(291–312), and CKII(290–312) were best fit by a 2-exponential as indicated in TableI. Interestingly, similar experiments using the phosphorylated form of CaM-kinase II (data not shown) also yielded two CaM dissociation constants of 6.2 × 10−4 s−1 and 30 × 10−4 s−1. The mechanistic basis for the two rate constants is not clear, yet it appears that CaM-kinase II peptides can mimic, at least kinetically, multiple CaM binding characteristics of the intact protein. Having experimentally determined the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants for each peptide, we calculated the Kd for each member of the family (Kd =koff/kon). These calculations are summarized in Table I. The Kdvalues for the peptides with native sequence ranged from 2.0 × 10−9 for CKII(296–312) to 2.0 × 10−13m for CKII(291–312). It is clear that the largest increase in affinity comes from the addition of the293Phe-Asn-Ala295 sequence, producing a three-order of magnitude decrease in Kd. However lengthening the peptide further to include the two Lys residues N-terminal to 293Phe-Asn-Ala295 provide for an additional order of magnitude increase in affinity. The crystal structure of CaM-bound CKII(290–314) shows that positively charged side chains of the basic amino acids 296Arg-Arg-Lys298 appear to form electrostatic interactions with acidic residues in the N-terminal domain of CaM (10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Since these basic residues are adjacent to293Phe-Asn-Ala295, we previously hypothesized that the predominantly hydrophobic interactions between this triplet and CaM may alter the conformation of the CaM-peptide complex such that electrostatic interactions could form between CaM and296Arg-Arg-Lys298 (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such interactions may contribute to the decrease in ΔG0 necessary for CaM rapping. To specifically test this hypothesis, the basic amino acids296Arg-Arg-Lys298 were replaced with Ala residues within the context of CKII(296–312) and CKII(293–312). Alanine substitutions in CKII(296–312) have relatively little effect and cause a 6-fold decrease in affinity due to association and dissociation rates that are 20- and 4-fold slower, respectively, than for the corresponding native peptide (see Table I). Substitution of296Arg-Arg-Lys298 with Ala residues in CKII(293–312) causes a dramatic 3000-fold decrease in affinity for CaM, due to a 6-fold slower rate of association, and a dissociation rate that is 500-fold faster that the native peptide. In total, these data show that the absence of either296Arg-Arg-Lys298 or293Phe-Asn-Ala295 are sufficient to eliminate the high affinity binding of CKII peptides to CaM. We showed previously that the rate of dissociation of the CaM-kinase peptide CKII(290–312) from CaM was at least 1000-fold slower than the shorter peptide CKII(296–312) (9Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, these peptides provided a kinetic model for high and low affinity binding of CaM to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of CaM-kinase II, respectively. The crystal structure of CaM bound to CKII(290–314) indicated a plausible explanation for these findings. CKII(296–312) lacked 3 amino acids (293Phe-Asn-Ala295), of which both Phe293 and Ala295 interact with residues in CaM (10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Based on these observations we proposed that293Phe-Asn-Ala295 were required for high affinity binding of CaM-kinase II peptides to CaM. Their contribution to the overall decrease in free energy of the high affinity complex would be either through direct stabilizing interactions with CaM and/or by promoting a conformation that allows CaM to form stable interactions with other residues on the peptide, specifically, the adjacent296Arg-Arg-Lys298. This working model was tested in the current manuscript by kinetic analysis of rates of association and dissociation, and the overall Kd for the binding of CaM to a family of peptides. The data demonstrate an extremely high affinity association between CaM and the longer peptides (Kd ≈ 10−13m), yet previous enzyme inhibition studies using similar peptides have reported Ki or IC50 values of ≈10−8–10−9m (4Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kelly P.T. Weinberger R.P. Waxham M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). While competitive enzyme inhibition assays provide useful information on the relative affinity of peptides for CaM, these assays essentially measure the amount of peptide required to reduce the free CaM levels to a value equal to its Kd for the marker enzyme. Thus, the observed Ki or IC50 for peptides will never be lower than this Kd. Fluorescently labeled CaM coupled with kinetic measurements provides a means to directly measure binding constants for high affinity association of CaM with a variety of peptides and proteins. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that Phe293 and Asn294 are necessary for high affinity binding of CaM-kinase II peptides to CaM. The increase in affinity discovered for peptides of increasing length was dominated by decreased rates of CaM dissociation. Addition of Ala295 to the core peptide CKII(296–312) had no discernible effect on CaM-dissociation. However, addition of Asn294 and Ala295 produced a 40-fold increase in binding affinity. This was somewhat surprising in that Asn294 was disordered in the crystal structure and presumably does not make direct contacts with CaM. Addition of293Phe-Asn-Ala295 produced the single most substantial increase in binding affinity, increasing over 1,100-fold from the core peptide CKII(296–312) and 28-fold over CKII(294–312). Further extension of the peptide in the N-terminal direction produced measurable but much smaller increases in CaM binding affinity. A second feature of our hypothesis was that amino acids296Arg-Arg-Lys298 are also important for high affinity binding of CKII peptides to CaM. This is based on 1) their proximity to 293Phe-Asn-Ala295, 2) the fact that these residues do indeed form electrostatic interactions with clusters of acidic residues in CaM (10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and 3) that analogous basic residues are found in the N-terminal end of CaM-binding peptides from myosin light chain kinase. Table I shows that conversion of296Arg-Arg-Lys298 to Ala within the context of CKII(296–312) has little effect on overall affinity. In contrast, the same change made in CKII(293–312) decreases overall affinity by several orders of magnitude. From these observations, we conclude that potential electrostatic interactions between CaM and CKII peptides are not established with CKII(296–312), even though296Arg-Arg-Lys298 is present in the peptide, and that 293Phe-Asn-Ala295 is necessary for296Arg-Arg-Lys298 to form the appropriate contacts with CaM for high affinity binding. Formation of such electrostatic interactions may also be responsible for the 40-fold increase in CaM binding affinity upon extension of the CKII peptides to include Asn294. Even though Asn294 is not ordered in the crystal structure it may shield296Arg-Arg-Lys298 from water and increase the probability that these amino acids can form electrostatic interactions with CaM. In total, our data demonstrate that both293Phe-Asn-Ala295 and296Arg-Arg-Lys298 are necessary and act in synergy to produce high affinity CaM binding. Our data are consistent with a recent report by Chin and Means (14Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) who systematically converted the nine Met residues in CaM to Gln. They showed that substitution of only Met124 produced a decrease in the maximal activation of CaM-kinase II. This alteration, and others, also produced significant increases in the amount of CaM required for half-maximal activation of the enzyme. Met124is particularly significant in the context of our findings since this residue contacts Phe293, Ala295, and Leu299. It is possible that following autophosphorylation of Thr286, interaction of Phe293 and Ala295 with Met124 in CaM allows alignment of other residues in the C and N terminus of CaM to form stable contacts with 296Arg-Arg-Lys298. Our data have implications with respect to a previous report which showed that amino acids 291Lys-Lys-Phe-Asn294are necessary to maintain CaM-kinase II in the fully inhibited state. Cruzalegui et al. (15Cruzalegui F.H. Kapiloff M.S. Morfin J.-P. Kemp B.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Means A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12127-12131Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that deletion or replacement of 291Lys-Lys-Phe-Asn294 confers partial Ca2+/CaM-independent activity to CaM-kinase II. Further, C-terminal truncation of CaM-kinase II up to, but not including,291Lys-Lys-Phe-Asn294 inactivated the enzyme. Further truncation to remove291Lys-Lys-Phe-Asn294 produced an active form of the enzyme. Apparently in the basal state, these residues are in contact with residues in the catalytic region providing a portion of the autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme. As such, one could speculate that 291Lys-Lys-Phe-Asn294 would not be available for simultaneous binding to CaM. Only upon binding CaM and autophosphorylation of Thr286 would these residues become available for CaM interactions. This hypothesis is supported by proteolysis studies, which showed that autophosphorylation of Thr286 exposes the region surrounding Phe293 to proteolysis (16Kwiatkowski A.P. King M.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5380-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Yamagata Y. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15391-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is logical to speculate that the high and low affinity CaM-binding peptides, as well as the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of CaM-kinase II, will have differential and biologically significant effects on the Ca2+-binding properties of CaM. This follows from a series of studies showing that CaM binding to different targets differentially increase the affinity of CaM for Ca2+(18Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation has led some to speculate that stable intermediates of CaM bound to targets might persist even at resting intracellular Ca2+ (for a formal kinetic scheme, see Brownet al. (13Brown S.E. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). If the high affinity association of CKII(290–312) is reflected in a significantly slowed off rate of Ca2+ from CaM, then it seems possible that Ca2+would not fully dissociate from CaM when intracellular Ca2+concentration returns to basal levels, leaving the enzyme in a CaM-bound state. A corollary to this mechanism would be that the proportion of cellular CaM-kinase II that exists in the Thr286-phosphorylated state (high CaM affinity) may exist with CaM physically associated with its CaM binding domain. As proposed (2Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), the abundance of CaM-kinase II in neurons coupled with its capacity to bind CaM with high affinity might not only maintain the enzyme in an active state, but also regulate the availability of CaM for other CaM-dependent enzymes. The potential for these scenarios will be explored by determining whether CKII(296–312) and CKII(290–312) induce different degrees of increase in the Ca2+-binding affinity of CaM. Based on these data and the literature reports discussed above, a model for the transition of CaM-kinase II from a low to high affinity CaM-binding form can be proposed to include the following steps. 1) First, Ca2+ binds to CaM, inducing a conformational change that produces an initial interaction with the core CaM-binding domain of CaM-kinase II. A reasonable prediction from the crystal structure (10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) is that the critical residues in the core are likely Leu299 and Leu308; 2) Ca2+/CaM-binding induces intersubunit autophosphorylation of Thr286; 3) the phosphorylation of Thr286exposes 293Phe-Asn-Ala295, and possibly290Leu-Lys-Lys292, which are then available to form additional contacts with CaM; and 4) formation of these contacts lead to further conformational changes permitting CaM to interact with296Arg-Arg-Lys298 which provides for the highest affinity CaM-binding or CaM-trapping. Step 3, and possibly 4, above may also be important for CaM-kinase II to exhibit maximal enzymatic activity. By interacting with CaM, the area surrounding 293Phe-Asn-Ala295 would not be available to interact with and inhibit the catalytic domain (15Cruzalegui F.H. Kapiloff M.S. Morfin J.-P. Kemp B.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Means A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12127-12131Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This model also provides a possible explanation for why the Ca2+/CaM-independent form of the enzyme expresses only a portion of maximal activity, typically 20–80% (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). When Ca2+/CaM is removed following autophosphorylation, with for example EGTA, the area surrounding293Phe-Asn-Ala295 would again become free to interact with the catalytic domain. Thus, the enzyme expresses sub-maximal activity in the Ca2+/CaM-independent state because the autoinhibitory domain has partially re-established itself with the catalytic domain. Analyzing these possibilities in the context of native and mutated forms of CaM-kinase II are currently underway. We thank Andy Hudmon, Steve Kolb, Bryan Davis, Wen Liu, and Dr. Don Blumenthal for providing reagents and thoughtful discussion during the course of these studies. We also are grateful to Katayun Irani for performing some of the dissociation rate determinations."
https://openalex.org/W1992186441,"Fusion of recycling and transcytotic vesicles with the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells requires the<i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and is sensitive to botulinum neurotoxin serotype E (BoNT/E). BoNT/E is thought to selectively proteolyze the 25,000-dalton synaptosomal associated protein (SNAP-25), a protein found in neurons or cells of neuroendocrine origin. However, SNAP-25 is not found in MDCK cells. One possible target for BoNT/E in MDCK cells is SNAP-23, a newly described SNAP-25 homolog that is found in several organs including kidney. Currently, the function of SNAP-23 is unknown. We have reconstituted transferrin recycling in permeabilized MDCK cells to assess the role of SNAP-23 in the endocytic traffic of this protein. We find that: (i) SNAP-23 is expressed in MDCK cells and is found both at the basolateral plasma membrane and associated with apical and basolateral vesicles, (ii) canine SNAP-23 is cleaved by BoNT/E, (iii) transferrin recycling is <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-dependent and BoNT/E-sensitive, and (iv) addition of either exogenous SNAP-23 or anti-SNAP-23 antibodies inhibits ligand recycling. Our observations suggest that SNAP-23 may be required for fusion of recycling vesicles with the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089092016,"Endothelial cells express two major cadherins, VE- and N-cadherins, but only the former consistently participates in adherens junction organization. In heart microvascular endothelial cells, we identified a new member of the cadherin superfamily using polymerase chain reaction. The entire putative coding sequence was determined. Similarly to protocadherins, while the extracellular domain presented homology with other members of the cadherin superfamily, the intracellular region was unrelated either to cadherins or to any other known protein. We propose for this new protein the name of vascular endothelial cadherin-2.

This new molecule shares some functional properties with VE-cadherin and other members of the cadherin family. In Chinese hamster ovary transfectants it promoted homotypic Ca2+ dependent aggregation and adhesion and clustered at intercellular junctions. However, in contrast to VE-cadherin, it did not modify paracellular permeability, cell migration, and density-dependent cell growth. These observations suggest that different cadherins may promote homophilic cell-to-cell adhesion but that the functional consequences of this interaction depend on their binding to specific intracellular signaling/cytoskeletal proteins.

These observations suggest that different cadherins may promote homophilic cell-to-cell adhesion but that the functional consequences of this interaction depend on their binding to specific intracellular signaling/cytoskeletal proteins. Endothelial permeability to plasma proteins and circulating cells is controlled in part by intercellular junctions. Besides their role in promoting homotypic cell adhesion, emerging evidence suggests that intercellular junctions can transfer cell-cell signals and be responsible for complex cellular responses such as contact inhibition of cell growth and cell polarity. The molecular organization of intercellular junctions in the endothelium has been only partially elucidated in the last few years. At least three types of complex structures have been described: tight junctions, adherens junctions, and complexus adhaerentes. All of these structures are formed by specific transmembrane proteins, which through their extracellular region promote homotypic cell-to-cell adhesion and through the cytoplasmic tail bind to a complex network of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins (1Rubin L.L.

Outside of these junctional structures, other adhesive proteins such as PECAM 1The abbreviations used are: PECAM, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EC1–EC6 domains, extracellular domains 1–6; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; VE-cad, vascular endothelial cadherin; VE-cad-2, vascular endothelial cadherin 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s).

Horschowski N. George F. Sampol J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have been found to be clustered at intercellular contacts. The intracellular molecules that associate with adherens junctions are different from those that associate with tight junctions and from those that link other junctional adhesion proteins such as PECAM, suggesting that a certain specificity in signaling should exist (3Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In adherens junctions, the transmembrane proteins responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion belong to the cadherin superfamily of adhesive proteins. In endothelial cells, one of the major cadherins is VE-cadherin or cadherin-5 (VE-cad), which is consistently present at adherens junctions and is cell-specific (2Dejana E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 7-10Google Scholar, 3Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Similarly to the other members of the family, the short intracellular tail of VE-cad is linked to three cytoplasmic proteins called catenins: β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120. β-Catenin and plakoglobin bind α-catenin, which in turn promotes the anchorage of the complex to the actin cytoskeleton. As the other known cadherins, the extracellular domain of VE-cad promotes homotypic, calcium-dependent adhesion. Endothelial cells also express N-cadherin, which in human endothelium does not colocalize with VE-cad at cell contacts but remains diffuse on the cell membrane (7Salomon D. Ayalon O. Patel King R. Hynes R.O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar, 8Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Besides these well characterized cadherins, some indirect evidence suggests that other cadherin-like structures may be present in the endothelium (9Ayalon O. Sabanai H. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, we started an investigation to test this possibility. Using a polymerase chain reaction method previously introduced by Suzuki et al. (6Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and Sano et al.(10Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St. John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we identified a new protein that, on the extracellular domain, presents homology with cadherins. This protein is concentrated at intercellular junctions and expresses adhesive properties, but, in contrast to VE-cad, does not bind to catenins and does not modify paracellular permeability, cell migration, or growth. This indicates that several proteins may participate in the molecular organization of interendothelial junctions, but each molecule may play a specific functional role and possibly transfer different intracellular signals. For its localization in endothelial cells and for its homology with the cadherin and protocadherin family, we propose for this new protein the name of vascular endothelial cadherin-2 (VE-cad-2). All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. PCR was performed as described previously by Suzukiet al. (6Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and Sano et al. (10Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St. John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S.

Two different sets of degenerated oligonucleotide primers were used in this study. One set corresponds to two well conserved sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin; the upstream and downstream primers were 5′-GAATTCAC(A/C/G/T)GC(A/C/G/T)CC(A/C/G/T)TA(C/T)GA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTC(A/C/G/T)GC(A/C/G/T)A(A/G)(C/T)TT(C/T)TT(A/G)AA-3′, respectively. The other set corresponds to two conserved regions in the third (EC3) and in the fourth extracellular domain (EC4) as described previously by Sano et al. (10Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S.

The PCR reaction consisted of 33 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min usingTaq DNA polymerase obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCR II plasmid by use of the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA) and sequenced according to the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (12Tabor S.

Plaques showing a strong positive hybridization signal were screened four times to obtain a single phage clone. Phage inserts were subcloned in the pBluescript vector and sequenced by Genomic Express S.A. (Grenoble, France). The nucleotide and the deduced protein sequences were screened against the data bank as described previously (15Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M.

CHO cells were plated at 5–6 × 105 cells/10-mm Petri dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After about 24 h, the cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 20 μg of pECE-VE-cad-2 and 2 μg of pCMVneo plasmid. Cells were washed 24 h later with PBS and cultured for another 24–36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. They were then cultured in presence of 600 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). After about 10 days in selective medium, the surviving colonies were ring-cloned. G418-resistant clones were screened for expression by Northern blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Control cells, CHO cells transfected with pCMVneo were selected, cloned, and cultured in the same way. Total RNA was extracted and purified by use of the Rapid Total RNA isolation kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and 20 μg were run in a standard formaldehyde/agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond N membrane (Amersham International), fixed at 80 °C for 2 h, and hybridized at 65 °C in a buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate, 3× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 10% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were then washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, twice with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and once with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min and then subjected to autoradiography.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Sterile plasticware was from Falcon (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ); both culture medium and serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. A rabbit antiserum was raised against a recombinant fragment spanning the extracellular domain of VE-cad-2 (74–335 amino acids). The fragment was generated by PCR. The primers were designed to create at the 5′-end a BamHI site and at the 3′-end a HindIII restriction site. The cDNA fragment was then subcloned into the BamHI–HindIII site of the expression vector pQE30 (Qiaexpressionist kit; Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) in the correct reading frame and sequenced to verify that no mutation had arisen during PCR. The resulting pQE30-VE-cad-2 vector was then introduced into M15 (pREP4) cells by a single step transformation method. The fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and was purified from the extract by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity chromatography, as described by the manufacturer (Qiaexpressionist kit; Qiagen). Polyclonal antibody against VE-cad-2 was produced in rabbit by injecting 0.5 mg of the fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant at three subcutaneous sites. Subsequent injections were in Freund's incomplete adjuvant with 0.5 mg of the fusion protein. The fragment antiserum was affinity-purified by affinity chromatography on the corresponding fragment affinity column CN-Br-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden). The antiserum was further characterized for its positive reaction with endothelial cells (H5V) and VE-cad-2 transfectants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining of fixed cell monolayers. Mouse monoclonal antibody to human VE-cad was the clone TEA 1.31 (20Leach L. Clark P. Lampugnani M.G. Arroyo A.G. Dejana E. Firth J.A. J.

Fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (reactive with either mouse or rabbit IgG) were purchased from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark). Goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody and protein A peroxidase-conjugated antibody used for immunoblotting detection were from Pierce. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in methanol. The cells were then rinsed and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with the relevant primary antibodies, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min with the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. Coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem) and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Photographs were taken using T-Max P3200 films. EGTA was used for chelating calcium ions in the culture medium as described previously (21Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A buffer stock solution of 100 mm EGTA was used to obtain a final concentration of 5 mm. Cells grown to confluence on glass coverslips were incubated with 5 mm EGTA at 37 °C for 30 min, fixed, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described above. Cells were cultured to confluence on glass coverslips and treated with 1 μg/ml cytochalasin D in culture medium. 30 min later, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described above. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed as described elsewhere (22Alexander J.S. Blaschuk O.W. Haselton F.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using sulfonitrohydroxysuccinimido-biotin (Pierce). Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 10% low fat milk and then incubated in fresh blocking solution with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Biospa Division, Milano, Italy) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was visualized using the ECL kit as described under “Blot and Immunoprecipitation.” Whole cell extracts were obtained from confluent cells as described previously (23Frachet P. Uzan G. Thevenon D. Denarier E. Prandini M.H. Marguerie G. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Detergent solubilization was carried out essentially as reported previously in detail (24Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Different cell extracts were adjusted to 1× Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated under reducing conditions on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207094) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of the various cell extracts were carried out essentially as described (24Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). After blocking with 10% low fat milk, the proteins of interest were detected by specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies at the optimal dilution in blocking buffer. This was sequentially followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1 mg/ml) for monoclonal antibodies or protein A peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1 mg/ml) (Pierce) for polyclonal antibody and further development of peroxidase activity using an ECL kit (Amersham Biotech Pharmacia International) and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation of the cadherin-catenin complex was performed using the nonionic detergent-soluble fraction of cells, as previously reported (24Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cell extracts were precleared by incubation with uncoupled protein G- or protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biotech Pharmacia) for 2 h. After centrifugation, the precleared supernatants were incubated with protein G- or protein A-Sepharose coupled to mAb TEA 1.31 or polyclonal antibody against VE-cad-2 during 1 h. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation; washed five times in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 2 mmCaCl2; and finally resuspended in 30 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted sequentially with polyclonal antibody to VE-cad-2 or mAb TEA 1.31 to VE-cad or mAbs to α- and β-catenin as described above. Calcium-dependent cell aggregation was done under conditions that preserve, by flow cytometry analysis, VE-cad-2 or VE-cad expression as described previously (15Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). When indicated, cytochalasin D was added at 1 μg/ml after the first centrifugation, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. In some experiments, EGTA (5 mm final concentration) was added to the medium. For heterotypic aggregation assays, CHO-VE-cad-2/VE-cad cells were labeled with 2 mm2′,5′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester and 2′,5′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 10 min at 37 °C and processed as described (26Navarro P. Caveda L. Breviario F. Mandoteanu I. Lampugnani M.-G. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30965-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). CHO, CHO-VE-cad-2, or CHO-VE-cad cells were cultured in 96-well plates and grown for 5 days to confluency. All three types of cells were labeled with [125I]iododeoxyuridine (1 mCi/ml) overnight prior to the cell adhesion experiment. 12 h later, the cells were detached as described above and resuspended at 3 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 100 μl of labeled cell suspension were added to different adherent cell monolayers (CHO, CHO-VE-cad-2, and CHO-VE-cad) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were solubilized with 0.5 m NaOH, 0.1% SDS and counted in a γ-counter. Permeability across cell monolayers was measured in Transwell units (with polycarbonate filter, 0.4-μm pore; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described previously (15Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO transfectants were cultured to confluency for 5 days. Then culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat immunoglobulins (8 mg/ml initial concentration in the upper chamber; minimal calculated molecular mass, 200 kDa; specific activity, 28 units/mg) was added to the upper chamber. At 2 h, 100-μl aliquots were collected from the lower compartment and assayed photometrically for the presence of enzymatic activity. In some experiments, EGTA (5 mm, final concentration) was added both to the lower and upper compartments for 2 h at the same time as immunoglobulins. Cell migration was estimated as described previously (15Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell monolayer was wounded with a plastic tip. Four diameters, regularly distanced by about 45°, were removed. The remaining cells were washed twice with culture medium to remove cell debris and incubated at 37 °C in culture medium. At the indicated time intervals, cells were fixed with Fast Green FCF (0.02% in methanol) and stained with crystal violet (0.5% in a 20:80 mixture of methanol/water). The distance migrated by the cells was measured using a micrograduate scale (Nikon) adapted in the ocular of a Nikon inverted microscope under phase contrasts (magnification × 100). Cell growth was evaluated as described previously (27Caveda L. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Breviario F. Corada M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1 × 104/ml (1 ml/well) in 24-well plates (2 cm2/well). Culture medium was not changed for the duration of the experiment (96 h). Cell number was evaluated after trypsinization of the cells and counting (four replicates) in a Bürker chamber. A PCR method was applied to identify new members of the cadherin superfamily. As primers we first used two degenerated oligonucleotides corresponding to two highly conserved sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins as previously described by Suzuki et al. (6Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using cDNA obtained from mouse heart microvascular endothelial cells (H5V). The resulting 160-bp products were then subcloned in the pCRII plasmid and sequenced. Of 35 clones sequenced, three clones encoded the amino acid sequence of N-cadherin, and two clones encoded the amino acid sequence of VE-cad. The other cDNA clones encoded amino acid sequences that did not present homology with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins. In the second part of the research, we used as primers degenerated oligonucleotides corresponding to two conserved sequences of the extracellular domain of cadherins, as described previously by Sanoet al. (10Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St. John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). PCR from the cDNA of the cell line H5V yielded four major bands of 450, 370, 300, and 130 bp in size. The 450- and 130-bp bands correspond to the distance between the two primer sites in classic cadherins and the two primer sites in protocadherins, respectively (10Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St. John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The 370- and 300-bp bands would not be predicted from any of the known members of the cadherin superfamily and were therefore discarded. The 130-bp product was subcloned into the pCR II vector, and 30 clones were isolated and sequenced. Two cDNAs (clones 1 and 14) presented a novel sequence and were considered good candidates to be new putative members of the cadherin superfamily. A cDNA library of postnatal day 4–8 mouse brain capillaries (13Schnurch H. Risau W. Development. 1993; 119: 957-968PubMed Google Scholar) was screened by using clones 1 and 14 as probes. Four clones of 5.8, 4.0, 2.4, and 1.8 kb were obtained by screening with clone 1, while only a clone of 700 bp was obtained using clone 14 as probe. The sequence analysis of the 700-bp clone revealed a partial sequence that did not correspond to any previously identified sequence (data not shown). The sequences of the two cDNA clones of 5.8 and of 4.0 kb obtained by screening with clone 1 overlap and appear to contain the full-length open reading frame of a novel member of the cadherin superfamily. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the 4.0-kb clone are shown in Fig. 1. The 3868-bp sequence contains 298 bp of putative 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 3540 nucleotides encoding 1180 amino acids, and a short 3′-untranslated region of 29 bp. At position 299, the cDNA sequence contains a translation initiation site that matches the Kozak criteria (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). The polyadenylation signal was not identified. The sequence presents a signal peptide, an extracellular region that can be divided into six domains (EC1–EC6), a transmembrane domain, and a large cytoplasmic region of 443 amino acids. The repeats EC1–EC5 are 104–109 residues long and present homology to the cadherin repeats found in"
https://openalex.org/W1981049634,"Drosophila eye-specific protein kinase C (eye-PKC) is involved in light adaptation and deactivation. eye-PKC, NORPA (phospholipase Cβ), and transient-receptor-potential (TRP) (calcium channel) are integral components of a signal transduction complex organized by INAD, a protein containing five PDZ domains. We previously demonstrated the direct association between the third PDZ domain of INAD with TRP in addition to the carboxyl-terminal half of INAD with the last three residues of NORPA. In this work, the molecular interaction between eye-PKC and INAD is defined via the yeast two-hybrid and ligand overlay assays. We show that the second PDZ domain of INAD interacts with the last three residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of eye-PKC, Thr-Ile-Ile. The association between eye-PKC and INAD is disrupted by an amino acid substitution (Ile-700 to Asp) at the final residue of eye-PKC. In flies lacking endogenous eye-PKC (inaCp215), normal visual physiology is restored upon expression of wild-type eye-PKC, whereas the eye-PKCI700D mutant is completely inactive. Flies homozygous for inaCp209 andInaDp215, a mutation that causes a loss of the INAD-TRP association, were generated. These double mutants display a more severe response inactivation than either of the single mutants. Based on these findings, we conclude that the in vivoactivity of eye-PKC depends on its association with INAD and that the sensitivity of photoreceptors is cooperatively regulated by the presence of both eye-PKC and TRP in the signaling complex. Drosophila eye-specific protein kinase C (eye-PKC) is involved in light adaptation and deactivation. eye-PKC, NORPA (phospholipase Cβ), and transient-receptor-potential (TRP) (calcium channel) are integral components of a signal transduction complex organized by INAD, a protein containing five PDZ domains.

Based on these findings, we conclude that the in vivoactivity of eye-PKC depends on its association with INAD and that the sensitivity of photoreceptors is cooperatively regulated by the presence of both eye-PKC and TRP in the signaling complex. In Drosophila, visual transduction is a G-protein-coupled phospholipase C-mediated process that leads to depolarization of photoreceptors (see Refs. 1Selinger Z. Doza Y.N. Minke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 283-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ranganathan R. Malicki D.M. Zuker C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 283-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar for reviews). In this signaling pathway, rhodopsins are activated by light and catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange in the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gq. The α-subunit of Gq interacts with the phospholipase Cβ, NORPA, that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (4Running Deer J.L. Hurley J.B. Yarfitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12623-12628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After the activation of NORPA, two cation channels, TRP 1The abbreviations used are: TRP, transient receptor potential; PKC, protein kinase C; NORPA (norpA), no-receptor-potential; INAD (InaD), inactivation-no-afterpotential D; INAC (inaC), inactivation-no-afterpotential C; ERG, electroretinograms; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and TRPL (TRP-like), are opened, leading to membrane depolarization (5Niemeyer B. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these two channels are gated remain elusive. One hypothesis is that the TRP calcium channel is controlled by depletion of internal calcium stores initiated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding to its receptor (6Hardie R.C. Minke B. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), similar to the store-operated channel present in nonexcitable cells (7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). However, a recent report suggests that an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is not involved in visual signaling (8Acharya J.K. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Hartenstein V. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition calcium release from internal stores has not been directly implicated in visual excitation (9Ranganathan R. Bacskai B.J. Tsien R.Y. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 837-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Hardie R.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the uncertain role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in photoreceptors, diacylglycerol generated by NORPA is a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC). eye-PKC encoded by the inaC locus is known to be involved in the negative feedback regulation of visual transduction in Drosophila photoreceptors (11Hardie R.C. Peretz A. Suss-Toby E. Rom-Glas A. Bishop S.A. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nature. 1993; 363: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,12Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The importance of PKC as a regulator of the visual response is shown by the defective visual electrophysiology of the inaCmutants missing the eye-specific isoform of PKC. The inaCmutants display slow deactivation of the light response and are unable to adapt to different light intensities (11Hardie R.C. Peretz A. Suss-Toby E. Rom-Glas A. Bishop S.A. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nature. 1993; 363: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition,inaC photoreceptors undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration (12Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). eye-PKC has been shown to be a component of a signal transduction complex by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography assays (13Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bahner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R.

Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This complex is organized by an adaptor protein, INAD, that also interacts with two key components of the visual cascade, TRP and NORPA (13Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bahner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R.

A. 1997; 94: 12682-12687Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The formation of this signaling complex is crucial for a functional visual signaling process, as flies lacking INAD show mis-localization of eye-PKC, TRP, and NORPA and display a drastically reduced response to light (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). INAD appears to act as a scaffold protein that assembles with these signaling proteins into a multiprotein complex. Formation of this macromolecular complex may be essential for the fast kinetics of signal transduction inDrosophila photoreceptors (14Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bahner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Since the gating mechanism of TRP is not known, investigations on the protein-protein interactions in this complex may shed light on events leading to depolarization. We previously reported a point mutation in INAD that eliminates the TRP interaction and brings about a slow recovery of the visual response (17Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Shieh B.-H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus the INAD/TRP interaction appears to regulate the TRP calcium channel (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 17Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We also investigated the functional role of the NORPA/INAD association by generating transgenic flies expressing a modified NORPA that lacks the INAD interaction. ThenorpA transgenic flies display a unique electroretinogram recordings (ERG) characterized by delayed activation and slow deactivation. This phenotype of slow kinetics is also observed inInaD2 that contains a missense mutation in the fifth PDZ domain leading to a loss of the NORPA association (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In this report, we define the respective binding domains in eye-PKC and INAD and demonstrate the functional consequence of this interactionin vivo. Our findings suggest the essential role of the eye-PKC and INAD association in regulating visual transduction. Potential substrates for eye-PKC that are involved in deactivation and desensitization of the visual response are discussed. Standard molecular biology methods were used in subcloning, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and nucleotide sequencing according to published procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the PCR-based overlap extension method. The yeast two hybrid system used in this work is detailed in Golemis et al. (21Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Suppl. 33. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The yeast strain used was EGY191 (MATa, trp1, his3, ura3, 2ops-LEU2); the LacZ reporter plasmid was pSH18–34; the LexA fusion plasmid was pEG202, and the activation domain fusion plasmid was pJG4–5. Methods for yeast transformation, testing protein-protein interactions, and checking protein expression were from Golemis et al. (21Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Suppl. 33. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Antibodies used to assay the level of fusion protein expression were polyclonal rabbit anti-HA (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and anti-LexA (Invitrogen). Primers flanking codons 1–381 ofinaC were used to amplify 5′ sequence by PCR. The primers included 5′ BglII/EcoRI restriction sites and 3′BamHI/XhoI restriction sites.BglII-XhoI restriction fragment was cloned intoBamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then the NsiI-XhoI restriction fragment from pPKC (pPKC is a full-length inaC generated by RT-PCR) was cloned in to recreate inaC in pGEX-4T-1. TheEcoRI-BamHI (blunt, vector-encoded) restriction fragment from pPKC was cloned intoEcoRI-XhoI(blunt) sites of pJG4–5 before theEcoRI-EcoRI restriction fragment from the pGEX-4T-1 PKC clone was ligated into the EcoRI site of this construct. BanI(blunt)-NotI restriction fragment was subcloned from pPKC into theBamHI(blunt)-NotI sites of pEG202. The BamHI-BamHI restriction fragment from pPKCI700D (codon 700, ATT mutated to GAT) was subcloned into BamHI restriction sites of PKC-18. BamHI-XhoI restriction fragment was deleted from PKC-18. EcoRI-EcoRI restriction fragment from PKC-18 was deleted. Codons 631 to 700 were PCR-amplified and cloned using NcoI-XhoI sites into pEG202. For correct framing, theHindIII-XhoI restriction fragment from pPKC was cloned into HindIII-XhoI sites of pBluescript II SK(−), and the resulting EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment was subcloned into pEG202. The last 20 (10Hardie R.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) codons were cloned by annealing and ligating complementary oligonucleotides into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pEG202. Amino acid substitutions are detailed in Table II. The final 4 and 3 codons of eye-PKC were cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pEG202 using complementary oligonucleotides. snf1 encodes a yeast serine-threonine specific protein kinase (22Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The BamHI-BamHI restriction fragment containing snf1 was subcloned from pSE112 (23Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) into pEG202. INAD fusions were named for the PDZ domains they contain. PCR primers were designed to amplify codons 1 through 365 of InaD with 5′ EcoRI and 3′XhoI restriction sites. PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment from this construct (pCR2.I5′) was subcloned into pJG4–5. SmaI-XhoI restriction fragment containing 3′ coding sequence was subcloned from a full-lengthInaD cDNA into pCR2.I5′. From this construct (pCR2.INAD), the entire InaD cDNA was subcloned intoEcoRI-XhoI sites of pJG4–5. Similarly, InaD cDNA was cloned into pEG202. The EcoRI-AvaII(blunt) restriction fragment from pCR2.I5′ was cloned intoEcoRI-XhoI(blunt) sites of pJG4–5. For correct framing, thePvuI(blunt)-XhoI fragment from pCR2.INAD and pCR2.I5′, respectively, were subcloned intoEcoRV-XhoI restriction sites of pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene). From these, the EcoRI-XhoI fragment was cloned into pJG4–5. The EcoRI-MspA1I restriction fragment from pBluescript II SK(-)/PDZ2–5 construct was cloned intoEcoRI-XhoI(blunt) sites of pJG4–5. The MspA1I-XhoI restriction fragment from pBluescript II SK(−)/PDZ2–5 was subcloned intoNotI(blunt)-XhoI sites of pET30b (Novagen). From this the EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment was cloned into pJG4–5. Codon 22, AAG (K) to TCG (S). Codon 29, GGC (G) to GAA (E). Codon 30, ATC (I) to CAC (H). Codon 32, ATA (I) to ACA (T). Changes were introduced by two rounds of PCR amplification with two overlapping 5′ primers in conjunction with a 3′ primer. The SacII-SacII restriction fragment was ligated into pCR2.I5′, replacing wild-type sequence, then PDZ1* was constructed as per PDZ1. Codon 254, AGG (R) to AGC (S). Codon 260, CTG (L) to CAG (Q). Codon 261, GGA (G) to GAA (E). Codon 262, CTC (L) to CAC (H). The resulting PCR product was cloned into PDZ1–2, replacing the wild-typeBamHI-BamHI sequence. ThePvuI(blunt)-XhoI restriction fragment from this construct was subcloned into EcoRV-XhoI sites of pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene), then theEcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment from this construct was subcloned into pJG4–5. A PCR product encompassing codons 485 to 577 ofInaD with 5′ EcoRI and 3′ XhoI sites was subcloned into pJG4–5. The EcoRI-PstI(blunt) restriction fragment from P4/5 was subcloned intoEcoRI-XhoI(blunt) sites of pJG4–5. The BamHI-PstI(blunt) restriction fragment (codons 548–622) was subcloned into theBamHI-XhoI(blunt) sites of a PDZ4A, pEG202 clone. The EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment was then subcloned into pJG4–5. PCR fragments and sequences across the junction of fused proteins were verified by DNA sequencing. Unless otherwise indicated, duplicate constructs were isolated and tested in triplicate. These three procedures were carried out as described previously (17Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C in a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. Recombination between marked InaDp215(InaD, sp) and inaCp209 (inaC, px, sp) chromosomes was performed using standard techniques. If recombination occurs, double mutants will have spotted (sp) marker, but not plexus (px). Potential double mutants were further evaluated for the presence of theinaCp209 and InaDp215mutations by biochemical methods. The mutant and wild-type eye-PKC cDNA were subcloned into a modified pCaSpeR 4 vector (24Thummel C.S. Pirrota V. Drosophila Information Service. 1992; 71: 150Google Scholar) that contains the Drosophila hsp70 promoter. The P-element construct and a transposase plasmid were injected into theinaCp209 embryos to generate transgenic flies (25Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). Flies with the transgene integrated into the second or third chromosome were selected and made homozygote for further analysis. ERG recordings were carried out as described (19Shieh B.-H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Experimentally, flies were anesthetized by carbon dioxide and immobilized. Glass electrodes were filled with physiological saline (0.7% NaCl). Light stimulation was delivered by a fiber optic light source (Oriel). Signals were amplified by means of a WPI Dam 60 preamplifier (WPI) and digitized using Superscope II (GW Instruments). We employed the yeast two-hybrid method using the LexA system (21Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Suppl. 33. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar), with eye-PKC (Fig. 1 A) and INAD fused with the LexA DNA binding domain and a transcription activation domain, respectively. A positive interaction between the two proteins will activate transcription of two reporter genes. Leu2activation results in growth of yeast on plates lacking leucine, andLacZ gives colonies with a blue color on plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Xgal). We used the expression of LacZ as a means for quantitation. As a negative control, SNF1, a yeast serine/threonine protein kinase fusion (23Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), was shown not to interact with INAD (Fig. 1 B). The amino and carboxyl terminus domains of eye-PKC contain amino acid sequences unique to this PKC (12Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and may be the basis for the interaction with INAD. We initially found that INAD interacts with both full-length eye-PKC and PKC-18 (which contains residues 18–700) as shown by LacZ reporter activity (Fig. 1 B). To assess the role of the amino terminus in interaction, we tested an amino terminus fragment (PKC-NH2, Fig. 1 A) and found that it did not interact with INAD (Fig. 1 B). Although the carboxyl terminus (PKC562–700, Fig. 1 A) was the obvious determinant for association (Fig. 1 B), we attempted to identify the scope of interaction by deleting eye-PKC to within 70 (represented as PKC631–700), 26 (PKC675–700), 20, 10, 4, and finally 3 amino acid residues of the carboxyl terminus without a loss of association with INAD (Fig. 1). The last three residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of eye-PKC, Thr-Ile-Ile (TII), fit the general motif for a PDZ domain interaction. PDZ domains typically interact with the carboxyl-terminal tail of proteins that terminate (0 position) with a hydrophobic residue (such as Val, Ile, or an aromatic residue, Phe) and have Ser or Thr or Asp at the −2 position (26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were made to determine the critical residues required for the association. The final amino acid residue, Ile, when changed to Val, slightly decreases the interaction with INAD when tested in a protein fusion that contains the last 10 amino acid residues of eye-PKC (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the Asp or Asn substitution markedly reduces the association (Fig. 1 B). We also examined the Asp substitution in the context of PKC-18 (PKC-18 TID). PKC-18 TID fails to associate with full-length INAD (Fig. 1 B) nor does it interact with the second PDZ domain of INAD (results not shown). INAD was first predicted to contain two PDZ domains (19Shieh B.-H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but further analysis suggests that there are five PDZ domains in the protein (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 27Saras J. Heldin C-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 11: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These PDZ domains are named sequentially PDZ1 to PDZ5 in the text. The PDZ domains of INAD in Drosophila and Calliphora, the blowfly, (13Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) are aligned in Fig. 2 A to show the similarity of each individual PDZ domain from these two dipteran species. Although these five regions share the general characteristics of PDZ domains, the individual sequences (PDZ1 to PDZ5) are distinct and divergent. This is consistent with the notion that they interact with different proteins. To map the region of INAD that interacts with eye-PKC, a series of INAD constructs were fused to the transcription activation domain and tested against PKC-18. These INAD fusion proteins are named according to the PDZ domains they encompass (Fig. 2 B). We show strong association between PKC-18 with PDZ1–2 and PDZ2 (Fig. 2 C). We also observed a weak yet detectable interaction between PKC-18 and PDZ1. However, no eye-PKC association with either PDZ2–5 or PDZ2–3 was detected (Fig. 2 C). These results, observed consistently in several independent experiments, indicate that eye-PKC interacts with PDZ1 and PDZ2, with PDZ2 showing a stronger interaction (See Fig. 3 C). To account for the lack of association between eye-PKC and PDZ2–3 or PDZ2–5, which also contain PDZ2, we propose that PDZ3 may interfere with PDZ2 binding to eye-PKC. Consistent with this hypothesis, is the observation that a weaker interaction between full-length INAD and eye-PKC was detected. A recent report suggests that eye-PKC interacts with PDZ4 (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). We therefore paid special attention to this region of the protein. Three additional constructs that encompass PDZ4 (Fig. 2 B) were tested, including PDZ4A, which contains exactly the same region of INAD as was reported to interact with eye-PKC (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). All of these PDZ4 fusion proteins fail to associate with eye-PKC. The expression level of these fusion proteins is similar to or higher than that of PDZ1–2 and should be sufficient to allow detection of an interaction with PKC-18 (Fig. 2 C). To confirm that eye-PKC interacts with INAD via the PDZ domains, amino acid substitutions were introduced in the PDZ domain to modify the structure. It is known from the crystal structure of a peptide-PDZ domain complex that the PDZ domain binding to the amino-terminal hydrophobic residue is dependent on a “carboxylate binding loop” (29Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 30Morais-Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Residues in this loop of PDZ1-PDZ5 are shownboxed in Fig. 2 A. eye-PKC appears to show a weak interaction with PDZ1 (Fig. 2 C and 3 C). We mutated PDZ1 by changing Lys-22 to Ser, Gly-29 to Glu, Ile-30 to His, and Ile-32 to Thr in PDZ1*. These nonconserved substitutions are likely to bring about a change in the structure of PDZ1. These mutations eliminated the interaction between PDZ1 and eye-PKC (Fig. 2 Cand 3 C). We analyzed a modified PDZ2 (PDZ2*) that contains the following substitutions: Arg-254 to Ser, Leu-260 to Gln, Gly-261 to Glu, and Leu-262 to His. We observed a marked reduction of the interaction between the modified PDZ2 and PKC-18 (Fig. 2 Cand 3 C). Taken together, our findings provide evidence for a strong interaction between the second PDZ domain of INAD and the last three residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of eye-PKC. To further confirm the results obtained above, we employed ligand overlay assay. This method was used successfully to define the interaction between the third PDZ domain of INAD and TRP (17Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PDZ2, PDZ1–2, and PDZ4 were radiolabeled and probed in filters containing retinal extracts and bacterial extracts containing either an eye-PKC fusion protein or T7 gene 10, respectively. Fig. 4 shows that both PDZ2 and PDZ1–2 display strong and specific association with retinal eye-PKC and PKC fusion protein. In contrast, PDZ4 recognizes neither retinal PKC nor PKC fusion. Interestingly, in PDZ1–2, the presence of PDZ1 somehow potentiates the interaction of PDZ2 with its targets, whereas PDZ1 alone only weakly associates with PKC (data not shown). These findings agree with those obtained by the yeast two-hybrid assay, providing further evidence that PDZ2 interacts with eye-PKC. To gain insight into the functional significance of the eye-PKC/INAD association in vivo, we generated transgenic flies lacking the interaction and examined the visual electrophysiology. We investigated a point mutation in eye-PKC, eye-PKCI700D, that eliminates the interaction of the kinase with INAD (Fig. 1 B) without the modifications in those domains required for the predicted kinase activity (12Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Transgenic flies expressing eye-PKCI700D under the control of aDrosophila heat-inducible promoter (hsp70) were generated in an eye-PKC null (inaCp209) (12Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) genetic background. After heat shock treatment, the expression of eye-PKCI700D was comparable with that of eye-PKC in wild-type flies (Fig. 5 A). The function of eye-PKCI700D was analyzed by ERG (Fig. 5 B), showing that eye-PKCI700D displays a phenotype indistinguishable from that ofinaCp209 (Fig. 5 B). This abnormal phenotype of inaCp209 is characterized by a slowly decaying receptor potential during the light pulse (desensitization) and delayed deactivation upon cessation of light stimulation (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, transgenic flies expressing wild-type eye-PKC rescue the defective visual physiology ofinaCp209(Fig. 5 B). We conclude that disruption of the eye-PKC-INAD interaction in eye-PKCI700Dresults in a complete loss of the eye-PKC activity in vivo. InaDp215 flies express a mutant INAD protein that does not interact with TRP (17Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To determine how the phenotype of inaCp209 flies is modified in the absence of the INAD/TRP interaction, we generatedinaCp209,InaDp215 double mutants. The lack of eye-PKC was confirmed by Western blotting, and the presence of mutant INAD was confirmed by a loss of TRP binding in an overlay assay (Fig. 6). ERG recordings of theinaCp209,InaDp215 double mutant were compared with those of wild-type and single mutant flies. In the experimental paradigm used, flies were dark-adapted for 90 s then given two 5-s pulses of the orange light with a 6-s interval. As shown in Fig. 7, wild-type flies respond to light with fast kinetics and show desensitization during the light pulse. Importantly, the response to a subsequent stimulation of the same light intensity is not inactivated in wild-type flies, such that a second light pulse triggers a response almost the same as the initial one. Neither of the single mutant flies (inaCp209 or InaDp215) shows response inactivation under the experimental conditions (Fig. 7). In contrast, the double mutants display a marked reduction in this response to a second pulse of light. The peak amplitude of the second light response for wild-type, inaCp209 andInaDp215 flies was approximately 90% that of the first light response (wild-type, 91 ± 6.2%; InaD, 90 ± 5.0%; inaC, 95 ± 5.1%, n= 5). For theinaCp209,InaDp215 double mutant, the peak amplitude of the second response was greatly reduced (44% ± 7.5%, n = 10) (Fig. 7). Double mutants also show abnormal deactivation similar toinaC. We measured the rate of deactivation as the time required for the light response to decay to 50% upon cessation of the light pulse. For wild-type and InaDp215 flies, deactivation kinetics were very rapid (wild-type, 27.4 ± 3.0 ms;InaD, 29.1 ± 2.7 ms, n = 10). For theinaCp209,InaDp215 double mutant, the rate of deactivation was at least 80-fold slower than wild type and is similar to that of inaC flies (inaC, 2372 ± 640 ms; inaC, InaD, 2430 ± 430 ms, n = 10) (Fig. 7). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the regions of eye-PKC and INAD that interact and to determine the type of interaction. We found that the carboxyl-terminal tail of eye-PKC associates with predominantly the second PDZ domain of INAD. A fusion protein containing only the last three carboxyl-terminal residues of eye-PKC, Thr-Ile-Ile, interacts with INAD. This terminal sequence is consistent with the tripeptide motif, (S/T/D)X(V/I/F) (X is any amino acid) that specifies the association with a PDZ domain (26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Substitution of the ultimate isoleucine with an aspartic acid or an asparagine disrupts the interaction with INAD. To gain insight into the in vivo function that the eye-PKC-INAD interaction specifies, we generated transgenic flies expressing eye-PKCI700D that will lack the INAD association. Significantly, these transgenic flies in theinaCp209 genetic background display an ERG phenotype of abnormal deactivation and desensitization similar to that of inaCp209. This indicates that eye-PKCI700D fails to rescue the mutant phenotype. Thus, a lack of PKC interaction with INAD results in a complete loss ofin vivo eye-PKC activity. This may be due to mis-localization of this enzyme, in turn rendering eye-PKC unable to phosphorylate specific substrates involved in regulation of the visual response. To investigate how eye-PKC and INAD regulate the visual response, we characterized the electrophysiology of ainaCp209,InaDp215 double mutant. We found that the double mutants display a more severe response inactivation, whereas inaC and InaD flies show no inactivation phenotype under the same experimental conditions. Response inactivation may result from depletion of limiting factors such as internal messengers and/or precursors, leading to exhaustion of the excitatory process (11Hardie R.C. Peretz A. Suss-Toby E. Rom-Glas A. Bishop S.A. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nature. 1993; 363: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is also likely that inactivation is due to defects in re-setting the proteins to the resting state such as conversion of metarhodopsin to rhodopsin (31Cosens D. Briscoe D. J. Insect Physiol. 1972; 18: 627-632Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Hillman P. Hochstein S. Minke B. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 668-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our finding suggests that the presence of both eye-PKC and TRP in the complex cooperatively contributes to regulation of sensitivity of photoreceptors. One potential function of the signaling complex is to ensure eye-PKC and TRP are in close proximity for efficient regulation of the light response. A simple interpretation of the interdependence of eye-PKC and TRP is that eye-PKC regulates an intermediate, also associated with the signaling complex, that acts on TRP. Alternatively, eye-PKC may directly regulate TRP or regulate another molecule(s) via TRP. Such a model for eye-PKC regulation via the signaling complex has been proposed (14Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bahner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and our analysis of the inaC,InaD double mutant provides the supporting evidence. Our finding that the response inactivation is more pronounced in the double mutant suggests that this regulatory step is partially activated in the absence of eye-PKC. It is possible that compensatory mechanisms differ during the development of the single and double mutants. It is also possible that this activity is constitutive or is modulated by another effector(s) in addition to eye-PKC. Candidate substrates for eye-PKC include TRP, as mentioned, NORPA, INAD, or another unidentified molecule(s) present in the signaling complex. There is no evidence that either NORPA or TRP are phosphorylated during the light response. Light-induced phosphorylation has been demonstrated in vitro for CalliphoraINAD (13Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus INAD is a possible substrate of eye-PKC. INAD contains no domains with an obvious catalytic function, and if phosphorylation of INAD is part of the eye-PKC regulatory process, it may achieve its effect by altering the protein binding properties of INAD. This could change the composition or function of molecules within the signaling complex. Our yeast two-hybrid and ligand overlay results both indicate that predominantly the second PDZ domain of INAD associates with eye-PKC, whereas no interaction was detected with PDZ4. This result is different from a previous report in which interaction of eye-PKC with the fourth PDZ domain of INAD was detected by affinity chromatography (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). We tested a total of five constructs that contained the fourth PDZ domain without any indication of this interaction. These included a fusion protein that contained exactly the same region as was tested before (16Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these conflicting results is that the different assay systems are measuring different types of association between eye-PKC and INAD. INAD may bind and cluster eye-PKC to the signaling complex, and it can also act as a substrate for the kinase activity (13Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We showed that amino acid substitutions made in the second PDZ domain of INAD disrupted the eye-PKC binding. None of these amino acid changes were near serine or threonine residues that are putative PKC phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, mutations in the carboxyl-terminal tail of PKC abolish its binding to the second PDZ domain. Thus the interaction we describe for eye-PKC/INAD is a typical carboxyl-terminal tail/PDZ domain association. The basis of the reported interaction with the fourth PDZ domain remains to be determined. Another provocative explanation could be that eye-PKC may bind different PDZ domains of INAD during different physiological conditions. For example, phosphorylation of INAD may change the relative affinity of the interaction in PDZ2 and PDZ4. Clarification of the role of these two eye-PKC/INAD interactions will require analysis of transgenic flies expressing modified InaD in which these PDZ domain are mutated. We thank Drs. L. E.

This response appears to be controlled by a membrane-delimited mechanism via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-proteins, in which the Go α subunit has been shown to mediate an inhibitory signal to HVA Ca2+channels. The primary structures of multiple subtypes of G-protein α subunits (Gα) including Goα have been deduced by molecular cloning and sequencing of their cDNAs. These studies revealed very similar but distinct amino acid sequences for each subtype cloned (7Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen, however, which subtypes of Gα preferentially interact with HVA Ca2+ channels such as N- and P/Q-types. In the previous study using mutant and chimeric channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (8Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17585-17594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), our results provided evidence that the cytoplasmic I-II loop (referred to as “loop 1” in the present study) of N-type (α1B) Ca2+ channels is a regulatory site for the G-protein βγ dimer (Gβγ) and the C termini of P/Q- (α1A) and N-type Ca2+ channels for Gα. However, this does not answer the question as to whether Gα, as well as Gβγ (9Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 10De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), directly interact with these Ca2+ channels. To address these issues, we have expressed α1B and α1A HVA Ca2+ channels in Xenopusoocytes, in which the effects of intracellularly applied loop 1 and C-terminal peptides derived from α1B and α1A were investigated. Furthermore, a direct association of Gα and Gβγ with these Ca2+ channels was determined by in vitro binding using glutathioneS-transferase (GST) proteins fused with the loop 1 and the C-terminal segments of α1B or α1A. These results, taken together with the findings of the previous study (8Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol.

The pSPA1, pSPA2, pSP72, pSP65, and pSP64 recombinant plasmids carrying the entire protein-coding sequences of Gα (Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, Go1α, Gzα, and Gsα), Gβ1, Gγ2, δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and the Ca2+ channel α1B, α1A, α1C, α2, and β1a subunits were described previously (8Furukawa T.

Kozasa T. Nagata S. Nakamura S. Katada T. Ui M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). cRNAs specific for α1A, α1B, α1C, α2, and β1a subunits of the Ca2+ channel, DOR, β2AR, and six isoforms of Gα, Gβ1, or Gγ2 were synthesizedin vitro using the MEGAscript SP6 kit (Ambion). According to the methods described in the companion paper (8Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17585-17594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNAs and subjected to electrophysiological measurements. cRNAs were used either with 0.3 μg/μl α1 (α1B, α1A, or α1C) cRNA in combination with 0.2 μg/μl α2 cRNA and 0.1 μg/μl β1acRNA; 0.03 μg/μl receptor (DOR or β2AR) cRNA; 0.05 μg/μl Gα cRNA; or 0.05 μg/μl Gβ1 cRNA and 0.025 μg/μl Gγ2 cRNA, unless otherwise specified. The antisense oligonucleotide AGO (0.1 μg/μl, 50 nl) complementary to the Xenopus Goα mRNA (8Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17585-17594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was injected 12–16 h prior to electrophysiological measurements. The sense oligonucleotide SGO, TCCCCCCCCGAGCAGTCATG, complementary to AGO was applied in the same manner as AGO. The following six kinds of peptides (Sawady, Japan) were synthesized based upon the amino acid sequence of the α1B or α1A subunits (see Fig. 4): PL1 (amino acid residues 366–384 of α1B), PB3T1 (amino acid residues 1934–1943 of α1B), PB3T2 (amino acid residues 2016–2025 of α1B), PB3T3 (amino acid residues 1907–1925 of α1B), PB3T4 (amino acid residues 1931–1949 of α1B), and PPQT1 (amino acid residues 2028–2046 of α1A). The peptide, PL1, also corresponds to the amino acid residues 370–388 of α1A. These synthetic peptides (10 μm) were injected 15 h prior to electrophysiological measurements. Injection of 50 nl of 10 μm cyclic AMP or 10 units/μl catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (Sigma) was carried out 30 min prior to electrophysiological measurements. For the pretreatment with 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (H7), the oocytes were incubated with 100 μm H7 for 1 h prior to measurement. In experiments in which PTX was used, the oocytes were preincubated with the toxin (200 ng/ml) for about 24 h prior to electrophysiological measurements. In some experiments, multiple single channel events in a membrane patch were recorded from oocytes as an ensemble average (or “pseudomacroscopic”), using an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany). The procedure was similar to that described elsewhere (14Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Cell-attached membrane patches were obtained using fire-polished borosilicate pipettes (Narishige, GD-1.5, Japan) having a resistance of 2–4 megohms (tip diameter ∼1 μm) when filled with the pipette solution. The pipette solution contained 110 mm BaCl2 and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium-OH). Oocytes that were implanted with α1B, α2, β1a, DOR, and Gi3α, and then injected with the antisense AGO, were bathed in a depolarizing solution consisting of 90 mmK+, 10 mm Na+, 1 mmMg2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 104 mmCl−, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with KOH). Under these experimental conditions, the average membrane potential was −2 ± 4 mV (n = 5). To apply Leu-enkephalin (Leu-EK) inside the patch electrode, a thin polyethylene tube having a tapered tip of about 100 μm in diameter was inserted into the glass pipette and used as an inlet tubing (18Soejima M. Noma A. Pfluegers Arch. 1984; 400: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Through this thin tubing, near (about 0.5 mm) the tip of the patch pipette, the pipette solution containing 50 μm Leu-EK was applied slowly using a syringe microinjector. Because the volume of injection was small (0.5–1.0 μl, about 1/50 volume of the solution in the pipette), no waste chamber (reservoir) was attached to the patch electrode. A negative pressure of about 30–40 cm H2O was applied to the patch electrode to minimize the mechanical effects of the pressure injection. Data acquisition and analysis were done on a computer using the software, DAAD system (19Yoshii M. Watabe S. Brain Res. 1994; 642: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, statistical data were represented by the mean and S.E. By using aHindIII linker, the Gα cDNA fragment (15Takao K. Yoshii M. Kanda A. Kokubun S. Nukada T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) containing the entire protein coding segment of Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, or Go1α was inserted into the HindIII site of the pKGSαN (20Nukada T. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), to yield expression vector, pKGi1α, pKGi2α, pKGi3α, or pKGo1α. NG108-15 cells in culture were transfected with the above plasmids by electroporation (20Nukada T. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the voltage was set at 1.7 kV and the capacitance at 20 microfarads. Transformants were selected in culture medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. One hundred clones of the ∼1 × 107 cells transfected were transformed to G418 resistance. Among these G418-resistant transformants, Gα-transformed NG108-15 clones were selected out by blot hybridization analysis (20Nukada T. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), using total cellular RNA prepared from each transformant and each cDNA fragment containing a protein coding segment as a probe. The presence of a hybridizable RNA species with an expected size from the construction was used to measure the transformants of NG108-15 cells by Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, or Go1α (20Nukada T. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Gi1α- (NGi1-1 and NGi1-3), Gi2α- (NGi2-5 and NGi2-6), Gi3α- (NGi3-6 and NGi3-13), and Go1α-transformed clones (NGo-13 and NGo-18) and non-transfected NG108-15 cells were plated at a density of 1–5 × 105 cells/35-mm polyornithine-coated dish, as described previously (21Higashida H. Hashii M. Fukuda K. Caulfield M.P. Numa S. Brown D.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 242: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 2–3 weeks in “differentiation” medium supplemented with 0.25 mmdibutyryl cyclic AMP to induce differentiation (22Nirenberg M. Wilson S. Higashida H. Rotter A. Krueger K. Busis N. Ray R. Kenimer J.G. Adler M. Science. 1983; 222: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Ca2+ currents were recorded by a whole cell variation of the patch-clamp technique (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) using the continuous or discontinuous single electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (Axoclamp-2, Axon Instruments). Low voltage-activated (T-type) and HVA (N/L-type) Ca2+ channel currents were recorded by a continuous mode (24Tsunoo A. Yoshii M. Narahashi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); the N-type component was observed by a discontinuous mode as described previously (21Higashida H. Hashii M. Fukuda K. Caulfield M.P. Numa S. Brown D.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 242: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The extracellular solution consisted of 50 mm BaCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CsCl, 20 mm glucose, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 μm tetrodotoxin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.24). The patch electrode contained solutions of the following composition: 150 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors were stimulated by a focal application of 1 mm ACh (3 μl). In experiments in which PTX was used, the cells were preincubated with the toxin (500 ng/ml) for 12–14 h prior to the measurements. The electrophysiological experiments were carried out at approximately 30 °C. Statistical data were represented by the mean and S.E. The 1.6-kilobase pair SrfI/SalI fragment (encoding amino acid residues 1912–2339 of the α1B subunit) and the 1.4-kilobase pair ScaI/BamHI fragment (encoding amino acid residues 1975–2424 of the α1Asubunit) were excised from the plasmids pSPB3 (16Wakamori M. Niidome T. Furutama D. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Fujita Y. Tanaka I. Katayama K. Yatani A. Schwartz A. Mori Y. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar) and pSPCBI-2 (14Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and fused in-frame to the GST coding sequence in pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce GST fusion proteins of C terminus (GST-B3T and GST-B1T), respectively. Similarly, to produce GST fusion proteins of loop 1 (GST-B3L1 or GST-B1L1), the 380-base pair fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), encoding either amino acid residues 361–483 of the α1B subunit or 365–489 of the α1A subunit, was fused in-frame. The sets of primers for PCR were GGAGAATTCGTAAGGAGCGCGAGAGA and TCTGTGCCTTCACCATGCGCC for α1B and GGGGAATTCGCAAAGAAAGGGAGCGG and AGAAGGCCTGAGTTTTGACCATG for α1A. The plasmids pSPB3 and pSPCBI-2 were used as a template for PCR. Four kinds of fusion proteins or GST proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside, and prepared according to the procedure described previously (25Grieco F. Hay J.M. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-858PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 5 h and washed five times with 40 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Approximately 10 μg of GST, or GST-fusion proteins, bound to beads were used in each binding assay. Ten micrograms of purified bovine brain Goα (26Asano T. Kamiya N. Morishita R. Kato K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 103: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Gβγ2 complex (27Asano T. Morishita R. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20512-20519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with the beads that had been equilibrated with buffer solutions supplemented with 0.1% Lubrol PX and 0.6% sodium cholate, respectively. These buffers contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaPO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm benzamidine). Then, the beads were washed with 40 volumes of the same buffer solutions and denatured by heating to 90 °C for 3 min in 200 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. Proteins (70 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) for Western blotting and detection by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (28Nakamura F. Ogata K. Shiozaki K. Kameyama K. Ohara K. Haga T. Nukada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12676-12681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody, GoAB, raised against the C-terminal decapeptide of Goα (FGo) (29Ohara-Imaizumi M. Kameyama K. Kawae N. Takeda K. Muramatsu S. Kumakura K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2275-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Tatsuya Haga, and the antibodies, K-20 and M-14, against Goα and Gβ1, respectively, were purchased from Santa Cruz. The first antibody when used was diluted appropriately to reduce nonspecific reactivity, and the second antibody (biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the peroxidase-streptavidin (Vector) were both diluted at 1:2000. Each incubation was for 1 h at room temperature. The decapeptide FGo (Sawady, Japan) was synthesized based upon the amino acid sequence corresponding to the amino acid residues 345–354 of Goα (29Ohara-Imaizumi M. Kameyama K. Kawae N. Takeda K. Muramatsu S. Kumakura K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2275-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The peptide antigens sc-387P (for K-20) and sc-261P (for M-14) were also purchased from Santa Cruz. The GST fusion proteins (GST-B3T, GST-B1T, GST-B3L1, and GST-B1L1) and GST proteins were tested more than three times for their ability to bind Goα and Gβγ2. There was no essential difference between GoAB and K-20 in detecting specific bindings of Goα to the fusion proteins. In the previous study (8Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17585-17594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), N-type (α1B), P/Q-type (α1A), and L-type (α1C) Ca2+ channels were shown to be functionally expressed inXenopus oocytes, and α1B and α1Achannels were negatively regulated by Gi3α and Gβ1γ2. To determine further which Gα isoforms regulate HVA Ca2+ channels, either Gα cRNA (for six different isoforms: Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, Go1α, Gzα, and Gsα) or Gβ1 plus Gγ2 cRNAs were injected into oocytes in combination with the Ca2+channel α1 (α1B or α1A), α2 and β1a subunits cRNAs and receptor (DOR or β2AR) cRNA. When Gsα was expressed, β2AR was co-expressed, and the receptor was stimulated by 1 μm isoproterenol, an agonist of the β-adrenergic receptor. Agonist-induced inhibitions of α1B channels were less pronounced in oocytes co-injected with Gi1α, Gi2α, or Gβ1γ2 cRNA, as compared with control oocytes injected with Ca2+ channel subunits (α1B, α2, and β1a) and DOR (Fig. 1 A,upper). Also, Leu-EK-induced inhibition was diminished in oocytes implanted with Gzα. Alternatively, the response to Leu-EK of α1B channels was not affected significantly in oocytes co-expressed with Gi3α, Go1α, or Gsα. As shown in Fig. 1 A (upper), PTX (200 ng/ml) blocked the agonist-induced inhibition of α1B channels with Gi3α but not with Gzα nor Gsα. These observations are consistent with the fact that Gi3α is PTX-sensitive, and Gzα and Gsα are PTX-insensitive G-proteins (30Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4715) Google Scholar). Because a PTX-insensitive component of the response was increased in oocytes co-expressed with the PTX-insensitive Gzα or Gsα, it was presumed that a maximal inhibition of the α1B channel was already attained by endogenous oocyte G-proteins and that introduced Gzα or Gsα was capable of replacing endogenous G-proteins when exerting current inhibition. Therefore, in order to unmask the effects of exogenous Gα, the antisense oligonucleotide, AGO, directed against mRNAs encoding Xenopus Goα (8Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17585-17594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was injected prior to the electrophysiological studies. As expected, Leu-EK-induced inhibition of α1B channels in control oocytes (without exogenous Gα subtypes) was reduced by 42.3 ± 7.4% (n = 25) in the presence of antisense oligonucleotide AGO. As a result, the hierarchy of exogenous Gα subtypes in inhibiting α1B channels could be more clearly recognized (Fig. 1 A, lower) when compared with antisense-free control experiments (Fig. 1 A,upper). Sense oligonucleotide, SGO, to XenopusGoα had no effects on the inhibition of α1Bchannels (n = 6). After antisense treatment, the agonist-induced inhibition of N-type α1B currents was further pronounced in oocytes injected with Gi3α, Go1α, Gzα, or Gsα cRNA (Fig. 1 A, lower). Here, the action of Gsα would not be associated with adenylate cyclase, since the injection of 50 nl of 10 μm cyclic AMP (n = 3) or 10 units/μl catalytic subunit of PKA (n = 3) failed to influence α1B currents. Moreover, the pretreatment with 100 μm H7, a inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, did not affect the agonist-induced inhibition of α1B currents (n = 6). However, in the case of L-type α1C channels, the catalytic subunit of PKA increased their current amplitude by 82.8 ± 10.9% (n = 6). In oocytes injected with cRNAs for Ca2+ channel subunits (α1B, α2, and β1a) and β2AR, isoproterenol-induced inhibition of α1B channels was 17.5 ± 1.2% (n = 45). To exclude further the possibility that such diffusible second messengers might be involved in the effects of G-proteins in potentiating the agonist-induced inhibition of N-type α1Bchannels, cell-attached patch recordings were performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). In oocytes implanted with N-type Ca2+ channel subunits, DOR and Gi3α, multiple single channel currents through a membrane patch were suppressed by Leu-EK applied to the patch, but the application to the rest of the cell membrane was ineffective (n = 4). The extent of inhibition was 48.0 ± 8.0% (n = 4), which was comparable to that observed for the whole cell currents of oocytes (Fig. 1 A, lower). Thus, Leu-EK has to be applied directly to the recording membrane patch to induce current inhibition, indicating that the Leu-EK-induced inhibition of α1Bchannels associated with Gi3α employs a membrane-delimited pathway as predicted in native neurons. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the extent to which Leu-EK inhibited α1B channels was dependent on the amount of Gα cRNA injected. The rank order of efficiency among Gα subtypes examined was Gi3α > Go1α > Gzα. The agonist-induced current inhibition was considerably reduced when a low concentration (15 ng/μl) of Gzα cRNA was applied. By contrast, oocytes implanted with Gi2α or Gβ1γ2 cRNA showed no effect on the Leu-EK-induced current inhibition, whereas oocytes injected with Gi1α showed an attenuating effect (Fig. 1 A,lower). Unlike N-type α1B channels (Fig. 1 A,upper), P/Q-type α1A channels revealed more conspicuous intensifications of the agonist-induced inhibition by exogenous Gα, probably a result of weak masking effects of endogenous G-proteins (Fig. 1 B, upper). The agonist-induced inhibition of currents was potentiated in those oocytes co-expressed with Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, or Go1α but not with Gzα or Gsα, regardless of antisense oligonucleotide (AGO) injection (Fig. 1 B), although AGO did attenuate the Leu-EK-induced inhibition of α1A channels by 23.2 ± 8.6% (n = 6), as compared with its effect on α1B channels (42.3 ± 7.4%, n = 25). In addition, the agonist-induced inhibition of α1Achannels was diminished in PTX-treated oocytes co-expressed with Gi3α (Fig. 1 B, upper). In oocytes co-expressed with the PTX-insensitive Gsα, the blockade of agonist-induced inhibition of α1A channels by PTX was at the same level as in control oocytes absent of exogenous Gα. This finding is consistent with the observation that the agonist-induced inhibition of α1A currents was not potentiated in oocytes co-expressed with Gsα. The inhibition of α1A channels was not potentiated in oocytes co-expressed with Gβ1γ2, similar to α1Bchannels. By contrast, the agonists never evoked an inhibition of L-type α1C currents in oocytes expressed with the Ca2+ channel α1C, α2, and β1a subunits and the receptor (DOR or β2AR) in combination with either of the six different isoforms of Gα (n = 6–30) or Gβ1γ2(n = 6), even if the concentration of Gi3α cRNA injected was increased to 150 ng/μl (n = 4). To examine whether specifications of Gα-mediated inhibition of HVA Ca2+ channels are reproducible in neuronal cells, we investigated the mechanism by which native HVA Ca2+channels are regulated by Gα in NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cells. NG108-15 cells express N- and L-type Ca2+ channels (31Kasai H. Neher E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1992; 448: 161-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Taussig R. Sanchez S. Rifo M.

These native HVA Ca2+ channels were sensitive to 10 μmnifedipine (n = 10) or 0.3 μmω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CTx) (n = 6), but not to 0.3 μm ω-agatoxin IVA (n = 3). Puff application of 1 mm ACh inhibited HVA Ca2+currents in the presence of nifedipine (n = 5). On the other hand, ACh did not inhibit HVA Ca2+ currents in the presence of both nifedipine and ω-CTx (n = 4). These results indicate that ACh inhibits N-type Ca2+ channel currents in NG108-15 cells.

From 112 to 246 amino acids were deleted from the α-subunit region comprising amino acids 469–729. The receptor constructs were expressed as soluble insulin receptor IgG fusion proteins in baby hamster kidney cells and were characterized in binding assays by immunoblotting and chemical cross-linking with radiolabeled insulin. The shortest receptor fragment identified was a free monomeric α-subunit deleted of amino acids 469–703 and 718–729 (exon 11); the mass of this receptor fragment was found by mass spectrometry to be 70 kDa. This small insulin receptor fragment bound insulin with an affinity (Kd) of 4.4 nm, which is similar to what was found for the full-length ectodomain of the insulin receptor (5.0 nm). Cross-linking experiments confirmed that the 70-kDa receptor fragment specifically bound insulin.In summary we have minimized the insulin binding domain of the insulin receptor by identifying a 70-kDa fragment of the ectodomain that retains insulin binding affinity making this an interesting candidate for detailed structural analysis.

Insulin mediates its effects by binding to specific tyrosine kinase receptors in the plasma membrane of target cells. The structure of the insulin receptor has been investigated extensively and recently reviewed (1Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tavaré J.M.

The insulin receptor is a glycoprotein of a relative molecular mass of 350–400 kDa, which is synthesized as a single chain polypeptide and proteolytically cleaved yielding a disulfide-linked α-β monomer insulin receptor. Two α-β monomers are linked by disulfide bonds between the α-subunits, resulting in the β-α-α-β receptor subunit configuration. The exact disulfide pattern responsible for this receptor configuration was elusive for a long time until first an α-α contact was shown to connect Cys-524 of the two monomers (5Schäffer L. Ljungqvist L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and more recently Sparrow et al. (6Sparrow L.G. McKern N.M. Gorman J.J. Strike P.M.

The intracellular part of the β-subunit includes the tyrosine kinase domain that acquire kinase activity upon binding of insulin to epitopes in the ectodomain. The x-ray crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain has been solved (10Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), whereas detailed three-dimensional structure of the insulin-binding site is not available, so only indirect information can be used to identify important structural features necessary for insulin binding. Predictions of the tertiary structure of the IR ectodomain have been based on alignment with epidermal growth factor receptor sequences (11Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The consensus from these alignments is that the insulin receptor α-subunits have two large homologous domains, L1 and L2, separated by a cysteine-rich region. The L1 and L2 domains are comprised of four repeats of α-helices followed by β-strand, turn, and β-strand. The best conserved feature in these repeats is a central glycine residue responsible for the turn (11Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The L1 region spans amino acids 1–155 (nomenclature of Ebina et al. (13Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.-H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar)), and the cysteine-rich region comprises residues 155–312, and L2 comprises residues 313–468 (12Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the first 468 amino acids of the α-subunit are predicted to be well defined domains with extensive homologies to the epidermal growth factor receptor. The corresponding domain of the IGFI receptor (1–486) was expressed in C6 rat glioblastoma cells resulting in inhibited IGFI receptor signaling and inhibition of growth (14D'Ambrosio C. Ferber A. Resnicoff M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4013-4020PubMed Google Scholar), and recently McKern et al. (15McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Verkuylen A. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Ivancic N.

The major ligand binding determinants of the IR appear to reside in the α-subunit. Studies with chimeric receptors (16Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K.

Other cross-linking studies have identified hormone-receptor contact sites in the cysteine-rich region (20Yip C.C. Hsu H. Patel R.G. Hawley D.M. Maddux B.A. Goldfine I.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicate that an important binding domain is found between amino acids 704 and 716. The insulin contact sites are apparently located exclusively in the α-subunit which was further verified by investigating expression of free α-subunit in COS cells (25Schaefer E.M. Siddle K. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13248-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-subunit was secreted as a monomer that bound insulin with near wild-type affinity, but the expression level of free α-subunit was low allowing only limited characterization (25Schaefer E.M. Siddle K. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13248-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin receptor deletion mutants have previously been expressed by two groups; Kadowaki et al. (26Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Cama A. Marcus-Samuels B. Rovira A. Bevins C.L. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21285-21296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described an insulin receptor deleted of amino acids 486–569, and Sung et al. (27Sung C.K. Wong K.Y. Yip C.C. Hawley D.M. Goldfine I.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 315-324PubMed Google Scholar) expressed a receptor with deletion of amino acids 485–599. Both groups found that the mutated receptors bound insulin with high affinity. In the present study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a series of insulin receptors with deletions of 112–246 amino acids in the IR region 469–729 (exons 7–11). The receptors were stably expressed in BHK cells as soluble receptor IgG fusion protein, and secreted protein was characterized in binding assays, by immunoblotting, and chemical cross-linking, and molecular weight was determined by mass spectrometry. By using this approach we succeeded in identifying and characterizing a 70-kDa fragment of the insulin receptor. This receptor fragment is a free monomeric α-subunit deleted of amino acids 469–703 and 718–729 that binds insulin with an affinity comparable to the intact ectodomain. Insulin, insulin analogue X92 (A8H, B10D, B25Y-amide, and des-B26–30 insulin), and A14-125I-insulin and A14-125I-X92 were from Novo Nordisk. cDNA encoding IR-IgG fusion protein was a gift of Dr. Joseph Bass, University of Chicago. DNA restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and PNGaseF were from New England Biolabs; Pwo polymerase was from Boehringer Mannheim. Neuraminidase was from Sigma. Preparation of plasmid DNA and agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed according to standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10 or 2% fetal calf serum.Staphylococcus aureus protein A was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and DSS (disuccinimidyl suberate) was from Pierce. An overview of the deletion constructs and the abbreviations used are shown in TableI. The deletion mutants were expressed as soluble insulin receptor (IR) IgG fusion protein, consisting of the IR ectodomain fused to the Fc region of the IgG heavy chain (29Bass J. Kurose T.

This fragment was digested with BglII andEagI and ligated into the corresponding site of the plasmid encoding IRwt, resulting in a cDNA sequence where amino acids 485–599 are deleted. IRΔ613 and IRΔ629 were made using same strategy (BglII/EagI site), and the sense primers 5′-TGACAAGATCTTGAAGTGGAAACCACCCTCCG-3′ and 5′-TGACAAGATCTTGGTTTTCTGGGAGAGGCAGG-3′, respectively (BglII sites underlined). In the construct IRΔ649, exons 7–9 were deleted by PCR amplification using a sense primer located upstream from Bsu36I site (amino acids 417–419) and the antisense primer 5′-AGGTCCTCGAGGGCAGCTTCAGCCCACAGGATGCCTTGTCCCC-3′ (XhoI site underlined). This fragment was digested withBsu36I and XhoI and ligated into corresponding site of the plasmid encoding IRwt, resulting in a cDNA sequence in which amino acids 469–649 are deleted. IRΔ673 was constructed by overlap extension of fragments I and II. Fragment I was amplified using a sense primer upstream from Bsu36I site and the antisense primer 5′-CTCACAGCTAGCCTTGTCCCCATTGGTC-3′ (NheI site underlined). Fragment II was amplified using sense primer 5′-GGGGACAAGGCTAGCTGTGAGTATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCG-3′ (NheI site underlined) and an antisense primer downstream from the AvrII site (amino acids 728–729 in exon 11). The overlap fragment was digested with Bsu36I andAvrII and ligated into corresponding site of the plasmid encoding IRwt, resulting in a cDNA sequence deleted of amino acids 469–673, and a new silent NheI site is introduced (amino acids 466–467). IRΔ685 was made using the sense primer 5′-GACAAGGCTAGCTGTCCAAAGACAGACTCTCAGATCC-3′ (NheI site is underlined) and an antisense primer downstream from theAvrII site (amino acids 728–729). This fragment was digested with NheI and AvrII and ligated into corresponding site of the plasmid encoding IRΔ673, resulting in a cDNA sequence deleted of amino acids 469–685. Finally IRΔ685* and IRΔ703 were made by PCR amplification using a sense primer upstream from the NarI site (amino acids 450–452) and the antisense primers 5′-TTTTCCTAGGGACGAAAACCACG-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTAGGGACGAAAACCACGTTGTGCAGGTAATCCTCAAACGTACAGCTAGCCTTGTCCCC (AvrII site underlined). The fragments were digested with NarI and AvrII and ligated into the corresponding site of the plasmid encoding IRwt, resulting in cDNA sequences deleted of amino acids 469–685 + 718–729 and 469–703 + 718–729, respectively. In these two constructs a new silentAvrII site was introduced (amino acids 716–717). Two binding assays were used, a microtiter plate assay and a polyethylene glycol precipitation assay. For the plate assay receptor, IgG fusions were immobilized on protein A-coated microtiter plates, as described in detail (31Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly wells were coated with protein A, washed 3 times with binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100) before a dilution of receptor fusion construct in binding buffer was added to each well. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with binding buffer. Binding experiments were performed by adding a total volume of 150 μl of binding buffer with A14-125I-insulin (5–10 pm) and varying concentrations of insulin. After 16 h at 4 °C unbound ligand was removed by aspirating the buffer and washing once with cold binding buffer, and the A14-125I-insulin bound in each well was counted in a γ-counter. The precipitation assay was performed by incubating a suitable dilution of BHK medium containing receptor in a total volume of 200 μl with A14-125I-insulin (5–10 pm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand in binding buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Subsequently bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 0.2% γ-globulin and 500 μl of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Bound A14-125I-insulin was counted in a γ-counter. In both assays the concentration of receptor was adjusted to yield 10–15% binding of tracer when no competing ligand was added in the competition assay. The binding data were fitted using nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The expressed receptors were detected by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody mAb-F26. This antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 39–75, mapping at the N terminus of the insulin receptor α-subunit. The antibody was kindly donated by Jes Thorn Clausen, Novo Nordisk. For blotting, medium from BHK cells expressing receptor constructs was mixed with 0.33 volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (40% w/v sucrose, 563 mmTris base, 423 mm Tris-HCl, 278 mm SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.88 mm Serva Blue G250, 0.7 mm phenol red), and 20 μl was run on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Reduced samples were mixed with loading buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before loading 20 μl on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked by incubating with blocking buffer (5% defatted skim milk, 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5)) for 16 h at 4 °C. The receptor antibody mAb-F26 was diluted in blocking buffer, and after incubating with receptor antibody the membrane was washed with TBS before incubating with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobins antibody (P260 from DAKO, Denmark). Finally the blot was washed with TBS and immunoreactive protein was detected using ECL reagent from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For chemical cross-linking the high affinity analogue X92 (A8H, B10D, B25Y-amide, des-B26–30 insulin) was used because the high affinity of this analogue allowed detection of receptors directly in BHK medium, and cross-linking was performed essentially as described (16Andersen A.S.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Medium from BHK cells expressing receptor constructs was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with A14-125I-X92 (0.14 nm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled X92 (1 μm). DSS in dimethyl sulfoxide was added from a 10 mm stock solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 15 min on ice the reaction was stopped by adding 0.33 volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer or 0.33 volume SDS-PAGE loading buffer with 0.1 m DTT. Reduced samples were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before running on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 20% ethanol, and a PhosphorImager screen was exposed with the dried gel. The smallest receptor fragment, IRΔ703 was purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized insulin as described previously (33Markussen J. Halstrøm J. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18814-18818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRΔ703 in Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.5% n-octyl glucopyranoside, was treated with a deglycosylation mixture containing neuraminidase, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and PNGaseF, either in the presence or absence of 0.1% SDS, for 18 h at 37 °C. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE (Perseptive Biosystems) in sinapinic acid matrix. Calibration was performed on the MH+ and MH22+[/eq] ions of human serum albumin. We initially introduced the deletion described by Sung et al.(27Sung C.K. Wong K.Y. Yip C.C. Hawley D.M. Goldfine I.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 315-324PubMed Google Scholar) into our soluble IR-IgG fusion construct; this is the IRΔ599, deleted of amino acids 487–599. The constructs IRΔ613 and IRΔ629 were also deleted from amino acid 487, whereas the remaining five constructs were deleted from amino acid 469. The rationale for this is that amino acid Cys-468 is the last amino acid in exon 6 and also the last amino acid in the L2 domain; thus IR residues 1–468 are predicted to be a large domain with homology to the N-terminal domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (11Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Insulin receptor secreted into BHK medium was analyzed in two binding assays. The receptor used here is fused to the Fc region of IgG, and therefore intact receptors could be immobilized using protein A. In this way binding curves for IRwt, IRΔ599, IRΔ613, and IRΔ629 receptors could be generated; the affinities of these receptors were 2–3 nm (Kd) (Table I). In contrast no binding was detectable in the protein A assay for all receptor constructs deleted of amino acids 630–649. The polyethylene glycol precipitation assay yielded binding curves for all the constructs expressed (Fig. 2 and Table I). In Fig. 2are shown binding curves obtained when using insulin to displace A14-125I-insulin from IRwt, IRΔ599, IRΔ649, and IRΔ703. The IRwt receptor displacement curve is biphasic fitting to a two-site binding model with binding affinities in the picomolar range (31Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) for the high affinity site and a Kd of 3.1 ± 0.9 nm for the low affinity site in the protein A assay. The binding curves for all deleted receptors were clearly one-sited (Fig. 2) with affinities ranging from 1 to 7 nm in the binding assays. The lowest Kd of 1.1 nmwas observed for IRΔ673, and the shortest construct IRΔ703 gave aKd of 4.4 ± 0.8 nm. For the full-length ectodomain the affinity for insulin was 5.0 ± 0.2 nm. Two of the deletion constructs IRΔ685 and IRΔ685* only differ by the exon 11 region (amino acids 718–729); the affinity of IRΔ685 for insulin was 6.4 ± 2.4 nm, and when exon 11 is deleted in IRΔ685* the affinity was 7.3 ± 1.6 nm, so in these deletion receptors the exon 11 region does not influence binding of insulin significantly, in contrast to what has been reported for the IR holoreceptor (34Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or the insulin proreceptor (35Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32639-32648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody used for immunoblotting was raised against an N-terminal epitope of the insulin receptor, and thus it would be expected to recognize the α-subunit of all receptors deletion constructs expressed. Immunoblotting was performed on non-reduced as well as reduced samples of medium from transfected BHK cells. The immunoblots are shown in Fig. 3. On the reduced gel (Fig. 3 A) the antibody detects the full-length α-subunit of 130 kDa in the IRwt sample, whereas the deletion constructs show a gradual decrease in size of the α-subunit from apparent mass of 130 kDa to approximately 80 kDa for the smallest receptor construct IRΔ703. This receptor is also shown in its deglycosylated form after PNGaseF treatment, where it acquires an apparent mass of approximately 55 kDa comparable to what was predicted from the amino acid sequence. For immunoblotting similar volumes of BHK medium were loaded, so in addition to smaller size there seems to be better expression yields when expressing the smaller receptor fragments. Immunoblotting of the unreduced samples reveals three groups of immunoreactive bands (Fig. 3). The full-length receptor fusion IRwt has been reported to migrate as 380-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE (29Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19367-19375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) consistent with the high molecular mass band of more than 200 kDa observed on the blot (Fig. 3 A). The blot shows bands that have not entered the separation gel indicating aggregation to very high molecular weight complexes, which is also consistent with the previous report on this receptor (29Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19367-19375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IRΔ599, IRΔ613, and IRΔ629 have mobility corresponding to intact receptor IgG fusion so apparently deletion of Cys-524 is well tolerated in terms of disulfide linkage of the receptor subunits, indicating that Cys-524 is not the only α-α disulfide linkage. A marked decrease in molecular weight is seen with IRΔ649 in which residues 630–649 are deleted. The decreased size is consistent with a loss of contact between α- and β-subunits suggesting that Cys-647 is responsible for the only disulfide linkage between α- and β-subunits. There seems to be small amounts of monomeric α-subunit even in the IRΔ649 construct and more pronounced in the IRΔ673 construct probably because the α-α dimer is not very stable when one of the α-α disulfides (Cys-524) has been removed. Possibly interactions between the Fc regions fused to the ectodomain also stabilize the disulfide between the two α-subunits. Finally the constructs IRΔ685, IRΔ685*, and IRΔ703 all represent free monomeric α-subunit fragments only. This supports that Cys-682, Cys-683, or Cys-685 is involved in the second α-α disulfide bond. Chemical cross-linking of A14-125I-X92 insulin analogue was performed using BHK medium directly. After cross-linking, samples were run under reduced as well as non-reduced conditions (Fig. 4). Both reduced and non-reduced gels show a cross-linking pattern"

However, the molecular mechanism by which the phosphorylation activates the motor function is not yet understood. In the present study, we focused our attention on the role of the central helix of RLC for regulation. The flexible region at the middle of the central helix (Gly95-Pro98) was substituted or deleted to various extents, and the effects of the deletion or substitution on the regulation of the motor activity of myosin were examined. Deletion of Gly95-Asp97, Gly95-Thr96, or Thr96-Asp97 decreased the actin-translocating activity of myosin a little, but the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the motor activity was not disrupted. In contrast, the deletion of Gly95-Pro98 of RLC completely abolished the actin translocating activity of phosphorylated myosin. However, the unregulated myosin long subfragment 1 containing this RLC mutant showed motor activity the same as that containing the wild type RLC. Since long subfragment 1 motor activity is unregulated by phosphorylation,i.e. constitutively active, these results suggest that the deletion of these residues at the central helix of RLC disrupts the phosphorylation-mediated activation mechanism but not the motor function of myosin itself. On the other hand, the elimination of Pro98 or substitution of Gly95-Pro98 by Ala resulted in the activation of actin translocating activity of dephosphorylated myosin, whereas it did not affect the motor activity of phosphorylated myosin. Together, these results clearly indicate the importance of the hinge at the central helix of RLC on the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of smooth muscle myosin.

The motor activity of vertebrate smooth muscle as well as non-muscle cell myosin is regulated by phosphorylation of the 20,000 dalton light chain (LC20) 1The abbreviations used are: LC20, 20,000-dalton light chain of smooth muscle myosin; MLC, myosin light chain; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RLC, regulatory light chain; S1, myosin subfragment 1; S2, myosin subfragment 2; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). of myosin (1Hartshorne D.J.

While the phosphorylation of myosin at LC20 occurs at several sites which are catalyzed by various protein kinases, the activation effect is rather specific to the site of phosphorylation, and only the phosphorylation at serine 19 and/or threonine 18 can activate the motor activity of myosin (6Jakes R. Northrop F. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1976; 70: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent three-dimensional structural analysis of the skeletal muscle myosin head domain greatly facilitated the understanding of the structure-function relationship of the myosin motor (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). It was revealed that the ATPase active site and actin binding site, two functionally essential regions of the myosin motor, exist toward the top of the myosin head while the regulatory light chain (i.e. LC20) associates with the myosin heavy chain at the lower end of myosin head, i.e. adjacent to the head-rod junction. This structural feature indicates that it is unlikely that the regulation is achieved by the direct interaction between the motor effector sites and the phosphorylation site. This leads to the hypothesis that the change in the conformation of LC20 induced by phosphorylation is transmitted to the motor effector sites via intersubunit communication that would be critical for the regulation of myosin motor activity (10Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11639-11642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the detail of such a mechanism is not yet understood, some progress toward this problem has been made. It has been shown using various probes that phosphorylation of LC20 changes the conformation at the head-rod junction of myosin (10Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11639-11642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Onishi H.

It was shown recently that the two-headed structure is critical for the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of myosin motor activity (14Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found that the chimeric myosin which consisted of the skeletal globular motor domain, smooth muscle light chain-associated domain and S2, is completely regulated by phosphorylation (17Sata M. Stafford III, W.F. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that the regulatory domain solely confers the phosphorylation-dependent regulation. Based on these findings, it is plausible that the interaction between the two myosin heads at the C-terminal regulatory domain of S1 is altered by phosphorylation that is critical for regulation. The question is how the phosphorylation changes the conformation of RLC (regulatory light chain), thus activating the myosin motor activity. Using myosin molecules containing the chimeric or mutated LC20, it was revealed that: 1) the negative charge introduced by the phosphate moiety is important for the activation of myosin motor activity because the substitution of Ser19/Thr18 of LC20 by the acidic residues partially mimicked the phosphorylation-induced activation of myosin motor activity (18Kamisoyama H. Araki Y. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Sweeney H.L. Yang Z. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trybus K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); and 2) the C-terminal domain of LC20 is critical for both heavy chain binding and phosphorylation-dependent regulation because an N-terminal smooth RLC/C-terminal skeletal RLC chimera failed to activate myosin motor activity by phosphorylation (20Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion of the C-terminal residues diminished the binding to the heavy chain (21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the deletion or substitution of the C-terminal residues of LC20 disrupted the phosphorylation-dependent activation of smooth muscle myosin (21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the phosphorylation at the N-terminal region of RLC influences the conformation at the RLC-heavy chain interface at the C-terminal domain of RLC and thus achieves the regulation of myosin motor function. For calmodulin, it has been suggested that there is a cross-talk between the N- and C-terminal domains, and the long central helix which connects the two domains plays a role on the cross-talk. Since three-dimensional structure of RLC is homologous to calmodulin (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar), it is plausible that the long central helix of RLC also plays a role on the cross-talk between the N- and C-terminal domains of RLC, thus involved in regulation of smooth muscle myosin motor activity. In the present study, we produced a series of mutant LC20s in which the hinge region at the middle of the long central helix of LC20 is modified. The motor activity and the phosphorylation dependence of myosin containing these mutant LC20s were examined. The results clearly indicate that the hinge region at the central helix of LC20 plays a critical role for the phosphorylation-induced regulation of myosin motor activity. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The PT7–7Escherichia coli expression vector containing the T7 promotor (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. S. Tabor (Harvard Medical School). Smooth muscle myosin was prepared from frozen turkey gizzards as described (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase was prepared from frozen turkey gizzards (26Ikebe M. Stepinska M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13828-13834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant calmodulin was expressed in E. coli and prepared as follows. Calmodulin cDNA from Xenopus oocytes (27Chien Y.H. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in the pTNcoI2 vector was kindly supplied by Dr. C. Klee (National Institutes of Health). Two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GAA ATA CTT CAT ATG GCT GAC CAA CTG ACA G-3′, containing an NdeI site as well as an initiation codon, and 5′-TAC CGC AAG CGA CAG GCC G-3′, downstream of the polylinker region of the vector, were synthesized and used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of calmodulin cDNA. The amplified cDNA was digested with NdeI andHindIII and subcloned into PT7–7 using uniqueNdeI and HindIII sites at the polylinker region. BL21(DE3) was transformed with the calmodulin expression vector and then cultured in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the liquid culture, and the cells were harvested 10 h later. The packed cells (3 g) were sonicated in buffer containing 8 murea, 5 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sample was centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation (27,000 × g for 10 min), dissolved with 8 m urea and Tris base, and dialyzed against buffer A (1 mm DTT, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to DE52 ion-exchange chromatography. After the sample was loaded, the column (3 cm × 24 cm) was washed with buffer A and the recombinant calmodulin was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 500 mm. The fractions containing calmodulin were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, concentrated, and subjected to Sephacryl S200 gel filtration chromatography (3 cm × 90 cm) in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The fractions containing calmodulin were collected, dialyzed against buffer B (30 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and stored at –80 °C. The mutant cDNAs were made by the site-directed mutagenesis strategy as described previously using the LC20 expression vector pT7-LCW as a template (18Kamisoyama H. Araki Y. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PT7-LCW does not contain a tag sequence, to avoid having artificial amino acid residues in the expressed recombinant LC20. After confirming the mutation by direct sequencing analysis, the mutant LC20 expression vectors were transferred to BL21(DE3). The expression and purification of the mutant LC20s was done as described previously (21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory light chain was removed from myosin according to Trybuset al. (22Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Myosin (5 mg/ml) was incubated with buffer C containing 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 3 mmNaN3, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm TFP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm ATP, and 20 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, for 1 h at 0 °C and then applied to a Sepharose CL4B column (3 × 90 cm) equilibrated with buffer D containing 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mmimidazole-HCl, pH7.0. The myosin-containing fractions were combined and a three-fold molar excess of LC20 was added to them. The mixture was dialyzed for 90 min against buffer F containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.0. The mixture was further dialyzed for 2 h against buffer G containing 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The precipitates were washed twice with buffer D and then dissolved with buffer G (0.3m KCl, 5 mm DTT, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). To prepare myosin containing phosphorylated LC20, the purified LC20s were thiophosphorylated before adding to the LC20-deficient myosin. The extent of phosphorylation was monitored by urea-gel electrophoresis (29Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and complete phosphorylation of LC20 was confirmed (not shown). The baculovirus transfer vectors of smooth muscle heavy chain and light chains were produced as described (16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses for the heavy chain and the light chains were produced according to the protocols described by O'Reilly et al.(30O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). To express truncated smooth muscle myosin, Sf9 insect cells were coinfected with three separate viruses expressing the heavy chain and two light chains. The recombinant smooth muscle myosin was purified as described previously (16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Actin-activated ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in an assay mixture containing 0.1 mg/ml myosin, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with or without 5 mg/ml F-actin. The ATPase activity of myosin or actomyosin was determined by measuring the liberated 32P as described previously (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gels by using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Actin-translocating velocity was measured by an in vitromotility assay as described previously (16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Student'st test was used for statistical comparison of mean values. A value of p < .01 was considered to be significant. Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed at 20 °C on a Beckman model-E analytical ultracentrifuge. Sedimentation patterns were acquired with the on-line Rayleigh system (32Yphantis D.A. Lary J.W. Stafford W.F. Liu S. Olsen P.H. Hayes D.B. Moody T.P. Ridgeway T.M. Lyons D.A. Laue T.M. Schuster T.M.

The camera lens was focused at the 2/3 plane of the cell equipped with sapphire windows. The apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution function were computed as described by Stafford (33Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 34Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The hybrid myosin containing various mutant LC20 was prepared by adding exogenous LC20 to the LC20-deficient myosin. The exogenous LC20 was properly bound to the LC20-deficient myosin at the LC20 binding site based on the following findings. 1) The stoichiometry of the heavy chain and LC20 in the reconstituted myosin was identical to that of naturally isolated smooth muscle myosin based upon gel densitometry analysis (data not shown, see also Ref. 16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2) The reconstituted myosin with wild type LC20 showed phosphorylation-dependent actin-activated ATPase activity and actin-translocating activity, which were indistinguishable to naturally isolated myosin (TableI, see Fig. 2).Table IActin-activated ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin containing various mutant RLCLC20 mutantMg2+-ATPase activity in nmol/mg · minDephosphorylatedPhosphorylated+ Actin− ActinActivated+ Actin− ActinActivatedWild6.5 ± 1.73.1 ± 1.13.4 ± 0.960.3 ± 7.13.2 ± 1.857.1 ± 5.8GTDP/AAAA13.0 ± 3.26.6 ± 1.76.5 ± 1.673.0 ± 2.32.9 ± 1.670.1 ± 0.7ΔGTDP22.5 ± 3.511.8 ± 4.310.7 ± 1.035.6 ± 7.711.5 ± 6.324.1 ± 3.3ΔGTD13.2 ± 2.34.7 ± 0.78.5 ± 1.646.1 ± 15.92.1 ± 7.637.4 ± 3.5ΔGT8.1 ± 0.04.0 ± 1.64.0 ± 1.753.8 ± 1.66.2 ± 0.747.6 ± 0.9ΔTD10.7 ± 2.75.4 ± 2.15.4 ± 2.755.5 ± 3.88.5 ± 3.547.0 ± 7.3ΔP20.1 ± 2.65.9 ± 1.014.2 ± 3.664.3 ± 4.75.5 ± 0.358.8 ± 4.4The activities were measured with three independent preparations of myosin.

All data are presented as mean activity ± S.D. ATPase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Six mutant LC20s were produced in which the four amino acid residues corresponding to the hinge region at the middle of the central helix of LC20 were deleted or substituted to various extents (Fig. 1). These mutant LC20s were introduced to the LC20-deficient myosin as described above. All mutant LC20s bound stoichiometrically to myosin heavy chain as judged by gel densitometry (not shown). To produce phosphorylated myosin, LC20s were first thiophosphorylated with ATPγS in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin/MLC kinase to avoid possible dephosphorylation during the preparations and then introduced to the LC20-deficient myosin. For all LC20 mutants tested in this study, the rate of phosphorylation was indistinguishable from that of wild type LC20 (data not shown). The LC20s were completely phosphorylated as judged by the mobility shift due to the phosphate group in urea-gel electrophoresis (not shown, see also Ref. 21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-activated ATPase activity of myosins was determined in the presence of 5 mg/ml F-actin, in which the extent of actin activation was saturated (maximum ATPase activity). The actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin, containing phosphorylated ΔP in which Pro98 was deleted, and GTDP/AAAA, in which all four residues were substituted by Ala, were practically the same as that of myosin containing wild type LC20 (Table I), whereas the myosins containing other phosphorylated LC20 mutants showed lower ATPase activity (Table I). The decrease in the activity was moderate for ΔTD and ΔGT and more extensive for ΔGTDP and ΔGTD. These results suggest that the hinge at the central helix of LC20 is involved in the phosphorylation-induced activation mechanism of the actomyosin ATPase activity. On the other hand, the actin-activated ATPase activity of dephosphorylated myosin containing mutant LC20s was higher than that of myosin containing wild type LC20, particularly for ΔGTDP and ΔP (Table I). The effect of the mutation of LC20 at the hinge of the central helix on myosin motor function was evaluated more directly by using an in vitro motility assay. Myosin containing wild type LC20 showed completely phosphorylation-dependent actin translocating activity, and an actin sliding velocity of 0.67 ± 0.04 μm/s at 25 °C was obtained for phosphorylated LC20, which is comparable with the value previously obtained for naturally isolated smooth muscle myosin (16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While myosin containing GTDP/AAAA, ΔP, or ΔTD showed virtually the same phosphorylation-activated actin- translocating activity, the activity was significantly lower for the myosins containing ΔGTD and ΔGT (Fig. 2). The most striking effect was observed for ΔGTDP-containing myosin in which actin-translocating activity was completely abolished (Fig. 2). There are two possibilities to account for this observation. First, the deletion of the four residues at the hinge of LC20, i.e. ΔGTDP, disrupts the motor function of myosin. Second, the mutation does not abolish the motor activity itself but disrupts the phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we utilized a smooth muscle myosin mutant having phosphorylation-independent, constitutively active motor activity. Previously, we produced truncated mutants of smooth muscle myosin containing various lengths of the S2 portion and showed that the monomeric myosins have phosphorylation-independent motor activity while the dimeric (double-headed) myosins have the phosphorylation-dependent activity (16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the actin translocating activity of the 108-kDa truncated smooth muscle myosin (a monomeric myosin). The 108-kDa myosin containing ΔGTDP showed motor activity indistinguishable from that of the myosin containing wild type LC20. Virtually the same results were obtained for the 108-kDa myosin containing phosphorylated ΔGTDP and phosphorylated wild type LC20 (not shown). The results clearly indicate that the deletion of the four residues at the hinge of the central helix of LC20 disrupts the phosphorylation-induced activation process of smooth muscle myosin motor activity but does not diminish the myosin motor activity itself (Fig. 3). The result suggests that ΔGTDP cannot support the activation by phosphorylation when bound to myosin heavy chain and is thus trapped in the off state. To further evaluate this possibility, in vitro motility assay was performed using the mixture of phosphorylated myosin and ΔGTDP-containing myosin (Fig. 4). The significant reduction of the velocity was not found until the majority myosin was a ΔGTDP-containing one. Previously, Cuda et al.(35Cuda G. Pate E. Sellers J.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1767-1779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that more than 60% of dephosphorylated myosin is required until significant reduction of the velocity occurs. The present results are consistent with the earlier observation and suggest that ΔGTDP light chain traps phosphorylated myosin in the off state. It should be noted that the observed actin translocating velocity for the 108-kDa myosin (single-headed) was approximately 40% of that of the full-length myosin (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the previous finding (16Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and suggests that the mechano-chemical activity is affected by the interaction between the two heads. Another important finding is that the myosins containing GTDP/AAAA or ΔP showed significant phosphorylation-independent actin translocating activity (Fig. 5). The actin sliding velocity of the dephosphorylated myosins containing these two mutants was approximately 30% of that of the phosphorylated myosins. Myosin containing the dephosphorylated GTDP/AAAA or ΔP light chain supported continuous actin filament movement and majority of the filaments moved. This result suggests that the inhibitory activity of dephosphorylated LC20 is diminished by mutation at the hinge of the central helix of LC20.Figure 4Sliding velocity of actin filaments for mixtures of myosins containing phosphorylated wild type RLC and ΔGTDP. Actin movement was observed as described in Fig. 3. The velocities were normalized with respect to that obtained with myosin containing phosphorylated wild type light chain (0.61 ± 0.06 μm/s). •, phosphorylated myosin mixed with dephosphorylated myosin; ▴, phosphorylated myosin mixed with myosin containing phosphorylated ΔGTDP RLC; ▪, phosphorylated myosin mixed with myosin containing dephosphorylated ΔGTDP RLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Activation of sliding velocity of actin filaments on smooth muscle dephosphorylated myosin by disruption of the hinge at the central helix of RLC.

The equilibrium between the two conformations is sensitive to ionic strength (41Ikebe M. Hinkins S. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4580-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of LC20 (38Craig R. Smith R. Kendrick-Jones J.

Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational transition of myosins containing various mutant LC20s was examined using analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation patterns for myosin were measured at 0.2 and 0.4 m KCl (Fig. 6). The sedimentation pattern of myosins containing various mutant LC20s revealed a single symmetric peak under both conditions. The sedimentation coefficient (s20,w value) of myosin containing dephosphorylated wild type LC20 increased from 6.81 to 9.89 with decreasing KCl concentration, which is consistent with the previous reports (36Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6151-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki H. Onishi H. Takahashi K. Watanabe S. J. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4580-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) indicating that myosin forms an extended and a folded conformation (36Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 1983; 302: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) at 0.4 m KCl and 0.2m KCl, respectively. While the sedimentation coefficient of myosins containing various LC20 mutants did not differ from each other at 0.4 m KCl, the values at 0.2 m KCl were significantly different among the myosins containing different LC20 mutants. The sedimentation velocities of the myosins containing dephosphorylated ΔGTDP, ΔP, and GTDP/AAAA were 6.6 ± 0.05s,7.3 ± 0.05 s, and 6.5 ± 0.05s, which indicated that myosin having these mutant LC20s failed to form a folded conformation. On the other hand, the sedimentation constants of the myosins containing ΔGT and ΔTD were similar to that of the myosin having wild type LC20 (Fig. 6). While it is well known that the phosphorylation at serine 19 of LC20 activates smooth muscle or non-muscle myosin motor activity, it is not clear how the phosphorylation can activate the motor activity at a molecular level. According to the three-dimensional structural analysis of skeletal muscle S1, the regulatory light chain consists of two domains that are segregated by a long central α-helix (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the central long α-helix of LC20 plays a role in the phosphorylation-mediated regulation mechanism. Particularly, we focused our attention on the middle of the central helix where the helix is distorted (Fig. 1). To verify our hypothesis, we produced six mutant LC20s in which the four amino acid residues (Gly-Thr-Asp-Pro) corresponding to the hinge of the long central α-helix of LC20 were modified (Fig. 1). We found that the change in the structure of the hinge region significantly altered the motor function of smooth muscle myosin. The most notable findings were: 1) the deletion of all four residues (ΔGTDP) abolished the activation effect of phosphorylation on myosin motor activity; and 2) two mutant LC20s in which the four residues were substituted for Ala (GTDP/AAAA) or a proline residue in the hinge was deleted (ΔP) conferred the phosphorylation-independent motor activity on smooth muscle myosin, i.e. the inhibitory function of dephosphorylated LC20 was diminished. These findings clearly show that the hinge region of the central helix of LC20 is critical for phosphorylation-mediated regulation of smooth muscle myosin. It is expected that the deletion or substitution of the proline residue at the hinge would eliminate the distortion at the middle of the long α-helix; therefore, the results obtained in the present work suggest that the flexed nature of the central shaft of the LC20 is important for phosphorylation-mediated regulation of myosin motor activity. Previously, it was reported that the C-terminal domain of LC20 is responsible for the binding of LC20 to the heavy chain (21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the deletion of the C-terminal residues of LC20 abolishes the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of smooth muscle myosin despite the fact that the phosphorylation site is located in the N-terminal domain (21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This raised the hypothesis that there is an interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains of LC20, which is a critical component for the regulation of smooth muscle myosin motor function (21Ikebe M. Readon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results are consistent with this notion and suggest that the flexed region in the central helix plays a critical role in the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains. LC20 shares considerable structural homology with calmodulin and troponin C (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M.

Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) in which the two domains are linked with a long central connecting α-helix. It has been shown that the deletion of several amino acid residues at the central helix of calmodulin significantly disrupts the activation of target enzymes by calmodulin (46VanBerkum M.F. George S.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3750-3756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of the central connecting linker region in calmodulin function. The importance of the central helix of calmodulin in its function is supported by analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the calmodulin/MLC kinase peptide complex. Upon formation of the ternary complex with the calmodulin binding peptide in the presence of Ca2+, the long central helix of calmodulin is disrupted into two helices connected by a flexible loop (47Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 48Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In the case of myosin, the N-terminal domain of LC20 wraps around the C terminus of the S1 heavy chain while the C-terminal domain of LC20 interacts with the long helix portion of the S1 heavy chain (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the change in the distortion at the hinge of the central helix of LC20 would influence the bend at the C-terminal end of S1 heavy chain. In scallop myosin, in which the myosin function is regulated by the Ca2+ binding to the essential light chain, a change in the bend at the C-terminal end of S1 by Ca2+ binding is observed (49Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the substitution of LC20 by ΔGTDP, in which the flex at the hinge region of the central helix is disrupted, abolishes the formation of a folded structure (Fig. 6) that is likely to be related to the bend at the C-terminal end of S1."

Furthermore, the same domain mediates dimerization of activated STAT monomers, a prerequisite for DNA binding by this family of proteins. To identify amino acid residues within the STAT protein that mediate these various interactions, we have carried out an extensive mutational analysis of the Stat6 SH2 domain. Recombinant proteins carrying C-terminal deletions or double alanine substitutions were expressed in mammalian and insect cells and assayed for DNA binding, transcription activation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and the ability to interact with a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from the interleukin-4 receptor signaling chain. From these studies, we have identified amino acids that are required for both DNA binding and interleukin-4 receptor interaction, as well as residues that when mutated impair only one of the two functions. Our results suggest that the structural homology between the SH2 domain of Stat6 and that of the distantly related Src protein may be higher than predicted on the basis of primary amino acid sequence comparisons.

Hence, this protein-protein interaction domain has been the focus of many studies (1Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. Science. 1993; 262: 1522-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The best characterized class of SH2 containing proteins is the Src family. Structural analysis of the Src SH2 domain bound to a high affinity phosphopeptide revealed three key features necessary for selective protein recognition (3Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silverman L. Kuriyan J.

Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). First, phosphotyrosine binding is mediated through a mostly polar pocket that contains the conserved GTFLLR motif found in most SH2 domains. Second, a β-sheet structure interacts with the first two amino acids (i + 1 and i + 2) immediately C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine residue. Third, the i + 3 residue is recognized specifically by a second, more hydrophobic pocket (4Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, binding selectivity is determined largely by the three amino acids following the phosphotyrosine and specific residues in the interacting SH2 domain (5Bibbins K.B. Boeuf H. Varmus H.E. Mol.

Some are activated by multiple cytokines or growth factors, whereas others are only activated in response to a specific stimulus (11Darnell Jr., J.E.

Activation of STAT proteins involves cytokine binding to its receptor, which triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular receptor domain by an associated Jak kinase (10Schindler C.

The phosphorylated receptor chain provides a docking site for the latent STAT protein, which resides in the cytoplasm. Once recruited to the receptor, the STAT protein is phosphorylated at a single tyrosine residue by Jak kinase (12Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar).

Receptor-associated Jak kinases are relatively nonselective in their ability to phosphorylate individual cytokine receptors and/or STAT proteins (18Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Selectivity in gene activation upon stimulation with different cytokines appears to be achieved at the STAT-receptor interaction (11Darnell Jr., J.E.

This interaction is mediated by the STAT-SH2 domain, which also dictates the specificity in STAT:STAT dimer formation (25Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L.

The selectivity of Stat1 for the IFN-γ receptor can be transferred to Stat2 via the SH2 domain, suggesting that the STAT-SH2 domain is a modular structure as are other SH2 domains (2Pawson T.

Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Strikingly, STAT-SH2 domains share little sequence similarity with other SH2 domains (Fig. 1). Most of the similarity is restricted to the N-terminal half which contains the conserved GTFLLR motif (4Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). As with other SH2 domains, mutation of the invariant arginine leads to loss of phosphotyrosine recognition in STATs (5Bibbins K.B. Boeuf H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar) where little homology exists between the STAT-SH2 and other SH2 domains (Fig. 1). In addition, no structural information is available for any of the STAT-SH2 domains. Given the involvement of this domain in selective protein-protein interactions, we sought to define aspects of this domain that participate in achieving the fidelity of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway. We are interested primarily in the IL-4-inducible protein, Stat6. To determine the C terminus of the Stat6 SH2 domain, we generated a series of C-terminal deletion mutants. To identify residues critical for Stat6 function, we carried out a systematic mutational analysis of the SH2 domain by changing two amino acids at a time in the context of the full-length protein. Recombinant mutant proteins were tested for DNA binding, tyrosine phosphorylation, and transcription activation. Proteins were also tested for their ability to interact with a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from the IL-4 receptor. Mutants that were unable to bind DNA but did interact with the receptor-derived peptide could partially inhibit IL-4-induced gene expression when overexpressed in cells that contain endogenous Stat6. Our analysis provides insight into the structure and function of the Stat6 SH2 domain. BJAB cells were grown in RPMI 1640(1×) (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories), 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol. Stably transfected BJAB cell lines were grown in the same media supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). BJAB cells were stably transfected with the use of electroporation as described by Tewari and Dixit (31Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections in embryonic kidney 293 cells and HepG2 cells were carried out as described (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was determined 48 h following transfection using the Promega assay systems. The cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-4 6 h before harvesting. Expression constructs for full-length Stat6 (TPU272) and Stat6ΔC (TPU285) carrying a stop codon at position 662 have been described previously (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 22Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All C-terminal deletion mutants (aa 602, TPU601; aa 620, TPU600; aa 633, TPU599; aa 636, TPU598; aa 641, TPU597; aa 645, TPU596; aa 650, TPU595) were generated by replacing the XmaI/SacI fragment of TPU285 with DNA fragments that carried stop codons at the appropriate residues. The fragments were generated with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Double amino acid substitutions in the Stat6-SH2 domain were generated by substituting theXmaI/SacI fragment of TPU595 with mutated DNA fragments that were prepared by PCR. The integrity of the resulting clones was determined by DNA sequence analysis. All proteins carried nine histidine residues and a pentapeptide substrate (RRASV) for protein kinase A at their C terminus. With the exception of three mutants (WS, FS, and LY), all proteins were expressed in Hi-5 cells and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography (22Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The expression construct for full-length Stat6 (TPU389) differs from the previously described construct TPU388 (20Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) in that a flag epitope tag was introduced at the C terminus. All C-terminal deletion constructs (aa 602, TPU608; aa 620, TPU607; aa 636, TPU605; aa 641, TPU604; aa 645, TPU603; aa 650, TPU602) were generated by replacing the BglII/SpeI fragment of TPU389 with a DNA fragment carrying the indicated 3′ deletion. Double alanine mutants were prepared by replacing the BglII/SacI fragment of TPU389 with a DNA fragment that carried the indicated mutation. In each case, the fragments were generated by PCR, and the integrity of the clones was determined by DNA sequence analysis. Mutants WS, FS, and LY failed to express in insect cells and were consequently purified from stably transfected BJAB cells. Proteins expressed in mammalian cells contained C-terminal flag epitope tags, which allowed purification on anti-flag M2 affinity resin (Kodak). BJAB (108) cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (30 ml; 0.2m NaCl, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), incubated on ice for 10 min, and sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-flag M2 (1 ml) resin for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound material was washed from the resin with lysis buffer (50 ml). Bound protein was eluted with flag peptide (400 ng/ml). Biotinylated peptides (2.5 mmol: IL-4R peptide, ASSGEEGPYKPFQDLI, or IFN-γ peptide, GGGGGFGYPDKPHVL) were coupled to 25 μl of packed streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 30 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound peptide was removed by washing the resin 4 times with binding buffer (1 ml). Purified protein (20 μg) was incubated with peptide-coupled streptavidin beads (25 μl in a final volume of 500 μl binding buffer) for 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed by washing the resin 4 times with binding buffer (1 ml) for 10 min each. Bound protein was eluted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 5 μl were subjected to Western analysis with antibodies directed against Stat6. An aliquot of the starting material (25 μl) was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie R-250 staining to ensure that the input was equivalent for each binding reaction. Purified Stat6 was activated in vitrowith Jak1 kinase (both Stat6 and Jak1 were expressed and purified from insect cells (13Lin J.X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou L. Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1995; 2: 331-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar)). Phosphorylation conditions were 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 μg of Jak1, and 1 μg of Stat6 in a 50-μl reaction volume. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Typically, 1 μl of the reaction was used for mobility shift assays. Nuclear extract preparations and mobility shift assays have been described previously (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). BJAB cells (1.5 × 10 6) stably expressing wild-type Stat6 or mutant derivatives or 293 cells (2 × 106) transiently transfected with Stat6 C-terminal deletion mutants were either treated or not treated with IL-4 for 15 min. Cells were lysed in immune precipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and recombinant STAT proteins were immune-precipitated with anti-flag M2-coupled beads. The beads were washed 5 times with immune precipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer (50 μl). Proteins were subjected to Western blots with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-flag M2 antibody (Kodak). A sequence alignment of the Stat6 and Src SH2 domains is shown in Fig. 1. The conserved tryptophan residue constitutes the N-terminal border of the Src SH2 domain. The GTFLLR motif, which is involved in phosphotyrosine recognition, represents the most conserved region (28Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Some sequence identity exists N-terminal to the GTFLLR motif, whereas very little similarity is observed in the C-terminal half. Thus it is impossible to determine the C-terminal border of the Stat6 SH2 domain on the basis of sequence similarity. We showed previously that a truncated version of Stat6 (amino acids (aa) 1–661) that lacks the C-terminal 186 aa binds with wild-type affinity to a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from the IL-4 receptor (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This mutant retains the tyrosine residue (aa 641) critical for phosphorylation and dimerization; hence, the protein is able to bind DNA when activated in cells. In order to define more precisely the C-terminal border of the Stat6 SH2 domain, we generated a series of C-terminal deletion mutants by inserting a flag epitope tag and a stop codon at various positions between aa 602 and 650 (Fig. 1). The proteins were expressed in embryonic kidney 293 cells and assayed for DNA binding upon IL-4 stimulation. The 293 cells lack endogenous Stat6 protein but express all other components of the IL-4 signaling pathway. Therefore, any IL-4-inducible DNA binding activity is due to the recombinant Stat6 protein (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows the DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts prepared from IL-4-treated 293 cells transiently expressing the truncated Stat6 proteins. Only the wild-type protein and the mutant ending with aa 650 bound DNA. Mutants ending with aa 645, 641, and 636 did not bind DNA, although the proteins were expressed at the same level as the wild-type (Fig. 2 B). Proteins ending with aa 620 and 602 were not expressed in mammalian cells, suggesting that these truncated proteins are unstable (data not shown). These results indicate that only the mutant ending at aa 650 is, upon phosphorylation, able to dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind DNA. Mutant proteins (ending with aa 645 and 641) retain the critical tyrosine residue but were unable to bind DNA. Hence, we investigated whether these truncated proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cytokine stimulation. Proteins were immune-precipitated from IL-4-treated 293 cells and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 C). Only the DNA-binding positive derivative ending with aa 650 was tyrosine-phosphorylated. The absence of phosphorylation with mutants 645, 641, and 635 showed that no nonspecific tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in response to IL-4. Furthermore, the data suggest that the 9 aa following the critical tyrosine (aa 641) are required for proper cytokine-induced Stat6 activation. This lack of phosphorylation observed in mammalian cells might reflect an unproductive interaction between the truncated Stat6 proteins and the Jak kinase when both are bound to the IL-4 receptor. To resolve this issue, we investigated whether these same mutants could bind DNA when activated in vitro. The proteins were expressed in insect cells, purified to homogeneity, and tyrosine-phosphorylatedin vitro with recombinant Jak1. Again, a deletion mutant ending at aa 650 was able to bind DNA, whereas Stat6 proteins truncated at 641 and 636 were inactive (Fig. 2 D). However, while deletion to aa 645 blocked Stat6 phosphorylation in IL-4-treated 293 cells, this mutant was activated in vitro to bind DNA. Thus, the 9 aa following tyrosine 641 are essential for Stat6 activationin vivo, whereas only four of these residues are required for in vitro activation. We next assessed the C-terminal boundary of the SH2 domain with respect to peptide binding. We previously identified two tyrosine-containing peptides derived from the IL-4 receptor signaling chain that, when phosphorylated (YPKAFS and YPKPFQ), associate specifically with Stat6 (25Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Similarly, a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from the interferon-γ receptor bound specifically to Stat1 but not Stat6 (22Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 32Greenlund A. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, the specificity of the STAT-receptor interaction can be accurately mimicked with the use of peptides derived from individual receptor chains. We investigated whether truncated Stat6 proteins purified from insect cells could bind specifically to the IL-4 receptor-derived peptide YPKPFQ (S, Fig. 2 E). A phosphorylated peptide derived from the interferon-γ receptor served as a negative control (N, Fig. 2 E). Biotinylated peptides were attached to streptavidin beads and incubated with purified Stat6 proteins. After binding the beads were washed, and the eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot. All C-terminal deletion mutants (with the exception of mutant 602 which did not express) bound selectively to peptides with affinities equal to that of wild-type Stat6 (Fig. 2 E). Consistent with the peptide binding results is the observation that the mutants exhibited a dominant negative phenotype when overexpressed in an IL-4-responsive cell line (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for Stat6 mutants that retained receptor/peptide binding activity but lacked the ability to bind DNA (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). From the above results we tentatively designated aa 620 as the most C-terminal aa of the Stat6-SH2 domain. To identify more precisely amino acid residues critical for function of the Stat6 SH2 domain, we carried out an extensive mutational analysis. We substituted 2 aa at a time with alanines in the context of the full-length protein. Mutagenesis began at the conserved Trp-533 and ended at Pro-620. The mutants were expressed in lymphoid (BJAB) and nonlymphoid cells (293 cells), and their DNA binding properties and tyrosine phosphorylation status were determined. Fig. 3 shows the DNA binding activity of these mutants in nuclear extracts prepared from transiently transfected 293 cells following IL-4 treatment. Identical results were obtained with stably transfected BJAB cell extracts (data not shown). Many of the double alanine substitutions did not impair DNA binding. Because dimerization is a prerequisite for DNA binding, a positive DNA binding signal indicates that the SH2 domain of these mutants is capable of mediating both receptor binding and dimerization. However, certain substitutions reduced or completely abolished Stat6 DNA binding. Some of these loss-of-function substitutions target residues that are conserved between the SH2 domains of Stat6 and Src. For example, all changes in the conserved GTFLLR motif completely abolished DNA binding, consistent with the observation that this region is required for phosphotyrosine binding. Other double amino acid changes in conserved residues (WS, LI, and LY) also abolished DNA binding, whereas changes in the conserved LLLN sequence had no effect. Substitutions in certain regions without homology to Src (SK, DS, IT, IA, EN, IQ, PF, IR, RI, and RD) interfered with DNA binding. To determine the effect of these mutations on transcription, we overexpressed the proteins in 293 cells in the presence of a luciferase reporter carrying four copies of IL-4 response elements derived from the germ line epsilon promoter. Previously we showed that this reporter is not active in 293 cells in the presence or absence of IL-4 since 293 cells do not contain endogenous Stat6 (21Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A andB). However, the reporter can be activated through overexpression of recombinant Stat6 and in the presence of IL-4 (wt, Fig. 3 B). By using this assay system, we analyzed all SH2 mutants for their ability to activate transcription. A comparison between Fig. 3, A and B, shows that all proteins that are able to bind DNA also activate transcription, whereas mutants that do not bind DNA are not transcriptionally active. In general the mutants were slightly less active than the wild-type protein which may reflect differences in the expression levels. For reasons we do not understand, mutant VT was significantly more active than the wild-type protein. The loss-of-function mutants were analyzed further to determine where in the Stat6 activation cycle they cease to function. Various reasons could account for the lack of DNA binding seen with some of our mutants. One possibility is that these mutants are not phosphorylated in the cell following IL-4 treatment, because they either failed to bind the receptor or bound the receptor-Jak complex in an unproductive manner. In contrast, mutants that do get phosphorylated completed the receptor binding and activation steps but failed subsequently, most likely beca"

From the genome sequencing in P. horikoshii we found a gene that had some homology with a gene for AARE from pig liver (9Mita M. Asada K. Uchimura Y. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Sakiyama F. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Kato I. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cloned the gene from P. horikoshii and attempted to express the enzyme in E. coli and examine the characteristics of the expressed enzyme. The host E. coli BL21(DE3) and the vector pET11a were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). ThePfu DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and ligation kit were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Otsu, Shiga, Japan). TheNα-acetylamino acid p-nitroanilide derivatives (Ac-amino acid-pNA) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The acylpeptides Ac-Ala-Ala, Ac-Met-Ala, f-Met-Ala, f-Met-Ala-Ser, f-Met-Leu-Gly, and f-Ala-Ala-Ala were also from Bachem. The other acylpeptides Ac-Met-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, f-Met-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, and f-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala were purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Minou, Osaka, Japan). α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) was purchased from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). The synthesis of DNA primers and the sequencing of proteins were performed by the custom service center of Takara Shuzo. The DNA sequencing was carried out with ABI model 373 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Div., Foster City, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest reagent grade commercially available. The genome of P. horikoshii was sequenced by the method of Kaneko et al.(13Kaneko T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Kotani H. Sazuka T. Miyajima N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The gene that was homologous to the mammalian gene for AARE was found by BLAST search (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reactionmethod using two primers with unique restriction sites. Amplification of the gene by polymerase chain reaction was carried out at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, for 35 cycles using Pfu DNA polymerase. The amplified gene was hydrolyzed by the restriction enzymes and inserted in pET11a cut by the same restriction enzymes. The amplified gene was expressed using the pET11a vector system in the host E. coli BL21(DE3) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The host E. coliBL21(DE3) was transformed by the constructed plasmid. The transformant cell was grown in 2YT medium (1% yeast extract, 1.6% tryptone, and 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. After incubation with shaking at 37 °C until theA600 reached 0.6–1.0, the induction was carried out by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm and shaking for 4 h at 37 °C. The concentration of the enzyme was determined with Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. After induction, the transformant cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted with oxide aluminum in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.6 m NaCl. After incubation with DNase I (from bovine pancreas; Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, the crude extract was heated at 85 °C for 30 min. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The dialyzed sample was loaded on a HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and eluted with a linear gradient (0–1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer). The fractions that showed protein of a similar molecular mass(70 kDa, SDS-PAGE) calculated from the amino acid sequence were concentrated by a Centricon 10 filter (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrated material was loaded on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0m NaCl. The fractions demonstrating only one protein band with a molecular mass of 70 kDa by SDS-PAGE were collected and used for the detailed characterizations of the enzyme. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE performed on a 4–15% gradient gel in the Phast System (Pharmacia). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The molecular weight was also determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and light-scattering photometry. The HPLC was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia), and the elution was carried out using 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 m NaCl at 1.5 ml/min at room temperature. The eluted protein was detected by its absorbance at 280 nm. The light-scattering photometer was conducted at room temperature with a DLS-700S light-scattering photometry (Otsuka Denshi, Shiga, Japan) calibrated with benzene (15Pike E.R. Pomeroy W.R.M. Vaughan J.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1975; 62: 3188-3192Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) at 633 nm and analyzed by the method of Kamata and Nakahara (16Kamata T. Nakahara H. J. Colloid Int. Sci. 1973; 43: 89-96Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Optical clarification was performed with polyvinylidene fluoride filters. The specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) was obtained with a KMX-16 refractometer (Chromatix Inc., Sunnyvale, CA at the same wavelength, calibrated with NaCl solution. The activity of the enzyme was determined using Ac-amino acid-pNA and acylpeptides. The enzyme was incubated at 85 °C with the substrates in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) containing 0.6 m NaCl and 5%N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and the released products were measured. The activity toward the Ac-amino acid-pNAs was calculated using the absorption coefficient ε406 = 9.91 mm−1 ofpNA released (17Kobayashi K. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11435-11445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity toward the acylpeptides was measured by the detection of the exposed α-NH2 group with the cadmium-ninhydrin colorimetric method (18Doi E. Shibata D. Matoba T. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The analysis of the products from the peptides was performed by HPLC on an ODS-80Ts column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 25 cm) containing TSK gel (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The flow rate was 0.7 ml/min with 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The activity toward α-MSH was examined by a PSQ-1 protein sequencer (Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan) at the custom service center of Takara Shuzo. 1 unit of activity corresponds to the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Thermostability of the enzyme was measured by the circular dichroism (CD) and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). CD was measured with a CD spectrometer (model 62A DS) (Aviv Instrument, Lakewood, NJ) utilizing a 5.0-mm path length quartz cell in the far UV region. The scan rate of the temperature was 1 K/min. The measurement was carried out in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) containing 0.6 m NaCl. The experiments of DSC were performed in a model DSC5100 calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Provo, UT). A scan rate of 1 K/min was used throughout. Before measurement, the sample was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) containing 0.6m NaCl and degassed with an aspirator for 15 min. Instrument base lines were established with both cells filled with dialysate; the reference cell remained filled with dialysate during the protein scans. In the genome sequenced fromP. horikoshii, we found a gene that contained 1,896 base pairs and showed about 20% identity with the AARE gene from pig liver (Fig. 1) (12Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Kato I. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The open reading frame was preceded by AT-rich regions in which a putative ribosome binding site GGTGAT at position −4 and a putative promoter consensus TTATAT at position −33 from ATG initiation site were found. This consensus resembles the eukaryotic TATA box and has been confirmed to be the archaeal consensus sequence TT(A/T)(T/A)AX, as determined by analysis of more than 80 archaeal promoters (19Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The protein encoded consists of 632 amino acids, making it smaller than AARE (732 amino acids) from a mammal. However, the proposed active residues (Ser, Asp, and His) of AARE, called “catalytic triad residues” (5Rawling N.D. Polgar L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Kato I. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were conserved (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the sequence homology in the Ser, Asp, and His regions (6Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) of a new family of serine-type peptidases (5Rawling N.D. Polgar L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was also observed in this protein. The residues Tyr-492 in the Ser region and Glu-602 in the His region of this protein are not conserved in AARE, but dipeptidyl peptidase (6Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that this protein, dipeptidyl peptidase, and AARE might be evolutionally related. The gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using two primers. The upper primer (5′-TTTTGAATTCTTACATATGGGCAAGGGGCTTTCA-3′) contained an NdeI I site (underlined), and the lower primer (5′-TTTTGGTACCTTT GGATCCTAAGGGTTTAGCTATCCTTT-3′) contained a BamHI site (underlined). The amplified gene was inserted in pET11a, and BL21(DE3) was transformed by the constructed plasmid. After induction for 4 h at 37 °C, 50 mg of the thermostable 70-kDa protein (as determined by SDS-PAGE) was purified from 2 liters of culture medium. The result of densitometer (data not shown) for SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) indicated that the purity was about 99%. The purified protein (0.05 mg) in solution was spotted on an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and sequenced by a PSQ-1 protein sequencer (Shimazu) at the custom service center of Takara Shuzo. By sequence analysis, the first 20 amino acid residues of the NH2terminus except the NH2-terminal Met were detected. The NH2-terminal sequence was identical to that anticipated from the nucleotide sequence. The extra f-Met residue at the NH2 terminus of the nascent polypeptide, encoded by the initiation codon, was not detected. This shows that the Gly residue neighboring the starting f-Met residue has a small radius of gyration which is essential for the removal of the f-Met residue to yield the mature enzyme (20Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 59-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), and the soluble protein was processed correctly. The high yield of the recombinant protein indicates the very efficient post-translation of the P. horikoshii gene inside E. coli cells, including the removal of the f-Met residue from the nascent polypeptide. It is suggested that the pET system is a good tool for the production of this protein, and the protein has no toxic effect on the growth of E. coli. Unlike other AARE, the protein derived from P. horikoshiineeded a high concentration of NaCl to be dissolved. Therefore, the purified protein solution used for the characterization contained 0.6m NaCl. The molecular mass of the purified protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), was consistent with that (72,390 Da) calculated from the amino acid sequences. The molecular mass of the protein determined by HPLC was about 150,000 Da (data not shown). The weighted-average molecular weight measured by light-scattering photometry using the dn/dc value determined for chicken gizzard myosin was about 160,000. Therefore, the protein is likely a dimer structure, instead of the four identical subunits found in mammals (9Mita M. Asada K. Uchimura Y. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Sakiyama F. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Kobayashi K. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11435-11445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption coefficient (A280 nm) of the protein at 1% was determined to be 12.0. To examine the activity of this protein, we used Ac-Leu-pNA, Ac-Ala-pNA, Ac-Tyr-pNA, Leu-pNA, and Ala-pNA as substrates. Table I shows the hydrolytic activity (releasing of pNA) of the protein for them. At 85 °C and pH 5.4, the protein exhibited some hydrolytic activity for Ac-Leu-pNA, Ac-Ala-pNA, Ac-Tyr-pNA and no hydrolytic activity for Leu-pNA and Ala-pNA. As shown in Table I, the protein also had hydrolytic activity for acetylpeptides and formylpeptides. Analysis of the products by HPLC revealed that the protein could only release the acylated amino acids from acylpeptides. Therefore, this protein was concluded to be the AARE from the thermophilic archaeon P. horikoshii. The characteristics of this enzyme (hereafter referred to as AAREP) were examined. The optimum pH of AAREP at 85 °C was between pH 4.8 and 5.5 (Fig. 3). The optimum temperature of AAREP at pH 5.4 was about 90 °C (Fig. 4). Its specificity for small substrates was different from those of AAREs in mammals (1Tsunasawa S. Narita K. Ogata K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1975; 77: 89-102PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kobayashi K. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11435-11445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the AARE from rat, AAREP released Ac-Leu better than Ac-Ala from Ac-amino acid-pNA; for most of the substrates used, the specific activity of AAREP was higher than that of AARE from rat (Table I). The activity decreased with increasing the residues of acylpeptides (TableI). Table II shows that AAREP has similar binding affinity for Ac-Leu-pNA, Ac-Ala-pNA, Ac-Ala-Ala, and Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala. This result is different from that of rat (17Kobayashi K. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11435-11445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km value obtained for Ac-Ala-Ala was a little smaller than that for Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala (Table II). The active site of AAREP seems to be suitable for relatively short acylpeptides. The hydrolytic activity of AAREP toward α-MSH was also examined under the above conditions. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of α-MSH was not detected by the protein sequencer after the incubation with AAREP. This result indicates that AAREP cannot release Ac-Ser from α-MSH, unlike the AARE of pig 2K. Ishikawa and S. Tsunasawa, unpublished data. or rat (17Kobayashi K. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11435-11445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The hydrolytic reaction was measured at 85 °C in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) containing 0.6 m NaCl and 5% DMF. Thermostability of the enzyme was examined with CD and DSC. The CD spectrum in the far-UV region of the enzyme was examined at 25 °C and 95 °C. The CD spectrum of the enzyme at 95 °C was a little different from that at 25 °C (Fig. 5). The intensity of the negative ellipticity around 220 nm decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The CD spectrum of AAREP at 95 °C was stable for 24 h. Using DSC from 0 °C to 125 °C, we measured the heat capacity changes of AAREP. We observed two peaks of heat capacity changes of AAREP over 100 °C in the first scan (Fig. 6 A) but no peak in the second scan. Precipitate was observed after the first scan. The temperature of the peaks was independent of the enzyme concentrations examined (0.1–2 mg/ml). This result indicates that the heat inactivation process of the enzyme is irreversible and accompanied by aggregation. The two peaks observed suggest that AAREP consists of two major domains as reported by Miyagi et al. (12Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Kato I. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results indicate that incubating AAREP at 95 °C caused its structure to begin unfolding, but the major conformation of the enzyme remained stable from 0 °C to 100 °C. After incubating at 95 °C, we measured the relative activity of AAREP at 85 °C to examine the effect of heating. Incubating at 95 °C appeared to increase the relative activity nearly 7-fold (Fig. 7). The enzyme did not lose its increased activity upon cooling (4–25 °C), suggesting that the activation was irreversible. This heat-activated enzyme (hereafter referred to as HAAREP) was also stable at 95 °C for 24 h. From the light-scattering photometry, the molecular mass of HAAREP was determined to be 260 kDa, and the spatial size of the associated molecule was observed to be expanded in space compared with AAREP; itsz-average radius of gyration (RG) had increased from less than 100 to more than 400. These molecular mass andRG values were virtually constant for nearly 5 days (250–264 kDa and RG = 416–445) at room temperature, without significant decomposition of the molecule or development of aggregation. The molecular mass value indicates that the number of monomers constituting the associated molecule averages a little more than 3 in this condition. However, the significant spacial expansion (RG = 416–445) strongly suggests a conformational change over the whole monomeric structural unit as a result of heat treatment. By heating, the absorbance around 250–280 nm was increased by 10 ± 1.3%, and the intensity of the negative ellipticity of the CD around 220 nm was decreased slightly (Fig. 5). The changes in the absorbance and CD were parallel to the change in the activity of the enzyme. The NH2-terminal sequence of HAAREP remained identical to that of AAREP. The rate of activation by heat treatment was independent of the enzyme concentrations examined (0.04–1.23 mg/ml). Therefore, it is deduced that the conformational change by heat treatment alters the molecular character of monomer and increases the activity. The NH2-terminal section of about 500 residues (12Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Kato I. Tsunasawa S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in the enzyme might be related the conformational change by heat treatment. We are continuing to investigate these points. In comparing the characteristics of the two enzymes, we found that HAAREP had a higher optimum pH, above 7.0 (Fig. 3) and a higher optimum temperature, 95 °C (Fig. 4). The relative specificity of HAAREP for substrates was similar to that of AAREP, although HAAREP showed a 7–14-fold increase in specific activity (Table I). The activation parameters of these enzymes were measured from 50–85 °C (TableIII). The temperature dependence on theKm value of Ac-Leu-pNA for AAREP (Km values at 60, 75, 80, 85, and 90 °C were 0.689 ± 0.21, 3.60 ± 0.66, 3.85 ± 0.91, 11.0 ± 6.3, and 18.0 ± 5.6 mm, respectively) was similar to that for HAAREP (Km values at 60, 75, 80, 85, and 90 °C were 0.876 ± 0.24, 4.12 ± 0.51, 3.99 ± 0.66, 12.9 ± 9.0, and 19.7 ± 2.1 mm, respectively) (Table III). From the temperature dependence on the kcat value of Ac-Leu-pNA, the activation energy of HAAREP was found to be greater than that of AAREP (Fig. 4 and Table III). Both ΔS‡ and ΔH‡ values of the activation were increased by heat treatment. The shapes of the DSC curves of HAAREP (Fig. 6 B) and AAREP (Fig. 6 A) were slightly different from each other, but both enzymes seem to be stable below 100 °C. These results suggest that the conformational change in the enzyme by heat treatment has an orienting effect on the catalytic groups of the active site, making the enzyme more active at higher temperatures. It is speculated that HAAREP is a stable intermediate state between the native AAREP state and the heat-inactivated (unfolded) state of the enzyme. Although we have no information about the activity and structure of native AARE in P. horikoshiicells, HAAREP is thought to be the dominant state of the enzyme inP. horikoshii because of the organism's high optimum growth temperature.Table IIIActivation parameters of AAREP and HAAREP for the hydrolysis of Ac-Leu-pNA at 85 °CEnzymeAAREPHAAREPΔG‡ (kcal/mol)16.75 ± 3.315.35 ± 0.26Ea (kcal/mol)15.3 ± 0.825.9 ± 2.9ΔH‡ (kcal/mol)14.6 ± 0.825.2 ± 2.9ΔS‡ (cal/mol/K)−6.0 ± 6.327.5 ± 11ΔG (kcal/mol)−3.21 ± 0.5−3.10 ± 0.8ΔH (kcal/mol)−25.8 ± 2.8−24.6 ± 3.3ΔS (cal/mol/K)−63.1 ± 7.8−60.0 ± 9.3The activation parameters (ΔG‡,Ea, ΔH‡, ΔS‡) and (ΔG, ΔH, ΔS) for Ac-Leu-pNA were calculated using typical Arrhenius plots ofkcat (Fig. 4. inset) and van't Hoff plots of Km, respectively.

Until now, AARE has been found only in eukaryotic cells and thought to be related to the initiation of protein synthesis (1Tsunasawa S. Narita K. Ogata K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1975; 77: 89-102PubMed Google Scholar, 21Narita K. Tsuchida I. Tsunasawa S. Ogata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Liew C.C.

A. 1970; 67: 1600-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The existence of this enzyme in the archaeon P. horikoshiisuggests that the initiation of protein synthesis in archaea is similar to that in eukaryotic cells. From the fact that a number of eukaryotic intracellular proteins are known to beNα-acylated (24Tsunasawa S. Sakiyama F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Brown J.L. Roberts W.K. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the existence of proteasomes in P. horikoshii (26Ishikawa K. Ishida H. Koyama Y. Ishimura M. Higuchi K. Kosugi Y. Matsui E. Masuchi Y. Shizuya H. Maekawa A. Matsui I. Nature Biotech.

Thermophiles 1996. 1996; (conference abstract, 178)Google Scholar), which might play an important role in the recycling of acylamino acids for protein synthesis with the help of AARE. In eukaryotic cells, a strong degree of genetic similarity between AARE and aminoacylase was suggested by Jones et al. (33Jones W.M. Scaloni A. Bossa F. Popowicz A.M. Schneewind O. Manning J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2194-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). InP. horikoshii, however, the gene for aminoacylase was found at another locus in the genome (27Matsui E.

Short Rep. 1997; 8: 65Google Scholar), and AAREP did not share homology or activity with aminoacylase. AARE from mammals has been used to removeNα-acylamino acid residues from acylpeptides for protein sequencing at relatively low temperature (37 °C). AAREP may not be used to removeNα-acylamino acid residues of relatively long acylpeptides. However, AAREP is expected to be used for relatively short acylpeptides in sequence analysis at temperatures higher than 90 °C. Studies about the crystal structure, thermostability, and hydrolytic mechanism of AAREP are in progress. We thank T. Hashimoto, M. Jyutori, Dr. Y. Kosugi, Dr. S. Kawasaki, and Dr. S.

This signal is abrogated by protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors, indicating that activation of an as yet unidentified PTK is mandatory for radiation-induced c-jun expression. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases BTK, SYK, and LYN are not required for this signal. Lymphoma B-cells rendered deficient for LYN, SYK, or both by targeted gene disruption showed increased c-jun expression levels after radiation exposure, but the magnitude of the stimulation was lower than in wild-type cells.

This induction is thought to be triggered by activation of JNK (JUN N-terminalkinase) (also known as stress-activated protein kinases), which leads to enhanced c-jun transcription (11Karin M.

We have previously shown that PTK activation precedes and mandates radiation-induced activation of c-jun proto-oncogene expression in human B-lineage lymphoid cells (10Chae H.P. Jarvis L.J. Uckun F.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 447-451PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identity of the PTK responsible for radiation-induced c-jun activation remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential involvement of BTK, SYK, and LYN in radiation-induced c-jun activation. To this end, we used DT-40 chicken lymphoma B-cell clones rendered deficient for these specific PTKs by targeted gene disruption. Our findings indicate that BTK plays no role in radiation-induced c-jun activation. Similarly, neither LYN nor SYK was required for activation of c-jun after radiation exposure, but our results suggest that their participation may influence the magnitude of the c-jun response. Notably, an inhibitor of JAK-3 (Janus family kinase-3) abrogated the radiation-induced c-jun activation, prompting the hypothesis that activation of a chicken JAK-3 homologue may be mandatory for induction of c-jun transcription after radiation exposure. The establishment and characterization of BTK-, SYK-, and LYN-deficient clones and reconstituted SYK-deficient cell lines of DT-40 chicken lymphoma B-cells were previously reported (20Uckun F.M.

The culture medium was RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% chicken serum (Sigma), 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (2 × 106/ml) were treated for 24 h at 37 °C with either 1) the PTK inhibitory isoflavone genistein (Calbiochem) at 111 μm(30 μg/ml) or 2) the JAK-3-specific PTK inhibitor 4-(3′-bromo-4′-hydroxyphenyl)amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (C16H14Br(N3O3)), kindly provided by Dr. Xing-Ping Liu (Alexander and Parker Pharmaceutical Inc., Roseville, MN), at 270 μm (100 μg/ml) prior to radiation in order to assess the effects of these agents on radiation-induced c-jun activation. The precursor 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline was prepared as shown Scheme FS1. In this procedure, 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzoic acid (compound 1) was treated with thionyl chloride, which directly reacted with ammonia to give 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzamide (compound 2) (35Nomoto F.

Compound 2 was reduced with sodium borohydrate and catalyzed by copper sulfate (36Thomas C.L. Catalytic Processes and Proven Catalysts. Academic Press, New York1970Google Scholar) to give 4,5-dimethoxy-2-aminobenzamide (compound 3), which was directly refluxed with formic acid to give 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline-4(3H)-one (compound 4). Compound 4 was refluxed with phosphorus oxytrichloride to provide the key starting material (compound 5) with good yield (35Nomoto F. Obase H. Takai H. Hirata T. Teranishi M. Nakamura J. Kubo K.

More specifically, for the synthesis of 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzamide (precursor compound 2), a suspension of 2 g (8.8 mmol) of 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzoic acid (5Bohmann D. Bos T.J. Admon T.

After cooling, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of 50 ml of concentrated NH4OH and 30 g of ice. The precipitated crystals were collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried to give 1.85 g of crude crystals. Recrystallization fromN,N-dimethylformamide yielded 1.76 g of pure product (88.5%). For the synthesis of 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline-4(3H)-one (precursor compound 4), 400 mg of NaBH4 was added with stirring over 4 h to a solution of 1.58 g (7 mmol) of 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzamide (compound 2) in MeOH containing a catalytic amount of CuSO4. The reaction mixture was poured into 200 ml of ice water with stirring to give 4,5-dimethoxy-2-aminobenzamide (compound 3), which was directly refluxed with 20 ml of HCOOH for 5 h. After removal of solvent, the residue was recrystallized fromN,N-dimethylformamide to give 1.18 g of pure crystals (81.5%), m.p. 295.0–297.0 °C. To synthesize 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (precursor compound 5),N,N-dimethylformamide (7 g, 90 mmol, 8.6 ml) was added dropwise over 20 min to a stirred solution of oxalyl chloride (11.42 g, 90 mmol, 8 ml) in 200 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane at 25 °C under N2, resulting in an exothermic gas evolution. When gas evolution ceased, 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline-4(3H)-one (compound 4) (12.36 g, 60 mmol) was added with mechanical agitation, and the mixture was heated to reflux for 4 h and then cooled to 25 °C. The reaction mixture was quenched with dilute aqueous Na2HPO4 solution (0.5 m, 250 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred on an ice bath for 2 h, and the solid was collected, rinsed with water (2 × 50 ml), and dried at 50 °C under vacuum to give 11.2 g of product (75.0%), m.p. 259.0–263.0 °C. Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared through the condensation of 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline with the substituted aniline as shown in Scheme FS2. More specifically, a mixture of 448 mg (2 mmol) of 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline and 2.5 mmol of substituted anilines in 20 ml of alcohol (EtOH or MeOH) was heated to reflux. Heating was continued for 4–24 h; sufficient Et3N was added to basify the solution; and the solvent was then concentrated to give crude product, which was recrystallized fromN,N-dimethylformamide. During the characterization of compounds 1 and 2 and their precursors, melting points were obtained using a Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a VAV-300 (Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota) or Varian-300 spectrometer and in Me2SO-d6 or CDCl3solution.

Shephard, Glendale, CA) as described previously (24Tuel-Ahlgren L. Jun X. Waddick K.G. Jin J. Bolen J. Uckun F.M. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1996; 20: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 38Uckun F.M. Jaszcz W. Chandan Langlie M. Waddick K.G. Gajl Peczalska K. Song C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were preincubated with PTK inhibitors for 24 h prior to irradiation. A 506-base pair c-jun probe was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of chicken genomic DNA. Primer sequences were determined based upon the sequence of chicken c-jun (GenBankTM accession code CHKJUN). Two primers (5′-ACTCTGCACC CAACTACAACGC-3′ and 5′-CTTCTACCGTCAGCTTTACGCG-3′) were used for amplification. Amplification was performed with a mixture of Taq polymerase and a proofreading polymerase (eLONGase/Taq polymerase plusPyrococcus sp. GB-D polymerase, Life Technologies, Inc.) on a thermocycler (Ericomp Delta II cycler) using a hot start. PCR products were subsequently cloned into the cloning vector PCR2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). An insert of the proper size (506 base pairs) was identified as chicken c-jun by sequence analysis using Thermosequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham) and analyzed on an automated sequencer (ALF Express Sequencer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 538-base pair chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was generated by reverse transcription and subsequent PCR amplification from chicken RNA with the following primers: 5′-AGAGGTGCTGCCCAGAACATCATC-3′ and 5′-GTGGGGAGACAGAAGGGAACAGA-3′. A 413-base pair chicken β-actin probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification from chicken RNA with the following primers: 5′-GCCCTCTTCCAGCATCTTTCTT-3′ and 5′-TTTATGCGCATTTATGGGTT-3′. The amplified cDNAs were cloned into PCR2.1. Total RNA was extracted from ∼2.5 × 107 cells with Trizol reagent, a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Biochemistry. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated directly from 1–3 × 108 cells with an Invitrogen Fast Trak 2.0 mRNA isolation kit. In brief, cells were lysed in an SDS lysis buffer containing a proprietary mixture of proteases. The lysate was directly incubated with oligo(dT) for absorption and subsequent elution of poly(A)+ RNA. Two micrograms of poly(A)+ or 20 μg of total RNA were denatured in formaldehyde/formamide loading dye at 65 °C prior to loading onto a 1% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel. Transcript sizes were determined relative to RNA markers of 0.5–9 kilobases. The gels were stained with Radiant Red in H2O to check loading and integrity of RNA prior to transfer. The RNA was subsequently transferred to positively charged nylon membrane with 20× SSC transfer buffer (1× SSC = 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.015m sodium citrate) by downward capillary transfer. The c-jun fragment was radiolabeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (40Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Northern blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in prehybridization/hybridization solution (50% formamide with proprietary blocking and background reduction reagents; Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) for 16–24 h, and unbound probe was removed by washing to a final stringency of 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC (65 °C). The blots were analyzed both by autoradiography and using the Bio-Rad storage phosphor imager system for quantitative scanning. The blots were subsequently stripped in boiling 0.1% SDS and then rehybridized with a chicken GAPDH and/or chicken β-actin probe to normalize for loading differences. Exposure of human lymphoma B-cells to 10–20-Gy γ-rays results in enhanced c-junexpression with a maximum response at 1–2 h (10Chae H.P. Jarvis L.J. Uckun F.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 447-451PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that, in DT-40 chicken lymphoma B-cells, ionizing radiation triggers biochemical and biological signals similar to those in human lymphoma B-cells (20Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine if DT-40 chicken lymphoma B-cells show a similar c-jun response to ionizing radiation, we irradiated DT-40 cells with 5, 10, 15, or 20 Gy and examined total RNA harvested from cells 2 or 4 h after radiation exposure for expression levels of 1.8-kilobase chicken c-jun transcripts by quantitative Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, radiation exposure increased the level of c-jun transcripts in a dose- and time-dependent manner without significantly affecting the GAPDH transcript levels, with a maximum stimulation index (as determined by comparison of the c-jun/GAPDH ratios in non-irradiated versus irradiated cells) of 3.1, 4 h after 20 Gy. In seven additional independent experiments, the stimulation index for 20-Gy ionizing radiation at 2 h after radiation exposure ranged from 2.4 to 3.8 (mean ± S.E. = 2.9 ± 0.4). We next examined the role of PTK in radiation-induced activation of c-jun expression in chicken lymphoma B-cells since PTK inhibitors were shown to prevent radiation-induced c-junactivation in human lymphoma B-cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, ionizing radiation did not significantly enhance c-jun expression levels in DT-40 cells treated with the PTK inhibitory isoflavone genistein (stimulation index = 1.1), indicating that activation of a PTK is required for radiation-induced c-jun expression in chicken lymphoma B-cells as well. These findings established DT-40 chicken lymphoma B-cells as a suitable model to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of radiation-induced c-jun activation. BTK is abundantly expressed in lymphoma B-cells, and its activation has been shown to be required for radiation-induced apoptosis of DT-40 cells (20Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). DT-40 cells rendered BTK-deficient by targeted disruption of thebtk genes do not undergo apoptosis after radiation exposure. Therefore, we set out to determine if BTK could be the PTK responsible for radiation-induced c-jun activation as well, by comparing the levels of c-jun induction in BTK-deficient (BTK−) versus wild-type DT-40 cells. Contrary to our expectations, 20-Gy ionizing radiation did not fail to induce c-jun expression in BTK-deficient DT-40 cells in any of the three independent experiments performed. The stimulation indices ranged from 1.6 to 3.9 (mean ± S.E. = 2.4 ± 0.5) (Fig. 2 ). Thus, ionizing radiation-induced increases in c-jun transcript levels do not depend upon the presence of BTK. Since SYK is also abundantly expressed in DT-40 cells and is rapidly activated after ionizing radiation, we next examined if SYK might be the PTK responsible for radiation-induced increases in c-juntranscript levels. As shown in Fig. 3 A, 20-Gy ionizing radiation enhanced c-jun expression in SYK−DT-40 cells rendered SYK-deficient by targeted gene disruption even though the stimulation indices observed in five independent experiments were lower than those in wild-type cells (1.9 ± 0.2versus 2.9 ± 0.4; p < 0.01). Thus, SYK is not required for radiation-induced c-jun activation in DT-40 cells, but it may participate in generation of an optimal signal. DT-40 cells express high levels of LYN, but do not express other members of the Src PTK family, including BLK, HCK, SRC, FYN, and YES, at detectable levels (20Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 33Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp.

Since it has previously been demonstrated that Src family PTKs are essential for UV-stimulated increases in c-jun expression, we postulated that the predominant Src family member, LYN, might mediate radiation-induced c-jun expression in DT-40 cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of ionizing radiation to activate c-junexpression in DT-40 cells rendered LYN-deficient by targeted gene disruption. LYN-deficient (LYN−) cells showed enhanced c-jun expression after irradiation; however, the stimulation indices were lower than those in wild-type DT-40 (Fig. 3 B ). Since LYN and SYK have been shown to cooperate in the generation of other signals in B-cells (21Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of ionizing radiation to induce c-junexpression in LYN−SYK− DT-40 cells, generated by targeted disruption of the syk gene in LYN−-deficient DT-40 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, LYN−SYK− DT-40 cells showed elevated c-jun transcript levels after irradiation, indicating that the c-jun response does not depend on either of these PTKs, either alone or in cooperation. Similar to SYK, LYN is not required for radiation-induced c-junactivation in DT-40 cells, but it may participate in generation of an optimal response. Interestingly, in four independent experiments, we observed higher base-line expression levels of c-jun in SYK−DT-40 cells than in wild-type DT-40 cells (range of 1.4–2.3-fold, mean ± S.E. = 1.6 ± 0.2-fold), suggesting that SYK may be involved in regulation of base-line c-jun levels. To further explore this possibility, we compared c-jun levels in SYK− cells with those in SYK− cells reconstituted with the wild-type or kinase domain mutant (K−) syk gene. We observed that reconstitution with wild-type syk reduced the higher base-line expression levels of c-jun in SYK− cells, whereas reconstitution with K− syk failed to reduce c-jun levels (data not shown). These results implicate SYK as a negative regulator of c-jun expression. This novel function of SYK seems to depend on its kinase domain. B-cell signal transduction events direct fundamental decisions regarding cell survival during periods of oxidative stress. A better understanding of the dynamic interplay between"

In this study, the position of the carboxyl–terminus of these aggrecan fragments, as well as a major proteolytically shortened aggrecan core protein present in cartilage matrix, have been deduced by characterizing the peptides generated by the reaction of aggrecan core protein peptides with cyanogen bromide. It was shown that two out of three such peptide fragments having an amino terminus starting at Ala374 have their carboxyl terminus located within the chondroitin sulfate 1 domain. The third and largest aggrecan core protein peptide, with an amino terminus starting at Ala374, has a carboxyl terminus in a region of core protein between the chondroitin sulfate 1 domain and the chondroitin sulfate 2 domain. The carboxyl terminus of this peptide appeared to be the same as that of the proteolytically degraded aggrecan core protein, which is retained within the extracellular matrix of the tissue. Another two aggrecan fragments recovered from the medium of explant cultures with amino-terminal sequences in the chondroitin sulfate 2 domain at Ala1772 and Leu1872 were shown to have their carboxyl termini within the G3 globular domain. These results suggest that the catabolism of aggrecan between residues Glu373 and Ala374 in the interglobular domain by the putative proteinase, aggrecanase, may be dependent on prior proteolytic processing within the carboxyl-terminal region of the core protein.

Aggrecan, the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of cartilage forms link protein-stabilized aggregates with hyaluronan and gives the tissue the ability to resist mechanical compression. The core protein of aggrecan is made up of three globular domains: G1 1The abbreviations used are: G1, globular domain 1; G2, globular domain 2; G3, globular domain 3; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and G2, at the amino-terminal end of the molecule separated by an interglobular domain, and the G3 domain at the carboxyl-terminal end, separated from the G2 domain by the keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate attachment regions. Studies on the turnover of the total and 35S-labeled pools of aggrecan in explant bovine cartilage cultures have shown that catabolism of aggrecan involves proteolytic cleavage at alanine residue 374 2Numbering of amino acid residues starts at the first residue of bovine aggrecan (4Hering T.M.

Z. Ilic, H. C. Robinson, and C. J. Handley, unpublished data. Related studies on the catabolism of newly synthesized35S-labeled aggrecan in explant bovine cartilage cultures have shown that the core protein of aggrecan within the matrix decreases in size with time in culture (1Ilic M.Z.

Using explant cultures of articular cartilage and radiolabeling techniques, we have shown that there is a rapid processing of aggrecan core protein into a smaller polypeptide (1Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J.

A major degraded aggrecan core protein with an amino-terminal sequence corresponding to that of bovine aggrecan and with the same apparent molecular weight as the degraded radiolabeled core protein, is also present in the total pool of aggrecan in the matrix (1Ilic M.Z.

In experiments investigating the loss of35S-labeled proteoglycans from cartilage explants and characterizing the catabolic products of radiolabeled aggrecan, articular cartilage (∼4.5 g) from two metacarpalphalangeal joints of 2–3-year-old cattle was placed in organ culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g of tissue/10 ml of medium) containing 20% (v/v) newborn calf serum for 5 days at 37 °C with daily change of medium as described previously (12Hascall V.C.

After 5 days in culture, the tissue was incubated with [35S]sulfate (60 μCi/ml) in medium containing 20% (v/v) newborn calf serum for 6 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the tissue was washed thoroughly with fresh sterile medium, and a proportion of the tissue (1 g) was immediately extracted for 48 h at 4 °C with 10 ml of 4m guanidinium chloride in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing proteinase inhibitors (13Oegema T.R.

At the end of the culture period, the tissue was extracted as above. In experiments involving characterization of catabolic products of total levels of aggrecan, articular cartilage (∼8 g) from two metacarpalphalangeal joints of 6–8-year-old cattle was placed in organ culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g of tissue/10 ml of medium) containing 20% (v/v) newborn calf serum for 5 days. After 5 days in culture, the tissue was washed with medium alone and replaced in culture for a further 8 days in medium containing 1 μmretinoic acid. The medium was changed daily, and the spent medium was stored in the presence of proteinase inhibitors at −20 °C. Fetal articular cartilage (∼5 g) from the knee and metacarpalphalangeal joints obtained immediately after dissection was extracted for 48 h at 4 °C with 50 ml of 4 m guanidinium chloride in 0.05m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing proteinase inhibitors for 48 h. Aggrecan macromolecules were isolated by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and digested with chondroitinase ABC (0.5 units) and keratanase (1.0 unit) in the presence of proteinase inhibitors (14Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Biophys. 1992; 294: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Pooled medium (640 ml) from explant articular cartilage cultures from mature animals was applied in 320-ml lots to a column of Q-Sepharose (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 6 m urea, 0.05m sodium acetate, pH 6, containing 0.15 msodium chloride. The column was then washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and aggrecan macromolecules were eluted with 30 ml of 4m guanidinium chloride containing 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8. The resultant aggrecan preparation was subjected to a cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation followed by deglycosylation and purification by ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose as above. Purified aggrecan core proteins isolated from the matrix of fetal calf articular cartilage and from the medium of explant cultures of cartilage and peptides generated from them by cyanogen bromide cleavage were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions on SDS-4–10% gradient polyacrylamide slab gels (85 × 55 × 0.75 mm) (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar).

After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.8 mm4-chloro-1-napthol in 20% (v/v) methanol and 0.02% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. Samples of peptides derived from the deglycosylation of aggrecan isolated from the matrix of fetal calf articular cartilage (1 mg) and aggrecan fragments present in the medium of articular cartilage cultures from mature cattle (1.5 mg) were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-4–10% gradient polyacrylamide slab gels (160 × 150 × 1.5 mm). The gels were electroeluted using polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Immobilon-PSQ (250 mA; 18 h; 4 °C). The membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the bands corresponding to the peptides were cut out and subjected to amino acid sequencing in an Advance Biosystems gas phase sequenator. Aliquots (2 ml) of guanidinium chloride extracts of cartilage explants containing 35S-labeled macromolecules and of spent medium (3 ml out of a total volume of 10 ml) from articular cartilage explant cultures, pooled from the first 2 days of culture after incubation with [35S]sulfate and pooled from day 3 to day 6 of culture, were applied to a column of Sephadex G-25 (1.4 × 17 cm) and eluted with 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate. The macromolecules eluting at the void volume of the column were pooled and lyophilized. The aggrecan samples were then resuspended in 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 7, containing proteinase inhibitors and digested with chondroitinase ABC (0.125 units) and keratanase (0.25 units) for 16 h at 37 °C. The digests were applied to a column of Sephadex G-25 eluted with 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate, and the excluded volume proteins were pooled and lyophilized. Two-thirds of each sample was subjected to reaction with cyanogen bromide. The radiolabeled core proteins, core protein fragments, and cyanogen bromide peptides isolated from the matrix and medium were analyzed by electrophoresis on an SDS-4–20% gradient polyacrylamide slab gel (160 × 150 × 1.5 mm) under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were rinsed in distilled water and subjected to fluorography as described previously. In another experiment, aggrecan fragments were isolated from the medium of explant cultures pooled over 6 days of culture after incubation with [35S]sulfate. The resultant aggrecan fragments were deglycosylated and analyzed on an SDS-4–20% gradient polyacrylamide slab gel. After electroelution onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane was probed with the monoclonal antibody 5/6/3-B-3. The immunoblot was subjected to autoradiography as described previously. A solution of 5% (w/v) cyanogen bromide in 70% (v/v) formic acid was added to dry aggrecan core proteins isolated from the matrix and medium (1 ml of solution of cyanogen bromide per 2 mg of aggrecan core proteins), and the reaction was allowed to proceed under N2in the dark for 16 h. The samples were then diluted with 1 volume of distilled water and lyophilized. This study involved the characterization of high molecular weight peptides generated by cyanogen bromide digestion of intact aggrecan core protein present in the matrix. Bovine aggrecan core protein contains nine methionine residues (4Hering T.M. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Oldberg Á.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hence the reaction of intact aggrecan core protein with cyanogen bromide can be expected to generate 10 peptides (Fig. 1 A). Three large cyanogen bromide peptides, which span most of the aggrecan core protein from Cys278 in the G1 domain to Met2197 in the G3 domain, are predicted. The work described in this study required a tissue source rich in undegraded aggrecan. For this reason, aggrecan core proteins were isolated from fetal calf articular cartilage, since the level of the intact aggrecan core protein, containing the G3 domain, is higher in fetal tissue than in older animals. In calf cartilage, it makes up ∼50% of total aggrecan (19Flannery C. Stanescu V. Mörgelin M. Boynton R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the result of proteolytic processing of the core protein, articular cartilage from mature animals was used, since our previous work has shown that in such tissue there is a rapid proteolytic processing of the intact core protein (1Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteoglycan core proteins were isolated from the matrix of articular cartilage explants immediately after incubation with [35S]sulfate for 6 h. Samples of deglycosylated radiolabeled proteoglycan core proteins before and after reaction with cyanogen bromide were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Fig. 2, lane a, shows a single major radiolabeled aggrecan core protein band with Mr greater than 200,000 (peptide 1), which represents the intact core protein. Also present were minor radioactive bands of smaller molecular weight. After reaction of aggrecan core proteins with cyanogen bromide, four major radiolabeled peptides were generated (lane b): two intensely labeled peptides designated CNBr310 and CNBr120 as well as lower intensity bands designated CNBr430 and CNBr105. Deglycosylated aggrecan core proteins, isolated from the matrix of fetal articular cartilage were reacted with cyanogen bromide. Fig. 2 shows a silver-stained gel of aggrecan core proteins before (lane c) and after (lane d) reaction with cyanogen bromide. The most abundant aggrecan core protein present in the matrix of fetal cartilage was peptide 1. Present in smaller quantity was a diffuse band of smaller core proteins, which are consistent with aggrecan core proteins proteolytically shortened at the carboxyl-terminal end (20Bayliss M.T. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 20: 12-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The predominant band corresponded to the migration of peptide 2 observed in articular cartilage from mature animals (1Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Ilic M.Z. Mok M.T. Williamson O.D. Campbell M.A. Hughes C.E. Handley C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide reaction with the same deglycosylated aggrecan core protein preparation from fetal calf cartilage generated four peptides (lane d) with the same electrophoretic mobility as those observed for radiolabeled cyanogen bromide peptides of aggrecan core proteins, CNBr430, CNBr310, CNBr120, and CNBr105. Fig. 2 also shows the immunodetection of the aggrecan core proteins (lanes e and f) and the cyanogen bromide peptides (lanes g and h) with monoclonal antibodies 1/20/5-D-4, which reacts to keratan sulfate oligosaccharides (lanes e and g) and 5/6/3-B-3, which reacts to terminal unsaturated chondroitin 6-sulfate disaccharides (lanes f and h). Aggrecan core protein bands were positive to keratan sulfate and to chondroitin sulfate epitopes. Cyanogen bromide peptides CNBr430 and CNBr310 were positive to monoclonal antibodies 1/20/5-D-4 and 5/6/3-B-3, while peptide CNBr105 had only keratan sulfate epitopes, and peptide CNBr120 had only chondroitin sulfate epitopes. Each of these cyanogen bromide peptides was subjected to amino-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the results are shown in TableI. Peptide CNBr310 had an amino-terminal sequence starting at Val692 of bovine aggrecan, which is located in the keratan sulfate domain of bovine aggrecan. Peptide CNBr430 had the same amino-terminal sequence as peptide CNBr310 but was present in a lower concentration. Peptide CNBr120 had an amino-terminal sequence starting at Ser1793 that was located in the chondroitin sulfate 2 domain of bovine aggrecan, and peptide CNBr105 had an amino-terminal sequence starting at Cys278 that was located in the G1 domain of bovine aggrecan. Included in Table I are amino-terminal sequences of aggrecan core proteins peptide 1 and peptide 2 (1Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab These results show that intact aggrecan core protein gave rise to four high molecular weight aggrecan core protein peptides after reaction with cyanogen bromide. This was indicated by the fact that the four peptides, derived from a preparation of aggrecan from fetal articular cartilage, match those from the radiolabeled pool of aggrecan rich in intact aggrecan core protein as it was isolated from mature articular cartilage immediately after incubation with [35S]sulfate. Three of these peptides, CNBr105, CNBr310, and CNBr120, had amino-terminal sequences originating in the G1 globular, keratan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate 2 domain, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1 B. The peptide CNBr430, with the same amino-terminal sequence as peptide CNBr310, was present at a much lower level than peptide CNBr310. Peptide CNBr430 was therefore likely to be a product of incomplete reaction of the intact aggrecan core protein with cyanogen bromide at its carboxyl-terminal end. Cyanogen bromide peptides CNBr105, CNBr310, and CNBr120 combined account for the bulk of the aggrecan core protein, a total of 1920 amino acid residues out of 2308, spanning from Cys278 in G1 to Met2197 in G3. These results are consistent with previous studies where a keratan sulfate-containing fragment with amino-terminal sequence SSAGWLA- 4This sequence differs from the bovine sequence in the first amino acid residue, which is Cys278 instead of Ser as reported in Ref. 21Périn J.-P.

Acta. 1983; 743: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Peptide CNBr105 shows up as a weak band when detected by 35S-fluorography of SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, lane b) but as an intense band when detected by the silver stain or immunolocalization with monoclonal antibody 1/20/5-D-4 (Fig. 2, lanes dand g, respectively). The reasons for this difference are 2-fold; there is only a small number of keratan sulfate oligosaccharide stubs attached to this region of the aggrecan core protein and consequently a low level of incorporation of 35S, whereas the majority of aggrecan monomers in the total pool of aggrecan, even core proteins lacking parts of the carboxyl-terminal domain, will generate this peptide following reaction with cyanogen bromide. Indeed, proteolytically shortened core proteins from the total pool of aggrecan, lacking much of the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule yet retaining an intact hyaluronan binding domain, can be expected to yield peptide CNBr105. Proteolytic cleavage of the aggrecan core protein between Met691 and Met1792 would also be expected to generate cyanogen bromide peptides with aMr lower than that of peptide CNBr310 as was seen in Fig. 2, lanes d, g, andh. Such peptides are likely to have the same amino-terminal sequence as peptide CNBr310 but different carboxyl termini. Comparison of high molecular weight cyanogen bromide peptides of intact aggrecan core protein with cyanogen bromide peptides of proteolytically degraded aggrecan isolated from the matrix and medium of bovine articular cartilage was then used to estimate the location of the carboxyl termini of the core proteins of these degraded aggrecan macromolecules. An experiment was set up to isolate 35S-labeled aggrecan that had undergone proteolytic processing in the carboxyl-terminal region. In this experiment, arti"

Here we report that a non-Raf binding Ras effector-loop variant (H-Ras G12V,E37G), which retains interaction with the Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), inhibits the conversion of MyoD-expressing C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts to skeletal muscle. We show that H-Ras G12V,E37G, RalGDS, and the membrane-localized RalGDS CAAX protein inhibit the activity of α-actin-Luc, a muscle-specific reporter gene containing a necessary E-box and serum response factor (SRF) binding site, while a RalGDS protein defective for Ras interaction has no effect on α-actin-Luc transcription. H-Ras G12V,E37G does not activate endogenous MAPK, but does increase SRF-dependent transcription. Interestingly, RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, and RalA G23V inhibit H-Ras G12V,E37G-induced expression of an SRF-regulated reporter gene, demonstrating that signaling through RalGDS does not duplicate the action of H-Ras G12V,E37G in this system. As additional evidence for this, we show that H-Ras G12V,E37G inhibits the expression of troponin I-Luc, an SRF-independent muscle-specific reporter gene, whereas RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX do not. Although our studies show that signaling through RalGDS can interfere with the expression of reporter genes dependent on SRF activity (including α-actin-Luc), our studies also provide strong evidence that an additional signaling molecule(s) activated by H-Ras G12V,E37G is required to achieve the complete inhibition of the myogenic differentiation program.

Ramocki M.B. Taparowsky E.J. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the set of Ras effectors that impact differentiation events appears to be distinct from the set which induces cellular transformation since Ras proteins defective for transformation efficiently block the morphological and biochemical differentiation of myoblasts in culture (8Weyman C.M. Ramocki M.B. Taparowsky E.J. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that two transformation-defective, effector-specific Ras variants inhibit MyoD-induced skeletal myogenesis (9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E.

H-Ras G12V,T35S binds to Raf-1 and activates MAPK, whereas H-Ras G12V,Y40C does not (10White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The ability of these Ras molecules to inhibit skeletal muscle differentiation does not rely on their individual abilities to activate either MEK/MAPK or Rac/Rho activity (9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these Ras effector-loop variants fail to function synergistically to inhibit myogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest that a potentially novel, Ras-activated signaling pathway is important for the inhibition of differentiation in this model system. In this current study, we demonstrate that a third Ras effector-loop variant, H-Ras G12V,E37G, which specifically interacts with the Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) (6White M.A. Vale T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), also inhibits the MyoD-induced differentiation of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. Using a reporter gene whose muscle-specific expression relies on both SRF and the muscle regulatory factors, we show that H-Ras G12V,E37G, RalGDS, and the membrane-localized RalGDS CAAX protein inhibit muscle-specific gene expression, whereas a RalGDS protein modified by deletion of the Ras binding domain (RalGDS-rbd) does not. Additionally, coexpression of H-Ras G12V,E37G and RalGDS or RalGDS CAAX enhances this effect, suggesting that H-Ras G12V,E37G and RalGDS function through distinct pathways. In examining the potential role of SRF in this observed inhibition, we demonstrate that H-Ras G12V,E37G, but not RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, or RalA G23V, activates a reporter gene regulated by a single SRF site. Furthermore, RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, and RalA G23V inhibit H-Ras G12V,E37G-stimulated transactivation of the SRF reporter gene, and RalGDS CAAX actually functions to inhibit the basal level of SRF activity observed in these cells. The opposing actions of the RalGDS pathway and H-Ras G12V,E37G toward SRF in C3H10T1/2 cells suggest that the observed impact of RalGDS on the expression of certain muscle-specific genes is linked to its negative impact on SRF. In support of this, we show that H-Ras G12V,E37G blocks activation of troponin I-Luc, an SRF-independent, muscle-specific reporter gene, whereas RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX do not. Taken together, these studies suggest a minor role for RalGDS in the Ras-mediated inhibition of myogenesis and provide strong evidence that a novel Ras-activated molecule(s) is the major effector operating to repress biochemical and morphological differentiation in this model system. α-actin-Luc, a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the muscle-specific human cardiac α-actin promoter, and pSRF2-Luc, a luciferase reporter gene regulated by a single SRF binding site from the c-fos promoter, have been described previously (12Sartorelli V.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the amounts of plasmid DNA indicated in each of the Fig. legends. Cells were exposed to DNA precipitates for 4 h, after which the cultures were treated with 20% glycerol in basal modified Eagle's medium for 2 min, maintained in growth medium for 18 h and then treated with DM for 48 h. For gene expression studies, cells were lysed in 25 mmTris, pH 7.8, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol. Following normalization to total protein content (Bio-Rad Protein Assay), cell extracts were analyzed using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). Values are expressed as RLU (relative light units/μg of protein). A minimum of three independent transfections were performed for each experimental group. Parallel cultures were processed for immunocytochemistry and for Western blot analysis as described below. Transfected C3H10T1/2 cells in DM were fixed with 70% ethanol:formalin:acetic acid (20:2:1) for 60 s, permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl for 10 min, and blocked using 2% horse serum in PBS for 30 min. Washes between treatments were performed with PBS. The cells were incubated with MF-20, a monoclonal antibody specific for the myosin heavy chain protein (16Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and reactive complexes were visualized using a secondary antibody and Vectastain Kit reagents (Vector Laboratories). The number of myosin positive cells was averaged following the examination of ten, randomly chosen microscope fields. In all instances, the efficiency of myofiber formation is expressed as a percent of the efficiency observed in control cultures transfected with pEM-MyoD alone. Transfected C3H10T1/2 cells were harvested in 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 400 mm dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol) and normalized for protein content by Coomassie Blue staining. Equal amounts of protein, along with low molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad), were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filter paper as described (17Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and MyoD was detected by incubation in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST containing a 1:300 dilution of anti-MyoD antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following several washes in TBST, reactive complexes were visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine if expression of the transformation-defective Ras effector-loop variant, H-Ras G12V,E37G, inhibits skeletal myogenesis, we tested its ability to block MyoD-induced expression of skeletal myosin and activation of a muscle-specific reporter gene, α-actin-Luc. C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with an expression vector for mouse MyoD (pEM-MyoD) and either pDCR vector DNA or pDCR H-Ras G12V,E37G. Twenty-two hours following transfection, the cultures were treated with DM and incubated for 48 h prior to myosin heavy chain immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 1 A, H-Ras G12V,E37G inhibits morphological differentiation by greater than 70%. C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with α-actin-Luc, pEM-MyoD and either pDCR vector DNA, pDCR H-Ras G12V or pDCR H-Ras G12V,E37G were cultured as described above, and cell lysates were assayed for reporter gene expression. As shown in Fig. 1 B, H-Ras G12V and H-Ras G12V,E37G also inhibit α-actin-Luc activity by 75 and 68%, respectively. The repression of myogenesis in these assays is not due to a decrease in MyoD protein since Western blot analysis revealed that equivalent levels of MyoD protein accumulate in the control and in the experimental groups (Fig. 1 C). Since H-Ras G12V,E37G interacts specifically with RalGDS (6White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Miller M.J. Prigent S. Kupperman E. Rioux L. Park S-H. Feramisco J.R. White M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), these data suggest that RalGDS has a role in the repression of myogenesis by oncogenic Ras. To determine if RalGDS and the membrane-localized variant RalGDS CAAX duplicate the effects of H-Ras G12V,E37G on muscle-specific reporter gene activity, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected with α-actin-Luc, pEM-MyoD, and pCEP4 expression vectors for RalGDS or RalGDS CAAX. The requirement for Ras interaction in the RalGDS effect was tested using pCEP4 RalGDS-rbd, which expresses a RalGDS protein deleted for the Ras binding domain. Twenty-two hours following transfection, the cells were cultured in DM, and 48 h later, cell lysates were prepared. RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX inhibit α-actin-Luc activity by 52 and 48%, respectively, whereas RalGDS-rbd has no significant effect on reporter gene expression (Fig. 2 A). The observed repression of reporter gene activity by RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX is not due to low levels of MyoD protein accumulation since Western blot analysis indicates that high levels of MyoD protein are found in all groups (Fig. 2 B). Likewise, the inability of RalGDS-rbd to block myogenesis is not a function of protein expression levels, since all three RalGDS proteins are expressed equivalently in these cells (data not shown). If RalGDS mediates the inhibition of myogenesis by H-Ras G12V,E37G, it follows that coexpression of RalGDS or RalGDS CAAX with H-Ras G12V,E37G should result in an increased repression of reporter gene activity. To test this prediction, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected with α-actin-Luc, pEM-MyoD, pDCR H-Ras G12V,E37G, and either pCEP4 RalGDS or pCEP4 RalGDS CAAX. Interestingly, coexpression of RalGDS or RalGDS CAAX with H-Ras G12V,E37G generates even lower levels of α-actin-Luc activity than either of the proteins alone. However, no true synergy is observed in these assays (Fig. 3). The increase in the inhibition of α-actin-Luc expression by RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX in the presence of H-Ras G12V,E37G, which we have interpreted to be additive, suggests that RalGDS functions as a mediator of the Ras effect. Alternatively, RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX may function within the context of a Ras signaling network to relay a negative signal of their own. Previously, we demonstrated that the constitutive activation of the Rac/Rho signaling pathway does not duplicate the effects of activated H-Ras expression in this system (9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate if the inhibition of myogenesis by H-Ras G12V,E37G relies on Rac1 activity, C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with pEM-MyoD, α-actin-Luc, pDCR H-Ras G12V,E37G, and pZIP Rac1 17N, which expresses a dominant negative form of Rac1. Results from these experiments show that expression of Rac1 17N in the presence of H-Ras G12V,E37G generates a level of reporter gene activity equivalent to that produced by H-Ras G12V,E37G alone (Fig. 3). We have confirmed by Western analysis that the Rac1 17N protein is expressed in these cells (data not shown), and therefore, we conclude that H-Ras G12V,E37G inhibits α-actin-Luc activity independently of Rac1. To confirm that H-Ras G12V,E37G functions as expected in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, we examined its influence on the transcriptional activation of two distinct reporter genes: pG5T-Luc, which is activated in a MAPK-dependent manner by Gal4-Elk1, and pSRF-Luc, which is expressed in response to SRF binding. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with pG5T-Luc, Gal4-Elk1, and pDCR H-Ras G12V,E37G, or with pSRF-Luc and pDCR H-Ras G12V,E37G. As expected, H-Ras G12V,E37G does not activate endogenous MAPK activity (2Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and therefore does not significantly enhance Gal4-Elk1-mediated transactivation in these cells (Fig. 4 A). Control groups transfected with oncogenic H-Ras alone (H-Ras 61L (Fig. 4 A) or H-Ras G12V (9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) reveal that the cells are capable of producing activated MAPK as measured by this assay. H-Ras G12V,E37G does, however, activate SRF-mediated transactivation by 7.1-fold (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, the α-actin-Luc reporter gene contains an SRF site that is essential for its activity (12Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX have been reported to act upstream of SRF (19Okazaki M. Kishida S. Hinoi T. Hasegawa T. Tamada M. Kataoka T. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine if RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX negatively influence α-actin-Luc reporter gene expression by blocking the activity of SRF, C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with pSRF-Luc and either RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, RalA G23V (a putative downstream effector of RalGDS), or H-Ras G12V,E37G plus RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, or RalA G23V. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the level of pSRF-Luc activity measured in the presence of RalGDS CAAX (a constitutively active variant of RalGDS) is reduced significantly compared with control values. Similarly, the coexpression of RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, or RalA G23V and H-Ras G12V,E37G in an equimolar ratio stimulates pSRF-Luc expression by only 4.0-, 2.4-, and 3.6-fold, respectively. These data suggest that, in C3H10T1/2 cells, the RalGDS signaling pathway represses α-actin-Luc activity by inhibiting SRF and thus provides a possible explanation for the observed additive inhibition of α-actin-Luc expression by H-Ras G12V,E37G and RalGDS or RalGDS CAAX. To further explore the observation that the RalGDS signaling pathway does not mimic the effects of H-Ras G12V,E37G in C3H10T1/2 cells, we decided to test the effects of H-Ras G12V,E37G, RalGDS, and RalGDS CAAX on a second muscle-specific reporter gene, troponin I-Luc. The troponin I-Luc (TnI-Luc) reporter gene is a muscle-specific reporter gene that is regulated independently of SRF. C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected with TnI-Luc, pEM-MyoD, and either H-Ras G12V,E37G, RalGDS, or RalGDS CAAX. The expression of H-Ras G12V,E37G inhibited TnI-Luc activity by 80% (Fig. 5). Expression of RalGDS had no effect on TnI-Luc activity, and RalGDS CAAX inhibited activity of the reporter gene by only 30% (Fig. 5). The ability of RalGDS CAAX, a constitutively active form of RalGDS, to inhibit this reporter gene to any extent suggests that the RalGDS signaling pathway may have a minor role in the Ras-mediated inhibition of myogenesis. In this regard, we also tested the ability of RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX to inhibit the morphological differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Compared with control cultures, RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX did not significantly affect fiber formation as detected by myosin heavy chain immunostaining (data not shown). Taken together, these data convincingly demonstrate that signaling through RalGDS does not duplicate the effects observed with H-Ras G12V,E37G in this cell type and provide strong evidence that a novel Ras effector mediates the inhibition of myogenesis by H-Ras G12V,E37G. It has been known for many years that oncogenic H-Ras inhibits the differentiation of muscle cells independently of their continued proliferation (8Weyman C.M. Ramocki M.B. Taparowsky E.J. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Olson E.N. Spizz G. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). H-Ras relies on multiple effector molecules including Raf/MEK/MAPK, Rac/Rho, and RalGDS to induce cellular transformation (1Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) and presumably a subset of these effectors to block differentiation events. H-Ras G12V,E37G is a variant of oncogenic H-Ras which does not activate the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway (2Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and is defective in cellular transformation (10White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Here we show that H-Ras G12V,E37G activates an intracellular signaling pathway which inhibits both the morphological differentiation of myogenic competent cells and the transcriptional activity of two muscle-specific reporter genes. Using the H-Ras effector-loop variants, H-Ras G12V,T35S and H-Ras G12V,Y40C, we demonstrated previously that Ras inhibits myogenesis independently of Raf/MEK/MAPK and Rac/Rho, suggesting the involvement of novel, Ras-activated signaling intermediates in this model system. The goal of this study, therefore, was to use H-Ras G12V,E37G to investigate further the possible identity of these intermediates. H-Ras G12V,E37G has been shown to interact specifically with RalGDS (6White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). RalGDS and the membrane-associated variant RalGDS CAAX inhibit α-actin-Luc activity and further decrease expression from this muscle-specific reporter gene when coexpressed with H-Ras G12V,E37G. H-Ras G12V,E37G does not enhance Gal4-Elk1 activity, confirming its inability to activate MAPK in this system. H-Ras G12V,E37G activates the transactivation potential of endogenous SRF, as evidenced by its ability to increase expression of the SRF-Luc reporter gene. Interestingly, RalGDS CAAX inhibits pSRF-Luc activity when expressed alone, and RalGDS, RalGDS CAAX, and RalA G23V inhibit H-Ras G12V,E37G-stimulated pSRF-Luc activity by 43, 66, and 49%, respectively. Since the full expression of α-actin-Luc depends on the activity of SRF, the ubiquitous transcription factor SP1, and a muscle-specific regulatory factor such as MyoD (12Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), this result strongly suggests that one manner in which RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX block α-actin-Luc activity is via the negative regulation of SRF. To address this issue further, we tested whether a second muscle-specific reporter gene, TnI-Luc (17Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which is activated independently of SRF, is inhibited to the same extent by H-Ras G12V,E37G, RalGDS and RalGDS CAAX. The results of this experiment demonstrate that H-Ras G12V,E37G inhibits this reporter gene by 80%, that RalGDS CAAX exerts only a modest negative effect on TnI-Luc expression, and that RalGDS has no effect at all. These data suggest that constitutive activation of the RalGDS signaling pathway does not duplicate the inhibitory effects of H-Ras G12V,E37G in this system. We also have ruled out contributions from RalA and Rac1 proteins in this signaling pathway by demonstrating that the constitutively active RalA G23V protein has no effect on TnI-Luc activity 2M. B. Ramocki, M. A. White, S. F. Konieczny, and E. J. Taparowsky, unpublished observations. and that coexpression of dominant negative Rac1 does not reverse the inhibition of α-actin-Luc activity induced by H-Ras G12V,E37G (Fig. 3), RalGDS or RalGDS CAAX.2 A recent report has shown that RalGDS does not activate the SRF-responsive c-fos promoter in NIH3T3 cells unless coexpressed with constitutively activated Raf-1 kinase (19Okazaki M. Kishida S. Hinoi T. Hasegawa T. Tamada M. Kataoka T. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Separate studies have identified Rlf, a protein possessing 30% identity to RalGDS, as a molecule that associates with H-Ras G12V,E37G in vivo and that can stimulate c-fos promoter activity, alone or synergistically with H-Ras G12V,E37G (20Wolthuis R.M.F. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wolthuis R.M.F. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At this time, we are unable to reconcile these data from other labs with our observation that RalGDS inhibits SRF-mediated transcription in C3H10T1/2 cells. It is our view that these contrasting results provide additional evidence for the existence of cell-type-specific signaling pathways for activated Ras and its effectors. To date, all of the major Ras effectors have been tested for a role in the Ras-mediated inhibition of skeletal myogenesis (8Weyman C.M. Ramocki M.B. Taparowsky E.J. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 320: 367-374Google Scholar) and none have been able to duplicate the effects of oncogenic Ras expression in this system. H-Ras G12V,E37G most likely activates a novel Ras effector which also is activated following the expression of H-Ras G12V,T35S or H-Ras G12V,Y40C. Designing strategies to identify this novel, Ras-induced signaling pathway operating in skeletal muscle precursor cells will be essential to fully understand how Ras activation impacts cellular proliferation, transformation, and differentiation events in a wide variety of cell types."

Gi3α was found to inhibit both N- and P/Q-type channels by receptor agonists, whereas Gβ1γ2 was responsible for prepulse facilitation of N-type channels. L-type channels (α1C) were not regulated by Gα or Gβγ. For N-type, prepulse facilitation mediated via Gβγ was impaired when the cytoplasmic I-II loop (loop 1) was deleted or replaced with the α1C loop 1. Gα-mediated inhibitions were also impaired by substitution of the α1C loop 1, but only when the C terminus was deleted. For P/Q-type, by contrast, deletion of the C terminus alone diminished Gα-mediated inhibition. Moreover, a chimera of L-type with the α1B loop 1 gained Gβγ-dependent facilitation, whereas an L-type chimera with the N- or P/Q-type C terminus gained Gα-mediated inhibition. These findings provide evidence that loop 1 of N-type channels is a regulatory site for Gβγ and the C termini of P/Q- and N-types for Gα.

A family of membrane-associated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: G-proteins, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins; Gα, G-protein α subunit; Gβγ, G-protein βγ subunit; HVA, high voltage-activated; loop 1, intracellular loop joining the segments I and II; DOR, δ-opioid receptor; Leu-EK, Leu-enkephalin; ω-CTx, ω-conotoxin GVIA; ω-Aga, ω-agatoxin IVA; DHP, dihydropyridine; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair. 1The abbreviations used are: G-proteins, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins; Gα, G-protein α subunit; Gβγ, G-protein βγ subunit; HVA, high voltage-activated; loop 1, intracellular loop joining the segments I and II; DOR, δ-opioid receptor; Leu-EK, Leu-enkephalin; ω-CTx, ω-conotoxin GVIA; ω-Aga, ω-agatoxin IVA; DHP, dihydropyridine; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair. is essential for mediating signal transduction between cell-surface receptors and intracellular effectors such as adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and ion channels (1Gilman A.G.

The α subunit (Gα) contains a binding site for guanine nucleotides and possesses GTPase activity. Upon receptor stimulation, heterotrimeric G-proteins disassociate into an α-GTP complex and β/γ dimer. In most systems, a GTP-bound Gα activates or inhibits an effector system, and the functional half-life is determined by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα. Recently, it has been shown that the βγ dimer (Gβγ) is significantly important in signal transduction as well (3Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). High voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels are negatively regulated by G-proteins in a membrane-delimited manner (2Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

This response is primarily mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (Go/Gi), in which Goα has been shown to inhibit current from HVA Ca2+ channels (5Hescheler J. Rosenthal W. Trautwein W.

It remains to be determined, however, which subunit arm of the G-protein complex preferentially interacts with N- and P/Q-types of HVA Ca2+channels. Recently, it has been determined that the intracellular loop joining motif I and II (referred to as “loop 1” in the present study) is an interaction site on neuronal HVA Ca2+ channels for Gβγ (10Zamponi G.W.

Nevertheless, mapping of region(s) on HVA Ca2+ channels responsible for interactions with Gα and/or Gβγ is still very incomplete (14Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To address these issues at the molecular level, we have functionally expressed α1A, α1B, and α1Cof HVA Ca2+ channels in Xenopus oocytes. These subunits were derived from rabbit brain N-type, P/Q-type, and cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. In addition, we have co-expressed δ-opioid receptor (DOR) together with Gα or Gβγ as we did in determining a region of the muscarinic-gated K+channel critical for activation by Gβγ with the presumption that co-expression with Gα or Gβγ determines which kind of modulation takes place (15Takao K.

In this paper, interactions of Gα and Gβγ with Ca2+ channels were characterized using mutant and chimeric N- (α1B) and P/Q-type (α1A) Ca2+ channels. The results, together with evidence for a direct binding provided by the companion paper (16Furukawa T. Miura R. Mori Y. Strobeck M. Suzuki K. Ogihara Y. Asano T. Morishita R. Hashii M. Higashida H.

The plasmid pSPCDR was digested withXbaI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated with aSalI linker to yield pSPCDRS. The α1C subunit cDNA was kindly provided by Drs.

The pSPA1, pSPA2, pSP72, pSP65, and pSP64 recombinant plasmids carrying the entire protein-coding sequences of Gi3α, Gβ1, Gγ2, and Ca2+ channel α1B, α1A, α2, and β1a subunits were described previously (15Takao K.

Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of Gi3α was the same as that reported (22Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) except that Ser-16, Asp-64, Ser-165, Glu-261, and Pro-282 were determined as Thr (ACG), Glu (GAA), Thr (ACC), Asp (GAC), and Ser (TCA), respectively, in our clone, pG3α1 (15Takao K.

The 5.5-kb NotI/SrfI fragment excised from pSPB3BH was ligated with the 55-bpNotI/BglI fragment from pSPB3 and the annealed oligodeoxyribonucleotides, GGGCTGGCGGTCC and GGACCGCCAGCCCCGC. The 1.7-kb NotI/PflMI fragment from the resulting plasmid was ligated with the 8.6-kb NotI/PflMI fragment from pSPB3 to obtain pSPB3S. The plasmid pSPB3S was digested with SrfI and SpeI, blunted with T4DNA polymerase, and ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides, GGGCTTAGCTGCGGAGAAGAGTTCTGAGACGTGCACCGGTT and AACCGGTGCACGTCTCAGAACTCTTCTCCGCAGCTAAGCCC, to yield pSPB3TΔ1. In this plasmid, the codon TTC for Tyr-1913 was replaced with the codon TAG for termination. The 8.7-kb SrfI/SalI fragment excised from pSPB3S was ligated with the 2.2-kbScaI/SalI fragment from pSPCDRS to obtain pSPB3TCD. In this plasmid, the codon CGG for Arg-1911 of the α1B subunit was replaced with the codon CAC for (His), and the segment encoding amino acid residues 1658–2171 of the α1C subunit was substituted for amino acid residues 1912–2339 of the α1B subunit. The plasmid pSPB3S was digested withEcoRI, blunted, and circularized to delete theEcoRI site. The resulting plasmid and the plasmid pSPB3TΔ1 were digested with BsmI, blunted, and ligated with theEcoRI linker, dGGAATTCC, to produce pSPB3S.E. and pSPB3TΔ1E. The plasmids pSPB3S.E. and pSPB3TΔ1E were digested withPmlI and EcoRI, and the 9.3-kbPmlI/EcoRI fragment from pSPB3S.E. or the 7.8-kbPmlI/EcoRI fragment from pSPB3TΔ1E was ligated with the 950-bp BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pSPCDR and the annealed oligonucleotides, GTGGCCCTGGGTGTATTTTGTCAGTCTGGTCATCTTTG and GATCCAAAGATGACCAGACTGACAAAATACACCCAGGGCCAC, to yield pSPB3LCD or pSPB3LCDTΔ1. In these plasmids, the segment encoding amino acid residues 411–740 of the α1C subunit was substituted for amino acid residues 332–668 of the α1B subunit. The 8.6-kb SrfI/SalI fragment was excised from pSPB3LCD and ligated with the 2.2-kbScaI/SalI fragment from pSPCDRS to yield pSPB3LCDTCD. The plasmid pSPCDR was partially digested withAvrII, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and circularized with T4 DNA ligase to obtain pSPCDTD1. In this plasmid, the codon AGG and CCC for Arg-1980 and Pro-1981 of the α1C subunit was replaced with the codon AGC (Ser) and TAG for termination. The 5.2-kb HindIII/ScaI and the 3.0-kb HindIII/SalI fragments excised from pSPCDRS were ligated with the 1.6-kb SrfI/SalI fragment from pSPB3 to obtain pSPCDTB3. In this plasmid, the segment encoding amino acid residues 1912–2339 of the α1Bsubunit was substituted for amino acid residues of 1658–2171 of the α1C subunit, and the codon TAC for Tyr-1657 of the α1C subunit was replaced with the codon TGG (Trp). To delete an internal SacI site, the plasmids pSPCDRS and pSPCDTB3 were partially digested withSacI, blunted, and circularized to produce pSPCDRSS and pSPCDTB3S. Another SacI site on pSPCDRSS was deleted by the same procedure. The resulting plasmid and the plasmid pSPCDTB3S were digested with SacI and StuI and blunted. The 9.5-kb SacI/StuI fragment from the former or the 8.9-kb SacI/StuI fragment from the latter was ligated with the 890-bp XhoI/ApaI fragment that was excised from pSPB3 and blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, in order to yield pSPCDLB3 or pSPCDLB3TB3. In these plasmids, the segment encoding amino acid residues 242–537 of the α1Bsubunit were substituted for amino acid residues 318–610 of the α1C subunit, and the codon CTC for Leu-242 of the α1B subunit and CAG for Gln-611 of the α1Csubunit were replaced with the codon GTC for (Val) and GAG for (Glu), respectively. The 9.6-kb PmlI/PflMI fragment from pSPB3S was ligated with the 99-bpPmlI/HhaI and 610-bpKpnI/PflMI fragments excised from pSPB3 and the annealed oligonucleotides, CGAGAGAGAGCTCAACGGGTAC and CCGTTGAGCTCTCTCTCGCG, to yield pSPB3LΔ1. In this plasmid, the segment encoding amino acid residues 366–383 of the α1B subunit were deleted. The plasmid pSPB3 was digested with SacI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and cleaved with NotI, PvuII,XmnI, and/or PflMI. The 1.1-kbNotI/SacI and 510-bpPvuII/PflMI fragments, the 1.2-kbNotI/PvuII and 360-bpXmnI/PflMI fragments, and the 1.1-kbNotI/SacI and 360-bpXmnI/PflMI fragments were ligated with the 8.6-kbNotI/PflMI fragment from pSPB3S to produce pSPB3LΔ2, pSPB3LΔ3, and pSPB3LΔ4, respectively. In the plasmid pSPB3LΔ2, the segment encoding amino acid residues 384–420 of the α1B subunit was deleted. In the plasmid pSPB3LΔ3, the segment encoding amino acid residues 421–470 of the α1Bsubunit was deleted, and the codon ATG for Met-471 was replaced with the codon GTG for (Val). In the plasmid pSPB3LΔ4, the segment encoding amino acid residues 384–470 of the α1B subunit was deleted, and the codon ATG for Met-471 was replaced with the codon GTG for (Val). pSPCBI-1 (20Mori Y.

The resulting 5.6-kb SalI/SphI (blunted) and 3.6-kb HindIII (blunted)/SalI fragments were ligated to yield pSPBICΔ1 (originally pSPCBIΔSH-1). In the plasmid pSPBICΔ1, the segment encoding amino acid residues 1856–2273 of the α1A (BI-1 α1) subunit was deleted, and the amino acid residues AFRLRAAERGR were attached. Oligonucleotides GATCTATGCCGCCATGATGATCATGGAGTACTAC, CGGCAGAGCAAAGCCAAAAAGCTGCAGGCCATGCGCGAGGAG, CAGAACCGGACACCGCTCATGTTCCAGCGCATGGAGCCCCCG, and CCGGATGAGGGGGGCGCCGGCCAGAACGCCCTGCCCTAGCGC were annealed with GGCCGCGCTAGGGCAGGGCGTTCTGGCCGGCGCCCCCCTC, ATCCGGCGGGGGCTCCATGCGCTGGAACATGAGCGGTGTCCG, GTTCTGCTCCTCGCGCATGGCCTGCAGCTTTTTGGCTTTGCT, and CTGCCGGTAGTACTCCATGATCATCATGGCGGCATA, respectively, ligated, and cleaved with BglII and NotI. The resulting 170-bpBglII/NotI fragment was ligated with the 5.8-kbXbaI/NheI, 2.6-kbNheI/BglII, and 1.1-kbNotI/XbaI fragment from pSPCBI-1 to yield pSPBICΔ4. The plasmid carries cDNA encoding the α1A(BI-1 α1) subunit with a deletion of the C-terminal amino acid residues 2015–2273. The 640-bp BamHI/BstXI and 420-bp BstXI/XmnI fragments from pCARD3 (18Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), the 87-bp XmnI/HindIII fragment from pSPCBI-2 (20Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F.

The 1.5-kbXhoI/BamHI fragment from pCARD3, the 1.1-kbBamHI/HindIII fragment from pCB(Bm-Hd), and the 9.3-kb HindIII/SalI fragment from pSPCBI-2 were ligated to yield pBC2. In the plasmid pBC2, the α1A (BI-2 α1) subunit cDNA has a substitution of the nucleotide sequence encoding residues 1–777 of the α1C subunit for the sequence encoding the amino acid residues 1–707. The 7.2-kb XbaI/PflMI fragment from pCARD3, the 3.1-kb SphI/XbaI fragment from pSPCBI-2, and the annealed oligonucleotides CTGGATGAATACGTGCGGGTCTGGGCCGAGTACGACCCTGCTGCTTGGGGACGCATG and CGTCCCCAAGCAGCAGGGTCGTACTCGGCCCAGACCCGCACGTATTCATCCAGATG were ligated to yield pBC4. The plasmid pBC4 carries cDNA for the α1C subunit which has the C-terminal tail residues 1524–2127 replaced with the tail residues 1838–2424 of the α1A (BI-2 α1) subunit. Subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. After removal of the follicular cell layer (15Takao K. Yoshii M. Kanda A. Kokubun S. Nukada T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar),Xenopus oocytes were injected either with 0.3 μg/μl α1 (α1B, α1A, α1C, mutant α1, or chimeric α1) cRNA in combination with 0.2 μg/μl α2 cRNA and 0.1 μg/μl β1a cRNA; 0.03 μg/μl DOR cRNA; 0.05 μg/μl Gi3α cRNA, or 0.05 μg/μl Gβ1 cRNA, and 0.025 μg/μl Gγ2cRNA, unless otherwise specified. The average volume of injection was ∼50 nl per oocyte. The injected oocytes were incubated for 3–5 days and then subjected to electrophysiological measurements at 21 ± 2 °C. In order to unmask the effect of endogenous Gα (16Furukawa T. Miura R. Mori Y. Strobeck M. Suzuki K. Ogihara Y. Asano T. Morishita R. Hashii M. Higashida H. Yoshii Y. Nukada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17595-17603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a deoxyoligonucleotide 20-mer (AGO) of the following sequence was used in antisense experiments, CATGACTGCTCGGGGGGGGA. The AGO antisense oligonucleotide is complementary to nucleotides (−17 to 3) of theXenopus Goα mRNA (23Olate J. Jorquera H. Purcell P. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Allende J.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The endogenousXenopus Goα nucleotide sequence shows 40% identity with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of Goα cRNA injected. This antisense oligonucleotide (0.1 μg/μl, 50 nl) was injected 12–16 h prior to electrophysiological measurements. The oocytes were positioned in a recording chamber (1.0 ml in volume) and were perfused with a Ba2+ solution containing 40 mm Ba2+, 50 mm Na+, 2 mm K+, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with methanesulfonic acid). Membrane currents through the expressed Ca2+ channels were measured with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method as described previously (15Takao K. Yoshii M. Kanda A. Kokubun S. Nukada T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Also, the membrane potential recorded by the potential electrode was monitored. The membrane was held at −80 or −100 mV, and step depolarizations were applied to activate the Ca2+ channels. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and those showing resistances of 0.5–1.5 megohms were used. We noticed slow tail currents upon repolarization as shown in Fig. 1. In these cases, the time resolution of clamping was within 4 ms and the potential error was within 3% of the command pulse, indicating no serious space-clamping problems in characterizing Ca2+channel currents. Unless otherwise stated, statistical data were represented by the mean and S.E. To establish a recombinant expression system, where current inhibition mediated by G-proteins can be reconstituted individually, HVA N-, P/Q-, and L-type Ca2+channels were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of cRNAs for three (α1, α2, and β1) Ca2+ channel subunits and the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Their responses to the opioid peptide, Leu-enkephalin (Leu-EK), were examined by the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Fig. 1 illustrates inward membrane currents recorded from Xenopus oocytes that were injected with the N-type α1B (Fig. 1, A andB), P/Q-type α1A (Fig. 1, C andD), and L-type α1C (Fig. 1, E andF) cRNA in combination with α2 and β1a subunits and DOR. As shown by the current-voltage (I-V) relationships in Fig. 1, step depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV produced long lasting inward currents at potentials more positive than −30 mV for oocytes injected with α1B (Fig. 1 B) and α1A subunits (Fig. 1 D) and at potentials positive to −50 mV with α1C (Fig. 1 F). As shown in Fig. 1 A, inward currents recorded from oocytes implanted with α1B, α2, β1aand DOR showed a time-dependent inactivation and a sensitivity to 0.1 μm ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CTx), an N-type Ca2+ channel blocker. This current was not blocked by 0.3 μm ω-agatoxin IVA (ω-Aga), a P/Q-type Ca2+ channel blocker (n = 3), nor 10 μm nifedipine, a dihydropyridine (DHP)-derivative L-type Ca2+ channel blocker (n = 12). Application of Leu-EK (1 μm) to the bathing solution inhibited inward current from N-type channels within seconds (Fig. 1 B). The inhibited current displayed “kinetic slowing” of the current activation as well as an overall reduction in peak current (24Tsunoo A. Yoshii M. Narahashi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,25Kasai H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1992; 448: 189-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, oocytes expressing α1A, α2, β1a, and DOR exhibited inward currents which were blocked by 0.3 μmω-Aga (Fig. 1 C) but not by 0.3 μm ω-CTx (n = 3) nor 10 μm nifedipine (n = 9), consistent with previous findings. Application of Leu-EK to oocytes expressing α1A also displayed Ca2+ channel modulation, similar to that observed with α1B. Since DOR translates a signal to downstream effectors through activation of G-proteins (26Evans C.J. Keith Jr., D.E. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1952-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the Leu-EK-induced inhibition of α1B and α1A currents is mediated by endogenous oocyte G-proteins. Following the injection of L-type α1C cRNA in combination with α2, β1a, and DOR cRNAs, inward currents were observed (Fig. 1, E and F), which were sensitive to 10 μm nifedipine (Fig. 1 E) (18Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), but were not blocked by 0.3 μm ω-CTx (n = 3) nor 0.3 μm ω-Aga (n = 3). By contrast to the ω-CTx-sensitive N-type or ω-Aga-sensitive P/Q-type currents, these currents were not inhibited by Leu-EK (Fig. 1 F). Thus, based on the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, α1B, α1A, and α1C channels functionally expressed in oocytes possessed the native characteristics of ω-CTx-sensitive N-type, ω-Aga-sensitive P/Q-type, and DHP-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. The Leu-EK-induced inhibition of inward Ba2+ currents was not appreciably observed when either DOR (n = 6) or the α1 subunit of Ca2+ channel (n= 6) cRNA was injected alone. In addition, ω-CTx- (n= 13), ω-Aga- (n = 3), and DHP (n = 15)-sensitive Ba2+ currents were not detectable without injection of α1B, α1A, and α1C subunit cRNAs. To determine which arm of the G-protein complex contributes to regulation of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, either Gi3α cRNA or Gβ1 plus Gγ2 cRNAs were injected into oocytes in combination with Ca2+ channel α1 (α1B or α1A), α2, and β1a subunits cRNAs and DOR cRNA. As detailed in the companion paper (16Furukawa T. Miura R. Mori Y. Strobeck M. Suzuki K. Ogihara Y. Asano T. Morishita R. Hashii M. Higashida H. Yoshii Y. Nukada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17595-17603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), agonist-induced inhibition of N-type α1B currents (Figs. 2 A and 3 A,B3) and P/Q-type α1A currents (Fig. 4,A and C, B1) was further pronounced in oocytes injected with Gi3α cRNA. By contrast, inhibition of α1B and α1A channels was not potentiated in oocytes co-expressed with Gβ1γ2. However, Ba2+ currents recorded from oocytes expressed with Ca2+ channel α1B, α2, and β1a subunits, DOR and Gβ1γ2, were increased by a large conditioning depolarization to +80 mV without receptor stimulation (Fig. 3 A,B3, open bar; also see Fig. 2 in the companion paper). This may indicate that the exogenous Gβγ can inhibit the N-type Ca2+ channel by itself, therefore not requiring receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins. Prepulse facilitations were not prominent, but still significant, for the α1A channel when injected with Gβγ (Fig. 4 C, B1). Moreover, L-type α1C currents were never inhibited by the application of agonist nor facilitated by administration of a prepulse (Figs. 2 A and 3 A, CD).Figure 3The C terminus and the loop 1 of α1B channels determining the interactions with Gi3α and Gβ1γ2. Aand B, upper, comparisons of wild-type, mutant, and chimeric α1B and α1C channels with respect to the Leu-EK-induced inhibition via Gi3α and to the prepulse facilitation via Gβ1γ2. The responses of 7 different channel types, as indicated with schemes, to 1 μm Leu-EK (horizontal bars), prepulse (open circles), or both (filled circles) were measured in oocytes co-expressing with DOR, α2, and β1a in combination with G-protein subunit as indicated. The pulse protocols were as follows: a 200-ms test pulse was applied to +10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV, which was preceded, if necessary, by a depolarizing prepulse (30 ms in duration) to +80 mV and then by a 20-ms repolarization to −100 mV. The antisense oligonucleotide, AGO, was used. The number of oocytes examined for each data are 4–23 in A and 4–10 in B. The deletion sites for these mutant α1B channels in B are represented schematically in Fig. 5 A.

In oocytes from which endogenous Ca2+ currents were recorded, α1subunit was not co-expressed (No exogenous Ca2+ channel).

Little is known, however, of the factors that regulate the secretion of this protein. We have undertaken an analysis of the response to oleate supplementation in stable clones of HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells expressing either a 6 K-IV or 17 K-IV isoform of apo(a). These cell lines were examined by pulse-chase analysis and each demonstrated an increase (range 2–6-fold) in apo(a) secretion following supplementation with 0.8 mm oleate. Microsomal membranes, prepared from HepG2 cells expressing a 6 K-IV apo(a) isoform, demonstrated that oleate supplementation increased the apparent protection of apo(a) from protease digestion, suggesting that alterations in the translocation efficiency of apo(a) may accompany the addition of oleate. Cells incubated with brefeldin A demonstrated increased recovery of the precursor form of apo(a) with oleate supplementation, suggesting that alterations in post-translational degradation may also contribute to the observed increase in apo(a) secretion following oleate addition. To further characterize the oleate-dependent increase in apo(a) secretion, cells were incubated with an inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. These experiments demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in apo(a) secretion from both cell lines. Furthermore, addition of either the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor or triacsin C, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, completely abrogated the oleate-dependent increase in apo(a) secretion. Taken together, these data provide evidence that apo(a) secretion from hepatoma cells may be linked to elements of cellular triglyceride assembly and secretion.

In humans, apo(a) circulates largely in association with low density lipoprotein, in the form of a hybrid lipoprotein referred to as Lp(a). The association between apo(a) and the major protein moiety of low density lipoprotein, namely apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), is mediated through covalent linkage of a single unpaired cysteine residue in apo(a) to a complementary unpaired cysteine in the extreme carboxyl terminus of apoB100 (4McCormick S.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23914-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interest in the biology of this lipoprotein species is driven by the observation that elevated levels of Lp(a) in the plasma of humans is associated with increased risk for atherosclerotic heart and peripheral vascular disease (2Scanu A.M. Fless G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 3Utermann G. Science. 1989; 246: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). In addition, while the molecular and physiologic basis for this observation is currently unresolved, the consensus appears to be that plasma levels of Lp(a) are largely determined by hepatic synthesis and not by alterations in catabolism (6Rader D.J. Cain W. Ikewaki K. Talley G. Zech L.A. Usher D. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Rader D.J. Cain W. Zech L.A. Usher D. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, while plasma levels of Lp(a) may vary by 3 log-orders between individuals, the levels for each individual appear to be quite constant and subject to little variability in response to diet and to pharmacologic agents which lower plasma cholesterol levels (8Gaw A. Hobbs H.H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is heightened interest in the possibility that understanding the mechanisms which regulate secretion of apo(a) and apoB100 from hepatocytes may result in progress toward a rational therapeutic target for elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) (9Angelin B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The predominant mechanism underlying individual differences in plasma Lp(a) levels relates to variations at the APO(a) locus (reviewed in Ref. 8Gaw A. Hobbs H.H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with an inverse correlation observed between plasma levels and the number of kringle IV (K-IV) repeats (10Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). White and colleagues (11White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated, using baboon hepatocytes, that this inverse correlation could be accounted for by differences in the rate and extent to which apo(a) isoforms were processed through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specifically, these workers demonstrated that smaller isoforms undergo a more complete and rapid exit from the ER than was observed with larger isoforms (11White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the implications to emerge from these studies is that a crucial restriction point in the secretion of apo(a) from hepatocytes may be topologically linked to early processing of this glycoprotein within the ER. Indeed, this prediction was confirmed in further studies by White and colleagues (12White A.L. Guerra B. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5048-5055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in which tunicamycin treatment of baboon hepatocytes was found to eliminate apo(a) secretion, in conjunction with a virtually complete block in the exit of the precursor apo(a) from the ER. Recent studies from our laboratory have extended these findings with the demonstration that the extent of the exit block of apo(a) from the ER is dependent on the number of K-IV repeats and may reflect differences in the binding of apo(a) to candidate chaperone proteins (13Bonen D.K. Nassir F. Hausman A.M.L. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res.,. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the effects of alterations in cellular triglyceride assembly and secretion on the synthesis and secretion of apo(a) from stable clones of transfected hepatoma cells (14Bonen D.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5659-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), expressing either a 6 K-IV or a larger, 17 K-IV, apo(a) isoform. The data demonstrate an increase in apo(a) secretion of both isoforms following oleate supplementation. The mechanisms underlying this response to oleate supplementation may involve alterations in the efficiency of apo(a) translocation, coupled with changes in post-translational degradation of apo(a). Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that the oleate-mediated increase in apo(a) secretion can be blocked by inhibition of either microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) or acyl-CoA synthase, suggesting that the secretion of apo(a) may be linked to elements of complex lipid assembly and/or secretion. Taken together, these data provide evidence that hepatic secretion of apo(a) may be related to the synthesis and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available and purchased from Sigma. Stable clones of HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells expressing a recombinant apo(a) containing 6 K-IV-like domains were generated as described previously (14Bonen D.K. Hausman A.M.L. Hadjiagapiou C. Skarosi S.F. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5659-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). McA-RH7777 cells were also stably transfected with an apo(a) expression construct (pRK5ha17) encoding 17 K-IV repeats. The pRK5ha17 expression plasmid (17Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) encodes for K-IV repeats 1–5, a fusion kringle consisting of repeats 6 and 26, followed by K-IV repeats 27–37 and kringle V. HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. McA-RH7777 cells were grown in DMEM containing 4 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfected HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells were grown to 90% confluence in T-25 flasks. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, preincubated for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM without serum, pulse-labeled in the same medium containing 250 μCi/ml Tran35S-label, and chased in complete medium containing 3 mm cysteine and 10 mm methionine for the times indicated in the figure legends. Preincubation, pulse, and chase media contained various additives as defined for each experiment. Where indicated, brefeldin A (BFA) was added at 5 μg/ml and was included in preincubation, pulse, and chase media. Where indicated, oleate was added at a final concentration of 0.8 mm. For experiments examining the effects of the MTP inhibitor (BMS) and triacsin C, the cells were preincubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM for 1 h and then labeled in the same media containing BMS or triacsin C for 4 h. BMS and triacsin C were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 100 and 1 mg/ml, respectively, and diluted to appropriate concentrations in media just prior to incubation with cells. Dimethyl sulfoxide, at identical final concentrations, was added alone to control cells. At the indicated times following radiolabeling, media were collected on ice and adjusted to a final concentration of the following protease inhibitors (100 mm leupeptin, 450 mm aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in cold lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors and, for HepG2 cells, 100 mm ε-aminocaproic acid. Cell lysates and media were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min to remove cellular debris and immunoprecipitations were conducted as described below. Incorporation of radioactivity into total protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of cell lysates, in all cases demonstrating comparable values between control and experimental groups (data not shown). Both medium and lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-agarose for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Aliquots were immunoprecipitated with saturating quantities of anti-apo(a), anti-apoB, anti-apoA-I, or anti-albumin antisera. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein G-agarose beads were added and the incubation continued for another 2–3 h at 4 °C. The final pellet was washed four times in immunoprecipitation wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.65 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), two times in water, and boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Quantitation was conducted using a PhosphorImager (SI, Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software. In order to average data from different experiments, where the absolute incorporation rates are divergent, immunoprecipitable apo(a) is presented as a percent of maximum intracellular apo(a), which was determined in each experiment. Transfected HepG2 cells were preincubated for 1 h in cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM containing 1.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 0.8 mmoleate. The cells were then pulse-labeled for 10 min and chased for 10 min in the same media. Membranes were prepared by Dounce homogenization as described by Shelness and colleagues (18Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2202-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (as above). After a 15-min incubation on ice, the cells were homogenized by 50 up-and-down strokes using a tight-fitting (type B) pestle. The homogenate was immediately adjusted to 250 mm sucrose and subjected to two rounds of centrifugation (700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to ensure complete removal of unbroken cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min using an S120-AT2 rotor (Sorvall RC M120 EX ultracentrifuge). The pellet was homogenized in a final volume of 750 μl of resuspension buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2) using a type B Dounce with 10 up-and-down strokes. Aliquots of equal volume from the final suspension were processed immediately on the day of preparation. Each received either no addition (control), 0.30 mg/ml proteinase K, or 0.30 mg/ml proteinase K plus 1% Triton X-100 (20Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 30 min, protease inhibitors (200 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin) were added and the samples incubated on ice for an additional 15 min. All samples were adjusted to a final concentration of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors as above and the membranes solubilized on ice for 30 min. The samples were then immunoprecipitated as described above. Where indicated in the text, comparisons were made using Student's t test for paired or unpaired samples using the InStat statistical package, version 2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). HepG2 cells expressing a 6 K-IV apo(a) isoform were examined by pulse-chase analysis in the presence or absence of 0.8 mm oleate. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, there was a sustained ∼2-fold increase in the accumulation of newly synthesized apo(a) in the media of the oleate supplemented cells at 60 and 120 min of chase (Fig. 1,A, right panel, and C). Note that intracellular accumulation of newly synthesized apo(a) and its rate of decline were comparable in both control and oleate-supplemented cells (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the increase in apo(a) delivery into the media noted with oleate supplementation reflects alterations in secretion efficiency. By way of confirmation of the effects of oleate supplementation on lipoprotein secretion, lysates and media from these cells were also examined for apoB100 synthesis and secretion. The results demonstrate the expected increase in apoB100 accumulation both within lysates (Fig. 1 D) and also in the media of oleate-supplemented cells (Fig. 1 E). In addition, the data in Fig. 1 A demonstrate an increase in the abundance of apoB100 coimmunoprecipitating with apo(a) in the media of oleate-supplemented cells. Taken together, these results indicate that oleate supplementation produces a rapid increase in the secretion of newly synthesized apoB100 as previously demonstrated, but further demonstrate a temporally similar increase in apo(a) secretion into the media of transfected HepG2 cells. Our previous studies with HepG2 cell clones expressing a 6 K-IV isoform indicated that a portion of newly synthesized apo(a) is found in the media in association with apoB100 (14Bonen D.K.

In addition, previous studies with HepG2 cells expressing larger isoforms of apo(a), as well as studies of primary baboon hepatocytes, have demonstrated that apo(a) is competent to associate with newly synthesized apoB100 secreted into the media (21Brunner C. Lobentanz E.-M. Petho-Schramm A. Ernst A. Kang C. Dieplinger H. Muller H.-J. Utermann G. J. Biol.

Accordingly, experiments were conducted to examine whether the modulation of apo(a) secretion following oleate supplementation was mediated through its association with apoB100, a protein whose secretion has been previously shown, and confirmed above (Fig. 1,D and E), to be regulated by oleate supplementation (24Wu X. Shang Z. Jiang H. Ginsberg H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3347-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Wu X. Shang A. Jiang A. Ginsberg H.N. J.

Pulse-chase experiments were conducted in stably transfected rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells expressing a 6 K-IV apo(a) isoform. This cell line was selected since rat apoB100 contains a tyrosine corresponding to the free cysteine at position 4326 in human apoB100 (28Rouy D. Duverger N. Lin S.D. Emmanuel F. Houdebine L.-M. Denefle P. Viglietta C. Gong E. Rubin E.M. Hughes S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1247-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and thus does not form a covalent complex with apo(a). The data again demonstrate the earlier appearance of the mature, processed form of apo(a) in lysates of oleate-supplemented cells (Fig. 2 A, left panel). In addition, the findings demonstrate a similar pattern of intracellular apo(a) decline in control and oleate-supplemented cells (Fig. 2 B), coupled with a sustained 6–7-fold increase in apo(a) secretion at 120 min of chase (Fig. 2, A, right panel, and C), suggesting again that oleate supplementation is associated with increased secretion efficiency of apo(a). The findings further suggest that the increase in apo(a) secretion noted following oleate supplementation occurs independent of a requirement for covalent association with apoB100. In order to determine whether the findings with the 6 K-IV isoform can be extended to the larger isoforms of apo(a) which are found in human populations, further studies were undertaken using McA-RH7777 cells expressing a 17 K-IV apo(a) isoform. Pulse-chase studies were conducted to examine the time course of intracellular processing and secretion of the larger isoform in the presence or absence of 0.8 mm oleate (Fig. 3). The data indicate a similar pattern of intracellular accumulation of apo(a) in the presence or absence of oleate (Fig. 3, A, left panel, and B). However, there was an increase in apo(a) secretion efficiency with the earlier appearance of apo(a) and a sustained ∼2-fold increase in apo(a) secretion after 4 h of chase following oleate supplementation (Fig. 3, A, right panel, and C). These findings reinforce the impressions gained above with the 6 K-IV apo(a) isoform and indicate that the effects of oleate supplementation on apo(a) secretion efficiency are not confined to the smaller fragment. One mechanism considered to account for the increased secretion of apo(a) from hepatoma cells following oleate supplementation was a change in the efficiency of translocation of this large protein into the ER. As an indirect measure of this process, microsomes were prepared from radiolabeled HepG2 cells expressing a 6 K-IV apo(a) isoform and aliquots of equal volume immediately subjected to proteinase K digestion with or without detergent. In these experiments, apparent protection from exogenous protease is used as a surrogate marker of translocation into the lumen of the ER. Proteinase K digestion of control cells demonstrated that the precursor apo(a) was largely (81 ± 2%, n = 3) susceptible to proteolysis in the absence of detergent. Additionally, the previously demonstrated band of coimmunoprecipitating apoB100 (14Bonen D.K. Hausman A.M.L. Hadjiagapiou C. Skarosi S.F. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5659-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was also susceptible to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 4). The addition of oleate prior to the preparation of microsomes resulted in an apparent increase in protection of apo(a) from proteinase K digestion, with only 44 ± 9% (n = 3) of apo(a) accessible to proteolysis in the absence of detergent (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that oleate supplementation may be associated with enhanced translocation of apo(a) across the ER membrane. A further mechanism to explain the increased secretion efficiency and enhanced recovery of newly synthesized apo(a) following oleate supplementation may involve alterations in intracellular degradation. In order to address this possibility, transfected HepG2 cells were treated with BFA, which blocks ER to Golgi processing of apo(a), and results in the accumulation of the precursor form of apo(a) within the cell (14Bonen D.K. Hausman A.M.L. Hadjiagapiou C. Skarosi S.F. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5659-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells expressing a 6 K-IV isoform of apo(a), treated with BFA alone, demonstrated an exponential decline in precursor apo(a) radioactivity, with recovery of approximately 50% of the initial material at 120 min of chase (Fig. 5, A and B). By contrast, cells treated with either BFA plus 0.8 mm oleate or BFA plus 50 μg/ml ALLN demonstrated almost complete recovery of apo(a) radioactivity at 120 min of chase (Fig. 5, A andB). These results suggest that the intracellular degradation of apo(a), detected when cells are incubated in BFA alone, is inhibited by the presence of oleate and by the calpain inhibitor ALLN. To validate these conclusions further, specifically with respect to the larger isoform of apo(a), studies were undertaken using McA-RH7777 cells expressing a 17 K-IV apo(a) isoform. The results indicate a decline in intracellular apo(a) recovery in BFA-treated cells, with less than 50% of the initial material remaining at 2 and 4 h of chase (Fig. 6). By contrast, cells treated with BFA plus 0.8 mm oleate revealed a significant increase in precursor apo(a) recovery with 73 ± 8% and 61 ± 5% (n = 3 each) of the initial material remaining at 2 and 4 h of chase, respectively (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggest that apo(a) secretion may be regulated through alterations in intracellular, presumably ER, degradation, a process which in turn appears responsive to oleate supplementation.Figure 6Oleate inhibits degradation of a 17 K-IV apo(a) isoform in McA-RH7777 cells treated with brefeldin A.McA-RH7777 cells expressing a 17 K-IV apo(a) isoform were preincubated in serum-free media for 1 h, pulsed for 1 h with 250 μCi/ml Tran35S-label, and chased for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h in fresh media. Preincubation, pulse, and chase media contained 1.5% bovine serum albumin + 5 μg/ml brefeldin A alone (BFA) or 0.8 mm oleic acid (BFA + OA).A, cell lysates were collected after each chase period, apo(a) was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. A representative immunoprecipitation demonstrates the 17 K-IV precursor apo(a). B, the data are presented as a percentage of maximum apo(a) (immunoprecipitated from the cells at 0.5 h of chase), the bars representing the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.Asterisks illustrate statistically significant differences between BFA − and BFA + oleate-treated (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The findings presented above raise the question of whether the changes observed in apo(a) secretion following oleate supplementation are related to important elements of triglyceride assembly and secretion by hepatoma cells. Accordingly, apo(a) secretion was determined in transfected hepatoma cells following inhibition of MTP activity by means of a potent competitive inhibitor, previously shown to decrease apoB secretion from both HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells (29Gordon D.A.

The encoded protein bears a significant resemblance to polynucleotide phosphorylases (PNPases) from bacteria and chloroplasts. More significantly, this RNA-binding protein is able to degrade RNAs with the resultant production of nucleotide diphosphates, and it can add extended polyadenylate tracts to RNAs using ADP as a donor for adenylate moieties. These activities are characteristic of PNPase. Antibodies raised against the cloned protein simultaneously immunoprecipitate both poly(A) polymerase and PNPase activity. We conclude from these studies that PNPase is the RNA-binding cofactor for this poly(A) polymerase and is an integral player in the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme. The identification of this RNA-binding protein as PNPase, which is a chloroplast-localized enzyme known to be involved in mRNA 3′-end determination and turnover (Hayes, R., Kudla, J., Schuster, G., Gabay, L., Maliga, P., and Gruissem, W.

In contrast, in bacteria, poly(A) tails appear to be a determinant of instability, serving to increase the rate with which RNAs are degradedin vivo (5Xu F. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In our ongoing studies of mRNA polyadenylation in plants, we identified a novel poly(A) polymerase that consisted of two distinct components (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), both of which were required for activity. One of these (termed PAP-I in previous papers) copurified with a 43-kDa polypeptide that could be recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against the yeast poly(A) polymerase (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The other (PAP-III) included one or more RNA-binding proteins of between 100 and 105 kDa in size; only RNAs associated with these proteins could be polyadenylated by this enzyme (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the isolation of cDNAs encoding these polypeptides. Analysis of these clones suggests that these RNA-binding proteins are related and are in actuality polynucleotide phosphorylase. In addition, we report that the poly(A) polymerase under study can be found in chloroplasts. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the interplay between RNA polyadenylation and turnover in chloroplasts. PAP-III, purified through the Mono Q stage (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol.

The PAP-III polypeptides (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were excised and submitted to the University of Kentucky Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility for proteolytic digestion with endo-LysC and NH2-terminal peptide sequencing. The resulting sequences were used to design degenerate oligonucleotides intended to amplify the coding segments for the corresponding peptides. These oligonucleotides (5′-CGCTGCAGACIARIGCYTCIACYTC-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCGTIGARGTIGGICARGA-3′, where I is inosine, R is purine, and Y is pyrimidine) were used to amplify products from a pea cDNA library (14Gantt J.S. Key J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These products were cloned (after digestion with BamHI and EcoRI) into appropriately digested pBluescript (Stratagene) and the inserts of different recombinants sequenced. Clones whose sequence matched those predicted from the peptide sequences were used to probe the same cDNA library, and several near full-length clones were identified. These were sequenced using the dideoxy method (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The assay for nonspecific plant poly(A) polymerase activity has been described elsewhere (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, bovine serum albumin was omitted from the polyadenylation reactions, and poly(A) was added to a final concentration of 3.33 mg/ml except where otherwise indicated. Unless noted otherwise PAP-I and PAP-III were purified through the Mono Q steps (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the experiment in Fig. 4, reactions were supplemented with the concentrations of unlabeled ADP indicated. To determine ADP-dependent adenylation, labeled RNA (RNA 3, described in Li et al. (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in a total volume of 2 μl, was mixed with 5 μl of PAP-III; the concentrations of labeled RNAs in these reactions were about 40 nm. After 30 min at 30 °C, 5 μl of buffer I (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a revised poly(A) polymerase reaction mix (167 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 267 mm KCl, 3.33 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm EDTA, 3.33 mm dithiothreitol, 0.67% Nonidet P-40, and 3.33 mm ADP) were added. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C, terminated by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and RNAs were recovered by precipitation with ethanol and separated on 6% sequencing gels. Electrophoresis was carried out for a period of time appropriate for the resolution of small RNAs; under these conditions, larger RNAs failed to resolve well but instead were apparent as an apparently homogeneous band. This property of our separations helps in quantitating these reactions because the signals corresponding to polyadenylated RNAs were localized in a small band rather than dispersed (as would be the case if more extending runs were conducted). Gels were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImaging System. Phosphate-dependent RNA breakdown was assayed as above, except ADP was replaced with 0.25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. 32P-Labeled RNA (rbcS-wt, derived from aNsiI-HaeIII fragment of the pearbcS-E9 gene polyadenylation signal (16Mogen B.D. MacDonald M.H. Leggewie G. Hunt A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5406-5414Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); 5,000–10,000 cpm, corresponding to approximately 1 pmol, was used per reaction) was preincubated with PAP-III for 15 min at 30 °C to permit binding of RNA to PAP-III (for details of the labeling and purification of the RNA, see Li et al. (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). The PAP reaction mix, containing phosphate instead of ADP or ATP, was then added, and reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C (well within the period during which the quantity of ADP increases in a linear manner). After halting reactions with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform, 1–4-μl aliquots of each reaction were applied to polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates. The plates were developed in 0.3 mLiCl and visualized by autoradiography. One μl each of 25 mm AMP, ADP, and ATP was applied as a standard (visualized by irradiating plates directly with ultraviolet light). The radioactivity in intact RNA (which remains at the origin) and ADP were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImaging System. The complete p98 coding region was cloned into pGEX-2T or pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce protein for antibody production. The appropriate fragment was produced by polymerase chain reaction with suitable restriction sites and reading frame adjustments incorporated into the primers. Escherichia colicarrying the recombinant plasmid was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and protein was purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B, as recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). Affinity-purified fusion proteins were eluted from the affinity matrix with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.9 m β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. The fusion proteins were visualized by staining briefly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, excised, and the nitrocellulose was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. These preparations were used to inject rabbits (200 μg/injection); the schedule for injection and other details have been described elsewhere (17Yang J. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1994; 99: 161-170Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies were purified from serum as described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PAP-III was immunoprecipitated from heparin-Sepharose-purified poly(A) polymerase preparations (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 20 μl of antibody (in Tris-buffered saline) was added to 20 μl of poly(A) polymerase and incubated at room temperature for 4 h with shaking. 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia), equilibrated in buffer I (40 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and antipain), was then added and the suspension incubated for 30 min on ice. The protein A-Sepharose was then collected by centrifugation (30 s in a microcentrifuge) and washed three times with 400 μl of buffer I. The pellet was suspended in 30 μl of buffer I, and 10 μl was assayed for PAP-III and PNPase activity as described above. Pea chloroplasts were isolated as described by Orozco et al.(18Orozco Jr., E.M. Mullet J.E. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Chua N.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 232-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and extracts were prepared by suspending chloroplasts in a lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mmMgCl2) and removing insoluble debris by centrifugation. Chloroplast extracts typically had protein concentrations between 1 and 5 mg/ml. These extracts were fractionated and assayed for poly(A) polymerase activity as described (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Alternatively, chloroplast extracts were evaluated by immunoblot analysis (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using appropriate antisera. Denatured extracts from pea leaves and roots, and extracts from isolated nuclei, were prepared essentially as described by Yang and Hunt (17Yang J. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1994; 99: 161-170Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These extracts were examined by immunoblot analysis using the antisera described in the text and figure legends. For immunoblots, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Filters were then washed and probed with antibodies (at dilutions of 1/500 to 1/1000) as described elsewhere (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1994; 99: 161-170Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that preparations of PAP-III contained a group of polypeptides between 100 and 105 kDa in size, one or more of which could be cross-linked to exogenous RNAs and to the products of polyadenylation (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, an association of substrate RNAs with these polypeptides was necessary for polyadenylation to occur (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we obtained NH2-terminal sequences from proteolytic fragments derived from these polypeptides. Because it was not possible to resolve the two or three individual species noted earlier (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we isolated these polypeptides in a single sample for peptide sequencing. Five peptide sequences were obtained, and this information was used to isolate corresponding cDNA clones. The longest cDNA (pQL105a) contained a single open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 897 amino acids (termed hereafter as p98), with a predicted size of about 98 kDa (Fig. 1). Because this open reading frame contained all of the peptides identified by NH2-terminal sequencing of endo-LysC fragments from the purified protein sample, it would appear that the various species arise from post-translational modification of a single polypeptide. p98 displayed significant homology to a number of proteins in various data bases. Most prominent among these were several polynucleotide phosphorylases (or PNPases; Fig. 1); for example, the amino acid identity of p98 and the E. coli PNPase was 40% (with respect to p98) in the region of homology (amino acids 83–842 of p98). The similarity with PNPases extended through the COOH-terminal domain that contains the ribosomal protein S1-related RNA binding domain (Fig. 1; 19, 20), consistent with our finding that p98 is an RNA-binding protein (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). p98 was also highly homologous to a chloroplast protein described previously, a 100-kDa ribonucleoprotein from spinach which is also related to the E. coli PNPase and has PNPase activities (23; Fig. 1); in this case, the amino acid identity was 76%. The similarity of p98 to the E. coli and spinach PNPases was lowest at the NH2 terminus. This is most likely because of the presence of a chloroplast-targeting sequence in one or both polypeptides; the NH2-terminal domain of p98 is rich in hydroxylated amino acids and is free of acidic residues, characteristics commonly found in transit peptides (21Karlin-Neumann G.A. Tobin E.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity of p98 to PNPase suggested a biochemical similarity as well. Consequently, we assayed purified PAP-III for phosphate-dependent breakdown of RNA (with a subsequent production of NDPs) and for the extension of RNA substrates using NDPs as donors for nucleotide units, two activities associated with PNPase enzymes (22Reiner A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation of PAP-III with inorganic phosphate and RNA that had been labeled with [α-32P]ATP, labeled ADP could be detected (Fig. 2 A); this ADP formation was dependent on the presence of phosphate. In addition, incubation of labeled RNA with PAP-III in the presence of ADP resulted in a substantial elongation of the labeled RNA (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that PAP-III has biochemical activities similar to those of a PNPase. Several attempts were made to isolate and characterize a GST-p98 fusion protein in a soluble form from extracts prepared from E. coli. However, the fusion protein (as well as thrombin-treated protein) produced could not be eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrix under nondenaturing conditions, thereby precluding a direct assay of the fusion protein. Thus, as an alternative, we raised antibodies against the gel-purified fusion protein and examined the ability of these antibodies to immunoprecipitate PAP-III and PNPase activities. After affinity purification, these antibodies specifically recognized a group of polypeptides that copurified with PAP-III activity (Fig. 3). The mobilities of this group of polypeptides were similar to those present in purified PAP-III (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and this was consistent in these gels with the predicted size (98 kDa; Fig. 3). Subsequently, a partially purified preparation of this poly(A) polymerase (through the heparin-Sepharose step; this preparation contains PAP-I and PAP-III (see Ref. 12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) was treated sequentially with affinity-purified anti-p98 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. After pelleting and washing the protein A-Sepharose, proteins that were bound to the pellets were assayed for poly(A) polymerase and PNPase activity. As shown in Table I, substantial PAP-III activity (defined as PAP-I-dependent poly(A) polymerase activity) could be detected in the immunoprecipitate. Importantly, the dependence on PAP-I (compare the +PAP-I and −PAP-I columns in Table I) indicates that PAP-III was efficiently immunoprecipitated but that the PAP-I that is present in the partially purified PAP preparation was not. The immunoprecipitate also possessed significant PNPase activity (Table I). In contrast, no significant activity could be seen in samples treated with protein A-Sepharose but not with antibody.Table IAnti-PAP-III antibodies immunoprecipitate PAP-III and PNPase activitySamplePAP activityPNPase activity+ PAP-I− PAP-I%Immunoprecipitate864913847.2Purified PAP-III15,85450351.6Control (no Ab)14701.9Partially purified PAP (after the heparin-Sepharose step (12Das Gupta J.

PAP activity is represented as cpm incorporated from [α-32P]ATP into polynucleotide in 120 min, and PNPase activity as the percent of label in RNA converted to ADP in the same time. The realization that p98 is a PNPase raises some important questions regarding the polyadenylation activity observed with the combination of PAP-I + PAP-III. In particular, it is possible that the observed activity (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which was measured as incorporation of label from [α-32P]ATP into long molecules, might be the result of the action of a PNPase using trace amounts of [α-32P]ADP. This ADP might be present as a contaminant in commercial [α-32P]ATP preparations or might be produced by the action of unanticipated ATPases, nucleases, and nucleoside diphosphate kinases, or other contaminants. To evaluate this, the effect of added unlabeled ADP on the incorporation of label from [α-32P]ATP was examined. As seen in Fig. 4, relatively low concentrations of unlabeled ADP had a modest stimulatory effect on the incorporation of label from ATP into long molecules. Because the lowest concentration of ADP added in this experiment (0.02 mm) was at least 10-fold greater than possible trace contamination of [α-32P]ADP in the preparations of [α-32P]ATP we use (labeled ADP was not detectable by thin layer chromatography), we conclude that ADP present in the substrate mixture is not responsible for the ATP-dependent polyadenylation observed here or previously. In addition, because unlabeled ADP concentrations comparable to the ATP concentrations (0.25 mm) used in our experiments had no effect on activity (Fig. 4), we conclude that conversion of ATP to ADP is not responsible for the observed ATP-dependent polyadenylation. Thus, the combination of PAP-I + PAP-III in fact can use ATP to extend poly(A) tracts on substrate RNAs. The above results suggest that the poly(A) polymerase we have characterized (12Das Gupta J. Li Q. Thomson A.B. Hunt A.G. Plant Sci. 1995; 110: 215-226Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) may be located in the chloroplast (from which other plant PNPases have been isolated (23Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). To test this, we prepared extracts from purified pea chloroplasts and assayed these for poly(A) polymerase activity. Using our standard assay, we could detect activity that, like the enzyme isolated whole cell extracts, did not require the addition of exogenous RNAs (TableII). This lack of dependence on exogenously added RNA is one of the hallmarks of PAP-III isolated from whole leaf extracts (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and is the result of the association of RNA with PAP-III during purification. The specific activity in crude chloroplast extracts was comparable to that after fractionation of whole cell extracts on DEAE-Sepharose (Table II), which suggests that poly(A) polymerase activity is enriched through the purification of chloroplasts. Fractionation of the chloroplast extracts on DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and Mono Q columns yielded results identical to those obtained with whole cell extracts: fractions analogous to PAP-I and PAP-III could be obtained (not shown). These observations support the hypothesis that the novel poly(A) polymerase we have studied is a chloroplast-localized enzyme.Table IIPoly(A) polymerase activity in chloroplast extractsFractionaEnzyme fraction used for assay. 4 μg of each extract was used for activity determinations.Activity without poly(A)bActivity is represented as the pmol μg−1 protein min−1 incorporated from [α-32P]ATP into high molecular weight polynucleotides.

Open table in a new tab This possibility was tested further by examining chloroplast extracts for the presence of p98 by immunoblotting. Because poly(A) polymerase is typically presumed to be a nuclear enzyme, pea nuclear extracts were also examined. As seen in Fig. 5, p98 is readily detectable in chloroplast extracts. In contrast, this protein was absent from nuclear extracts (Fig. 5). Probing identical blots with antibodies against U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP; a nuclear marker) and the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (a chloroplast marker) indicated that the chloroplast and nuclear extracts were free from appreciable cross-contamination (Fig. 5). In addition to these results, p98 could not be detected in roots (not shown). These observations are all consistent with the hypothesis that PAP-III is a chloroplast enzyme. Several results, from this and previous studies, support our conclusion that PAP-III consists at least in part of PNPase. Before, we had noted the presence, in highly purified preparations of PAP-III, of a group of approximately 100–105-kDa polypeptides (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One or more of these polypeptides could be cross-linked to the labeled products of polyadenylation, indicative of a close association with the poly(A) polymerase reaction. Moreover, there was a requirement that substrate RNAs for the poly(A) polymerase be bound to one or more of these proteins (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have isolated cDNA clones based on peptide sequences obtained from these RNA-binding polypeptides. Antibodies raised against the product of the polypeptide encoded by the p98 clone recognize polypeptides of about 100 kDa (Fig. 3), and these antibodies immunoprecipitate PAP-III activity efficiently (Table I). These observations indicate that the encoded protein (p98) is a component of PAP-III. The identity of p98 with PNPase is indicated by the extensive amino acid sequence similarity with known PNPases (Fig. 1) and by the copurification (Fig. 2) and coimmunoprecipitation (Table I) of PNPase and PAP-III activities. PNPase has been identified previously in chloroplasts (23Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a chloroplast localization for the poly(A) polymerase we have characterized. Two lines of evidence presented here support this hypothesis. First, poly(A) polymerase activity is present in chloroplast extracts (TableII), 2Q.-S. Li, J. D. Gupta, and A. G. Hunt, unpublished observations. and the activity that can be purified from such extracts is biochemically indistinguishable from the activity that has been purified from whole leaf extracts (Table II). Second, p98 is present in chloroplast extracts (Fig. 5). We have not been able to detect this polypeptide in root extracts (data not shown), an observation that suggests that p98 is not present in mitochondria or other subcellular compartments that are present in root cells. However, we cannot rule out the presence of multiple locations for p98 in photosynthetic tissues, or in highly specialized cell types in roots. p98 is very similar to that of a previously described spinach PNPase (23Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but these sequences diverge at their NH2 and COOH termini. The NH2-terminal divergence might be expected in a chloroplast transit peptide. The COOH terminus of p98 retains the ribosomal protein S1-related RNA binding domain found in bacterial PNPases, whereas the spinach PNPase lacks most of this domain (Fig. 1). Because p98 serves as an RNA-binding cofactor in the reaction catalyzed by the chloroplast poly(A) polymerase (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the COOH-terminal sequence differences raise the interesting possibility that plants may possess more than one form of PNPase, only some of which are suitable as partners for polyadenylation. PNPase is an important part of the RNA turnover machinery in bacteria (11Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24McClaren R.S. Newbury S.F.

Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), acting to degrade RNAs in a 3′ → 5′ direction via its phosphorolytic activity. In chloroplasts, polynucleotide phosphorylase is associated with a complex that helps to determine mRNA 3′-ends and can also degrade RNAs in vitro (23Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Poly(A) tracts can destabilize RNAs in chloroplast extracts, and chloroplast RNAs of a transient (and presumably unstable) nature in vivo also may have polyadenylate tracts at their 3′-ends (8Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our results provide a possible link between polyadenylation and increased RNA turnover in chloroplasts. This follows from the observation that only those RNAs that are associated with p98 (which the present study indicates is identical to PNPase) can be polyadenylated by the poly(A) polymerase we have characterized (13Li Q. Das Gupta J. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); because p98 is also PNPase, our results indicate that, in vitro, the products of polyadenylation by a chloroplast poly(A) polymerase are necessarily associated with an enzyme known to be involved in RNA degradation.

Dermatol. 1986; 86: 709-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It exerts these effects by binding to its receptor, found principally in the nuclei of its target cells, and then modulating the transcription of specific target genes involved in cell growth and differentiation, such as the proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-fos, and involucrin, a marker of keratinocyte differentiation (3Haussler M.R.

Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, with which it shares structural homology in the DNA-binding domain, the hormone-binding domain, the dimerization domain, and the transactivation domain (6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6294) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that to effect gene transcription, VDR first requires protein-protein interaction with another, but distinct member of this receptor family, the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (7Zhang X. Hoffman B. Tran P.B.V. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Once dimerized, this VDR·RXR complex recognizes and binds to specific bipartite DNA sequences found on the promoter regions of vitamin D target genes known as vitamin D response elements (VDREs) (8Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21881-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound to these elements, the VDR·RXR complex can have either a stimulatory or an inhibitory effect on gene transcription. In previous studies, we have characterized the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on human keratinocytes as they progress from the normal to the malignant phenotype (9Sebag M. Henderson J.E. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our model of tumor progression, normal human keratinocytes were established as an immortal cell line by transfection with human papillomavirus type 16 and subsequently transformed with an activated ras oncogene. We determined that the malignant keratinocytes were resistant not only to the growth inhibitory effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3, but also to its transcriptional influences. In this work, we have studied the mechanism responsible for vitamin D resistance in ras-transformed keratinocytes. We report the first incidence of vitamin D resistance caused by a disruption of the VDR·RXR complex. The HPK1A cell line was established from normal human keratinocytes by stable transfection with human papillomavirus type 16. These cells have an indefinite life span in culture, but retain differentiation properties characteristic of normal keratinocytes and are nontumorigenic when injected into nude mice. These immortalized cells were then transformed into the malignant HPK1Aras cell line after transfection with a plasmid carrying an activated Ha-ras oncogene. In addition to forming colonies in soft agar, the malignant HPK1Aras cells produce invasive tumors when transplanted into nude mice (10Durst M. Dzarlieva-Petrusevska R.T. Boukamp P. Fusenig N.E. Gissmann L. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 251-256PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco-BRL, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and passaged once or twice weekly. Cells grown under these conditions were then seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml in either 6-well plates, for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, or in 100-mm2 culture dishes, for transfections and nuclear extract preparation. Transfections were performed by incubating plasmid DNA (10 μg) with LipofectAMINE (10 μg; Gibco-BRL) for 20 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then replacing the medium with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml in 6-well plates and transfected with 5 μg of a mOP3 plasmid, containing three repeats of the mouse osteopontin vitamin D response element (CAAGGTTCACGAGGTTCAC) in front of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and 2 μg of a β-galactosidase plasmid (11Ferrara J. McCuaig K. Hendy G.N. Uskokovic M. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2971-2981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3,(10−8–10−6m) for 24 h. Following this incubation period, the cells were scraped, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and finally lysed by three freeze-thawing cycles. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and aliquots of cell extracts were used for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Assays were performed using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. A probability value of <0.01 was considered to be significant. African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and HPK1Aras cells at 50% confluence in 100-mm2culture plates were transiently transfected with either 10 μg of plasmid DNAs expressing the human retinoid X receptor (hRXRα) and the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) (kind gifts of Drs. R. Evans and M. Haussler, respectively) or hRXRα alone using the LipofectAMINE technique, as described above. After 20 h, the medium was changed, and cells were further incubated for 48 h, washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, and collected. These cell pellets as well as cell pellets collected from untransfected HPK1A and HPK1Arascells were processed in a Dounce tissue homogenizer (loose) in 2 volumes of buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec, Canada). Nuclear pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C; resuspended in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol; and again Dounce-homogenized. Following a 20-min centrifugation at 25,000 × g, nuclear extracts (supernatant) were dialyzed for 5 h against 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Protein content was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario), and samples were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. 2 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min on ice with 200 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 or 200 nm thyroxine and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in a binding buffer (250 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). 5 fmol of the appropriate 32P-labeled DNA response element was then added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. When required, the anti-RXR antibody (4X1D12, a monoclonal antibody recognizing a common region in the E-domain of all three types of RXR; a kind gift of Dr. P. Chambon) or the anti-VDR antibody (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Neshanic, NJ) was added to the incubation. In some experiments, 1–5 pmol of baculovirus-expressed hVDR (Panvera, Madison, WI) were added to the above reactions. The samples were then electrophoresed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (0.045 m Tris borate and 0.001 m EDTA, pH 8.0) at 6 V/cm. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film without intensifying screens. Total cellular RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL) and chloroform extractions. For Northern blot analysis, 5–10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing 1.1% agarose gel. RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Nytran), air-dried, baked at 80 °C for 1 h, and then hybridized with a RXRα probe labeled with [32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) by the random primer method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ontario). After 24 h of incubation at 42 °C, filters were washed successively in 1× SSC and 1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS twice for 30 min at 55 °C. Autoradiography of filters was carried out at −70 °C using Kodak XAR films and two intensifying screens. For reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) first-strand cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of RNA in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water was denatured at 80 °C for 10 min, quick-cooled on ice, and reverse-transcribed from random hexamer primers (50 pmol; PdN6, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) in 1× PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer, Ontario) containing 500 μmol/liter dNTPs (Perkin-Elmer) and 20 units of RNasin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction was carried out in a volume of 20 μl at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 41 °C for 30 min, followed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. For amplification of first-strand cDNA derived from RXRα and RXRβ mRNAs, each reverse transcription reaction was expanded to a volume of 100 μl to contain 1× PCR buffer, 200 mmol/liter dNTPs, and 50 pmol each of the upstream and downstream PCR primers for RXRα and RXRβ. The reactions were heated to 72 °C and then supplemented with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco-BRL). The reactions were subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), except for denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing for 1.5 min, and extension for 2 min during the first cycle and extension for 15 min during the last cycle. PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel run in 1× TBE buffer and visualized with ethidium bromide. PCR products were directly cloned in the vector pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Plasmid clones of interest were identified by restriction endonuclease size analysis and/or PCR analysis, and the inserts were sequenced from primers complementary to the flanking T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase promoter sites using the T7 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction mixtures, radiolabeled with 35S-dATP (ICN Biomedicals), were electrophoresed on 5% Long Ranger sequencing gel (AC Biochem, Malvern, PA) for 2 h at 60 watts. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film at room temperature. 30 μg of nuclear proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 2 h at 200 mA in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.19 m glycine, and 20% methanol. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20), pH 7.5, followed by a 2-h incubation with an anti-RXRα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted to 1:1000 in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris and 140 mm NaCl). The blots were then washed three times for 10 min each in TBST and subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G, Bio-Rad) diluted to 1:3000 in Tris-buffered saline with 5% milk. The blots were washed as described above and treated with LumiGlo (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Finally, the blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film at room temperature for 10 min. For gel shift experiments, the following synthetic oligonucleotides were used: mouse osteopontin (mOP) VDRE, 5′-GTACAAGGTTCACGAGGTTCACGTCTTA-3′; mutant mOP VDRE, 5′-GATCCGTACAAGGCCCACGAGGTTCACGTCTTA-3′; human osteocalcin VDRE, 5′-TTGGTGACTCACCGGGTGAACGGGGGCATT-3′; and thyroid hormone receptor response element (TRE) β, 5′-GATCCTGGAGGTGACAGGAGGACAGCGATC-3′. For RT-PCR, the following synthetic oligonucleotides were used: VDR, 5′-ATGGCGGCCAGCACTTCCCTGCCTGAC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CTCCTCCTTCCGCTTCAGGATCATCTC-3′ (downstream); RXRα, 5′-TGGCAAGGACCGGAACGAGAAT-3′ (upstream) and 5′-TCCATAAGGAAGGTGTCAATGGG-3′ (downstream); and RXRβ, 5′-TGCGGGGACAGAAGCTCAGGCAAA-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GTAGGTCTCCAGTGATGCATACAC-3′ (downstream). To determine if the resistance of HPK1Aras cells to the growth inhibitory influence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 occurs at the transcriptional level, we transfected a reporter plasmid (mOP3) containing three repeats of the mouse osteopontin vitamin D response element cloned in front of a thymidine kinase-driven bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (Fig. 1). From the graph in Fig. 1, it was determined that the dose of 1,25-(OH)2D3 that gives the half-maximal transactivation effect in HPK1A cells was 8 × 10−9m, whereas in HPK1Arascells, that dose was ∼10-fold higher at 6 × 10−8m. A growth inhibition curve was constructed (9Sebag M. Henderson J.E. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these data correlate well with the transactivation data; half-maximal inhibition was observed at 0.2 × 10−9min HPK1A cells and at 0.2 × 10−8m in HPK1Aras cells. Therefore, 1,25-(OH)2D3 is ∼10-fold less effective in the growth inhibition and transactivation of HPK1Aras cells as compared with HPK1A cells. We previously reported that both the number of vitamin D receptors and their affinities for ligand were not significantly different in HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells (9Sebag M. Henderson J.E. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that the hormone-binding domain was functionally intact. Therefore, we first analyzed the DNA-binding domain of VDR by cloning the VDR cDNA from HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells using RT-PCR. After sequencing the cloned DNAs, we determined that sequences from both cell lines were identical to the known sequence of hVDR (data not shown). The ability of nuclear extracts derived from HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells to form specific VDR·RXR protein complexes interacting with known VDREs was next examined. We first determined that nuclear extracts from both HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells formed complexes with a32P-labeled mOP VDRE probe (Fig. 2 A). These complexes comigrated with those formed by control nuclear extracts (i.e. COS-7 cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding hVDR and hRXRα). The addition of an anti-VDR antibody that targets the DNA-binding domain of VDR inhibited the formation of retarded complexes in all nuclear extracts. The extracts were also incubated with an anti-RXR antibody that recognizes the D- and E-domains of RXR and normally retards (supershifts) any complexes containing RXR. A supershift was evident with control COS-7 cell extracts as well as with extracts prepared from immortalized HPK1A cells. These results contrasted sharply with the absence of a supershift with HPK1Aras nuclear extracts in the presence of an anti-RXR antibody. Similar results were also observed using an osteocalcin VDRE as the labeled probe under the same conditions (data not shown). To verify the presence of VDR in the complexes formed by HPK1Aras nuclear extracts, purified hVDR expressed in baculovirus was added in increasing concentrations to HPK1Aras and HPK1A nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 C). When hVDR was added to HPK1A or HPK1Aras nuclear extracts, a VDR-containing complex was formed on the VDRE with a dose-dependent increase. Consistent with the amount of starting material (2 μg of HPK1A and 1 μg of HPK1Arasnuclear extracts) used in this particular experiment, a lesser base-line complex formation was observed with HPK1Arasextracts (lane 1) as compared with HPK1A extracts (lane 6) in the absence of supplementation with hVDR. However, with the addition of 2 pmol of hVDR to the respective nuclear extracts, a similar 3-fold increase in the VDR-containing complex was observed with both the HPK1A extracts (lane 7) and the HPK1Aras extracts (lane 3). This dose-dependent increase in complex formation confirmed the presence of VDR in nuclear extracts prepared from HPK1Aras cells. The specificity of complex formation was assessed through the competition of a 32P-labeled mOP probe with either an unlabeled mOP probe or an unlabeled mutant mOP probe (Fig. 2 B). The protein·DNA complex was competed out by the unlabeled mOP probe; however, the mutant version of this probe left the complex unaffected in all cell extracts. We next investigated the possibility that the level of RXR mRNA expression in HPK1Aras cells was low or absent. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of RXRα message in both HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells and the absence of RXRβ message in both of these cell lines (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, Northern blot analysis revealed an equal amount of RXRα mRNA in both of these cell lines (Fig. 3 B). We then examined the possibility that an inhibitory factor present only in HPK1Aras cells could prevent the formation of VDR·RXR complexes. To test this hypothesis, HPK1Aras nuclear extracts were supplemented with COS-7 cell extracts enriched with RXRα (Fig. 4 A). The supershifted band in the presence of the anti-RXR antibody was restored (lane 6) with the addition of 1 μg of COS-7 extracts to the HPK1Aras extract. A dose-dependent increase in the intensity of this supershifted band was observed with the addition of increasing amounts of COS-7 extract to the HPK1Aras nuclear extract (data not shown). In Fig. 2 A, it was shown that the complex formed with the hRXRα-transfected COS-7 extracts (lane 3) was of similar intensity to the complex formed with the same amount of HPK1Aras nuclear extract (lane 11). In Fig. 4 B, hRXRα was transiently transfected into HPK1Aras cells. For the transfection of both HPK1Aras and COS-7 cells, the same conditions were used as described under “Materials and Methods.” However, the transfection efficiency of HPK1Aras cells was found to be 5-fold lower than that of COS-7 cells (determined through cotransfection with β-galactosidase). The complexes formed in HPK1Aras cells were recognized by the anti-RXR antibody (lane 3), implying that such expression levels of wild-type hRXRα in HPK1Aras cells overcame the defect observed with RXR in these cells. Finally, we examined the interaction of RXR with another dimerization partner, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). To this effect, we analyzed the ability of TR to bind to its DNA recognition sequence or thyroid hormone response element (TRE) (Fig. 5). Results with a 32P-labeled TRE probe were similar to those observed with a VDRE. HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells formed complexes that comigrated in gel retardation assays. However, the complexes formed by HPK1Aras cells were not recognized by the anti-RXR antibody, such that no supershift was observed with this antibody. Overexpressing hRXRα in HPK1Aras cells restored the ability of the anti-RXR antibody to supershift complexes as previously observed with VDREs (Fig. 5). The C-terminal domain of the RXRα cDNA derived from HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells was amplified and cloned into a sequencing vector. This area, from amino acids 706 to 1426, comprises the D- and E-domains of the receptor, domains that are responsible for ligand binding, but that also play a critical role in transactivation and dimerization (6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6294) Google Scholar, 12Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). No genetic alterations were found in the RXRα cDNA from HPK1Aras cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis was performed using nuclear extracts prepared from HPK1A, HPK1Aras, and COS-7 cells transfected with hRXRα (Fig. 6). An antibody specific for hRXRα revealed a single protein complex in the control COS-7 extracts. A single protein complex was also observed in the HPK1A and HPK1Aras extracts (Fig. 6). No protein complex was observed in the presence of preimmune IgG. Cultured keratinocytes have been shown to hydroxylate 25-(OH)D3 to its active metabolite, 1,25-(OH)2D3 (13Bikle D.D. Nemanic N.K. Whitney J.O. Elias P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1545-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and its receptor (the vitamin D receptor) has been identified in skin and in keratinocyte cultures (14Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Elias P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5390-5395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 acts in an autocrine fashion to suppress growth and to stimulate the differentiation of keratinocytes, making it a crucial player in keratinocyte cell biology. In this study, we first demonstrated that the vitamin D resistance observed in ras-transformed keratinocytes occurs at the level of gene transcription. Transfection experiments using a mOP VDRE attached to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid also supported the hypothesis that resistance in HPK1Aras cells is due to a disruption in the VDR signaling pathway. VDR isolated from HPK1Aras cells was present in amounts equal to those found in HPK1A cells and interacted normally with its ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (9Sebag M. Henderson J.E. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we focused our attention on the DNA-binding domain of VDR. To date, several mutations have been found in this region in the clinical condition described as type II vitamin D-resistant rickets (15Sone T. Marx S.J. Liberman V.A. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1980; 4: 623-631Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Jin C.H. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 196-205PubMed Google Scholar). The consequence of these mutations is a nonfunctional VDR, unable to modulate gene transcription. Our present study indicated that no such mutations are found in the VDR DNA-binding domain cloned from HPK1Aras cells. Furthermore, several clones were sequenced, and we ruled out the possibility of mutation in only one allele. Subsequently, we focused our attention on the interaction between VDR, RXR, and target DNA response elements. Using gel mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that nuclear extracts prepared from HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells and control COS-7 cells enriched with VDR and RXR bind to a VDRE in a similar fashion. The addition of an anti-VDR antibody that targets the DNA-binding domain of the receptor confirmed the presence of VDR in the complex observed on gel retardation assays using nuclear extracts derived from both established and transformed keratinocytes. Further confirmation of the presence of VDR was obtained by the addition of exogenous baculovirus-produced hVDR to nuclear extracts. From these studies, we can therefore conclude that in HPK1Aras cells, VDR is present in the protein complex that retards a VDRE probe. Recently, the dimerization partner of VDR was identified in gel retardation assays as RXR (7Zhang X. Hoffman B. Tran P.B.V. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and at least in vitro, RXR is required for VDR binding to a VDRE (16Jin C.H. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 196-205PubMed Google Scholar). Using an antibody that recognizes all three major types of RXR (α, β, and γ), we determined that RXR was present in the VDR-containing complexes from control and HPK1A nuclear extracts. However, the same antibody did not bind to the protein complex obtained from ras-transformed keratinocytes. It is therefore possible that RXR is not present in VDRE-binding complexes formed with HPK1Aras nuclear extracts. Much of the work supporting the notion that VDR has a weak affinity for a VDRE in the absence of RXR was executed using either bacterially expressed or yeast-expressed vitamin D receptors (16Jin C.H. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 196-205PubMed Google Scholar). However, this notion is still disputed, and some groups have proposed that VDR can indeed form homodimers and effectively bind to VDREs in the absence of RXR (17Freedman L.P. Arce V. Fernandez R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Carlberg C. Bendik I. Wyss A. Meier E. Sturzenbecker L.J. Grippo J.F. Hunziker W. Nature. 1993; 361: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 19Mackey S.L. Heymont J.L. Kronenberg H.M. Demay M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our present studies seem to indicate the lack of RXR in HPK1Aras complexes, but do not rule out the possibility that another, as of yet unidentified protein can participate in VDR binding to a VDRE. Further investigations are required to clarify this issue. To further clarify RXR interaction in HPK1Aras cells, we next analyzed its interaction with another well characterized dimerization partner, TR (7Zhang X. Hoffman B. Tran P.B.V. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis that RXR interaction with this receptor was abnormal in ras-transformed keratinocytes was confirmed by the absence of a supershift in the presence of the anti-RXR antibody. As TR has been clearly shown to form transcriptionally active homodimers in vitro (20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear what the physiological implications are with respect to the absence of RXR. Further work must be done on HPK1Aras cells to identify any biological consequences contributed by the lack of RXR involvement in thyroid receptor heterodimerization. Another potential mechanism of vitamin D resistance is the presence of interfering proteins preventing VDR·RXR interaction with VDREs. Such inhibitory accessory proteins have been previously identified for the thyroid hormone receptor (21Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 22Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Glass B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), and vitamin D-resistant New World primate cells were recently reported to contain a protein or complex of proteins capable of inhibiting VDR·RXR heterodimer binding to a VDRE (23Arbelle J.E. Chen H. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Pike J.W. Adams J.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested this possibility in our system by adding COS-7 extracts enriched with hRXRα to HPK1Aras nuclear extracts and observed heterodimer formation and binding to a VDRE. We observed that the same VDR-containing band was present, but also that the addition of this exogenous hRXRα rescued the supershift of this complex following the addition of the anti-RXR antibody. A similar rescue phenomenon was observed in gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts of HPK1Aras cells transfected with a plasmid overexpressing hRXRα. The presence of the expected VDR·RXR complex in these experiments ruled out the presence of an inhibitory protein in the HPK1Aras extracts. Similar results obtained using a TRE-labeled probe therefore indicate that the addition of exogenous hRXRα is sufficient to form both VDR·RXR and TR·RXR heterodimers in HPK1Aras cells. RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from both HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells revealed that the predominant form of RXR expressed in these cell lines is RXRα. Although RXRβ has been shown to increase and facilitate vitamin D receptor binding, it is RXRα that has the greatest effect on vitamin D-dependent transcription (24Kephart D.D. Walsh P.G. DeLuca H. Butt T.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 408-419PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of RXRα in skin biology is underscored by previous reports that claim that it is the predominant form of RXR in skin and cultured normal human keratinocytes (25Xiao J.-H. Durand B. Chambon P. Voorhees J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3001-3011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Elder J.T. Astrom A. Pettersson U. Tavakkol A. Krust A. Kastner P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 36S-41SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of RXRα message revealed that this receptor is expressed in equal amounts in both HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells, therefore eliminating low levels of RXRα expression as one potential mechanism of vitamin D resistance. Another distinct possibility to explain the inability of RXRα obtained from HPK1Aras cells to heterodimerize with VDR could be explained by genetic alteration of the RXRα dimerization domain. We investigated this possibility by amplifying, cloning, and sequencing the D- and E-domains of RXRα. These regions contain functional domains responsible for ligand binding, transactivation, and dimerization (6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6294) Google Scholar, 12Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). No mutations in these regions were found. Finally, we analyzed RXRα protein expression by Western blot analysis. Our data indicate that RXRα protein is expressed equally in both HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells. However, our present study did not exclude the possibility of post-translational modifications of the RXR protein in HPK1Aras cells. It should be noted that almost all nuclear receptors are known to be phosphoproteins, and an altered phosphorylation state of RXRα expressed in HPK1Aras cells as compared with RXRα from HPK1A cells could be responsible for the inability of RXRα to form complexes with the VDRE and TRE. In Fig. 4 B, the lower intensity of the supershifted band of the hRXRα-enriched HPK1Aras nuclear extracts (lane 3) as compared with that of COS-7 extracts (Fig. 2 A, lane 5) was likely mostly attributable to the 5-fold lower transfection efficiency relative to COS-7 cells. However, we cannot rule out that if post-translational modifications were occurring with endogenous RXR from HPK1Aras cells, hRXRα transfected in these cells was not also affected in this manner. This mechanism would also account for the less intense supershifted band recovered in these cells. Further studies are necessary to determine if this mechanism does indeed operate in ras-transformed keratinocytes. Recently, it has been established that nuclear receptors transactivate their target genes by associating with several coactivator or corepressor proteins (27Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94 (and references therein): 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Some of these coactivators, including SRC-1A (steroid receptorcoactivator-1A), have been shown to possess an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (27Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94 (and references therein): 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). SRC-1A binds to RXRα and enhances in vivo transcription by this nuclear receptor (29Horowitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). It is thought that since RXR recruits SRC-1A to the receptor complex, this coactivator could increase the accessibility of response elements within the promoters of the target genes to the transcriptional machinery by virtue of its histone acetyltransferase activity. In several cancer cell lines, mutations causing over- or underexpression of such coactivators and corepressors have been implicated in tumor progression (28Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). Deregulated quantities of these proteins could greatly affect the transactivation of target genes normally regulated by the VDR·RXR nuclear receptor complex and could account for the partial “resistance” to 1,25-(OH)2D3 observed in the HPK1Aras cells. Further studies on these coactivators and corepressors are required to determine if their over- or underproduction contributes in any way to the resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D3 encountered in the HPK1Aras cells. This study strongly suggests a causal relationship between resistance to vitamin D action and disruption of the VDR·RXR complex inras-transformed keratinocytes. The crucial role of RXR in modulating VDR function is likely to expand our knowledge as to how malignant cells can evade normal growth-arresting signals. We thank V. Papavasiliou, P. Harakidas, I.

https://openalex.org/W2011348427,"The 21-base pair glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene is the onlycis-acting element known to modulate the transcriptional activity of receptors bound to glucocorticoid response elements. Specifically, the GME increases the activity of complexes bound both by physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids, due to a left shift in the dose-response curve, and by saturating concentrations of anti-glucocorticoids. For this reason, the nuclear protein(s) that has been demonstrated to bind to the GME is of major interest as a possible transcription factor with hitherto undescribed properties. Subsequent studies indicated that not one but two proteins of 88 and 67 kDa (= GMEB-1 and -2, respectively) formed a heteromeric complex with double-stranded GME oligonucleotides in gel shift assays and participated in the expression of GME activity (Oshima, H., Szapary, D., and Simons, S. S., Jr. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 21893–21910). Here, we report the use of polymerase chain reaction of degenerate oligonucleotides and 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to clone two cDNAs of 2.0 and 1.9 kilobase pairs that probably result from alternative splicing. Both cDNAs encoded open reading frames containing all four previously sequenced peptides. The longer 2.0-kilobase pair cDNA encoded an open reading frame for an acidic, 529-amino acid protein and afforded a major 67-kDa and a minor 58-kDa protein after in vitrotranscription/translation. Both proteins were recognized by a mono-epitopic antibody raised against a peptide of GMEB-2. The in vitro translated protein bound to GME DNA in gel shift assays. However, the binding to GME DNA increased markedly after mixing with authentic GMEB-1 to give a gel-shifted complex that was similar to that derived from HTC cell cytosol. GMEB-2 shares a unique domain (KDWKR) with proteins derived from diverse organisms as follows:Drosophila (DEAF-I), rat (Suppressin), andCaenorhabditis elegans (three unknown open reading frames). Collectively, these data suggest that the 67-kDa GMEB-2 not only is an important factor for the modulation of glucocorticoid receptor bound to glucocorticoid response elements but also may belong to a novel family of transcription factors.

Glucocorticoid induction of the rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) 1The abbreviations used are: TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; GME, glucocorticoid modulatory element; GMEB, glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding protein; kb, kilobase pair; r.t., room temperature; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; bp, base pair; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. gene has been a useful model for steroid-induced gene expression over the years for several reasons. It is a biologically relevant response. It was one of the first systems to show a correlation between the steroid binding of receptors and whole cell induction of a protein (1Tomkins G.M. Martin Jr., D.W. Stellwagen R.H. Baxter J.D. Mamont P. Levinson B.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1970; 35: 635-640Crossref Google Scholar). TAT induction is a primary effect of the receptor-steroid complex in that the induction of enzyme requires mRNA synthesis and is down-regulated by the removal of steroid (2Thompson E.B. Baxter J.D. Rousseau G.G. Glucocorticoid Hormone Action. Springer Verlag, New York1979: 203-217Google Scholar). Finally, the TAT gene was shown to contain specific DNA sequences, called glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), which are steroid-inducible enhancers. GREs are obligatory components in the formation of the ternary DNA-receptor-steroid complexes that, in turn, are believed to interact with the transcriptional machinery to increase the rate of TAT gene transcription (3Jantzen H.-M. Strahle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 4Schmid E. Schmid W. Jantzen M. Mayer D. Jastorff B. Schütz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Over the last few years, however, the picture has become much more complicated. Whereas the TAT GRE is still a “simple GRE” in that receptor-steroid complex binding to the isolated GRE is capable of inducing transcription without the help of other cis-acting elements or transcription factors (5Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), differences with other GREs have emerged, and many other TAT gene elements have been found to participate in the induction process. Thus, the TAT GREs are much further upstream from the start of transcription than for most other steroid hormone responsive elements (3Jantzen H.-M. Strahle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 6Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8695-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor binding to the second GRE appears to be HNF-3 as opposed to the glucocorticoid receptor (7Nitsch D.

The region around the GREs of −2.6 to −2.3 kb has been found to be necessary for tissue-specific induction and has been called a glucocorticoid-responsive unit (6Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8695-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to the GRE, the glucocorticoid-responsive unit contains binding sites for the family of C/EBP proteins (9Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R.

Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). All of the above TAT gene elements have been defined in the context of how, and when, glucocorticoid receptor activates or represses gene transcription in the presence of saturating concentrations of steroid. Arguably even more important for the functioning of intact cells are the responses with subsaturating concentrations of glucocorticoids because the intact cell or organism rarely is exposed to micromolar concentrations of glucocorticoid. Whereas those mechanisms regulating the level of response to saturating concentrations of agonist steroids should persist at subsaturating concentrations, thereby leaving the EC50 of the dose-response curve unaffected, the converse is not necessarily true. In fact, we have reported that the dose-response curve for TAT gene induction in Fu5-5 cells is left-shifted (to give a lower EC50) relative to the same gene in HTC cells (18Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Mercier L. Miller P.A. Simons Jr., S.S. J.

Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Simons Jr., S.S. Mercier L. Miller N.R. Miller P.A. Oshima H. Sistare F.D. Thompson E.B. Wasner G. Yen P.M.

Thus, physiological concentrations of glucocorticoid elicited a greater percentage of the maximal induction of the TAT gene in Fu5-5 cells than of any other genes examined. Although the fold change in the percent of maximal activity seen with subsaturating concentrations of glucocorticoid may seem small (e.g. 60% for the TAT geneversus 30% for other glucocorticoid-regulated genes), it is more than sufficient to permit differential control of gene expression by the same subsaturating concentration of glucocorticoid that a cell would see during development, differentiation, and homeostasis. Another relatively unexplored area of steroid hormone action concerns anti-steroids, which block the action of agonists and thus have clinical utility. In parallel with the above studies of TAT dose-response curves, we observed that the amount of agonist activity displayed by anti-glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone 21-mesylate was much greater for TAT gene induction in Fu5-5 cells than in HTC cells (19Mercier L.

Furthermore, synthetic reporter constructs containing the 21-bp TAT sequence mimicked the endogenous TAT gene in the two other properties that have been examined: control of expression at the level of correctly initiated transcripts (26Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 27Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and response to changes in cell density (26Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 27Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the properties of the endogenous TAT gene were faithfully reproduced in synthetic reporter constructs containing a GRE and the 21-bp element. To reflect its activity, we have called this 21-bp sequence a glucocorticoid modulatory element, or GME (25Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 27Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S.

Szapary D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). The characteristics of this GME sequence appear to be unique among those elements previously documented to participate in the transcriptional activation by steroid receptors. Acis-acting element of the distal promoter of the rat progesterone receptor gene has been described to cause just the opposite effects of the GME, i.e. a right shift in the estrogen receptor induction of the progesterone receptor gene and decreased amounts of agonist activity with selected anti-estrogens (30Montano M.M. Kraus W.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, it is almost certain that different factors will be found to be responsible for the opposite effects of this progesterone receptor element and the GME. Two proteins of 88 and 67 kDa that bind to the GME have been purified by oligo-affinity chromatography. The combination of these two proteins was sufficient to give a complex with the GME oligonucleotide in gel shift assays that was indistinguishable from that of the endogenous, cellular proteins (31Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In both cases, biologically active, but not mutant inactive, GME oligonucleotide was able to inhibit the formation of a protein-DNA complex with 32P-GME oligonucleotide (26Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar,31Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we have called the 88- and 67-kDa proteins glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding proteins (GMEB) 1 and 2, respectively. By several biochemical criteria, these GMEBs differed from many of the previously described CREB/CREM/ATF family members, some of which also could bind to the the same GME DNA sequence (7Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G.

Furthermore, tryptic peptide fragments of the two GMEBs were unlike anything on GenBankTM, which additionally suggested that a novel process was being examined. Nevertheless, as most transcription factors are members of larger families with similar activities, it is probable that other proteins will be found that will be related to the GMEBs, either in structure or in function. In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of GMEB-2 (the 67-kDa protein). Preliminary experiments indicate that other related proteins may exist which could be members of this putative new family of transcription factors.

The following chemicals were purchased from the indicated sources: [35S]dATP, [35S]Met, and oligonucleotide, Life Technologies, Inc.; acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and prestained molecular weight markers, Bio-Rad and Life Technologies, Inc.; messenger RNA isolation kit, Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); reverse transcriptase-PCR system kit and TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega (Madison, WI); restriction enzymes and DNA polymerase, New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Promega. LSB buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at r.t.), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20 mm NaCl. Tris-buffered saline (TBS) had 20 mm Tris and 0.28 m NaCl in water (pH 7.5 at r.t.). The 2× SDS sample buffer contained 0.6 mTris (pH 8.8 at r.t.), 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue. Western blot transfer buffer was comprised of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3 at r.t.), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Rat hepatoma tissue culture cells (clone 27 of Fu5-5 cells) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) in Richter's improved minimum essential medium with zinc and supplemented with 0.03% glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). Cytosols were prepared as usual by freeze-thaw lysis and ultracentrifugation (32Reichman M.E. Foster C.M. Eisen L.P. Eisen H.J. Torain B.F. Simons Jr., S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5376-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antibody against the GMEB-2 sequence of ISPKEFVHLAGKSTLKDWKRAIR was prepared and affinity purified against the immunizing peptide by Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). The rat GMEB-2 was cloned by preparing degenerate oligonucleotides of 20 bp in length for the three published tryptic fragments of GMEB-2 (31Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For those amino acids such as leucine and serine, for each of which there are six possible codons, the degeneracy of the synthetic oligonucleotides was reduced by using only those codons that are most commonly used in rat. Each degenerate oligonucleotide contained the same last two 3′ nucleotides to act as a “clamp” for hybridization, thereby increasing the frequency of productive elongation, with the cDNAs that were prepared by reverse transcription from poly(A)-enriched rat liver Fu5-5 cell, Clone 27, mRNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total Fu5-5 RNA using either an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA; for degenerate primer cloning) or two passes over oligo(dT)-cellulose spin columns (5 Prime/3 Prime; for RACE). cDNA was prepared from the poly(A)+ RNA using either avian myeloblastosis virus polymerase (for degenerate primer cloning) or Superscript or Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with an oligo(dT) primer (for degenerate primer cloning), a GMEB2-specific primer (for 5′-RACE), or an anchored oligo(dT) primer (for 3′-RACE; used the CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) Amplifinder amplification primer sequence linked 5′ to (dT)17). After using all possible combinations of the primers for the three original tryptic fragments, and a second round of PCR using a second primer that was 3′ of the first primer, a 278-bp cDNA was obtained which contained the appropriate portions of the peptides IMDSGELDFYQHDK and AGLLDEVIQEFQQELEETMK at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. This 278-bp cDNA was then used with the method of 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Ligation-mediated 5′-RACE to generate a unique 5′ sequence (0.8 kb) was performed essentially according to the manufacturer's recommendations using theCLONTECH 5′-RACE kit, cDNA prepared from poly(A)+ RNA (see above), proofreading DeepVent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and two nested GMEB2-specific primers. Two 1.4-kb 3′ sequences, which overlapped the 5′ 0.8-kb sequence, were obtained using two nested GMEB2 gene-specific primers and a primer complementary to the anchor portion of the oligo(dT) primer used for cDNA synthesis (see above) with the native, proofreading form of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The blunt-ended products of Vent and DeepVent synthesis were A-tailed withTaq DNA polymerase according the manufacturer's recommendations (New England Biolabs) and cloned onto the T/A cloning vector, pCR2.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Three 5′- and 3′-RACE clones were completely sequenced on both strands. The full-length cDNAs were obtained by joining the 5′ and 3′ fragments together afterApaI cleavage in the overlapping region to give 2.0- and 1.9-kb clones. To ensure that there were no PCR errors in this composite GMEB-2 sequence, an independent recloning of GMEB-2 was performed. A full-length 2.0-kb cDNA was recloned directly from Fu5-5 cell (clone 27) mRNA by standard reverse transcription and PCR amplification methods using oligonucleotides corresponding to 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of the composite GMEB-2. The 2.0-kb GMEB-2 cDNA was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase 2.0 from U. S. Biochemical Corp.) of this direct GMEB-2 cDNA revealed no differences within the GMEB-2 coding region of the original GMEB-2 clone. HTC cytosol was separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the molecular mass range of 67 kDa, based on the migration of prestained molecular weight markers in adjacent lanes, was cut out of the gel and electroeluted in 1× SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.19 m glycine, 0.1% SDS) at 125 V in a model 1750 electroeluter (ISCO, Lincoln, NE) for 90 min at r.t. After elution, the protein was precipitated with 4 volumes of acetone (−60 °C). The pellets were redissolved in LSB buffer and reprecipitated with acetone as before. After the second precipitation, the recovered samples were denatured and renatured by redissolving in 100 μl of LSB buffer containing 6 mguanidinium hydrochloride and dialyzing against LSB buffer for 16 h. After dialysis, the renatured samples were concentrated to about 40 μl with a Microcon 10 concentrator and stored at −70 °C. GMEB-2 protein was expressed in vitro from the clone in pCR2.1 with TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturer's suggestions. The oligonucleotides 5′-CTTCTGTATGAGCGCCAGTAT-3′ and 3′-GAAGACATACTCGCGGTCATA-5′, which correspond to the GME of the rat TAT sequence at −3654 to −3634 bp from the start of transcription, were annealed and 32P-end-labeled by Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Gel shift experiments were performed as described (26Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosol (0.5–2.0 μl) and the in vitrotranscription/translation product (0.5–4.0 μl) were incubated with 20,000 cpm of the 32P-end-labeled GME (0.6 fmol) in a total volume of 20 μl for 20 min with sheared, non-denatured herring sperm DNA (0.3 μg) as a nonspecific competitor. For immuno-inhibition experiments, the antibody was added to the 20-μl reaction after the initial 20 min at 0 °C, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min at r.t. After electrophoresis in a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V in 0.4× TBE, the dried gels were autoradiographed for 12–24 h at r.t. with Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film. Alternatively, the gels were exposed to the phosphorimaging screen for the Molecular Dynamics Image-Quant system for 16–48 h at r.t. The amount of each specific band was calculated as the intensity of that band (calculated by the Molecular Dynamics software) minus the constant background value of the same area from an unrelated region of the gel. Samples diluted 1:2 in 2× SDS buffer were analyzed on constant percentage acrylamide gels (between 7 and 14% with a 1:37.5 ratio of bisacrylamide to acrylamide) run in a water-cooled (15 °C) Protean II slab gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 35 mA/gel. Gels were fixed, stained, dried without fluorescence additives, marked at the positions of the molecular weight markers with a fluorescent paint, and autoradiographed for 10–24 h as described (33Modarress K.J. Cavanaugh A.H. Chakraborti P.K. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25621-25628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer for 2 min at r.t. prior to electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Rad Transblot Apparatus (100 mA overnight followed by 250 mA for 2 h). The nitrocellulose was stained in Ponceau S (0.02% Ponceau S and 0.04% glacial acetic acid in water) to localize molecular weight markers, incubated with 10% Carnation nonfat dry milk in TBS for 45 min, and washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween (0.1 TTBS) for 5 min. Primary antibody was diluted in 0.1 TTBS (1:1000) and added to the nitrocellulose for 2 h at r.t. Biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ABC reagents (each diluted 1:1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were each added for sequential 30-min incubations at r.t. After the incubation periods with primary antibody, secondary antibody, and ABC reagents, the nitrocellulose was washed three times for 5 min each with 0.1 TTBS, and an additional three washes with TBS containing 0.3% Tween immediately after incubation with the ABC reagents. Detection of signal was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the recommended protocol of the supplier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The positions of the molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were indicated by overlaying with a fluorescent paint marker. Analyses were performed with the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test using the program InStat 2.03 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The rat GMEB-2 was cloned using the approach of PCR, with the primers being the degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the three tryptic fragments of GMEB-2 (31Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2049516652,"The apoptotic machinery of Caenorhabditis elegans includes three core interacting components: CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9. CED-3 is a death protease composed of a prodomain and a protease domain. CED-4 is a P-loop-containing, nucleotide-binding molecule that complexes with the single polypeptide zymogen form of CED-3, promoting its activation by autoprocessing. CED-9 blocks death by complexing with CED-4 and suppressing its ability to promote CED-3 activation. A naturally occurring alternatively spliced form of CED-4 that contains an insertion within the nucleotide-binding region (CED-4L) functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of CED-3 processing and attenuates cell death. Domain mapping studies revealed that distinct regions within CED-4 bind to the CED-3 prodomain and protease domain. Importantly, the CED-4 P-loop was involved in prodomain binding. Disruption of P-loop geometry because of mutation of a critical lysine (K165R) or insertional inactivation (CED-4L) abolished prodomain binding. Regardless, K165R and CED-4L still retained CED-3 binding through the protease domain but were unable to initiate CED-3 processing. Therefore, the P-loop-prodomain interaction is critical for triggering CED-4-mediated CED-3 processing. Underscoring the importance of this interaction was the finding that CED-9 contacted the P-loop and selectively inhibited its interaction with the CED-3 prodomain.

The interchangeability of death components between worm and man emphasize their conservation and suggest that they likely share a fundamentally similar mechanism of action.

We have used organomercurial chromatography to capture accessible thiol groups of proteins at (or near) nascent repair sites in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum (group C) human cells. The reactive groups include cysteine 110 of histone H3, which is exposed in unfolded nucleosomes. Immediately after UV irradiation and a short pulse labeling of repair patches, intact nuclei were digested with restriction enzymes to release ∼18% of the chromatin into soluble fragments, which are enriched (∼4-fold) in a constitutively transcribed gene. Upon organomercurial affinity fractionation, ∼1.8% of the soluble chromatin remains bound in high salt (0.5m NaCl) and is released with dithiothreitol. In normal cell chromatin, this fraction is enriched in nascent repair patches (1.5–1.8-fold) over the unbound fraction. This enrichment decreases following short chase periods with a time course similar to the loss of enhanced nuclease sensitivity of these regions (t ½ ≈ 30 min). Much less enrichment of nascent repair patches is observed in the thiol-reactive fraction from XPC cells, which repair primarily the transcribed strand of active genes. These results suggest that transient nucleosome unfolding occurs during nucleotide excision repair in normal human cells, and this unfolding may require the XPC protein.

These results suggest that transient nucleosome unfolding occurs during nucleotide excision repair in normal human cells, and this unfolding may require the XPC protein. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, forming nucleosomes, which are the primary repeating units of chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar and 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). In processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and repair, the proteins involved must access DNA buried within this structural hierarchy. This obstacle is formidable in the case of nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; XPA, XPC, and XPD, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A, C, and D, respectively; DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s); PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EPNP, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane. as DNA lesions occur in all regions of chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 3Smerdon M.J.

Progress in Nucleic Acids Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., 1998Google Scholar). Thus, damaged DNA within all levels of chromatin structure must be recognized, removed, and replaced by repair enzymes. Several human diseases, characterized by high cancer incidence, result from deficiencies in NER (reviewed in Refs. 6Cleaver J.E. Kraemer K.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. Mcgraw-Hill, New York1989: 2949-2971Google Scholar and 7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Wolfram S. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). For example, xeroderma pigmentosum, which is manifested as extreme sensitivity to UV light, often results in skin cancer. The xeroderma pigmentosum locus heterogeneity has been divided into eight complementation groups (6Cleaver J.E. Kraemer K.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. Mcgraw-Hill, New York1989: 2949-2971Google Scholar), indicating that the molecular basis of this disease may involve one of several defects in the DNA repair pathway. Some of these defects may prevent repair enzymes from accessing damaged DNA complexed with nucleosomes. Indeed, DNA damage-specific endonuclease activity in extracts from human XPA and XPD cells decreases when DNA is folded into nucleosomes, while this activity is enhanced in extracts from normal human cells (8Parrish D.D. Lambert M.W. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Parrish D.D. Feng X. Lambert M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 10Parrish D.D. Lambert W.C. Lambert M.W. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, XPC cells repair primarily the template strands of transcriptionally active chromatin and are deficient in repair of inactive (or bulk) chromatin (11Kantor G.J. Barsalou L.S. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Venema J. van-Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. van-Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Since transcriptionally active chromatin has a number of distinguishing features compared with bulk chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar and 14), factors may exist in cells that promote access to DNA lesions in condensed chromatin domains for DNA repair processing. It is clear that NER modulates nucleosome structure (for reviews, see Refs. 3Smerdon M.J. Lambert M.W. Laval J. DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Biological Implications in Mammalian Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., 1989: 271-294Crossref Google Scholar, 4Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Hoekstra M.F. Nickoloff J.A. DNA Damage and Repair: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Cell Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar, 5Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acids Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., 1998Google Scholar). During (and immediately after) repair synthesis, the association of histones with DNA appears to be locally disrupted. In early studies, nucleosome rearrangement during NER was operationally defined as (a) a change in nuclease digestion kinetics of newly repaired DNA (or “nuclease sensitivity”) and (b) a change in association of newly repaired DNA with nucleosome core particles (15Smerdon M.J. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Smerdon M.J. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Smerdon M.J. Kastan M.B. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3732-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Newly repaired DNA is almost absent from isolated nucleosome cores immediately after repair synthesis but rapidly associates with core histones (t½ ≈ 20 min) in intact human cells. Over longer times (1–24 h), there is a slow change in these features, resulting in the randomization of repair patches in nucleosomes, thought to reflect nucleosome migration onto newly repaired DNA (18Nissen K.A. Lan S.Y. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8585-8588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, XPC fibroblasts differ quantitatively in these features, in that nascent repair patches are less sensitive to nuclease digestion than in normal cells and completely randomize in chromatin by 1 h after labeling (i.e. are not associated with a slow rearrangement phase) (Ref. 17Smerdon M.J. Kastan M.B. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3732-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; also see Ref. 5Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acids Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., 1998Google Scholar). This suggests that nucleosome rearrangement, following repair, occurs more rapidly in XPC cells and that the newly repaired nucleosomes are more mobile than at least some of those repaired in normal cells. The changes observed in both nuclease sensitivity and nucleosome core association appear to be due to the same event, since the time courses of these changes are virtually identical (15Smerdon M.J.

This phenomenon was referred to as “nucleosome rearrangement” to avoid implication of a mechanism for this process (15Smerdon M.J. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and an unfolding-refolding model was proposed to explain these changes (19Lieberman M.W. Smerdon M.J. Tlsty T.D. Oleson F.B. Emmelot P. Kriek E. Environmental Carcinogenesis. Elsevier/North-Holland and Biochemical Press, 1979: 345-363Google Scholar). Following this rapid rearrangement phase, newly repaired nucleosomes appear to have typical structures that contain histone H1 (20Smerdon M.J. Watkins J.F. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3879-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This rapid rearrangement phase occurs regardless of the time after UV damage that repair synthesis takes place (16Smerdon M.J. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prior to the rapid rearrangement phase, nascent repair patches do not yield a DNase I footprint (16Smerdon M.J. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that newly repaired DNA is not tightly bound to a surface of core histones immediately after repair synthesis. In addition, repair patch ligation precedes nucleosome formation in human cells (21Hunting D.J. Dresler S.L. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3219-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 244-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, completion of NER during the rapid phase of nucleosome rearrangement appears to progress from an unligated nonnucleosome structure to a ligated nonnucleosome structure and finally to a ligated nucleosome structure (3Smerdon M.J. Lambert M.W. Laval J. DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Biological Implications in Mammalian Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., 1989: 271-294Crossref Google Scholar, 4Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Hoekstra M.F.

Progress in Nucleic Acids Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., 1998Google Scholar). A number of studies implicate nucleosome disruption (or unfolding) during transcription (reviewed in Refs. 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar and 23Thoma F. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 175-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Allfrey and co-workers (e.g. see Ref. 24Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) employed organomercurial affinity chromatography as a means to bind “open” nucleosomes at exposed thiols of disrupted (or unfolded) H3 histones to capture actively transcribing chromatin. Nucleosomes from a number of different species, including slime mold, yeast, mice, and humans, were fractionated with this method, and in each case active genes were preferentially bound to the organomercurial affinity matrix. In addition, the thiol reactivity of nucleosomes containing the genes c-fos and c-myc correlated with the expression of these genes when assayed by nuclear run-off transcription (25Chen T.A. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, when genes are actively transcribed in cells, at least some of these sequences are preferentially associated with the thiol-reactive nucleosomes. This suggests that proteins at (or near) these genes have exposed sulfhydryl groups during transcription. Candidate proteins include H3 histones, which have one internal cysteine (at position 110) exposed in unfolded nucleosomes and other proteins with exposed thiols that are strongly bound to these genes (i.e. remain bound in 0.5 m salt). Perhaps the most direct evidence for the involvement of cysteine 110 of histone H3 in this assay comes from studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not naturally possess a cysteine residue in histone H3 (26Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chen-Cleland T.A. Smith M.M. Le S. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1118-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant yeast strain was constructed with a cysteine substitution for alanine at position 110, and this substitution yielded binding of transcriptionally active chromatin to the organomercurial matrix (27Chen-Cleland T.A. Smith M.M. Le S. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1118-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding did not occur in wild type strains. Furthermore, electron spectroscopic imaging implicates the existence of U-shaped structures in the nucleosomes collected from thiol-reactive chromatin but not in the unbound fraction of the organomercurial matrix (28Basset-Jones D.P. Mendez E. Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. Allfrey V.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, organomercurial chromatography has been used to fractionate labeled excision repair patches in human chromatin as an assay for nucleosome unfolding during NER. We have observed an enrichment of nascent repair patches associated with thiol-reactive nucleosomes of normal human cells, and this enrichment decreases in these cells as nucleosomes rearrange after the repair event. On the other hand, chromatin from XPC cells shows much less enrichment, suggesting that this transient change is more rapid in transcriptionally active chromatin and/or that this effect is due to NER occurring only in bulk (inactive) chromatin in normal human cells. Normal human diploid fibroblasts (strain AG1518) and human XPC fibroblasts (strain GMO2996) were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) gene construct, pZH-15, was a gift from Drs. C. A. Smith and P. Hanawalt (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). This construct contains a 788-bp insert of genomic DNA from −315 bp into intron 2 of the human DHFR gene. 14C- and3H-labeled thymidine was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). All restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Affi-Gel 501 organomercurial agarose was purchased from Bio-Rad, and agarose magnetic beads, activated byp-nitrophenyl chloroformate, were synthesized by Perceptive Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA). Cell culture conditions were as described by Smerdon et al. (17Smerdon M.J. Kastan M.B. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3732-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In all experiments, to ensure a minimum amount of background replication, the cells were grown to confluence and treated with 2 mm hydroxyurea 45 min prior to UV damage. To allow comparison of data between experiments and between samples within one experiment, the “double-label” procedure described in Smerdon et al. (17Smerdon M.J. Kastan M.B. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3732-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used. Cells were pulse-labeled with 20 nCi/ml [14C]dThd during the growth phase to yield uniformly 14C-labeled DNA. At growth arrest (or confluence), cells were induced to repair by exposure to 12 J/m2 UV light in the presence of 10 μCi/ml [3H]dThd in conditioned media (or 20 μCi/ml [3H]dThd for XPC cells), which was incorporated into the nascent repair patches during specified incubation times. Therefore, the 3H/14C ratio accurately measures the relative repair activity in each of the organomercurial fractions. In some experiments, following this pulse label, the 3H was chased with 50 μm unlabeled thymidine for varying times (see Ref. 17Smerdon M.J. Kastan M.B. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3732-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated as described (24Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Harvested cells were pelleted and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 8.6% sucrose, and 5.0 mm sodium butyrate (to inhibit histone deacetylation). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 8.6% sucrose, 5.0 mm sodium butyrate, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.25 mm1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane (EPNP), and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. Nuclei, at an approximate concentration of 1 × 107 nuclei/ml, were treated with a mix of three restriction enzymes (0.5 units/μl each of HaeIII, RsaI, andTaqI) for 1 h at 37 °C, with vigorous shaking to digest the chromatin. The nuclei digestion buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 3.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5.0 mm sodium butyrate, 0.25 mm PMSF, 0.25 mm EPNP. Chromatin fragments were released, with the addition of 50 mm EDTA, from the nuclei into the supernatant, which was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. at 4 °C. This soluble fraction will be referred to as the “S fraction.” Magnetic agarose beads were coupled to a phenylmercury group as described by Chen-Cleland et al. (29Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23409-23416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, some beads were made with benzoic acid replacing mercuric benzoate, resulting in beads containing just a benzene ring (and no HgCl). These beads were used in control experiments for nonspecific binding (see below). The soluble chromatin (or S fraction) collected after restriction digestion of nuclei for each sample was loaded onto organomercurial columns or mixed with organomercurial magnetic beads (as described in Refs. 24Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 29Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23409-23416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to selectively bind unfolded nucleosomes. The first column buffer, buffer 1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 2% sucrose, 5.0 mm EDTA, 5.0 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm EPNP), washed out the flow-through fraction and rinsed the column (or beads) of nonbinding material (Fig. 1). The collected fractions were called “peak 1.” The organomercurial matrix was then washed with buffer 2 (buffer 1 plus 0.5 m NaCl), which releases chromatin bound by ionic interactions alone (Fig. 1). Finally, the column (or beads) was washed with buffer 3 (buffer 1 plus 0.5m NaCl and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). The DTT reduces sulfide linkages, releasing the thiol-reactive chromatin from the matrix (Fig. 1). In the repair analysis, the three classes of nucleosomes separated by the chromatography (class 1, non-reactive; class 2, salt labile; and class 3, thiol-reactive) were stripped of protein by proteinase K digestion (500 μg/ml at 42 °C 1 h), and the level of 3H dpm and 14C dpm was determined by scintillation counting of triplicate samples (Packard 1900CA, Downer's Grove, IL). To clarify the presentation of data, TableI shows scintillation counts (dpm) for a typical experiment. The ratio of 3H dpm (repaired DNA) to 14C dpm (total DNA) gives the relative amount of repair synthesis (per unit of DNA) for a given experiment. Since the levels (specific radioactivity) of3H and 14C incorporated vary for each experiment, we normalized the ratio for the thiol-bound fraction (fraction 3) to the ratio for the flow-through fraction (fraction 1) in each experiment (Table I). Also, the average3H/14C ratio in unirradiated cells was 4 ± 2.7% (mean ± 1 S.D.) that of the irradiated cells in each case.Table IData from repair-labeled chromatin fractionated by organomercurial chromatographyChase timeFraction3H14C3H/14CFraction 3/Fraction 1hdpm0S818220464.00126,32712,2202.15228649223.11319,17046474.131.9224S19,82061273.231128,76540,6783.17216,74051523.25326909392.860.91Data shown are from a typical experiment to explain our calculations. Confluent human fibroblasts were uniformly labeled in DNA during growth with [14C]dThd, labeled for 30 min in NER patches with [3H]dThd after 12 J/m2 UV irradiation, and exposed to chase periods of 0 or 24 h, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Soluble chromatin (S) was applied to an organomercurial-agarose column and fractionated as described in the legend to Fig. 1, and the amount of DNA in each fraction was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. A portion of each fraction, which was increased for fractions 2 and 3, was analyzed by scintillation counting. A ratio of 3H/14C represents the amount of repair synthesis per unit of DNA. To compare results from different experiments, the thiol-bound fraction (3Smerdon M.J. Lambert M.W. Laval J. DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Biological Implications in Mammalian Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., 1989: 271-294Crossref Google Scholar) was normalized to the flow-through fraction (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.

Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar) for Figs. 6 and 7 (i.e. values of 1.92 and 0.91 for the data shown). Normal human fibroblasts were prelabeled during the growth phase with [14C]dThd to provide a “bulk” DNA label for repair experiments and allow normalization of repair synthesis levels in each fraction from the organomercurial column (i.e. repaired DNA/total DNA in a particular fraction). A typical profile of the complete fractionation on the mercury affinity agarose column is shown in Fig. 2. Nuclei were prepared and digested with a mixture of three restriction endonucleases (TaqI, HaeIII, andRsaI), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The released (soluble) chromatin, or S fraction, represents 18 ± 5% of the total DNA content, as measured by scintillation counting of the14C content in the pellet and supernatant (data not shown). This value is similar to that obtained by Allfrey and co-workers for human HeLa cells (29Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23409-23416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, only a minor fraction of the total chromatin in cells is released by this procedure. This number (∼18%) is higher than estimated percentages of actual transcriptionally active genes in mature mammalian cells (30Lewin B. Genes VI. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 650-661Google Scholar); therefore, the S fraction must contain a large fraction of inactive (yet open) chromatin regions accessible to restriction endonucleases. The soluble fraction of the digested chromatin (∼18 ± 5% of total) was loaded onto the organomercurial column, which was equilibrated with column buffer 1, and the unbound chromatin was collected as peak 1 (Fig. 2, fractions 5–10). The second wash contained 0.5 m NaCl and was used to release chromatin fragments bound solely by ionic interactions (Fig. 2, fractions 35–39). This peak was collected and is referred to as fraction 2. The column was then washed with a buffer containing 10 mm DTT to release thiol-reactive chromatin, and this peak collected as fraction 3 (Fig. 2, fractions 55–65; inset). Based on 14C dpm values from 10 different experiments, 94 ± 0.3% of the soluble chromatin was recovered in fraction 1, and 3.8 ± 1.2% was collected in fraction 2. The thiol-reactive chromatin released in fraction 3 represents only 1.8 ± 0.4% of the soluble chromatin, or about 0.4% of total chromatin (see below). In the transcription studies on human 3T3 cells, Allfrey and co-workers (24Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23409-23416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that ∼10% of the soluble chromatin was recovered in fraction 2 and ∼7% in fraction 3. These differences from our results may reflect differences in solubility of the fragment sizes produced. These authors used different restriction enzymes (6-bp cutters) than our combination of 4-bp cutters and employed a different method for DNA quantitation (Hoescht dye) than we used (14C labeling). However, only a small percentage (<5%) of the human genome is expected to be actively transcribing (and completely disrupted) at any given time in mature human fibroblasts (30Lewin B. Genes VI. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 650-661Google Scholar); therefore, only a small portion of the soluble fraction should be involved in repair. To test whether the mercury affinity matrix may occlude or bind chromatin fragments nonspecifically, magnetic beads were generated containing only the phenyl group, and lacking HgCl (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 14C-labeled chromatin was then fractionated with these beads as for the repair experiments. Fraction 1, representing the nucleosomes that did not bind to the column, contained ∼97% of the total soluble chromatin (14C-labeled DNA), while the wash with buffer 2 (0.5m NaCl) released ∼3% of the chromatin. Only 0.05% of the 14C-labeled chromatin was detected in fraction 3 (10 mm DTT wash), or <3% of the thiol-bound chromatin when the HgCl group is present. Thus, whereas the column matrix itself interacts ionically with a small fraction of the chromatin fragments, there is little chromatin retained in the presence of 0.5 mNaCl. The fraction of chromatin fragments expected to contain repair patches can be estimated as follows. About 18% of the total genome is liberated from the nucleus by the restriction enzyme digest (see above), and about 2% of these fragments are captured by the organomercurial matrix and released as fraction 3. Therefore, about 0.4% (2% × 0.18) of the total chromatin is eluted in fraction 3. 2Clearly, the insoluble (or pellet) fraction, representing ∼80% of total chromatin, may also contain thiol-reactive proteins at (or near) nascent repair sites, and it is expected that this value of 0.4% is less than the actual fraction of thiol-reactive fragments in total chromatin. There is an average of one cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer per 6–8 kilobase pairs at 12 J/m2 in these cells (31Gale J.M. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 949-958Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Ramanathan B. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol.

Although the three-dimensional structure of human FLT3L is unknown, sequence comparisons with other members of the four-helix bundle protein family whose three-dimensional structures are known, imply that it is a member of the left-handed short chain antiparallel four-helix bundle cytokine structural subfamily (1Hannum C.

The three-dimensional structure of five members of the short chain helical cytokines have been solved, including interleukin-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2, M-CSF, and interleukin-5 (9Rozwarski D.A.

Structural features common to these proteins include an up-up-down-down antiparallel topology for helices A–D and two short strands of β-sheet contained in the long cross-over segments between helices A-B and C-D. The unique up-up-down-down topology for helices A–D, similar genetic organization of exons and introns, distant relatedness observed between some members, and similar biological function indicate that helical bundle cytokines arose from divergent evolution of a common ancestral protein. It is widely believed that helical cytokines initiate signal transduction by ligand-induced receptor oligomerization (10Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar).The current methods for site-directed mutagenesis are powerful tools for the study of structure and function of proteins and are highly efficient and effective when some idea of where to make the specific mutation is available. However, in the case of FLT3L, the protein region of interest is not well defined, so it is difficult to predict which mutation to make in order to bring about a desired change. The cross-reactivity of murine and human FLT3L for FLT3R (7Lyman S.D. James L. Johnson L. Brasel K. de Vries P. Escobar S.S. Downey H. Splett R.R. Beckmann M.P. McKenna H.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 2795-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) precludes the potential to identify residues of interest by swapping interspecies segments of polypeptide between these ligands. Comprehensive mutational studies of other four-helix bundle proteins may not be applicable to FLT3L because a number of these species are monomeric and bind class I hematopoietic receptors, whereas FLT3L is dimeric and binds to and activates a class III tyrosine kinase receptor. Therefore, the method employed in this study of FLT3L structure-function relationship is random mutagenesis of the DNA encoding FLT3L coupled with an activity-screening system.DISCUSSIONWe have generated a map of the FLT3L binding surface for its receptor using random mutagenesis and a functional screen. The data in Table III indicate that there is minimal gross structural perturbation, with the exception of W118R, in our collection of purified FLT3L muteins. These data suggest that most of the residues concerned may be directly involved in the energetics of receptor binding. Interpretation of the mutation pattern observed in this study (Fig. 3) is greatly facilitated by the three-dimensional homology model of FLT3L (Fig. 5).The solved crystal structure of M-CSF was chosen as a template for modeling FLT3L, since several properties of M-CSF are most similar to FLT3L. M-CSF, and by analogy FLT3L and SCF, belong to the short chain helical bundle structural subfamily. Other members of this family share little identity, yet have remarkable structural similarity (9Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karplus P.A. Curr.

Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) are dimeric, but unlike M-CSF, FLT3L, and SCF they are non-disulfide-linked dimers. The M-CSF dimerization interface was used to model the dimerization interface of FLT3L.In addition to the sequence similarity between FLT3L and M-CSF, the FLT3L receptor-ligand system appears most similar to the M-CSF and SCF receptor-ligand systems. The receptors for FLT3L, SCF, and M-CSF are all type III tyrosine kinase receptors and share considerable sequence identity. The binding stoichiometry for polypeptide chains of SCF ligand with subunits of Kit receptor is 2:2 (24Lemmon M.A. Pinchasi D. Zhou M. Lax I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6311-6317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Koths and colleagues (25Taylor E.W. Fear A.L. Bohm A. Kim S.-H. Koths K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31171-31177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assert that M-CSF binds only one receptor chain per ligand polypeptide. These observations suggest that for SCF and M-CSF, and by analogy FLT3L, there is only one receptor binding site per ligand subunit and an overall 2:2 stoichiometry in the ligand-receptor complex.The mutagenesis data and the three-dimensional model of FLT3L corroborate each other. The three hot spot regions (positions 8–15, 81–87, and 116–124), widely separated in the primary structure, cluster together in a small surface patch of the tertiary structure. The clustering of mutations in a small surface patch is consistent with a single receptor binding site per monomer as suggested by studies of similar receptor-ligand systems. In addition, the model indicates that some mutations map to the proposed dimer interface. Mutations that disrupt the dimerization interface would be predicted to shift the equilibrium from dimeric to monomeric FLT3L. The L27P mutation maps to this proposed dimerization interface and reduces the biological activity of the mutant protein. As predicted, the L27P mutant protein exhibits a concentration-dependent change in the apparent molecular weight consistent with an alteration in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 6). In addition to L27P, we also identified another mutation that maps to the dimer interface, A64T. The A64T mutant protein was not purified or analyzed for its size exclusion properties. However, in the protein sequence alignment proposed by Hannum et al. (1Hannum C. Culpepper J. Campbell D. McClanahan T. Zurawski S. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R. Hudak S. Wagner J. Mattson J. Luh J. Duda G. Martina N. Peterson D. Menon S. Shanafelt A. Muench M. Kelner G. Namikawa R. Rennick D. Roncarolo M.-G. Zlotnik A. Rosnet O. Dubreuil P. Birnbaum D. Lee F. Nature. 1994; 368: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), position Ala64 in FLT3L correlates with Phe67 in SCF. A mutation at Phe67 in SCF altered monomer-dimer equilibrium toward monomer and reduced the biological activity of SCF (23Hsu Y.-R. Wu G.-M. Mendiaz E.A. Rashid S. Wypych J. Toso R. Mann M.B. Boone T.C. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6406-6415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The observation that the L27P mutation mapped to the dimerization interface and appeared to alter monomer-dimer equilibrium helped validate M-CSF as a template for modeling FLT3L structure.As noted above, mutations that map to three hot spots scattered throughout the primary sequence cluster together in a patch on the FLT3L three-dimensional model (Fig. 5). His8 maps to the center of this patch. We isolated two substitutions for histidine at position 8, H8R, which is FLT3L−, and H8Y, which is FLT3L++. This histidine is conserved in murine FLT3L and M-CSF (Fig. 1). Koths and co-workers (25Taylor E.W. Fear A.L. Bohm A. Kim S.-H. Koths K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31171-31177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that the activity of M-CSF is reduced when the equivalent histidine, His9, is substituted by alanine. High resolution three-dimensional analysis of M-CSF mutant H9A/H15A shows no significant structural perturbations. These data suggest that His9 of M-CSF and His8of FLT3L are directly involved in the binding energetics with their respective receptors. Lys84 is another basic residue of particular interest. Removal of positively charged Lys84, the penultimate residue of the C terminus of helix C, in muteins K84E and K84T results in the FLT3L++ phenotype. The threonine substitution of K84T is conservative with the serines found in the equivalent site in M-CSF and murine FLT3L. This suggests that Lys84 acts to diminish activity in native FLT3L by destabilizing the interaction with FLT3 receptor.Inspection of Fig. 5 B reveals that K84E, Q122R, and H8Y form a triangle of residues that enhance binding of FLT3L to its receptor. Residues that map within this triangle include Asp3, Cys4, Ser5, and Gln7. We identified the mutation D3G by subcloning a double mutant, but this mutation had little influence on FLT3L biological activity (Table I). A previous study showed that the C4S mutation reduced biological activity 10-fold (26Escobar S. Brasel K. Anderberg R. Lyman S.D. Blood. 1995; 86: S74Google Scholar). Other residues that map within the triangle include Ser5 and Gln7, which are Tyr5 and Ser7 in murine FLT3L, respectively (Fig. 1). Since murine FLT3L stimulates the human receptor, these residues are not critical for receptor binding. These data suggest that residues that can be changed to increase receptor affinity may include residues that may not be part of a continuous patch; another explanation is that this section of the homology model is inaccurate. Consistent with the former interpretation is the observation that W118R and L−3H increase binding affinity for the FLT3 receptor and introduce an extra positive charge to the molecule. The W118R mutation disrupts some of the helical content of the molecule (Table III), and Leu−3 is a residue that is not normally found in the mammalian expressed molecule, so it is unlikely that either residue is part of receptor binding site. These results are consistent with a less direct effect of charge rather than alterations in an area of the molecule critical for receptor binding.Double mutein K84E/Q122R maintains the close correlation between receptor affinity and bioactivity that we observe for the individual FLT3L++ mutations (Table II). This correlation breaks down for quadruple FLT3L++ mutein,L−3H/H8Y/K84E/Q122R. Whereas receptor affinity for the quadruple mutant is over 8-fold greater than wild type, cell proliferation activity is only 3-fold greater (Table II). Two recent reports also indicate that the correlation between receptor affinity and bioactivity diminishes as high affinity mutations are combined. Multiply substituted muteins of interleukin-6 (27Toniatti C. Cabibbo A. Sporeno E. Salvati A.L. Cerretani M. Serafini S. Lahm A. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2726-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (28Saggio I. Gloaguen I. Poiana G. Laufer R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3045-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) exhibit high affinity for their respective receptors but do not evince the same high levels of bioactivity. Two explanations potentially account for the apparent limit to bioactivity. First, Toniatti et al. (27Toniatti C. Cabibbo A. Sporeno E. Salvati A.L. Cerretani M. Serafini S. Lahm A. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2726-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) propose that receptor clustering on the surface of cytokine-activated cells acts to increase local receptor concentration to levels above the Kd of the IL-6 muteins, thus limiting maximum bioactivity of the high affinity mutants. Second, Reddy et al. (29Reddy C.C. Niyogi S.K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrate that an epidermal growth factor mutein with reduced receptor affinity exhibits greater bioactivity than wild type ligand by diminishing two attenuation mechanisms, endocytic internalization and degradation of epidermal growth factor and receptor down-regulation. Therefore, the maximum bioactivity of high affinity FLT3L muteins is potentially reduced by a rapid rate of ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis.In summary, we have developed a novel method for screening a randomly mutagenized ligand in order to identify residues involved in receptor binding. This method should be applicable to ligand-receptor systems where appropriate receptor binding and biological assays are available. In addition, the ability to simply identify species with “improved” receptor affinity and bioactivity points toward a significant utility for this technology. The strength of this method is further enhanced when mutations can be correlated to a homology-modeled structure. The corroboration among primary, tertiary, and quaternary structural information provides a powerful indication that we have correctly mapped the functional epitopes of FLT3L.

Growth factors and hormones initiate and regulate cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism by binding to receptors on the cell membrane. The binding of ligands to their receptors results in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation. Through an intracellular molecule relay, signals are amplified and transmitted from receptors to downstream targets. Under physiological conditions, these signaling processes are accurately regulated through mechanisms such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, coordinate localization of enzymes/substrates, and assembly of signaling molecule complexes by scaffolding, anchoring, and adaptor proteins (1Parson T.

Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). On the other hand, microinjection of the SH2 domain of the protein in fibroblasts was found to inhibit insulin and IGF-1-mediated mitogenesis, suggesting that the endogenous protein may have a positive role in signaling (5O'Neill T.J.

More recently, Baserga and colleagues (15Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S.-Q. Baserga R. J. Biol.

The inhibitory effect of Grb10 has also been suggested from recent genomic imprinting studies. The gene coding for mouse Grb10 has been identified as a maternally expressed gene located on proximal chromosome 11 (16Miyoshi N. Kuroiwa Y. Kohda T. Shitara H. Yonekawa H. Kawabe T. Hasegawa H.

Genetic studies have shown that maternal duplication of chromosome 11 proximal to the translocation breakpoint cause prenatal growth retardation (17Cattanach B.M. Beechey C.V. Rasberry C. Jones J.

Maternal disomy of human chromosome 7 has been shown to cause Silver-Russell syndrome whose symptoms include pre- and postnatal growth retardation and other dysmorphologies (19Kotzot D. Schmitt S. Bernasconi F. Robinson W.P. Lurie I.W. Ilyina H. Mehes K. Hamel B.C. Otten B.J. Hergersberg M. Werder E. Schoenle E. Schinzek A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).To further understand the functional role of Grb10, we attempted to identify molecules that interacted with the protein using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we present evidence that hGrb10 undergoes tetramerization in cells. In addition, we have found that the interaction involves at least two functional domains: the IPS/SH2 domain and the PH domain. Furthermore, we have shown that the NH2-terminal sequence of hGrb10 inhibited the binding of the protein to the autophosphorylated IR, suggesting that the oligomerization may play a role in the regulation of insulin signaling. We present a model for the mechanism of the tetramerization and its potential role in receptor signal transduction.DISCUSSIONWe report here the oligomerization of an adaptor protein, hGrb10. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that an SH2 and PH domain-containing adaptor protein undergoes tetramerization in cells, and the oligomerization is mediated by at least two functional domains, the IPS/SH2 and the PH domain. These findings are quite interesting as oligomerization of adaptor proteins in cells may have important physiological relevance. One possible function for hGrb10 tetramerization may be to provide a reservoir of latent hGrb10 molecules and prevent the protein from nonspecific binding to cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. We have shown previously that the SH2 domain of hGrb10 binds the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the kinase domain of the IR (13Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, Dr. Gustafson and colleagues (20He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have found that the IPS region alone is also capable of interacting with the IR and IGF-1R in a kinase dependent manner. The finding that the IPS/SH2 domain is one of the determinants involved in the hGrb10 tetramerization suggests that the tetramerization may regulate the binding of the protein to the autophosphorylated IR. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that the NH2terminus of hGrb10 (hGrb10Δ(IPS/SH2)), which interacted with the IPS/SH2 domain of the protein (Fig. 3 B), competitively inhibited the binding of hGrb10 to the IR (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that the tetramerized hGrb10 may be unable to interact with phosphotyrosine-containing peptides because of the blockage of its IPS/SH2 domain by the NH2-terminal sequence. The stimulation of cells by insulin or other growth factors may induce a conformational change of hGrb10 so that the SH2 domain of the protein is accessible for binding to phosphotyrosine-containing receptors. Tetramerization may thus provide a mechanism to regulate the interaction between the adaptor protein and the receptor in cells.Another possible role of hGrb10 oligomerization in cells may be to serve as a docking complex to recruit multiple signaling molecules. As Grb10 monomer contains several functional domains such as an SH2 domain, a PH domain, and a proline-rich sequence, all of which are able to interact with other cellular proteins, oligomerization of Grb10 should enhance the binding capacity of the protein to these signaling molecules. Although we were unable to determine whether hGrb10 binds to the IR or IGF-1R as a monomer or oligomer because of technical difficulties, this hypothesis is quite interesting, especially with the findings that hGrb10 is capable of binding simultaneously to the IR and other signaling proteins in cells (5O'Neill T.J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, oligomerization of the adaptor protein may provide a novel mechanism to colocalize multiple signaling molecules to regulate cell signaling processes.In this study, we have also found that the PH domain is sufficient to interact with the full-length hGrb10 (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8, and Fig. 3 C). PH domains have been shown to be involved in both protein-lipids or protein-protein interactions (22Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Examples of the latter include β-adrenergic receptor kinase, IRS-1, and the Btk tyrosine kinase, whose PH domains bind to the βγ-subunits of trimeric G proteins (23Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the IR (24Myers M.G.J. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.-M.

Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), respectively. The finding that the PH domain is involved in hGrb10 dimerization in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system provides new evidence that PH domains are functional motifs and can function independently to mediate regulated protein-protein interactions in signaling. However, it should be pointed out that the IPS/SH2 domain of hGrb10 is sufficient to interact with the full-length protein and that Grb10α, the isoform which has a 46-amino acid deletion, including part of the PH domain, was still be able to undergo tetramerization in cells (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the PH domain may not be essential for hGrb10 tetramerization. One possible role for the involvement of the PH domain may be to provide additional specificity for the interaction. Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis.A simple model, which accounts for the role of hGrb10 tetramerization, is depicted in Fig. 5. In this model, hGrb10 tetramerization in cells involves two functional motifs: the IPS/SH2 domain and the PH domain, both interacting with the NH2-terminal region of its partner. The tetramerization may bury the functional domains of hGrb10 and prevent them from nonspecifically interacting with the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or other cellular signaling molecules. The balance between monomeric and oligomeric hGrb10 may thus provide a specificity for the adaptor to transduce or regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling processes. This balance may be regulated by mechanisms such as phosphorylation, which could result from stimulation by insulin or other growth factors (14Dong L.Q. Du H.-Y. Porter S. Kolakowski J., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J.B. Yee D. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The modification may cause a conformational change of the protein and lead to the access of the SH2 domain by the autophosphorylated receptor. The binding affinity of the SH2/phosphotyrosine containing sequence interaction may be much greater than that of the interaction between the SH2 domain and the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated hGrb10 NH2-terminal sequence so that the hGrb10-receptor complex is stabilized. The binding of hGrb10 to the IR may result in a further conformational change for hGrb10, which may allow other functional domains such as the PH in the protein to interact with downstream signaling molecules. It should be pointed out that the tetramerization may not be unique for Grb10 but may occur in other adaptor molecules as well. For example, the COOH-terminal region of Grb10 has recently been shown to bind to the full-length Grb7 in the yeast two-hybrid system. 2J. Cooper, personal communication. It would be interesting to see whether oligomerization is a general mechanism for other adaptor proteins in the regulation of cellular signaling processes. Growth factors and hormones initiate and regulate cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism by binding to receptors on the cell membrane. The binding of ligands to their receptors results in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation. Through an intracellular molecule relay, signals are amplified and transmitted from receptors to downstream targets. Under physiological conditions, these signaling processes are accurately regulated through mechanisms such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, coordinate localization of enzymes/substrates, and assembly of signaling molecule complexes by scaffolding, anchoring, and adaptor proteins (1Parson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Many of the adaptor proteins involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling contain specific function modules such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IPS, insert between the PH domain and the SH2 domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PH, pleckstrin homology; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IPS, insert between the PH domain and the SH2 domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PH, pleckstrin homology; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. domain and the PH domain.

Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). On the other hand, microinjection of the SH2 domain of the protein in fibroblasts was found to inhibit insulin and IGF-1-mediated mitogenesis, suggesting that the endogenous protein may have a positive role in signaling (5O'Neill T.J. Rose T.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recently, Baserga and colleagues (15Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S.-Q. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of mGrb10 in mouse embryo fibroblast cells inhibits IGF-1-mediated cell proliferation by causing a delay in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The inhibitory effect of Grb10 has also been suggested from recent genomic imprinting studies. The gene coding for mouse Grb10 has been identified as a maternally expressed gene located on proximal chromosome 11 (16Miyoshi N. Kuroiwa Y. Kohda T. Shitara H. Yonekawa H. Kawabe T. Hasegawa H. Barton S.C. Surani M.Z. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that maternal duplication of chromosome 11 proximal to the translocation breakpoint cause prenatal growth retardation (17Cattanach B.M. Beechey C.V. Rasberry C. Jones J. Papworth D. Genet. Res. 1996; 68: 35-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, Grb10 is located on chromosome 7p11.2–12 (14Dong L.Q. Du H.-Y. Porter S. Kolakowski J., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J.B. Yee D. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Jerome C.A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Gietz R.D. Triggs-Raine B. Genomics. 1997; 40: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Maternal disomy of human chromosome 7 has been shown to cause Silver-Russell syndrome whose symptoms include pre- and postnatal growth retardation and other dysmorphologies (19Kotzot D. Schmitt S. Bernasconi F. Robinson W.P. Lurie I.W. Ilyina H. Mehes K. Hamel B.C. Otten B.J. Hergersberg M. Werder E. Schoenle E. Schinzek A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To further understand the functional role of Grb10, we attempted to identify molecules that interacted with the protein using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we present evidence that hGrb10 undergoes tetramerization in cells. In addition, we have found that the interaction involves at least two functional domains: the IPS/SH2 domain and the PH domain. Furthermore, we have shown that the NH2-terminal sequence of hGrb10 inhibited the binding of the protein to the autophosphorylated IR, suggesting that the oligomerization may play a role in the regulation of insulin signaling. We present a model for the mechanism of the tetramerization and its potential role in receptor signal transduction. DISCUSSIONWe report here the oligomerization of an adaptor protein, hGrb10. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that an SH2 and PH domain-containing adaptor protein undergoes tetramerization in cells, and the oligomerization is mediated by at least two functional domains, the IPS/SH2 and the PH domain. These findings are quite interesting as oligomerization of adaptor proteins in cells may have important physiological relevance. One possible function for hGrb10 tetramerization may be to provide a reservoir of latent hGrb10 molecules and prevent the protein from nonspecific binding to cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. We have shown previously that the SH2 domain of hGrb10 binds the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the kinase domain of the IR (13Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, Dr. Gustafson and colleagues (20He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have found that the IPS region alone is also capable of interacting with the IR and IGF-1R in a kinase dependent manner. The finding that the IPS/SH2 domain is one of the determinants involved in the hGrb10 tetramerization suggests that the tetramerization may regulate the binding of the protein to the autophosphorylated IR. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that the NH2terminus of hGrb10 (hGrb10Δ(IPS/SH2)), which interacted with the IPS/SH2 domain of the protein (Fig. 3 B), competitively inhibited the binding of hGrb10 to the IR (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that the tetramerized hGrb10 may be unable to interact with phosphotyrosine-containing peptides because of the blockage of its IPS/SH2 domain by the NH2-terminal sequence. The stimulation of cells by insulin or other growth factors may induce a conformational change of hGrb10 so that the SH2 domain of the protein is accessible for binding to phosphotyrosine-containing receptors. Tetramerization may thus provide a mechanism to regulate the interaction between the adaptor protein and the receptor in cells.Another possible role of hGrb10 oligomerization in cells may be to serve as a docking complex to recruit multiple signaling molecules. As Grb10 monomer contains several functional domains such as an SH2 domain, a PH domain, and a proline-rich sequence, all of which are able to interact with other cellular proteins, oligomerization of Grb10 should enhance the binding capacity of the protein to these signaling molecules. Although we were unable to determine whether hGrb10 binds to the IR or IGF-1R as a monomer or oligomer because of technical difficulties, this hypothesis is quite interesting, especially with the findings that hGrb10 is capable of binding simultaneously to the IR and other signaling proteins in cells (5O'Neill T.J.

Therefore, oligomerization of the adaptor protein may provide a novel mechanism to colocalize multiple signaling molecules to regulate cell signaling processes.In this study, we have also found that the PH domain is sufficient to interact with the full-length hGrb10 (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8, and Fig. 3 C). PH domains have been shown to be involved in both protein-lipids or protein-protein interactions (22Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Examples of the latter include β-adrenergic receptor kinase, IRS-1, and the Btk tyrosine kinase, whose PH domains bind to the βγ-subunits of trimeric G proteins (23Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the IR (24Myers M.G.J. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.-M.

Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), respectively. The finding that the PH domain is involved in hGrb10 dimerization in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system provides new evidence that PH domains are functional motifs and can function independently to mediate regulated protein-protein interactions in signaling. However, it should be pointed out that the IPS/SH2 domain of hGrb10 is sufficient to interact with the full-length protein and that Grb10α, the isoform which has a 46-amino acid deletion, including part of the PH domain, was still be able to undergo tetramerization in cells (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the PH domain may not be essential for hGrb10 tetramerization. One possible role for the involvement of the PH domain may be to provide additional specificity for the interaction. Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis.A simple model, which accounts for the role of hGrb10 tetramerization, is depicted in Fig. 5. In this model, hGrb10 tetramerization in cells involves two functional motifs: the IPS/SH2 domain and the PH domain, both interacting with the NH2-terminal region of its partner. The tetramerization may bury the functional domains of hGrb10 and prevent them from nonspecifically interacting with the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or other cellular signaling molecules. The balance between monomeric and oligomeric hGrb10 may thus provide a specificity for the adaptor to transduce or regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling processes. This balance may be regulated by mechanisms such as phosphorylation, which could result from stimulation by insulin or other growth factors (14Dong L.Q. Du H.-Y. Porter S. Kolakowski J., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J.B. Yee D. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The modification may cause a conformational change of the protein and lead to the access of the SH2 domain by the autophosphorylated receptor. The binding affinity of the SH2/phosphotyrosine containing sequence interaction may be much greater than that of the interaction between the SH2 domain and the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated hGrb10 NH2-terminal sequence so that the hGrb10-receptor complex is stabilized. The binding of hGrb10 to the IR may result in a further conformational change for hGrb10, which may allow other functional domains such as the PH in the protein to interact with downstream signaling molecules. It should be pointed out that the tetramerization may not be unique for Grb10 but may occur in other adaptor molecules as well. For example, the COOH-terminal region of Grb10 has recently been shown to bind to the full-length Grb7 in the yeast two-hybrid system. 2J. Cooper, personal communication. It would be interesting to see whether oligomerization is a general mechanism for other adaptor proteins in the regulation of cellular signaling processes.

Many zinc cluster proteins have been shown to bind as homodimers to a pair of CGG triplets oriented either as direct (CGG NX CGG), inverted (CGG NXCCG), or everted repeats (CCG NX CGG), where N indicates nucleotides. Variation in the spacing between the CGG triplets also contributes to the diversity of sites recognized. For example, Leu3p binds to the everted sequence CCG N4 CGG with a strict requirement for a 4-base pair spacing. Here, we show that another member of the family, Uga3p, recognizes the same DNA motif as Leu3p. However, these transcription factors have distinct DNA targets. We demonstrate that additional specificity of binding is provided by nucleotides located between the two everted CGG triplets. Altering the 4 nucleotides between to the two everted CGG triplets switches the specificity from a Uga3p site to a Leu3p site in both in vitro and in vivo assays.

These experiments provide a model for discrimination between targets of zinc cluster proteins. In fungi, many transcriptional regulators are characterized by the presence of a zinc finger containing a cluster of 6 cysteines (consensus sequence: CX2CX6CX5–9CX2CX6–8C) that are bound by two zinc atoms and are referred to as zinc cluster proteins or Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster proteins. Over 50 have been characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 2Todd R.B. Andrianopoulos A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 388-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The Zn2Cys6 domain is usually followed by a short linker region that bridges the zinc finger to the dimerization domain consisting of a coiled-coil consisting of heptad repeats (1Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Zinc cluster proteins usually bind as homodimers to target DNA sequences. Gal4p, which is required for activation of genes related to galactose metabolism, recognizes an inverted repeat consisting of CGG triplets spaced by 11 base pairs (bp) 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; glutathione S-transferase; a.a., amino acid(s); UAS, upstream activating sequence(s).

Some other members of this family bind to similar sites with an alternate spacing. For instance, Put3p, which activates genes related to proline metabolism, recognizes a DNA sequence related to that of Gal4p but with a spacing of 10 bp (CGG N10 CCG), whereas the activator of genes of the pyrimidine pathway, Ppr1p, binds to the sequence CGG N6 CCG (4Roy A.

Biol. 1997; 4: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, zinc fingers of Gal4p, Ppr1p, and Put3p can be interchanged without altering the specificity of binding (14Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Science. 1993; 261: 909-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Other zinc cluster proteins also recognize CGG triplets but with a different orientation. For example, Hap1p, which activates genes required for cellular respiration, binds as a homodimer to a direct repeat consisting of two CGG triplets spaced by 6 bp (CGG N6 CGG) (15Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,16Ha N. Hellauer K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, two other zinc cluster proteins, Leu3p and Pdr3p, bind to CGG triplets oriented in opposite directions, an everted repeat (CCG NX CGG) (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Leu3p activates genes for the metabolism of branched amino acids and GDH1 which encodes NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in ammonium assimilation (18Friden P. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Hu Y. Cooper T.G. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Leu3p, which forms a homodimer in solution (20Remboutsika E. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5547-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), is constitutively bound to target sites (21Kirkpatrick C.R. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4021-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and its activity is positively regulated by α-isopropyl malate, an intermediate of leucine metabolism (22Sze J.Y. Woontner M. Jaehning J.A. Kohlhaw G.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Even though direct and inverted repeats consisting of CGG triplets are found in UASLEU3 (upstream activating sequence), we have shown, by mutational analysis, that Leu3p actually binds to an everted repeat containing two CGG triplets spaced by 4 bp (CCG N4 CGG). Alternatively, DNA targets of Leu3p could be considered to be an inverted repeat with the sequence CCG. However, a chimeric protein in which the zinc finger of Gal4p was replaced by the corresponding region of Leu3p was shown to recognize a Gal4p site (CGG N11 CCG) but not an inverted repeat with the sequence CCG N11 CGG (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results show that Leu3p does recognize the sequence CGG and strongly suggest that the two zinc fingers of Leu3p are oriented in opposite orientations to those of Gal4p (8Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Alteration of the spacing between the CGG triplets completely abolishes binding of Leu3p to a target site in vitro. Similarly, another member of this family, Pdr3p, a positive transcriptional regulator of multi-drug resistance genes (23Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen.

Yeast. 1992; 8: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), binds to an everted repeat with no intervening nucleotides (CCGCGG) (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, diversity of binding sites is generated, in part, by three different DNA motifs (direct, inverted, and everted repeats) as well as differences between the number of nucleotides between the CGG triplets. Other members of the family of zinc cluster proteins include Uga3p (also called Dur3p) and Dal81p (also called Uga35p or Durlp). Dal81p is a general positive regulator of genes involved in nitrogen utilization through catabolism of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), urea, arginine, and allatoin (27Vissers S. Andre B. Muyldermans F. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The role of another member of the family of zinc cluster proteins, Uga3p, is restricted to genes related to GABA metabolism (29Coornaert D. Vissers S. Andre B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Activity of Uga3p is dependent on the presence of GABA resulting in activation of the genes for GABA utilization as a nitrogen source such as the UGA1 and the UGA4 genes that encode GABA transaminase and GABA permease, respectively (28Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Coornaert D. Vissers S. Andre B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Deletion of either UGA3 or DAL81 impairs activation of UGA1 and UGA4 (27Vissers S. Andre B. Muyldermans F. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell.

Unexpectedly, deletion of DNA sequences encoding the zinc finger of Dal81p does not affect its function suggesting that Dal81p may not act by binding to specific DNA sequences. Target sites have been identified in the UGA1 and UGA4 genes (31Talibi D. Grenson M. André B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These UASs contain three (or four) CGG triplets that could be recognized by Uga3p (see Fig. 1). We have performed detailed mutagenesis of the UAS of UGA1. Our results show that Uga3p recognizes an everted CGG repeat spaced by 4 bp, a sequence similar to the target site of Leu3p. However, Leu3p does not recognize targets of Uga3p and vice versa. We show that additional specificity is provided by nucleotides located between the two CGG triplets. Yeast (S. cerevisiae) strain YPH499 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ2000 leu2-Δ1) was used as wild type. Disruption of the UGA3 was done by transforming YPH499 with linearized plasmid pUGA-HIS (see below) and selecting for histidine auxotrophy. Deletion of DNA sequences encoding the zinc finger of LEU3 was performed by the method of Baudinet al. (33Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The HIS3 gene was amplified by PCR using pHIS3 (see below) as template and the oligonucleotides primers 5′-GGAATAGAACTGGGATGAATGCTAGGAAAAGGAAATTCGCCTGCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCA-3′ and 5′-AAATTGATGATATTTTGTCGCAAATTCTTGAAACAGCTCAGCAGCGGATAACAATTTCAC-3′. Homologous recombination was verified by PCR or Southern blot analysis. A portion of theUGA3 gene that encodes its DNA-binding domain (a.a 1–124) was PCR-amplified with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGAATTATGGCGTGGAGAA-3′ (initiator codon in bold) and 5′-GGAATTCAGTAGTTGTACAGCT-3′ and yeast genomic DNA isolated from the strain YPH499 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR product was cut by BamHI and EcoRI, purified on a column (PCR purification kit, Promega), and subcloned into pRSET-A (Invitrogen) or pGEX-f (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes to give pUGA3-(1–124) and pGST-UGA3-(1–124), respectively. The HIS3 gene was amplified with the primers 5′-TTACTCTTGGCCTCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGTTCAGAATGACACG-3′, and the PCR product was subcloned into theEcoRV site of pZERO-2 (Invitrogen) to give pMHIS3. TheUGA3 disruption plasmid, pUGA-HIS, was constructed by subcloning the EagI fragment of pMHIS3 containing theHIS3 gene into the EagI site of pUGA3-(1–124). The resulting construct disrupts the UGA3 gene at nucleotide 244 relative to the ATG. Reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides in front of a derivative of SLFΔ178 containing a minimal CYC1 promoter driving lacZtranscription (34Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide 5′-TCGAAAAGCCGCGGGCGGGATTGTAC-3′ and its complementary sequence 5′-AATCCCGCCCGCGGCTTT-3′ were used to generate pUGA1-WT containing one copy of the UAS of UGA1(31Talibi D. Grenson M. André B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in front of a minimal CYC1 promoter. Similarly, oligonucleotide 5′-TCGATCGGCCGGAACCGGCTTTGTAC-3′ and its complementary sequence 5′-AAAGCCGGTTCCGGCCGA-3′ were used to give pLEU2-WT containing one copy of the UAS of LEU2 (18Friden P. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reporter ULU, containing sequences corresponding to the UAS of LEU2 flanked by sequences of the UAS of UGA1, was constructed using the oligonucleotide 5′-TCGAAAAGCCGGAACCGGGATTGTAC-3′ and its complementary sequence 5′-AATCCCGGTTCCGGCTTT-3′. Sequences of the mutants of the UASs ofUGA1 and LEU2 are given in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III. All reporters were sequenced to verify the correct construction of the UASs.Table IIn vivo activity of reporters containing one copy of the UAS of UGA1 or the UAS of LEU2 (or mutants), or no UAS, inserted in front of a minimal CYC1 promoterReporters used in the assay and description of the UASs are given in the first and second rows, respectively.

For more details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Strains were transformed with reporters and selected on plates lacking uracil. Colonies were grown overnight in YPD (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1990: 177-178Google Scholar). Cells were then diluted in SD (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1990: 177-178Google Scholar) supplemented with histidine, leucine, lysine, tryptophan, and adenine at 0.004% (w/v) and glucose (2% final concentration). Activity of Uga3p was induced by adding GABA to the medium (0.1% final concentration). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with permeabilized cells (36Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed at least twice in duplicates. The DNA-binding domain of Leu3p (a.a. 1–147) was expressed inE. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified as described (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase moiety was removed by cleavage with thrombin. The DNA-binding domain of Uga3p (a.a. 1–124) fused to a 6xHis tag was expressed as described (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that whole bacterial extracts were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). EMSAs were performed as described (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Competitor probes were generated by PCR using the primers 5′-AAGATGCGGCCAGCAAAACT-3′ and 5′-CAGAGCACATGCATGCCATA-3′ and the reporters as templates. The PCR products were then purified on a column (Qiagen). Labeled UAS ofLEU2 (0.15 pmol) was added to 4, 25, 100, and 200 × excess of cold competitors, and Leu3 (a.a. 1–147) was added last. After 30 min at room temperature, the mixture was loaded on a 4% acrylamide gel. The percentage of binding (with no competitor taken as 100%) was measured (PhosphorImager, Fuji) and plotted against the log of the concentration of the cold competitor. Relative affinities were determined by comparing the concentration of each competitor required to give 50% binding as compared with the wild type competitor. The UASs UASLEU3 and UASUGA3 have 6 identical nucleotides (Fig. 1, Ref. 31Talibi D. Grenson M. André B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We first set out to determine if Leu3p and Uga3p have different target specificities and, if so, to identify which nucleotides are responsible for the discrimination between a Leu3p and a Uga3p target. We inserted the UAS of LEU2 or the UAS ofUGA1 (or mutants) upstream of a minimal CYC1 promoter driving lacZ transcription. The reporters were transformed in a wild type strain or strains carrying disruption of genes encoding the transcriptional activators Uga3p or Leu3p, and their activity was assayed. As shown in Table I, activity of the UAS of UGA1 was induced 15-fold in a wild type strain grown in the presence of GABA and gave background levels in a uga3− strain. Deletion of the LEU3 gene had no effect on UGA1 activity indicating that Leu3p does not recognize the UAS of UGA1. As expected, activity of the UAS of LEU2 was reduced about 80 times in a strain carrying a deletion of the LEU3 gene, whereas the activity was reduced 3–4 times in a uga3− strain (Table I). If Uga3p was directly involved in the activation of LEU2, one would expect increased activity in the presence of GABA. However, the UAS ofLEU2 showed slightly decreased activity in the presence of GABA in a wild type strain suggesting that the reduced activity is due to indirect effect. These results show that even if the UASs ofUGA1 and LEU2 are related, they are activated by distinct zinc cluster proteins, Uga3p and Leu3p, respectively. If Uga3p recognizes CGG triplets, there are three triplets within the UAS of UGA1 that are potentially important for its activity (Fig. 1). To determine the importance of each of these CGG triplets, we mutated each one to CGA and assayed the activity of the resulting mutants. Mutating the first or the third CGG triplet of the UAS of UGA1reduced β-galactosidase activity 300- and 15-fold, respectively (Table I, mutants UGA1-A and UGA1-C). Similarly, mutations in both the first and third CGGs resulted in background activity (Table I, mutant UGA1-D). In contrast, a mutant bearing a nucleotide alteration in the second CGG triplet showed high activity that was dependent on Uga3p and GABA but not on Leu3p. Thus, CGG triplets numbers 1 and 3, which correspond to an everted repeat, appear to be essential for transcriptional activation by Uga3p. Additional evidence for the importance of an everted CGG motif was provided by other mutations targeting CGG triplets numbers 1 and 2. A mutation of CGG triplet number 1 to CAG (mutant UGA1-E) reduced activity over 25-fold, whereas a similar nucleotide alteration in the second CGG triplet (mutant UGA1-F) reduced activity to 25% relative to that of the wild type UAS of UGA1. Moreover, the activity of UGA1-F was dependent on Uga3p since it was induced by GABA and reduced about 15 times in a uga3− strain (Table I). These results indicate that the DNA motif recognized by Uga3p is similar to the UAS of LEU2, an everted repeat spaced by 4 nucleotides (CCG N4 CGG). We compared the activity in vivo of wild type or mutated UGA1 sequences with binding of the Uga3p DNA-binding domain to these sequences in vitro. With a probe corresponding to the UAS ofUGA1, a retarded complex was formed in the presence of an extract prepared from cells containing the expression vector for Uga3p (a.a. 1–124) (Fig. 2) but not the parental vector (data not shown). Nucleotide alteration in the first CGG triplet (UGA1-A), but not the second (UGA1-B), abolished binding of Uga3p, an observation consistent with the relative function of these sequences in reporter plasmids in vivo. Mutation in the third CGG triplet (UGA1-C) resulted in a weak complex of identical mobility to that formed on the wild type sequence and a complex of faster mobility which may correspond to a monomer as observed for another zinc cluster protein (37Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutations in both the first and the third CGG triplets (UGA1-D) completely abolished binding of Uga3p, an observation consistent with the background activity of the double mutant in vivo. Thus, the activity observed in vivo is correlated with in vitro binding of Uga3p. Our results suggested that nucleotides other than those present in the everted CGG motifs are responsible for discrimination between activation by Leu3p and Uga3p. To map these nucleotides, a reporter containing sequences encompassing the everted repeat of LEU2 flanked by sequences corresponding to the UAS of UGA1 was made (reporter ULU, TableII). The activity of that reporter was similar to the UAS of LEU2, high in a wild type strain even in the absence of GABA and reduced to background levels in a leu3− strain. These results suggest that key nucleotides for discrimination of a Leu3 and a Uga3p site are located between the two everted CGG triplets. The everted sequence at the UAS of LEU2 is CCGG, and the sequence is GCGG at the UAS of UGA1. We tested the importance of these nucleotides by introducing single or double nucleotide alteration(s) at the UAS of UGA1 to the corresponding nucleotides found at the UAS of LEU2. Single mutations greatly reduced activity of the reporter plasmid when assayed in a wild type strain in the presence or absence of GABA (reporters UGA1-G, UGA1-H, Table II). Similarly, the double mutant (reporter UGA1-I) was not responsive to the activators Leu3p or Uga3p. However, a reporter (3XUGA1-I) containing three copies of the UAS found in UGA1-I has the specificity of a Leu3p site. Its activity is not induced by GABA and shows greatly reduced activity in a leu3− strain. Thus, the results suggest that other nucleotides located between the two everted CGG triplets are important for activation by Uga3p or Leu3p. We next tested if the UAS of UGA1 with other nucleotides flanking the everted CGG triplets could be recognized by Uga3p or Leu3p. We constructed additional reporters containing the everted sequence TCGG or ACGG. Background activity was observed with a UAS containing the TCGG motif (reporter UGA1-J) or the ACGG motif (reporter UGA1-K, Table III). These results show that for activation by Leu3p or Uga3p there is a strict requirement for a C or a G, respectively. We determined the importance of the two central nucleotides of the UAS of UGA1. For the wild type UAS ofUGA1, the sequence GGCGG is on the top strand of the everted repeat and the sequence CGCGG is on the lower strand (nucleotide difference in bold). Therefore, we tested if the presence of a G or a C at that position is important for activation by Uga3p. We constructed two reporters containing the perfect everted repeats GGCGG or CGCGG. Strong activity was observed with either reporter (UGA1-L, UGA1-M, Table III), giving rise to 25-fold induction in the presence of GABA. The results show that the “optimal” target sequence for Uga3p consists of an everted repeat with the sequence (G/C)GCGG. The importance of the two central nucleotides of the UAS ofUGA1 and LEU2 was further assayed by substituting the AA sequence present in the middle of UAS of LEU2 by the sequence GG found in the UAS of UGA1 and vice versa. A double nucleotide alteration of the UAS of LEU2 (reporter LEU2-GG, Table III) had a 4-fold effect on activation by Leu3p. Similarly, mutating the two central nucleotides of the UAS ofUGA1 to AA (mutant UGA1-AA, Table III) resulted in a 12-fold decrease of β-galactosidase activity and was not increased significantly by addition of GABA. Thus, all the nucleotides located between the everted CGG triplets of the UAS of UGA1 appear to be important for discrimination between the Uga3p and Leu3p activators. We correlated the in vivo activity of reporters described above with their ability to bind in vitro with the purified DNA-binding domain of Leu3p (a.a. 1–147; hereafter referred to as Leu3p). We measured the relative affinities of the UASs ofLEU2 and UGA1 and mutants (TableIV). The affinity of UGA1 for Leu3p was weak (8%) compared with the affinity of the UAS of LEU2. The hybrid UAS consisting of the core sequence of LEU2flanked by sequences of the UAS of UGA1 had similar affinity for Leu3p. In addition, the mutant of the LEU2 UAS, in which the central nucleotides were changed to those of the UGA1 UAS, had a reduced affinity for Leu3p (50%) relative to that of the wild type LEU2 UAS in agreement with its slightly reduced activity in vivo (4-fold). Thus, the Leu3p affinity for the mutant UASs is correlated with their in vivo activity.Table IVRelative affinity of Leu3p to the UASs of LEU2 and UGA1 and mutant sitesSequences of the middle part of the UASs used as competitors are given in the left panel. Mutations are shown in bold. Relative affinities are given in the right panel. For more details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Sequences of the middle part of the UASs used as competitors are given in the left panel. Mutations are shown in bold. Relative affinities are given in the right panel. For more details, see “Experimental Procedures.” In this report, we show that Leu3p and Uga3p recognize highly related but distinct DNA sequences as follows: an everted CGG repeat spaced by 4 bp (CCG N4 CGG) and that nucleotides located between the CGG triplets are important for discrimination between a Uga3p and a Leu3p site. For example, any mutation targeting the two everted CGG triplets resulted in decreased activation by Uga3p (Table I), whereas mutating a third CGG triplet in the middle of the UAS had only minor effects in analogy to Leu3p (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results correlate with in vitro binding of the DNA-binding domain of Uga3p to the UAS ofUGA1 and mutants (Fig. 2). Comparison with the UAS ofUGA4 shows that only the two everted CGG triplets are conserved in both UGA1 and UGA4 (Fig. 1). Thus, Uga3p and Leu3p recognize a similar DNA motif, an everted sequence spaced by 4 bp (CCG N4 CGG). However, a target of Uga3p, the UAS ofUGA1, was shown not to be activated by Leu3p. Conversely, the UAS of LEU2 is not a target of Uga3p. We showed that nucleotides located between the two CGG triplets are responsible for discriminating between a Uga3p site and a Leu3p site. Changing either nucleotides that flank the two everted CGG triplets of the UAS of UGA1 to those found in the UAS of LEU2abolishes activation by Uga3p (Table II, reporters UGA1-G and UGA1-H). Double nucleotide alteration results in very weak activity for both activators. However, a reporter (3XUGA1-I) containing three copies of the double mutant is responsive to Leu3p but not Uga3p. Thus the nucleotides that flank the two everted CGG triplets of the UAS ofUGA1 are important but not sufficient for discrimination between Uga3p and Leu3p. In addition, a UAS containing the repeat TCGG or ACGG (reporters UGA1-J and UGA1-K, Table III) is almost inactive. Thus, there is a strict requirement for G or C nucleotides flanking the CGG motifs for activation by Uga3p and Leu3p, respectively. Other nucleotides in the middle of the UAS of UGA1 are important for activity since a double mutation (GG to AA) showed low transcriptional activity (reporter UGA1-AA). Thus, our results suggest that the site recognized by Uga3p is an everted repeat with the repeat sequence of (G/C)GCGG. The two nucleotides in the middle of the UAS ofLEU2 also play a role in modulating activity by Leu3p. For example, substitution of the two As found in the middle of the UAS ofLEU2 to G results in decreased activation (4-fold) by Leu3p and in vitro binding. This is in agreement with the fact that most nucleotides found in the middle of the six known targets of Leu3p are A/T-rich and that none of them have only Gs or Cs at these positions (Fig. 1). We have previously shown (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that single mutations (to A or T) outside the everted CGG triplets reduced in vivoactivation and in vitro binding of Leu3p (17Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Three other members of the family of zinc cluster proteins bind to inverted CGG triplets with a spacing of 11 bp (Gal4p, Lac9p) or 6 bp (Ppr1p). Mutations in the CGG triplets have drastic effects on in vitro binding by these proteins, whereas they can tolerate multiple changes of the nucleotides located between the CGG triplets (5Liang S.D. Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 38Vashee S. Xu H. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol.

This is consistent with crystallographic data of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and Ppr1p which showed that most of the contacts with DNA are made through interaction with the CGG triplets (8Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 11Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is likely that Leu3p makes additional contacts with nucleotides between the CGG triplets allowing discrimination between the UAS of LEU2 and the UAS of UGA1, although this was not detected by methylation interference analysis (18Friden P. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Remboutsika E. Kohlhaw G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5547-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Additional protein-DNA contacts would account for the strict DNA sequence requirement for Uga3p. In addition to Uga3p, Dal81p is also required for induction of the GABA-responsive genes. The exact role of Dal81p in activation ofUGA1 is not clear. Unexpectedly, deletion of the entire zinc finger of Dal81p had no effect on activation of UGA1 (28Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3406-3409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the DAL81 gene did not affect transcription of theUGA3 gene (31Talibi D. Grenson M. André B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Probably Dal81p does not contact DNA to form a heterodimeric complex as observed for the zinc cluster proteins Oaf1p and Oaf2p (41Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility is that Dal81p rather helps Uga3p to dimerize, resulting in increased affinity for target sites or provides an activation domain required for increased gene expression. Our results may serve as a model for discrimination between UASs by other classes of zinc cluster proteins which recognize a specific CGG motif with a given spacing. For example, three zinc cluster proteins (Put3p, Tea1p, and Cha4p) have been shown to recognize the same DNA motif, inverted CGG triplets spaced by 10 bp (7Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece R.J. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Gray W.M. Fassler J.S. Mol. Cell.

However, Tea1p does not activate Put3p sites (42Gray W.M. Fassler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some additional nucleotides may be responsible for the discrimination as we have observed in the present study for Leu3p and Uga3p. In conclusion, alternate DNA motifs (direct, inverted, and everted repeats) and variation in the spacing between the CGG triplets have previously been shown to generate a diversity of binding sites for the family of zinc cluster proteins. In addition, other zinc cluster proteins do not recognize a pair of CGG triplets (44Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 45Strauss J. Muropastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) extending the repertoire of target sites for the family of zinc cluster proteins. Our results show that additional specificity can be provided by nucleotides flanking the CGG triplets generating distinct binding patterns of zinc cluster proteins to DNA motifs of a given spacing. This provides another mechanism by which the number of specific targets recognized by members of the family of zinc cluster proteins is increased. We are grateful to Dr. G. Hendy, Dr. J. White, and K. Chu for critical reading of the manuscript; to K. Hellauer for technical assistance; and to members of the Laboratory of Molecular Endocrinology for very helpful discussions."

The Asp74 → Ala and Asp74 → Asn mutant enzymes exhibited 50,000- and 2,000-fold reductions, respectively, in kcatrelative to wild-type FBPase. The pH optimum for the catalytic activity of the Asp74 → Glu, Asp68 → Glu, Asn64 → Gln, and Asn64 → Ala mutant enzymes shifted from pH 7.0 (wild-type enzyme) to pH 8.5, whereas the Lys71 → Ala mutant and Lys71,72 → Met double mutant had optimum activity at pH 7.5. Mg2+cooperativity, Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and Ki for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were comparable for the mutant and wild-type enzymes.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, EC3.1.3.11; FBPase 1The abbreviations used are: FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Fru-1,6-P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fru-2,6-P2, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Fru-1,6-P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fru-2,6-P2, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.), a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to fructose 6-phosphate and Pi in the presence of divalent metal ions such as Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ (1Bencovic S.T. DeMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar,2Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the enzyme by Mg2+ exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 2 at neutral pH, but is hyperbolic at pH 9.6 (3Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). FBPase is inhibited synergistically by AMP (as an allosteric effector) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2; as a substrate analog) (5Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 act as strong activators for phosphofructokinase, a major regulatory enzyme in the opposing glycolytic pathway. In mammals, FBPase is a homotetramer with a subunitMr of 37,000 (8Marcus F. Edelstein I. Reardon I. Heinrikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7161-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each subunit of the tetramer (designated C1, C2, C3, and C4) has an allosteric AMP domain (residues 1–200) and a catalytic Fru-1,6-P2 domain (residues 201–335), with the AMP-binding site being ∼28 Å away from the substrate-binding site (9Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 212: 513-539Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 2404-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Structures of AMP complexes of the enzyme define the T-state, whereas structures in the presence substrate analogs and without AMP represent the R-state. The structural transition (R- to T-state) involves a 17° rotation of the C1-C2 dimer with respect to the C3-C4 dimer and a 1.9° rotation of the AMP domain relative to the Fru-1,6-P2 domain within each subunit (10Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The R- to T-state transition results in conformational changes at interfaces between subunits C1 and C2 and subunits C1 and C4 (as well as interfaces related to these by the symmetry of the tetramer). Metal-binding sites (up to three total) are at or near the active site at the interface between the two domains of the enzyme (12Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mg2+ and AMP are mutually exclusive in their binding to FBPase (14Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, AMP inhibition is nonlinear and noncompetitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 and nonlinear and competitive with respect to Mg2+. Yet crystallographic studies reveal similar metal coordination in the absence and presence AMP (either one Mg2+ ion or two Zn2+ or two Mn2+ ions), although small perturbations in the active site are attributed to the 1.9° rotation of the AMP relative to the Fru-1,6-P2 domain due to AMP binding (13Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the residues involved at subunit interfaces of porcine liver FBPase revealed significant changes in the kinetic mechanism of AMP inhibition and cooperativity (16Shyur L.-F.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, a detailed mechanism of catalysis and allosteric regulation based on changes in interacting residues has been elusive. Perhaps published structures of FBPase do not reveal all of the essential structural elements for catalysis and regulation. Mutation of Arg49, a residue that precedes a disordered loop (residues 54–71), causes dramatic changes in FBPase kinetics (17Shyur L.-F. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26295-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of mammalian FBPases reveals Gly58, Gly61, Asn64, Asp68, Asp74, Lys71, and Lys72 as conserved residues within this disordered loop. Furthermore, loop 54–71 is proteolytically sensitive in all known FBPases (20Marcus F. Harrsch P.B. Moberly L. Edelstein I. Latshaw S.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7029-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether loop 54–71 plays a major role in FBPase kinetics, mutant enzymes Asn64 → Gln, Asn64 → Ala, Asp68 → Glu, Lys71→ Ala, Lys71,72 → Met (double mutation), Asp74 → Ala, Asp74 → Asn, and Asp74 → Glu were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and evaluated by initial velocity kinetics. The above mutations have profound effects on both catalysis and regulation of FBPase. Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, NADP, AMP, ampicillin, tetracycline, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. DNA-modifying and restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were either from New England Biolabs Inc. or Promega. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase were supplied by Boehringer Mannheim. Tryptone, yeast extract, and agar were from Difco. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or the equivalent. E. coli strains BMH 71-18 mutS (thi, supE, Δ(lac-proAB), [mutS::Tn10] [F′proAB, lacIq ZΔM15]) and XL-1Blue (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR-17, supE44, thi-1, relA1, lac[F′ proAB, LacIq ZΔM15, Tn10(Tetr)] came fromCLONTECH and Stratagene, respectively. FBPase-deficient E. coli strain DF 657 (tonA22, ompF627(T2r), relA1, pit-10, spoT1, Δ(fbp)287) was from the Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. Mutations were accomplished by the introduction of specific base changes into a double-stranded DNA plasmid. Eight mutagenic primers (5′-TGGCTCCACGCAGGTGACAGG-3′, 5′-TGGCTCCACGGCCGTGACAGGT-3′, 5′-GTGACAGGTGAGCAAGTGAAG-3′, 5′-GTGATCAAGTGGCGAAGTTGGATG-3′, 5′-GTGATCAAGTGATGATGTTGGATGT-3′, 5′-GAAGTTGGCGGTCCTCTCCA3′, 5′-GAAGAAGTTGGAAGTCCTCTC-3′, and 5′-GAAGTTGGAGGTCCTCTCCAA-3′) were used to mutate Asn64 → Gln, Asn64 → Ala, Asp68→ Glu, Lys71 → Ala, Lys71,72 → Met, Asp74 → Ala, Asp74 → Asn, and Asp74 → Glu. A selective primer (5′-CAGCCTCGCGTCGCGAACGCCAG-3′) was used to change the uniqueXhoI site to the original NruI site on the pET-11a vector. The double-stranded FBPase expression plasmid (pET-FBP) and mutagenic and selective primers were denatured, annealed, and polymerized using the TransformerTM site-Directed mutagenesis kit (21Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed byXhoI/NruI digestion and by fluorescent dideoxy chain termination sequencing at the Nucleic Acid Facility at Iowa State University. The plasmids with mutations were transformed into E. coli strain DF 657. The plasmid DNA was isolated from the overnight culture, and sequence analysis was performed on the entire FBPase gene. The expression and purification of wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase were carried out as described previously (22Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.-C. Ling T. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with slight modification. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatant was subjected to heat treatment, 30–70% ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, and CM-Sepharose column chromatography. Wild-type and mutant FBPases eluted as a single peak from the CM-Sepharose column by a NaCl gradient from 20 to 400 mm in 10 mm malonate buffer, pH 6.0. Protein purity was evaluated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Specific activity during purification was determined by the phosphoglucoisomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled spectrometric assay at either pH 7.5 or 9.6 (1Bencovic S.T. DeMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar). All other kinetic experiments were done at either pH 7.5 or 8.5 and 25 °C using a coupled spectrofluorometric assay (15Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rate data were analyzed using a computer program written in MINITAB language with an α value of 2.0 (25Siano D.B. Zyskind J.W. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 319: 587-600Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cooperativity was evaluated using either the ENZFITTER program (26Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER : A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987: 13-75Google Scholar) or the MINITAB program. CD studies on the wild-type and mutant FBPases were carried out in a Jasco J710 CD spectrometer in a 1-mm cell at room temperature using a 0.2 mg/ml concentration of the enzyme. Spectra were collected from 200 to 260 nm in increments of 1.3 nm, and each spectrum was blank-corrected and smoothed using the software package provided with the instrument. Purification of mutant and wild-type enzymes followed previous protocols (22Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.-C. Ling T. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes exhibited elution patterns similar to wild-type FBPase, except for Lys71 → Ala and Lys71,72 → Met, which eluted from the CM-Sepharose column at 100 mm NaCl. On the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all enzymes exhibit identical mobilities (Mr ∼ 37, 500) with no evidence of proteolysis (27Ulm E.H. Pogell B.M. deMaine M.M. Libby C.B. Bencovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and purity greater than 95% (data not shown). Activity ratios (pH 7.5:9.6) for the wild-type, Lys71 → Ala, and double mutant Lys71,72 → Met enzymes confirmed the absence of proteolysis. The CD spectra of wild-type and mutant FBPases are essentially superimposable from 200 to 260 nm (data not shown), indicating the absence of global structural alteration changes caused by the mutations. Initial rate studies were done at saturating concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 or Mg2+ that do not cause substrate inhibition. Kinetic parameters are in Table I. Thekcat values for the Asp74 → Ala and Asp74 → Asn mutants decreased 50,000 and 2,000 times, respectively, whereas a shift in the pH of optimum activity from pH 7.5 to 8.5 was exhibited by the Asp74 → Glu mutant with only a 20-fold reduction in kcat . A similar alteration in the pH of optimum activity occurred with mutants Asn64 → Gln, Asn64 → Ala, and Asp68 → Glu. On the other hand, replacements Lys71 → Ala and Lys71,72 → Met did not alter the pH of optimum activity. In Table I, the kinetic parameters for the Asp74 → Glu, Asn64 → Gln, Asn64 → Ala, and wild-type FBPases were measured at pH 8.5, and for mutants Asp68 → Glu, Lys71 → Ala, and Lys71,72 → Met at pH 7.5. A slight change in Fru-1,6-P2 affinity was observed in all mutants relative to wild-type FBPase.Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphataseEnzymekcatKm, Fru-1,6-P2Ki, AMPaThe Ki was obtained from plots of 1/velocity versus 1/[Fru-1,6-P2] at 5 mm Mg2+.Ki, Fru-2,6-P2Ka, Mg2+Hill coefficient Mg2+ bThe Hill coefficient for AMP inhibition is 1.0.s−1μmμm2μmmm2Wild-type, pH 7.521 ± 2.22.8 ± 0.120.5 ± 50.24 ± 0.080.49 ± 0.011.94 ± 0.04Lys71,72 → Met, pH 7.534 ± 4.11.6 ± 0.23525 ± 2961.78 ± 0.050.29 ± 0.011.78 ± 0.05Lys71 → Ala, pH 7.516 ± 1.92.8 ± 0.2189 ± 250.29 ± 0.050.27 ± 0.012.2 ± 0.05Asp68 → Glu, pH 7.56.4 ± 0.81.31 ± 0.1727.2 ± 3.10.065 ± 0.017.19 ± 0.21.43 ± 0.04Wild-type, pH 8.59.1 ± 2.62.2 ± 0.0853.7 ± 6.40.24 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.032.2 ± 0.1Asp74 → Ala, pH 8.50.0004NDcND, not determined.NDNDNDNDAsp74 → Asn, pH 8.50.01 ± 0.002NDNDNDNDNDAsp74 → Glu, pH 8.51.2 ± 0.11.03 ± 0.15.25 ± 0.47bThe Hill coefficient for AMP inhibition is 1.0.0.13 ± 0.0417.7 ± 1.21.26 ± 0.06Asn64 → Ala, pH 8.57.1 ± 0.81.42 ± 0.0812.7 ± 0.1bThe Hill coefficient for AMP inhibition is 1.0.0.072 ± 0.015.45 ± 0.391.42 ± 0.07Asn64 → Gln, pH 8.55.4 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.114.1 ± 0.20.099 ± 0.016.61 ± 0.261.44 ± 0.04a The Ki was obtained from plots of 1/velocity versus 1/[Fru-1,6-P2] at 5 mm Mg2+.b The Hill coefficient for AMP inhibition is 1.0.c ND, not determined.

The Hill coefficient for Mg2+ and the Kafor Mg2+ of the wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase were determined here at a saturating Fru-1,6-P2 concentration (30 μm) at pH 7.5 or 8.5. Hill coefficients at pH 8.5 dropped from 2.2 for the wild-type enzyme to ∼1.4 for the Asp74 → Glu, Asn64 → Gln, and Asn64 → Ala mutants, and at pH 7.5 from 2.0 to 1.4 for the Asp68 → Glu mutant. Increases of 126-, 51-, 47-, and 39-fold in Ka values for Mg2+ were found for the Asp74 → Glu, Asp68 → Glu, Asn64 → Gln, and Asn64 → Ala mutants, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme. The Lys71→ Ala and Lys71,72 → Met mutant enzymes as well as wild-type FBPase showed sigmoidal kinetics for Mg2+ at pH 7.5. On the other hand, the affinity for Mg2+ at pH 7.5 increased 2-fold for the Lys71 → Ala and Lys71,72 → Met mutant enzymes relative to wild-type FBPase. Fru-2,6-P2 is a competitive inhibitor of Fru-1,6-P2 and competes with the substrate for the active site of FBPase (7Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis J. Claus T.H. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1982; 218: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Kivalues for Fru-2,6-P2 decreased by <4-fold for all mutant enzymes compared with the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, the Lys71,72 → Met mutant exhibited a 7-fold increase inKi for Fru-2,6-P2. AMP is an allosteric regulator of FBPase (30Taketa K. Pogell B.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but nonlinear and competitive relative to Mg2+ for wild-type FBPase at either neutral or alkaline pH (15Liu F. Fromm H.J.

The wild-type and Lys71 → Ala, Lys71,72 → Met, Asp68 → Glu, and Asn64 → Gln FBPases exhibited competitive inhibition patterns for AMP relative to Mg2+, whereas the Asp74 → Glu and Asn64 → Ala mutants showed noncompetitive inhibition. Fig. 1 shows double-reciprocal plots of 1/velocity versus 1/[Mg2+]2 at various fixed concentrations of AMP for the Lys71,72 → Met mutant of FBPase. The data of Fig. 1 are consistent with a steady-state random mechanism represented by Equation 1, 1v=1VM1+KaA21+IKi+InKii+IKiii+InKivEquation 1 +KbB+KiaA2KbB1+IKI+InKiiwhere v, Vm , A, B, I, Ka , Kb , Kia , Ki , Kii , Kiii , andKiv represent initial velocity; maximal velocity; the concentrations of Mg2+, Fru-1,6-P2, and AMP; the Michaelis constants for Mg2+ and Fru-1,6-P2; the dissociation constant for Mg2+; and the dissociation constants for AMP from the enzyme·AMP, enzyme·AMP·AMP, enzyme·Fru-1,6-P2·AMP, and enzyme·Fru-1,6-P2·AMP·AMP complexes, respectively. n represents the Hill coefficient for AMP. When n = 2, the binding of AMP to FBPase is cooperative; on the other hand, there is no cooperativity whenn = 1. In the case of the wild-type, Lys71→ Ala, Asp68 → Glu, and Asn64 → Gln FBPases, the kinetic data (similar to those shown in Fig. 1) fit best to Equation 1 when n = 2. The “goodness of fit” was 4% when n = 2 as opposed to 11% whenn = 1. Fig. 2 illustrates double-reciprocal plots of 1/velocity versus1/[Mg2+]2 at various fixed concentrations of AMP for the Asp74 → Glu mutant of FBPase. The family of lines intersect to the left of the 1/velocity axis in Fig. 2. A similar result was found with the Asn64 → Ala mutant (data not shown). The data for both mutants are indicative of noncompetitive inhibition by AMP relative to Mg2+ and are consistent with Equation 2, 1v=1VM1+InKii+KaA21+InKiEquation 2 where v, VM , A, I, Ka,Ki, and Kii are defined as above, and n represents the Hill coefficient for AMP. The data for Asp74 → Glu and Asn64 → Ala all fit best to Equation 2 when n = 1. The goodness of fit is 5 and 6% when n = 1 for Asp74 → Glu and Asn64 → Ala, respectively, and >18% whenn = 2. The double-reciprocal plots of 1/velocity versus1/[Fru-1,6-P2] at various fixed concentrations of AMP for the wild-type, Lys71 → Ala, Lys71,72 → Met, and Asp68 → Glu enzymes gave a family of lines intersecting to the left of the 1/velocity axis (data not shown). Consequently, the mechanism of AMP inhibition for the Lys71→ Ala, Lys71,72 → Met, Asp68 → Glu, and wild-type FBPases is noncompetitive. The Ki values for the Lys71,72 → Met and Lys71 → Ala mutants increased 175- and 10-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme, respectively. AMP inhibition relative to Fru-1,6-P2 for Asp74 → Glu, Asn64 → Gln, and Asn64 → Ala gave a family of parallel lines (Fig. 3), indicating uncompetitive inhibition. Equation 3 with n = 1 best accounts for the data, 1v=1VM1+InKi+KaAEquation 3 where v, VM , A, I, n, Ka, and Ki represent initial velocity, maximal velocity, the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2, the concentration of AMP, the Hill coefficient, the Michaelis constants for Fru-1,6-P2, and the dissociation constant for AMP from the enzyme·AMP complex, respectively. The goodness of fit was <6%. Thus, cooperativity for AMP inhibition is lost in addition to the change of the kinetic mechanism. Amino acid sequences of all known mammalian FBPases are well conserved, particularly in segment 52–72, where 10 amino acids are highly conserved, suggesting an important functional or structural role.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), however, little or no electron density is present for residues 52–72, which is indicative of conformational disorder or proteolytic damage. The latter possibility is unlikely as microsequencing detected no proteolysis (10Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Reduced kcat values for the Asp74 → Ala, Asp74 →Asn, and Asp74 → Glu FBPases by 50,000-, 2,000-, and 20-fold, respectively, along with the shift in the pH of optimum activity from neutral to alkaline for the latter mutant, demonstrate the importance of position 74 in catalysis. Given the sensitive nature of position 74, conformational changes in the adjacent segment 52–72 could leverage significant alterations in the catalytic properties of FBPase. Mutations Asn64 → Ala, Asn64 → Gln, and Asp68 → Glu, for instance, change the pH of optimum activity from neutral to alkaline and decreasekcat values from 3- to 4-fold relative to that of the wild-type enzyme, and the double mutation Lys71,72→ Met elevates the Ki for AMP nearly 175-fold. The activity profiles of the Asp74 → Glu, Asn64→ Ala, Asn64 → Gln, and Asp68 → Glu mutants are very similar to those obtained with the proteolyzed enzyme in which residues 1–64 and 1–25 are missing (32MacGregor J.S.

The analysis above is strengthened by the crystal structure 2J.-Y. Choe, H. J. Fromm, and R. B. Honzatko, manuscript in preparation. (2.3-Å resolution, R-factor = 0.165, R-free = 0.24) of recombinant wild-type porcine liver FBPase with the products Fru-6-P, Pi, and Zn2+, which reveals strong electron density for loop 52–72 and a significant network of hydrogen bonds involving Asp68, Asn64, and other residues of the active site. In the proposed catalytic mechanism of hydrolysis of Fru-1,6-P2 (12Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a water molecule, bound to a metal cation, is activated for a nucleophilic attack of the 1-phosphate. The side chains of Asp74 and Glu98, relative to the attacking water and to the metal ion at the “catalytic” site (called metal site 2 in crystal structures of FBPase) (Fig. 4), are in position to act as general base catalysts. The distance between OD2 of Asp74 and OE2 of Glu98 and the cation at site 2 is ∼3.3 Å, but neither side chain is in the inner coordination sphere of that cation. Replacement of Glu98 by glutamine resulted in a 1,600-fold reduction in kcatrelative to wild-type FBPase (35Kelley N. Giroux E.L. Lu G. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Asp74 → Asn mutation caused a decrease in catalytic rate of the same order of magnitude, whereas the Asp74 → Ala mutation resulted in almost the total loss of catalytic activity. Thus, Asp74and Glu98 may act in concert to remove a proton from the attacking water molecule. Asn64 and Asp68 are also in the active site (Fig. 5), with the former hydrogen bonding with Glu97 and Glu98 and the latter with Arg276. Evidently, Asn64 maintains Glu97 and Glu98 in proper orientations for metal binding and the activation of the attacking water molecule. The above is consistent with the reduction in the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ and the 50-fold decrease in affinity for Mg2+, exhibited by the Asn64 → Ala and Asn64 → Gln mutants relative to wild-type FBPase. Mutation of Arg276 to methionine reduces activity by 2,000-fold, abolishes Mg2+ cooperativity, and alters the kinetic mechanism of FBPase (36Zhang R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8190-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Evidently, the Asp68–Arg276 hydrogen bond is a determinant for many of the kinetic properties of FBPase; its loss could destabilize loop 52–72 and impair the catalytic function of Asp74. AMP induces a modest structural change in the helix (H2) immediately preceding loop 52–72, and in all AMP-bound complexes of FBPase, loop 52–72 is disordered (13Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The new crystal structure has an ordered loop in the absence of AMP. Hence, AMP could inhibit FBPase by the disruption of interactions between loop 52–72 and the active site. As Asn64 and Asp68 probably stabilize metal binding to the active site, the observed competition between AMP and Mg2+ in kinetics and NMR investigations may stem from the displacement of loop 52–72 from the active site due to the AMP-induced perturbation of helix H2. The 175- and 10-fold increases in Ki of AMP inhibition with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 for the Lys71,72 → Met and Lys71 → Ala enzymes, respectively, could originate from the destabilization of loop 52–72 in its disordered, AMP-induced conformation. AMP may be less effective in the displacement of loop 52–72 of the double mutant (in which positions 71 and 72 are methionine instead of lysine) because of the unfavorable thermodynamics of exposing two methionyl side chains to the solvent. Indeed, the double mutant apparently exhibits preference toward the active R-state, relative to the less active or inactive T-state. Its kcat /Kmincreases 3-fold, and its Ka for Mg2+decreases 2-fold, whereas its Ki for AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 increases 175- and 7-fold, respectively. In fact, the double mutant may represent the kinetic properties of FBPase locked into the R-state. Mutations that bring about a change in the kinetic mechanism of FBPase from competitive to noncompetitive (AMP inhibition relative to Mg2+) are possible in the context of a steady-state random mechanism (16Shyur L.-F. Aleshin A.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33301-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Shyur L.-F. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26295-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and now can be understood in terms of a conformational mechanism. To a first approximation, loop 52–72 is the instrument by which AMP exerts its allosteric effect on the active site. In the wild-type system with a fully functional loop, AMP and Mg2+ (presumably at site 2) are probably antagonists with respect to the conformation that they stabilize for loop 52–72. Hence, in wild-type FBPase, loop 52–72 strongly couples the AMP- and Mg2+-binding sites. In some mutants of loop 52–72, however, the strong coupling of the AMP and the cation site is diminished; AMP binds and perturbs the metal at site 2, thereby causing inhibition, but is no longer completely effective in displacing the cation from a catalytically productive association with the active site. A rational basis for an uncompetitive mechanism is more challenging, however. Four separate mutations (Asp74 → Glu, Asn64 → Ala, Asn64 → Gln, and Arg49→ Cys) change AMP inhibition with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 from noncompetitive to uncompetitive. The uncompetitive mechanism implies that AMP binds as an inhibitor only when Fru-1,6-P2 is productively bound at the active site. Hence, these mutations may stabilize a conformation of loop 52–72 that does not favor the binding of AMP (as an inhibitor), but permits the association of Fru-1,6-P2 with the active site. Productively bound Fru-1,6-P2 could then induce a conformational change in loop 52–72 that re-establishes the coupling between the AMP and the substrate-binding site. A more detailed explanation of the above phenomenon, however, must await crystallographic and ligand binding studies of mutant FBPases."

Recently we presented evidence that the serpin antichymotrypsin (ACT, I) reacts with the serine proteinase chymotrypsin (Chtr, E) to form an E*I* complex via a three-step mechanism, E + I ⇌ E ·I ⇌ EI′ ⇌ E*I* in which EI′, which retains the P1-P1′ linkage, is formed in a partly or largely rate-determining step, depending on temperature (O'Malley, K. H, Nair, S. A., Rubin, H., and Cooperman, B. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 5354–5359). Here we extend these studies through the introduction of a new assay for the formation of the postcomplex fragment, corresponding to ACT residues 359 (the P1′ residue) to 398 (the C terminus), coupled with rapid quench flow kinetic analysis. We show that the E·I encounter complex of wild type-rACT and Chtr forms both E*I* and postcomplex fragment with the same rate constant, so that both species arise fromEI′ conversion to E*I*. These results support our earlier conclusion that the P1-P1′ linkage is preserved inEI′ and imply that E*I* corresponds to a covalent adduct of E and I, either acyl enzyme or the tetrahedral intermediate formed by water attack on acyl enzyme. Furthermore, we show that the A347R (P12) variant of rACT, which is a substrate rather than an inhibitor of Chtr, has a rate constant for postcomplex fragment formation from the E·I complex very similar to that observed for WT-rACT, implying that EI′ is the common intermediate from which partitioning to inhibitor and substrate pathways occurs. These results are used to elaborate a proposed scheme for ACT interaction with Chtr that is considered in the light of relevant results from studies of other serpin-serine proteinase pairs.

Cleavage of I to form released I* occurs between residues 358 and 359 of ACT within the so-called “reactive center loop,” which in intact I extends out from the rest of the molecule, contains a segment of modified α-helix (10Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 250-257Google Scholar) and is the primary interaction site between the inhibitor and the target proteinase. Following standard nomenclature (11Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar), these residues are designated P1 and P1′. In released I* residues P1-P14 are inserted into β-sheet A, the dominant structural element in ACT, as strand 4A (s4A). The β-sheet C is also reinforced, with the result that the P1 and P1′ residues are separated by 70 Å (12Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recent fluorescence energy transfer studies suggest substantial, if not complete, s4A insertion within E*I* for the serpin:serine proteinase pairs α1-proteinase inhibitor:trypsin (13Stratikos E.

Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13489-13491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although full inhibition of Chtr requires only 1 eq of WT-ACT (i.e. the interaction is characterized by a stoichiometry of inhibition, SI, of 1), ACT inhibition of another target proteinase, chymase, has an SI of 4 at pH 8 (18Schechter N.M.

In the extreme, some variants, such as A347R (P12) and T345R (P14), in which small, neutral side chains within the “hinge” region of rACT are replaced by the charged, bulky arginine side chain, show no inhibition of Chtr (SIs > 100) and no E*I* formation, but are cleaved by Chtr in the reactive center loop with complete (A347R) or almost complete (T345R) insertion of s4A (19Zhong J.Q.

First, what is the sequence of events leading to E*I* formation? Second, where within the sequence does partitioning occur? E+I⇌k−1k1E·I⇌k−2k2EI′⇌k−3k3↓k4E+ISE*I*SCHEME 1 Recently we presented evidence for a minimal scheme (SchemeFS1) for the interaction of rACT and Chtr leading to the formation of E*I* (23O'Malley K.H Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The main features of this scheme were that: (a) there was at least one intermediate between the encounter complex, E·I, andE*I*; (b) conversion of E·I toEI′ involved at least partial reactive center loop insertion into β-sheet A of rACT, as shown by a blue-shifted increase in fluorescence intensity when a fluorescent derivative of rACT (at position P7 within the reactive center loop) was reacted with Chtr; (c) the P1-P1′ linkage was preserved in EI′, as inferred from the fact intact inhibitor was released on rapid acid denaturation of EI′; and (d)k3 ≫ k2 at 25 °C, but is similar in magnitude at 40 °C. We also speculated thatEI′, rather than E·I, was the common intermediate from which partitioning between the inhibitor and substrate pathways occurred. Here we extend these studies by introducing a new assay for quantitatively measuring the appearance of the so-called postcomplex fragment (16Wilczynska M. Fa M. Ohlsson P-I. Ny T. J. Biol.

The chromophoric proteinase substrate SucAAPF-pNA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Standard proteins for SDS-PAGE gel calibration were from Bio-Rad. HPLC-grade acetonitrile was from Fisher, and HPLC-grade trifluoroacetic acid was from Pierce (sequanal grade). Rapid quenched flow kinetic studies were carried out using a KinTek Chemical-Quench flow model RQF-3 machine as described earlier (23O'Malley K.H Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Quenching was achieved with 0.1m HCl. In preparing samples for HPLC analysis and quantification of rACT C-terminal peptide formation, the quenched rACT:Chtr sample (85 μl) was treated with 12 m urea (118 μl) and 300 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Following centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge (no. 5414) for 2 min, 200 μl of supernatant was injected into a Perkin-Elmer Series 4 system, equipped with an LC-95 (Perkin-Elmer, 4.5 μl flow cell) variable wavelength detector, using a Rainin C-18 column (Microsorb-MVTM, 50 × 4.6 mm, 300 Å, 5 μm, 0.7 ml/min). HPLC data were analyzed using Turbochrom Navigator software from Perkin-Elmer. A215values were used to quantitatively estimate the eluted peptide (25Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Quenched rACT:Chtr samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, and stained protein bands were quantified, as described earlier (23O'Malley K.H Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was performed on a VG Tofspec linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Danver, MA) at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory in the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania. Treatment of rACT with Chtr leads to postcomplex fragment formation. Following denaturation of the sample with dilute HCl and concentrated urea, to ensure dissociation of the postcomplex fragment from the remainder of the rACT molecule, the peptide was purified from other components of the reaction mixture by RP-HPLC, as shown in Fig. 1 A. Its retention time was close to the value predicted for amino acids 359–398 based on the use of Rekker's constants for the constituent amino acids (26Sasagawa T. Okuyama T. Teller D.C. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 240: 329-340Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Proof that the indicated postcomplex fragment peak contains the C-terminal peptide was provided by MALDI-MS analysis, which gave a mass of 4624 (for Ala2Arg3Asn3AspGln2GluIle4Leu2Lys2Met2Phe4Pro3Ser2Thr5Val4, the theoretical M + H+ is 4623.5). In simple preparative experiments, the yield of recovered postcomplex fragment, calculated from HPLC peak area as described previously (25Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was found to be 85 ± 5%. The difference from 100% is attributable to losses on the RP-HPLC column. Rate constants for postcomplex fragment release following mixing of rACT and excess Chtr were measured using a quenched stopped flow apparatus, and determining the amount of released fragment (Fig. 1 B) as a function of incubation time prior to the quench. The yield of recovered peptide was 75 ± 9%. This value, slightly lower than that above, reflects losses in the rapid quench apparatus in addition to those on the RP-HPLC column. Rates were measured under strictly first-order conditions, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 (upper panel). Earlier we showed that quantitative scanning of stained SDS-PAGE analyses of quenched reaction mixtures, in which E*I* is well resolved from both E and I, could also be used to determine rate constants for the formation of the SDS-stable complex E*I* (23O'Malley K.H Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results displayed in Fig. 2 (lower panel) demonstrate that formation of both E*I* and postcomplex fragment proceed at the same rate at pH 7.5 and 40 °C. Rate constants for the two processes were also identical for experiments performed at both pH 7.5 and 9.0 at 25 °C within experimental error, as summarized in Table I. Experiments nos. 1 and 2 make clear the independence of the measured first-order rate constant on [Chtr] in the concentration range employed, demonstrating that this constant (7 ± 1 s−1 at 25 °C, pH 7.5) is for reaction of the rACT·Chtr complex.Table IRate constants for formation of postcomplex fragment (kPCF) and rACT·Chtr SDS-stable complex (kcomp)Experiment[rACT][Chtr]/[rACT]TemppHkcomp*kPCFμm°Cs−1s−11Wild-type153.3257.56.8 ± 0.7 (2)6 ± 1 (1)2Wild-type156.6257.56.9 ± 0.6 (3)8 ± 2 (1)3Wild-type156.6407.517 ± 2 (3)17 ± 3 (2)4Wild-type236.6259.016 ± 6 (2)11 ± 4 (1)5A347R143257.53.9 ± 0.9 (2)6A347R226257.53.8 ± 0.2 (2)Buffers used were 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl.

Proceeding as above, the first-order rate constant for postcomplex fragment formation was measured for the reaction of the substrate A347R-ACT with excess Chtr, giving the results shown in TableI. The value obtained (3.9 ± 0.7 s−1 at 25 °C, pH 7.5) is 60% of that for rACT reaction with Chtr, and, as above, its lack of dependence on [Chtr] demonstrates that it measures reaction of the A347R-rACT·Chtr complex. The postcomplex fragment assay we introduce in this report, along with the assay for E*I* formation we described earlier (23O'Malley K.H Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) based on SDS-PAGE analyses, provide two new general methods for monitoring serpin-proteinase interactions. In contrast, earlier demonstrations that the P1-P1′ bond is cleaved within severalE*I* complexes relied on assay of the newly formed α-NH2 terminus at P1′ (15Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E.

Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29652-29655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), an approach only applicable in the absence of lysines in the postcomplex fragment. Coupling these new assays to a rapid quench flow kinetic analysis, we provide the first demonstration that the overall first-order rate constants for both postcomplex fragment and E*I* formation from the E·I encounter complex are indistinguishable from one another over a range of experimental conditions, including at 40 °C when k2 is similar in magnitude tok3. Thus, within the context of Scheme FS1, postcomplex fragment formation must accompany EI′ conversion to E*I*, supporting our earlier conclusion that the P1-P1′ linkage is preserved in EI′. The second major result of this work is the demonstration that postcomplex fragment formation from Chtr complexes of both the inhibitor WT-rACT and the substrate A347R-rACT proceed with very similar first-order rate constants. This result straightforwardly supports the hypothesis that partitioning between the inhibitor and substrate pathways, leading to formation of the inhibited complexE*I* or the cleaved inhibitor Is, respectively, proceeds from a common intermediate formed in a step that is largely rate-determining, i.e. EI′. By contrast, partitioning from E·I rather than from EI′ would require that two quite different transformations, conformational change of E·I to yield EI′ and hydrolysis of I within E·I to yield E + Is, coincidentally proceed with very similar rate constants, which we consider unlikely. If partitioning between the inhibitor and substrate pathways is fromEI′, then the putative partial insertion accompanyingEI′ formation must be insufficient to distort the catalytic machinery of the proteinase. As a result, further conformational change in the serpin-proteinase complex accompanies EI′ toE*I* conversion, and it is this further change that must be coupled to proteinase distortion and stabilization of E*I* toward hydrolysis. Is Scheme FS1 generally applicable for serpin-serine proteinase interactions? Scheme FS1 is similar to those proposed by Olson et al. (27Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30007-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Stone and Le Bonniec (28Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 344-362Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in positing that conversion of the E·I encounter complex to E*I* proceeds via an intermediate, EI′, and that the reactive center loop is at least partially inserted into β-sheet A in EI′. Also noteworthy is the similarity in values of the overall first-order rate constants for E·I conversion to E*I* in this work (7 s−1 for rACT and Chtr at 25 °C and pH 7.5) and in reactions of the heparin complex of antithrombin and thrombin (5 s−1) (29Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of t-plasminogen activator and two different reactive center loop fluorescent derivatives of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, at P1′ (8 s−1) and P9 (4 s−1) (15Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), under similar conditions (25 °C and pH 7.4). However, the schemes proposed by Olson et al. (27Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30007-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Stone and Le Bonniec (28Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 344-362Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) differ from one another in two significant respects. The first concerns the structure of EI′. Olsonet al. propose that EI′ involves a covalent bond (either tetrahedral intermediate or acyl enzyme) between the active site Ser-195 and the serpin, based mainly on the lack of fluorescence change following anhydrotrypsin (i.e. with dehydroalanine in place of Ser-195) complex formation with NBD-labeled P9 Ser → Cys plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In contrast, complexation of trypsin with NBD-labeled P9 Ser → Cys plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 results in a large fluorescence enhancement. On the other hand, Stone and Le Bonniec propose that EI′ does not involve covalent bond formation, based on their demonstration that, in reacting with the heparin complex of antithrombin, both WT thrombin and its S195A variant share a common pathway through EI′ formation, with identical values for k2, although only WT thrombin can complete the reaction to form E*I*. In their scheme (as in ours) k2 is largely rate-determining forE*I* formation. A possible reason for this difference is that dehydroalanine substitution for Ser-195 might be more disruptive than Ala-195 substitution, effectively blocking E·I conversion to EI′. Alternatively, different serpin-serine proteinase pairs may simply react via different pathways. Our present results are compatible either with no covalent interaction betweenE and I in EI′ or with formation of the initial tetrahedral intermediate on Ser-195 attack on the P1 carbonyl, and thus shed no further light on this issue. The second point of difference concerns the species from which partitioning into substrate and inhibitor pathways occurs, Olson et al. placing it atEI′, as in Scheme FS1 and Stone and Le Bonniec placing it atE·I, although in neither case is the supporting evidence strong. As discussed above, our results support EI′ as the species from which partitioning occurs. We conclude that Scheme FS1, in which (a) formation ofEI′ from E·I is at least partly rate-determining in overall E*I* formation from theE·I encounter complex, (b) the P1-P1′ linkage is preserved in EI′, (c) partitioning between substrate and inhibitor pathways occurs from EI′, and (d) E*I* corresponds to a covalent adduct ofE and I, most likely acyl enzyme, is likely to provide a general, minimal description of serpin-serine proteinase interaction, but that whether there is covalent bond formation between Eand I in EI′ might vary from system to system.

https://openalex.org/W2076318668,"The regulatory domain (RD), or neck region of the myosin head, consists of two classes of light chains that stabilize an α-helical segment of the heavy chain. RD from chicken skeletal muscle myosin was prepared in Escherichia coli by coexpression of a 9-kDa heavy chain fragment with the essential light chain. Recombinant regulatory light chain (RLC), wild type or mutant, was added separately to reconstitute the complex. The affinity of RD for divalent cations was determined by measuring the change in fluorescence of a pair of heavy chain tryptophans upon addition of calcium or magnesium. The complex bound divalent cations with high affinity, similar to the association constants determined for native myosin. The intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophans could be used as a donor to measure the fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance to a single labeled cysteine engineered at position 2 on RLC. Dansylated Cys2 could also serve as a donor by preparing RLC with a second cysteine at position 79 which was labeled with an acceptor probe. These fluorescence resonance energy transfer distances (24–30 Å), together with a previous measurement between Cys2 and Cys155 (Wolff-Long, V. L., Tao, T., and Lowey, S. (1995) J. Biol.

The nucleotide- and actin-binding sites are located in the globular portion of the myosin head (S1), 1The abbreviations used are: S1, myosin subfragment-1; RD, regulatory domain; ELC, essential light chain; RLC, regulatory light chain; HC, heavy chain peptide; LC, light chain; 1,5-IAEDANS,N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-napthyl)ethylenediamine; DDPM, N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol; DAN, dansyl moiety of 1,5-IAEDANS; DDP, dimethylamino-dinitrophenyl moiety of DDPM; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. whereas the light chains are wrapped around a long (∼10 nm) α-helical region that includes about 70 residues of the COOH terminus of the S1 heavy chain (1Rayment I.

The light chain-binding region is also known as the “regulatory domain” (RD), because regulation of the actin-activated ATPase activity is achieved either by calcium binding to the essential light chain (ELC) of molluscan myosins (2Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), or by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC) of smooth and non-muscle myosins (3Adelstein R.S. Eisenberg E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 921-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The RLC of vertebrate striated muscle can also be phosphorylated at a homologous serine residue, but here phosphorylation has only a modulatory effect on activity (4Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1085-C1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How these signals are transmitted from RD to the active sites remains a major unsolved problem. A stable fragment containing RLC and ELC bound to a 9-kDa heavy chain peptide was first isolated by proteolytic digestion of scallop myosin (5Kwon H. Goodwin E.B. Nyitray L. Berliner E. O'Neall-Hennessey E. Melandri F.D. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4771-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This fragment bound calcium with high affinity in the presence of magnesium, mimicking the behavior of intact scallop myosin. Crystallization of RD led to a high resolution structure that revealed the detailed interactions of the three chains in the complex, and their contribution to a calcium-specific binding site in ELC (2Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the LCs in scallop RD is similar to that in the neck region of chicken skeletal S1 (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar), although there are differences that are probably related to the unique regulatory mechanisms in the two myosins (6Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our initial goal was to see if a correctly folded RD complex, consisting of two light chains and a heavy chain peptide, could be prepared in an expression system. Not only would this approach eliminate microheterogeneity introduced by proteolysis, but the opportunity would arise to study light chain-heavy chain interactions by site-directed mutagenesis. To date it has not been possible to express sufficient quantities of a striated muscle myosin for biophysical studies. We show here that homogeneous RD, retaining the high affinity nonspecific calcium/magnesium site found in all muscle myosins, can be prepared in good yield in a bacterial expression system. Moreover, by labeling a single engineered cysteine (Cys2) with 1,5-IAEDANS at the NH2 terminus of RLC, it was possible to determine the fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance between Cys2 and a cluster of two tryptophans located at the sharp bend of the heavy chain α-helix, which served as a donor to IAEDANS. Dansylated Cys2 could also be used as a donor by engineering a second cysteine at position 79, which was subsequently labeled with an acceptor molecule. These two FRET distances, together with a previously determined distance between Cys2 and Cys155 (7Wolff-Long V.L. Tao T. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31111-31118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), were used to define an approximate position for the NH2 terminus of RLC. The first 19 residues of RLC are not visible in the crystal structure of chicken S1, probably due to their flexibility (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). The structure of scallop RD is without 11 NH2-terminal RLC residues, since these are removed by proteolysis during the preparation of RD (2Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The location of the missing sequence by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, despite the low resolution of this technique, provides a structural framework for considering how the actomyosin interaction can be enhanced by phosphorylation of a single serine on a light chain far removed from the active site. Embryonic chicken skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain cDNA, provided by J. Robbins (8Molina M.I. Kropp K.E. Gulick J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6478-6488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template to obtain cDNA encoding residues Leu774 to Leu844 by the polymerase chain reaction method. Restriction sites EcoRI andBamHI were created at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, for cloning into the pT7-7 expression vector. This construct produces 4 extra residues (MARI) at the NH2 terminus of the expressed protein. The cDNA obtained for chicken skeletal muscle ELC (LC1 isoform) was missing 45 bases from the 5′-end that encodes the first 15 residues of LC1 (9Nabeshima Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Muramatsu M. Ogata K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6099-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide containing the additional bases was ligated to the cDNA, and the completed sequence was cloned into an expression vector designated pWY. This vector was engineered from two plasmids, pT7-7 and pGP1-2 (10Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar), for the purpose of having a different origin of replication and antibiotic resistance (kanamycin) from pT7-7 (ampicillin). The light chain expressed from the pWY/LC1 construct has an NH2-terminal tag of 4 residues (MARI) from the vector followed by Pro2 as the first residue of LC1 instead of Ala. Sequencing of the cDNA revealed a six-base deletion (encoding Pro-Ala) in the 5′-coding region, which results in six pairs of Pro-Ala instead of the seven pairs found in tandem in the native protein. Comparison of LC1 sequences from different species indicates a high degree of variability in the NH2-terminal regions (11Collins J.H. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1991; 12: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the deletion was considered unimportant for the experiments presented here. A construct with both LC1 and wild-type RLC in the same pWY vector was also designed. The pWY/LC1 clone was digested withPstI/BamHI and the 700-base pairPstI/BglII fragment from pT7-7/LC2 encoding RLC (12Saraswat L.D. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19777-19785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into this clone. Thus, the cDNA for each light chain was positioned in tandem with the promoter and stop codon. This construct was used to express both light chains together with the pT7-7 vector containing the 9-kDa heavy chain fragment. Protein expression was in BL21(DE3), and bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C for 16–18 h in the presence of ampicillin and/or kanamycin as described in Wolff-Long et al. (13Wolff-Long V.L. Saraswat L.D. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23162-23167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression and purification of wild-type and mutant chicken skeletal RLC in the vector pT7-7 has been described (14Saraswat L.D. Pastra-Landis S.C. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21112-21118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type RLC contains two endogenous Cys residues at positions 126 and 155. In some RLC mutants, e.g.Cys126/Cys155 and Cys2, the endogenous tryptophan at position 138 was changed to phenylalanine in order to eliminate the contribution of Trp fluorescence. In other mutants the endogenous Cys residues were selectively removed by mutagenesis to alanine, as in Cys126, and new Cys residues were introduced at positions 2 and 79 as in Cys2 and Cys2/Cys79. Table I gives a description of all the RLCs, and the location of specific residues is shown in the ribbon diagram of the regulatory domain in Fig. 1.Table IPosition of cysteine residues in the regulatory light chainRecombinant light chainDescriptionWild-typeCys126, Cys155, Trp138C126/C155Cys126, Cys155, W138FCys2P2C, C126A, C155A, W138FC2/C79P2C, C126A, C155A, T79C, Trp138Cys126Cys126, C155A, Trp138 Open table in a new tab When the 9-kDa heavy chain fragment and ELC are coexpressed, they are found in inclusion bodies, whereas simultaneous expression of heavy chain fragment together with RLC and ELC results in a soluble complex in the cytoplasm. An advantage of the first method is that the soluble bacterial proteins can be readily separated from the inclusion bodies by centrifugation, followed by washing of the pellet with a mild detergent (14Saraswat L.D. Pastra-Landis S.C. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21112-21118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively pure protein in the inclusion bodies can then be used to prepare complexes with a variety of unlabeled or labeled mutant RLCs. Although simultaneous expression of the three chains is in some ways a simpler procedure, a major drawback is the presence of a much higher concentration of contaminating bacterial proteins that are difficult to remove. For this reason, and since we usually wished to incorporate a labeled RLC into the regulatory complex, the first preparative procedure was adopted. The cell pellet from a 1-liter culture of Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) coexpressing 9-kDa HC and LC1 was lysed, and the inclusion bodies isolated as described (14Saraswat L.D. Pastra-Landis S.C. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21112-21118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The washed pellet was resuspended in 8 m guanidine, 10 mm DTT in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3), to which RLC (20–25 mg unchromatographed, or purified and labeled) was added with stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min), and the proteins were renatured by dialysis against PBS, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C. Denatured insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm NaN3 for 4 h, clarified, and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (10–250 mm sodium phosphate in a total volume of 200 ml), and the fractions containing the regulatory complex were pooled and further purified on a DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia) column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3. After eluting the proteins with a linear gradient to 0.5 m NaCl (total volume 100 ml), the fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and pooled. Trace amounts of remaining impurities were removed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm, FPLC, Pharmacia). The yield was 10–15 mg of complex. Purified RLC (lyophilized with sucrose) was dissolved in 8 m guanidine, PBS, 10–20 mm DTT, and stirred at room temperature for 1 h in order to completely reduce the cysteines before dialysis against PBS, 50 μmDTT, with at least one change of buffer. The single Cys mutant, Cys2 (Table I), was reacted with 2.5–5-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS (Molecular Probes) over total thiols for 2 h on ice in the dark before stopping the reaction by adding DTT to a final concentration of 10 mm. The double Cys mutant, C2/C79, at a concentration of 5–7 mg/ml, was reacted with a 3-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS for 2 min on ice. The reaction was stopped with 50 mm DTT, and the sample dialyzed against 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, and 3 mm NaN3. The protein was chromatographed on a DEAE-Sephacel (FPLC, Pharmacia) column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the above buffer and eluted with a linear gradient to 300 mm sodium phosphate (total volume 150 ml). Fractions containing unreacted, singly labeled (C2DAN/C79), and doubly labeled RLC were identified by urea-PAGE. C2DAN/C79 (in PBS, 50 μm DTT) was subsequently reacted with a 4-fold molar excess of DDPM (Aldrich) at room temperature for 4 h to obtain C2DAN/C79DDP. Iodoacetamide was used to block any unreacted cysteines in control experiments. The light chains were dialyzed exhaustively against PBS to remove excess reagent before being used to prepare the RD complex. Spectrophotometric analysis of the labeled light chains was used to determine the extent of labeling. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using wild-type RLC as a standard (absorbance of 0.5 at 280 nm, 1 mg/ml). A molar extinction coefficient of 6200 m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm was used for IAEDANS-labeled proteins. The ratio of DANS to light chain was ∼0.9. The molar extinction coefficient for DDPM-labeled RLC was taken as 2930 m−1 cm−1 at 442 nm (7Wolff-Long V.L. Tao T. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31111-31118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ratio of DDP to RLC was approximately 1. RLC and the regulatory domain (with either wild-type or mutant RLCs) were dialyzed against 0.1m Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmNaN3 for 10–14 h and clarified at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. EGTA was added to a final concentration of 1 mm before titration with calcium ions. Similarly, 1 mm EDTA was used in titrations with magnesium ions. Proteins were diluted to an absorbance of less than 0.05 to reduce the effect of light scattering (and the Raman scattering was removed by subtraction of a buffer blank). Small aliquots (2–20 μl) of the stock CaCl2 or MgCl2 solution were delivered by a microsyringe (Hamilton Co.) into 2 ml of the protein solution with constant stirring. A SLM 48000 spectrofluorometer was used to measure tryptophan fluorescence (emission maximum at 340 nm) upon excitation at 295 nm. The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm at 1-nm intervals with 2-s integration at each wavelength. The sample compartment temperature was maintained at 20 °C. Percent decrease in tryptophan fluorescence (after volume correction) was plotted against -log free metal ions (pm) to obtain the concentration (equivalent to 1/Ka, the association constant) at which the half-maximal change in fluorescence occurs. The program used to calculate free metal ion concentrations was based on the methodology of Storer and Cornish-Bowden (16Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence energy transfer measurements were performed on an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer equipped with a rhodamine B (4 mg/ml in ethanol with a RG 630 filter) quantum counter. Spectra were recorded in ratio mode to correct for lamp intensity fluctuations. The spectral bandwidths for excitation and emission were 8 nm. Emission spectra were recorded at 1-nm intervals with 2-s integration at each wavelength, and were later corrected with software supplied by ISS. A 305 nm cut-off filter was used in the emission path for tryptophan spectra. When IAEDANS was used as a donor, 320 and 470 nm cut-off filters were placed in the excitation and emission paths, respectively. The cluster of two tryptophans in the heavy chain peptide of RD could be used as an intrinsic energy donor. The acceptor was a single cysteine on RLC labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS. For preparation of RD, RLC mutants were used in which tryptophan residue 138 was replaced with phenylalanine. Two samples of RD had to be independently prepared, one containing Cys2 blocked with iodoacetamide, and the other containing IAEDANS-labeled Cys2. Proteins were dialyzed against Hepes buffer containing 1 mm magnesium chloride and clarified as described above. The tryptophan emission spectra were recorded under identical optical conditions for the unlabeled and labeled complexes diluted into the dialysate or 7 mguanidine hydrochloride. Contributions to the spectra due to Raman scattering were removed by subtraction of the buffer blank. In guanidine, where the complex is fully dissociated and energy transfer is presumably zero, the tryptophan intensities of the two complexes are directly proportional to their concentrations. Therefore, the ratio of the tryptophan fluorescence intensities for the labeled and unlabeled RD complexes in the native state should be the same as in the denatured state, if no energy transfer occurs. After normalizing the concentrations of the two species, any observed decrease in fluorescence of the acceptor-labeled RD relative to the unlabeled sample can be attributed to energy transfer between donor and acceptor. The same procedure was applied to RD specimens in which RLC labeled with IAEDANS was used as the donor and a second cysteine introduced into RLC was labeled with the acceptor DDPM. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was calculated according to the following equation, E=1−Fda/Fd,Equation 1 where Fda and Fdare the measured fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of the acceptor, respectively. The degree of energy transfer is dependent upon the distance (R) between donor and acceptor and is given by Equation 2, R=E−1−11/6×Ro,Equation 2 where R0, the Forster critical distance at which the energy transfer is 50%, was calculated by experimentally determining the parameters in Equation 3, Ro=Jκ2Qdn−41/6×9.7×103Å,Equation 3 where Qd is the quantum yield of the donor,n is the refractive index of the medium, taken here as 1.4,J is the overlap integral expressed in mol−1cm3, and κ2 is the orientation factor. The quantum yield, which depends upon the chemical environment of the donor, was calculated for the free light chain and RD by the procedure described by Chen (17Chen R.F. Anal. Lett. 1967; 1: 35-42Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar) using quinine sulfate (in 0.05 msulfuric acid) as a standard. The absorbance of proteins at 295 nm and the quantum yield of 0.70 for quinine sulfate (18Scott T.G. Spencer R.D. Leonard N.J. Weber G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 687-695Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were used in the following equation, Qd=0.70×Absq,s×Fd/Absd×Fq,s.Equation 4 In order to determine the overlap integral, J, the emission spectrum of the donor (tryptophan excited at 295 nm) and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor (IAEDANS) were recorded at 1-nm intervals from 320 to 380 nm. The value of J was calculated according to the expression, J=∫Fd(λ)εa(λ)λ4dλ/∫Fd(λ)dλ,Equation 5 where εa is the extinction coefficient (mol−1 cm−1) of the acceptor and Fis the fluorescence intensity of the donor at wavelength λ (cm). Steady-state polarization measurements were performed on RLC and RD in order to estimate the upper and lower limits of the orientation factor κ2 (19Dale R.E. Eisinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) essentially as described in Ref. 20Lakey J.H. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. The limiting polarization anisotropies for donor and acceptor were determined using L-format with the emission monochromator set at a fixed wavelength (340 and 480 nm for donor and acceptor, respectively). Sucrose was added to the samples to provide a range of viscosities at 20 °C for extrapolation to infinite viscosity in Perrin plots (21Lakowitz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was monitored by urea-PAGE analysis (23Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 199: 31-38Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients of the recombinant RDs were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and determining the concentration by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity runs were made in a Beckman Model E analytical ultracentrifuge. Myosin light chains were phosphorylated as described previously (24Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 9-kDa heavy chain fragment (HC) could not be obtained in any significant amount when expressed without the light chains, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of the crude extracts from overnight cultures (data not shown). Therefore, it was necessary to coexpress HC with both light chains, ELC (LC1 isoform) and RLC (LC2) (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) or with ELC alone (lane 2). In the latter method, HC and ELC were segregated into inclusion bodies, which could be readily separated from the bacterial proteins (lane 3). After resuspension in 8m guanidine, RLC was added to solubilize the complex upon subsequent dialysis into a benign solvent (lane 4). RD was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on hydroxylapatite (lane 5) followed by DEAE-Sephacel (lane 6) to remove any last trace of impurities. The recombinant RLC added to the HC·ELC complex was one of several mutants described in TableI. The purified RD remained stable at all concentrations (up to 20 mg/ml) when stored at 4 °C. Various methods were used to establish the composition of RD. The co-elution of the light and heavy chains from the ion-exchange columns during purification suggested that they form a complex. Upon gel filtration chromatography, RD eluted between the chymotryptic S1 (∼100 kDa) and the free light chains (∼20 kDa) consistent with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. The sedimentation velocity pattern for purified RD showed a single, homogeneous peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.3 S (Fig. 2 B). The extinction coefficients of RDs made with wild-type and Cys126/Cys155were 0.5 and 0.4, respectively, which agrees well with the theoretical values based on the number of tryptophans and tyrosines in a 1:1:1 complex (25Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Although the ratio of the two LCs and HC as determined by densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels was 1:1:2, it is probable that the large number of charged residues in the heavy chain peptide caused a disproportionate absorption of dye. There are three tryptophans in wild-type RD, two in the heavy chain peptide (Trp829-Pro830-Trp831) and one in wild-type RLC (Trp138) (Fig. 1). A mutant RLC was prepared in which Trp138 was replaced by Phe so that Trp fluorescence from the heavy chain could be used as a single reporter group or donor site in FRET experiments. Tryptophan emission spectra for RD containing wild-type or mutant RLC were compared with free wild-type RLC (Fig. 3). RD(mut) containing two tryptophans from the heavy chain showed far less fluorescence than wild-type RLC which has only a single tryptophan. The diminished intensity of fluorescence suggests intramolecular quenching by the heavy chain tryptophans due to their close proximity in the structure (WPW). In contrast, the single Trp138 in wild-type RLC appears to increase its fluorescence in the more hydrophobic environment of the heavy chain complex, as judged by the enhanced fluorescence of RD(wt) compared with the sum of the fluorescence intensity of wild-type RLC and RD(mut). In a denaturing solvent such as guanidine hydrochloride, the fluorescence intensity is more proportional to the tryptophan content of the protein:i.e. the fluorescence of RD(wt) is equal to the sum of the fluorescence of RD(mut) and wild-type RLC (Fig. 3). The emission maxima in guanidine hydrochloride showed a red shift (353 nm) compared with the emission maxima at 343 and 340 nm for WT and RDs, respectively, in a benign solvent. This can be explained by the increased exposure of the Trps to solvent in an unfolded, denatured state. Titrations with divalent cations were carried out to determine if expressed RD would bind calcium and magnesium with affinities similar to those found for native myosin. First, the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp138in RLC was measured as a function of calcium (or magnesium) to determine the binding of these ions to free RLC (data shown only for Ca2+ binding) (Fig. 4,A and B). The total decrease in fluorescence intensity was ∼18% for Ca2+ and ∼12% for Mg2+ ions. The association constants of 105m−1 for Ca2+ and 103m−1 for Mg2+ obtained here agree well with those reported by Alexis and Gratzer (26Alexis M.N. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2319-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for rabbit skeletal RLC. Despite the considerable distance between the cation binding site in the NH2-terminal domain and the single Trp in the COOH terminus of RLC, the conformational change associated with metal binding must be transmitted to the Trp, as evidenced by a change in signal. Similarly, the decrease in fluorescence for RD(wt) or RD(mut) as a function of calcium (or magnesium) was used to determine the affinity of RLC for metal ions in the heavy chain bound state. Association constants of 107-108m−1 for Ca2+, and 106for Mg2+ were obtained (Fig. 4, C andD). The smaller fluorescence change with RD(wt) compared with RD(mut) can be attributed to the high level of background fluorescence contributed by Trp138 in wild-type RLC. The large fluorescence change in RD(mut) (∼32%), despite the low absolute intensity of the signal, suggests that the heavy chain tryptophans are perturbed to a greater degree by metal binding than the single Trp in RLC. This may be related to the hydrophobic interactio"
