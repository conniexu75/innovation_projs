While a very mild degree of biotin deficiency sufficed to increase susceptibility, even an extreme degree of pantothenic acid deficiency had no effect. Biotin deficiency also increased the susceptibility of ducks to P. cathemerium. In animals infected with P. lophurae, the concentration of biotin in the plasma as well as in the red cells rose during the course of the infection, reached a peak at about the same time as the parasite number reached its peak, and then returned to normal as the infection subsided. While the administration of additional biotin to animals partially deficient in biotin could be considered a specific measure tending to lessen the severity of infection with P. lophurae, the injection of biotin into animals fed a diet adequate in this vitamin had no antimalarial effects, perhaps because the excess biotin was rapidly removed from the blood."

You describe and quote from certain resolutions passed by the Metropolitan Section of the American Physical Society on 9 November; and in the course of your description, you unluckily speak of the position of the ""Society"" rather than that of the Section. Now, the fact is that fewer than five per cent of the members of the Society were present at that meeting, of which no one had been notified in advance except the members living in and near New York and a few others. The resolutions cannot therefore be taken as an expression of the' Society, even though many-myself included-think that a majority of the Society agree with them."
