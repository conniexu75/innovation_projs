https://openalex.org/W1965386143,IT is now a well-established fact that adrenal chromaffin cells of many vertebrates store substantial quantities of both adrenaline and noradrenaline. The relative proportions of the two catecholamines in the normal adult animal is species specific.

https://openalex.org/W2079931313,"THE human placenta is known to be a rich source of choline acetyltransferase (acetyl CoA: choline-o-acetyltransferase E.C. 2.3.1.6)1. Investigations have shown that this enzyme is very similar, in its kinetic behaviour and specificity, to choline acetyltransferase from other sources. In the foregoing work and in the course of purification of the placental enzyme (Morris, D., unpublished) it was of interest to determine its molecular weight, and to compare its sedimentation characteristics with that of rabbit brain enzyme."

Our main interest has been in the determination of the quality and properties of depot fat and the level of copper in the livers of pigs fed high-level copper."

https://openalex.org/W2032726665,"A PRONOUNCED sex difference was found to exist in the renal tubules of rats injected intravenously with minimally toxic doses of bichloride of mercury. Mercury, in toxic doses, produces an acute tubular necrosis in a wide variety of experimental animals and man1,2. Histologically, when minimally toxic doses are given to rats, the lesions are confined to the straight portions of the proximal tubules."

https://openalex.org/W1991767862,"THE chemical processes involved in hardening and darkening of insect cuticle have been the objects of increasing attention during recent years1–6. Hardening and darkening of the cuticle have been attributed to a tanning process involving the proteins of the cuticle1,5,7,8. But Malek9,10, Jones and Sinclair11, Dennell12, and Kawase13 have produced biochemical evidence that hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle are independent processes. The biochemical problems involved have been reviewed by Gilmour14. Dennell15 noted that in the larva of Sarcophaga the first sign of darkening of the cuticle is seen before contraction begins and presumably before hardening has commenced, and the object of this note is to direct attention to additional visual evidence indicating that hardening, darkening, and contraction are all separate processes."

This variation was found to be related to the order in which the medium batch was collected during filtration using standard asbestos pads."

https://openalex.org/W2075525682,"CONSIDERABLE interest has been shown recently in the turnover of strontium in the new-born1,2, stimulated by the pattern of deposition of strontium-90 in young children3. It has been postulated that in the very young the turnover of body stores of calcium and strontium must be relatively rapid compared with that in adults, that is, the calcium and strontium are much more labile. The following experiments on new-born rats lend considerable support to this hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2041513779,"IN a previous communication, I reported that the formation of carbonyl chloride in a state of high blood urea-level associated with acidaemia is responsible for uraemic coma. It was also claimed that phosgene is not formed under normal conditions in blood due to the absence of biologically available urea and acidaemia. Since then, investigations from different aspects have been pursued to confirm that uraemia is attributable to the formation of phosgene as claimed by the author. The results have lead to some additional direct evidences which are reported here."

Castration increases the uptake of oxygen both in male and in female rats3, and sex hormones which normally depress the oxidative enzymes of the vessels4 return these high values to normal. Furthermore, cyclic changes in the uptake of oxygen of the aorta have also been described in female rats. The oxidative activity was lower during œstrus and higher during diœstrus5; these findings may be correlated with opposite circulating levels of sex hormones."
