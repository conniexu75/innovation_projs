https://openalex.org/W2010357177,"Multiple small injections of streptozotocin in mice produce pancreatic insulitis, with progression to nearly complete beta cell destruction and diabetes mellitus. The timing and appearance of the inflammatory islet lesions suggest but do not prove that streptozotocin acts by initiating a cell-mediated immune reaction. Ultrastructural evidence of abundant type C viruses within beta cells of treated mice suggests that streptozotocin may activate murine leukemia virus in vivo in susceptible hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2049023634,"The sulfated glycosaminoglycan, heparin, was found to release 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (125I-LDL) from its receptor site on the surface of normal human fibroblasts. Measurement of the amount of 125I-LDL released by heparin permitted the resolution of the total cellular uptake of 125I-LDL at 37 degrees C into two components: first, an initial rapid, high affinity binding of the lipoprotein to the surface receptor, from which the 125I-LDL could be released by heparin, and second, a slower process attributable to an endocytosis of the receptor-bound lipoprotein, which rendered it resistant to heparin release. At 4 degrees C the amount of heparin-releasable 125I-LDL was similar to that at 37 degrees C, but interiorization of the lipoprotein did not occur at the lower temperature. The physiologic importance of the cell surface LDL receptor was emphasized by the finding that mutant fibroblasts from a subject with homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, which lack the ability to take up 125I-LDL at 37 degrees C, did not show cell surface binding of 125I-LDL, as measured by heparin release, at either 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Although heparin released 125I-LDL from its binding site, it did not release 3H-concanavalin A from its surface receptor, and conversely, alpha-methyl-D-mannopyranoside, which released 3H-concanavalin A, did not release surface-bound 125I-LDL. When added to the culture medium simultaneously with LDL, heparin prevented the binding of LDL to its receptor and hence prevented the LDL-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. The uptake of LDL by fibroblasts is proposed as a model of receptor-mediated adsorptive endocytosis of macromolecules in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2154130786,"In contrast to well-studied through-projection neurons that propagate information from one region to another in the central nervous system, short-axon or axonless neurons form local circuits, transmitting signals through synapses and electrical junctions between their dendrites. Interaction in this dendritic network proceeds without spike action potentials. Interaction is mediated by graded electrotonic changes of potential and is transmitted through high sensitivity (submillivolt threshold) synapses rather than by the lower sensitivity (20 to 100-mv threshold) synapses typical of projection neurons. A crucial feature of local circuits is their high degree of interaction both through specialized junctional structures and through the extracellular fields generated by local and more distant brain regions."

https://openalex.org/W2079251411,"Induction of early lymphocyte differentiation was studied in vitro in fractionated bone marrow cells of newly hatched chickens, with alloantiserums to identify newly differentiated B cells (Bu-1+) and T cells (Th-1+). Thymus extract induced selective T cell differentiation; the activity of the extract corresponds to that of thymopoietin. Bursal extract induced both B cell and T cell differentiation, but at lower concentrations B cell differentiation was always greater. This activity is ascribed to a lymphocyte-differentiating hormone of the bursa of Fabricius, for which the name bursopoietin is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1541571765,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with vesicular stomatitis virus was isolated to apparent homogeneity by a newly developed procedure, which includes stepwise removal of proteins from virions by successive treatment with high concentrations of cesium sulfate and cesium chloride, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation or chromatography on phosphocellulose or DEAE-Sephadex column. The polymerase thus purified contained L (large protein) and NS proteins as the intrinsic subunits and multiple species of enzyme were found which differ in the molar ratio of L to NS. Since the enzyme with the highest activity was composed of equimolar amounts of the two subunits and exhibited the sedimentation coefficient of approximately 11 S in a buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl, the structure of active protomer was suggested to be (L)1(NS)1. In accordance with this conclusion, enzyme preparations deficient in the content of NS protein, were activated by the addition of preparations deficient in the content of NS protein. The purified RNA polymerase catalyzed the synthesis of poly(A), which was covalently attached to the 3' termini of RNA products, and RNA, only in the presence of all 4 substrates. The present finding might be the first which indicates that the transcriptase itself catalyzes post-transcriptional modification of mRNA by adding poly(A) sequences to the 3'-OH termini. The molecular mechanism of the switch from transcription to poly(A) synthesis, however, remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1550969651,"Abstract Ornithine decarboxylase has been induced in log phase hepatoma cells grown in suspension culture. Induction with N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate produced a 4-fold increase in enzyme activity by 3 hours which was followed by a return to base levels by 6 hours. Induction with dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, exhibited a slow steady rate of increase in enzyme activity, reaching a plateau level of approximately 5- to 6-fold stimulation by about 12 hours. Induced cell and regenerating rat liver ornithine decarboxylase were shown to be indistinguishable by titration with antibody monospecific to the latter and by heat stability. L-[14C]Leucine incorporation into immunoprecipitable enzyme protein after induction in vitro or partial hepatectomy showed an increase which, when coupled with the increase in enzymatic activity, indicated de novo synthesis of enzyme protein. Physiological concentrations of the naturally occurring polyamines, spermidine and spermine, abolish cyclic AMP induction whereas they have no effect on dexamethasone induction. Both inductions were abolished by cycloheximide; in contrast, inhibition by actinomycin D was complete for dexamethasone induction and only partial with respect to cyclic AMP induction. The different time pattern of induction seen with cyclic AMP and dexamethasone, the partial inhibition of the cyclic AMP induction seen with actinomycin D, as well as the absence of inhibition of the dexamethasone induction by polyamines, indicate that these inducers might affect different aspects of the control of the same enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2033808264,"The major viral phosphoproteins (p12) of the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) and the simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV) bind in vitro to their homologous 70S and 35S viral RNAs. Using purified 32P-labeled RNA and 125I-labeled p12 protein, complexes that are stabilized by formaldehyde-cross-linking can be readily detected after velocity gradient centrifugation. The in vitro reconstructed ribonucleoprotein complexes are seen only with p12 proteins incubated with viral RNAs isolated from the same type C viruses; no such complexes form with heterologous protein-RNA mixtures. Homologous but not heterologous p12 molecules compete with radiolabeled p12 protein for the specific viral RNA binding sites. The competition assay permits the detection of 10 ng of viral p12 protein. The major internal protein of type C viruses (p30) does not bind to viral RNA using identical assay conditions. From the specific activities of the radiolabeled components and also by equilibrium sedimentation analysis, we estimate that fewer than 15 molecules of p12 protein bind to each molecule of viral RNA. Both the specificity and stoichiometry of the p12-RNA interactions suggest that these RNA tumor virus proteins have a regulatory role in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067976846,"The different species of polyoma virus-spedific RNA molecules present in the cytoplasm of 3T6 cells 30 hr after viral infection have been characterized by molecular hybridization between nonradioactive polyadenlated RNA, fractionated by sedimentation through sucrose-formamide density gradients, and the 32P-labeled separated strands of restriction endonuclease fragments of polyoma DNA. Two relatively abundant RNA molecules, sedimenting at 16S and at 19S, transcribed from the L strand of the viral DNA, as well as a minor 20S species transcribed from the E strand of the DNA, were detected. The most abundant viral transcript, the 16S RNA molecule, was estimated to be complementary to the 22% of the L-strand DNA extending from 47 to 25 map units. The less abundant 19S L DNA strand transcript included all the sequences present in the 16S RNA and mapped between 68 and 25 map units. The minor 20S RNA molecule was tentatively identified as a transcript of the E-strand DNA from the entire early region of the polyoma genome. These three viral RNA molecules together exhaust greater than 95% of the coding capacity of the viral DNA. A small region of the DNA (4-5%), including the origin of DNA replication, does not appear to determine sequences present among the major stable species of vital mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2071220187,"In effort to understand how N or B tropism is determined in murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles, we analyzed the MuLV produced after dual infection of mouse cells by N- and B-tropic MuLV. The progeny MuLV from such a mixed infection are sensitive to Fv-1 restriction in both N- and B-type cells, but are still highly infectious for mouse cells which do not exhibit Fv-1 restriction. This dual sensitivity to Fv-1 restriction is a phenotypic property of MuLV produced by mixedly infected cells, since individual virus clones derived from this MuLV are either N- or B-tropic. In further experiments, we superinfected murine sarcoma virus (MSV)-transformed cells with mixtures of N- and B-tropic MuLVs. The rescued MSV is restricted in its ability to transforms both N- and B-type cells. The results suggest that N- and B-tropic MuLVs specify different determinants, which are incorporated into virions along with the viral genome and which are the recognition sites for Fv-1 restriction. The presence of a given determinant in a virion renders the virus sensitive to restriction in cells of the opposite Fv-1 type."

https://openalex.org/W1517473019,"Although guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP)-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G) which was partially purified from silkworm pupae was not dissociated by cyclic GMP into catalytic and regulatory subunits as described for adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) (Takai, Y., Nakaya, S., Inoue, M., Kishimoto, A., Nishiyama, K., Yamamura, H., and Nishizuka, Y. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1481-1487), limited proteolysis with trypsin resulted in the formation of catalytic and cyclic GMP-binding fragments which showed molecular weights of approximately 3.4 X 10(4) and 3.6 X 10(4), respectively (the molecular weight of native protein kinase G was 1.4 X 10(5)). The catalytic fragment did not bind cyclic GMP and was fully active in the absence of the cyclic nucleotide. The fragment did not show an absolute requirement for a sulfhydryl compound and high concentrations of Mg2+ (50 to 100 mM), both of which were necessary for the maximal activation of native protein kinase G. The catalytic fragment was not inhibited by the cyclic GMP-binding fragment nor by the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. Inversely, the cyclic GMP-binding fragment was unable to inhibit the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Protein inhibitor, which was described for protein kinase A, was inert for the catalytic fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1897437078,"The stimulatory and inhibitory activities in the crude preparation of protein kinase modulator from dog heart were separated by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, and the stimulatory modulator was further purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The isolated stimulatory modulator, as the crude modulator preparation, stimulated the activity of the purified guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinases of both mammalian and arthropod origins in the presence of cGMP. The cGMP-dependent protein kinases were not activated by cGMP in the absence of either the isolated stimulatory modulator or the crude modulator. The stimulatory modulator, unlike the crude modulator had no effect on the activity of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase. The stimulatory modulator was a protein since its activity was destroyed by trypsin but was resistant to hydrolysis by DNase, RNase, phospholipase C, and lysozyme. The isolated inhibitory modulator, presumably the same as the protein inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase reported by Walsh et al. (Wash. D.A., Ashby, C.D., Gonzalez, C., Calkins, D., Fischer. E.H., and Krebs, E.G. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1977-1985), depressed the cAMP-stimulated activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase as did the crude preparation of protein kinase modulator. The isolated inhibitory modulator, unlike the crude preparation, was without effect on cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The present findings provide evidence to support that in mammals there are separate proteins for the stimulatory and the inhibitory activities of protein kinase modulator, in contrast to the modulator from an arthropod tissue (lobster tail muscle, Donnelly et al. (Donnelly, T.E., Jr., Kuo, J.F., Reyes, P.L., Liu, Y.P., and Greengard, P. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 190-198) which has been shown to possess both activities."

In theory, control of this disease by immunotherapy might be feasible, much like postexposure serum prophylaxis of rabies, since the time of HSV infection in the birth canal is usually known and antibody can be administered soon thereafter. Treatment with antibody has not been encouraged, however, because (1) many investigators consider this immunity cell-mediated rather than humoral6–11; (2) effective administration of human immune globulin in neonatal herpes of man has not been demonstrated1,3,12, and (3) transplacental antibody conferred only partial protection in human neonatal infections1. There is further discouragement in animal studies which failed to show protection by antibody9–11, although antibody was protective in some animal studies13–20. The findings reported here raise again the possibility that antibody treatment might be effective in specific conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1549783234,"Effects of monovalent cations on the neutral rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase are multifunctional and dependent on their nonhydrated ionic size. (a) The maximal velocity is increased by addition of monovalent cations with the optimum stimulation occurring with a nonhydrated ionic of 1.2 A in the presence of a chelating agent such as EDTA. (B) Activation curves are sigmoidal with n values varying from 1.5 to 2.3 as ionic of monovalent cation increases. The apparent Ka values from 16.0 to 180 mM, obtained for various monovalent cations, have a linear relationship to ionic radii of cations. (c) At lower concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate monovalent cations show the inhibitory effect and the apparent Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is increased as the concentration of monovalent cation is increased. A linear relationship is obtained between the slopes of increase in the Km and the reciprocals of ionic volume of monovalent cations. (d) The apparent Ka for Mg2+ is also increased as the concentration of monovalent cation is increased, and a linear relationship is obtained again between the increases in Ka and the reciprocals of ionic volume of monovalent cations. The cooperative nature for Mg2+ saturation is decreased as the Ka increases. (e) The apparent Ki for AMP is also linearly altered as the concentration of monovalent cation is varied. However, the alteration of the Ki is unusual, that is, the smaller cations than K+ increase the Ki (Li+ greater than Na+ greater than NH4+), whereas the larger cations decrease the value ((CH2CH2OH)3N+ greater than Cs+ greater than Rb+). The effect of K+ is insignificant. Alterations in the Ki are also linearly related to the reciprocals of ionic volume of monovalent cations. The cooperative nature for AMP inhibition is decreased or increased as the Ki increased or decreased. (f) In the absence of the chelating agent, the curves for Mg2+ saturation and AMP inhibition were hyperbolic without monovalent cations. By addition of monovalent cation the Ka for Mg+2+ or Ki for AMP is increased and cooperative natures for binding of both ligands are induced. For nonspherical monovalent cations, the application of functional ionic radius is proposed. Functional ionic radii of NH4+, (CH2OH)3CNH3+, and (CH2CH2OH)3N+ are estimated to be 1.17, 2.55, and 2.87 A, respectively. The presence of two distinct sites for the actions of monovalent cations is suggested."

In dystrophic white muscle (pectoral), activity of the two sulfhydryl enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase, was preferentially lost from the sarcoplasm resulting in decreased specific activities. By contrast, acetyl phosphatase was preferentially retained and showed increased specific activity. Dystrophic white muscle had decreased sulfhydryl content in the soluble proteins, severe reduction in muscle mass, fatty infiltration, and fragmentation of fibers. Red dystrophic muscles (thigh) were minimally involved in accordance with the known sparing of red fibers. Enzyme activities were correlated with histological observations. The results suggested that the disease process in dystrophic white muscle may be related to alterations in the sulfhydryl groups of proteins. The data are correlated with the beneficial effects of our treatment of hereditary avian dystrophy with the sulfhydryl compound, penicillamine (Chou, T.H., Hill, E.J., Bartle, E., Woolley, K., LeQuire, V., Olson, W., Roelofs, R., and Park, J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2013762474,"Certain continuous lymphoid and myeloid tumor cell lines of rodent origin are unable to grow in tissue culture in the absence of pre-formed L-cystine (CYS). In contrast, three NZB murine lymphoid cell lines obtained from NZB mice free of hematopoietic neoplasm can grow as well in cystine-deficient media containing L-cystathionine (CSN), the immediate precursor of CYS in the biosynthetic pathway, as in cystine sufficient medium. The former class of cells is, therefore, CYS auxotrophs (CYS-) and the latter CYS prototrophs (CYS+). Compared to CYS+ cells, the CYS- lines appear to be relatively deficient in the enzyme cystathionase, which catalyzes the cleavage of CSN to CYS and alpha-ketobutyrate. Using protein synthetic capacity as a criterion, normal thymocytes from mixed-bred Swiss mice behave like CYS prototrophs, while those from littermates bearing Moloney type C virus-induced thymic tumors behave like CYS auxotrophs. The former are also characterized by substantially higher levels of cystathionase than the latter. Extracts of thymocytes from tumor-free AKR mouse thymus are also characterized by higher levels of cystathionase activity than extracts of spontaneous AKR thymomas. Exogenous in vitro type C virus infection of a CYS+ cell results in vigorous virus production but no concomitant reduction in cystathionase activity. Thus viral replication alone in any random lymphoid cell is not sufficient to alter the enzyme level. The data therefore suggests that CYS auxotrophy may closely accompany neoplastic transformation of certain hematopoietic cells in vivo, including that induced by certain ""thymic"" type C viruses."

Systematic testing showed that these cells discharge only in response to specific stimuli and remain silent for as long as 40 minutes in the absence of stimulation. Silent cells were widely distributed in the pons and midbrain and constituted a major percentage of observed neurons. The economy of discharge shown by these cells contrasts with the spontaneous activity of virtually all other neurons that have been observed in the brains of unrestrained animals and suggests the widespread existence of specialized neural systems that show only phasic activity."

In these experiments, deoxyhemoglobin was reacted with n-butyl isocyanide for a controlled time and then mixed rapidly with a high concentration of nitric oxide to fill residual, unoccupied heme sites. The final mixture was frozen immediately after formation to prevent any displacement of bound isonitrile. The EPR spectrum of the frozen sample was resolved into alpha and beta nitric oxide components; these reflect the relative proportions of alpha- and beta-heme sites which were unoccupied by n-butyl isocyanide. Individual time courses for the alpha and beta subunits were obtained by varying the time between the formation of the isonitrile/hemoglobin mixture and its reaction with nitric oxide. At pH 7.0 only the beta chain time course exhibits an initial rapid phase; the alpha chain time course is monophasic, exhibiting almost, exponential behavior. This result shows unequivocally that the beta-hemes within deoxyhemoglobin react much more rapidly with n-butyl isocyanide than the alpha hemes."

https://openalex.org/W1511790243,"Abstract The effect of sugars on 125I-thyroid-stimulating hormone binding to beef thyroid membranes was studied to determine their role in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) binding. At 0.1 M concentration, N-acetylneuraminic acid produced a 3- to 7-fold increase in TSH binding, was the only sugar to enhance TSH binding, and did so whether binding was determined in the cyclase medium or under conditions of optimum binding. The enhanced TSH binding remained after the membranes were removed from the high NeuAc concentration and an effect was observed at concentrations of 10 mM NeuAc. NeuAc did not alter the kinetics of TSH binding but the pH optimum for TSH binding shifted from pH 5.5 to 7.5 in the presence of NeuAc. Incubation of the membranes with increasing concentrations of NeuAc resulted in increased sialic acid content of the membranes. The NeuAc concentration curve of membrane sialic acid and TSH binding were roughly parallel. The capacity of the low affinity site increased from 0.74 to 2.5 nmol/mg of protein in the presence of NeuAc. The apparent affinity (0.88 X 10(6) M-1) of this site was unaffected by NeuAc. With the high affinity site, NeuAc increased both the apparent affinity and capacity from 2.2 X 10(8)M-1 to 5.5 X 10(8) M-1 and 1.6 to 3.1 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. Neuraminidase or neuraminidase plus beta-galactosidase incubation of the membranes removed approximately 60% of the sialic acid from the membranes within 15 to 30 min but did not affect TSH binding. Large quantities of sialic acid were detected in the soluble fractions during isolation of the membranes, 4 to 5% of which was ultrafilterable and not associated with high molecular weight proteins. It is concluded that among the sugars tested, NeuAc exhibits an unique effect on TSH binding that may have physiological significance. The inability to alter TSH binding by enzymatic removal of endogenous sialic acid suggests that either NeuAc resistant to hydrolysis is sufficient to maintain TSH binding or that NeuAc important in TSH binding is removed during membrane preparation but is replaced by incubation with exogenous NeuAc."

The present report provides additional evidence that the synapses between photoreceptors and horizontal cells have properties characteristics of conventional chemical synapses. It is known that in the chemically transmitting synapse, strontium ions can substitute calcium ions in the process of transmitter release9–11.
