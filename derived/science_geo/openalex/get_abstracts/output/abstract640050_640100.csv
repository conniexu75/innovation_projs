https://openalex.org/W2973445239,"The superconducting state in the quasi-two-dimensional and strongly correlated Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is uniquely held up as a solid state analog to superfluid $^3$He-$A$, with an odd-parity order parameter that also breaks time reversal symmetry, and for which the vector order parameter has the same direction in spin space for all electron momenta. The recent discovery that uniaxial pressure causes a steep rise and maximum in transition temperature ($T_c$) in strained samples motivated the study of $^{17}$O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that we describe in this article. A reduction of Knight shifts $K$ was observed for all strain values and temperatures $T<T_c$, consistent with a drop in spin polarization in the superconducting state. In unstrained samples, our results are in contradiction with a body of previous NMR work, and with the most prominent previous proposals for the order parameter of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Possible alternative scenarios are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2976971613,"Cholesterol activates the master growth regulator, mTORC1 kinase, by promoting its recruitment to the surface of lysosomes by the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). The mechanisms that regulate lysosomal cholesterol content to enable mTORC1 signalling are unknown. Here, we show that oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and its anchors at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), VAPA and VAPB, deliver cholesterol across ER-lysosome contacts to activate mTORC1. In cells lacking OSBP, but not other VAP-interacting cholesterol carriers, the recruitment of mTORC1 by the Rag GTPases is inhibited owing to impaired transport of cholesterol to lysosomes. By contrast, OSBP-mediated cholesterol trafficking drives constitutive mTORC1 activation in a disease model caused by the loss of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Chemical and genetic inactivation of OSBP suppresses aberrant mTORC1 signalling and restores autophagic function in cellular models of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). Thus, ER-lysosome contacts are signalling hubs that enable cholesterol sensing by mTORC1, and targeting the sterol-transfer activity of these signalling hubs could be beneficial in patients with NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2974103075,"The mechanisms by which common risk variants of small effect interact to contribute to complex genetic disorders are unclear. Here, we apply a genetic approach, using isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells, to evaluate the effects of schizophrenia (SZ)-associated common variants predicted to function as SZ expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By integrating CRISPR-mediated gene editing, activation and repression technologies to study one putative SZ eQTL (FURIN rs4702) and four top-ranked SZ eQTL genes (FURIN, SNAP91, TSNARE1 and CLCN3), our platform resolves pre- and postsynaptic neuronal deficits, recapitulates genotype-dependent gene expression differences and identifies convergence downstream of SZ eQTL gene perturbations. Our observations highlight the cell-type-specific effects of common variants and demonstrate a synergistic effect between SZ eQTL genes that converges on synaptic function. We propose that the links between rare and common variants implicated in psychiatric disease risk constitute a potentially generalizable phenomenon occurring more widely in complex genetic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2973689228,"Cell fate transitions are accompanied by global transcriptional, epigenetic and topological changes driven by transcription factors, as is exemplified by reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells through the expression of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and cMYC. How transcription factors orchestrate the complex molecular changes around their target gene loci remains incompletely understood. Here, using KLF4 as a paradigm, we provide a transcription-factor-centric view of chromatin reorganization and its association with three-dimensional enhancer rewiring and transcriptional changes during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. Inducible depletion of KLF factors in PSCs caused a genome-wide decrease in enhancer connectivity, whereas disruption of individual KLF4 binding sites within pluripotent-stem-cell-specific enhancers was sufficient to impair enhancer-promoter contacts and reduce the expression of associated genes. Our study provides an integrative view of the complex activities of a lineage-specifying transcription factor and offers novel insights into the nature of the molecular events that follow transcription factor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2974009848,"Targeting membrane proteins could improve the efficacy of T cell–based immunotherapies. To facilitate the identification of T cell targets, we developed a hybrid genetic screening system where the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon and single guide RNA cassette are nested in an adeno-associated virus (AAV). SB-mediated genomic integration of the single guide RNA cassette enables efficient gene editing in primary murine T cells as well as a screen readout. We performed in vivo AAV–SB-CRISPR screens for membrane protein targets in CD8+ T cells in mouse models of glioblastoma (GBM). We validated screen hits by demonstrating that adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells with Pdia3, Mgat5, Emp1 or Lag3 gene editing enhances the survival of GBM-bearing mice in both syngeneic and T-cell receptor transgenic models. Transcriptome profiling, single cell sequencing, cytokine assays and T cell signaling analysis showed that Pdia3 editing in T cells enhances effector functions. Engineered PDIA3 mutant EGFRvIII chimeric antigen T cells are more potent in antigen-specific killing of human GBM cells. A hybrid AAV–transposon CRISPR approach enables large-scale in vivo screens in T cells and identifies potential targets for immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2976719148,"Among the main bacteria implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is well known for causing loss of periodontal attachment and systemic disease. Recent studies have suggested that secreted extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) from several bacteria may be important in periodontitis, although their role is unclear. Emerging evidence indicates that exRNAs circulate in nanosized bilayered and membranous extracellular vesicles (EVs) known as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we analyzed the small RNA expression profiles in activated human macrophage-like cells (U937) infected with OMVs from Aa and investigated whether these cells can harbor exRNAs of bacterial origin that have been loaded into the host RNA-induced silencing complex, thus regulating host target transcripts. Our results provide evidence for the cytoplasmic delivery and activity of microbial EV-derived small exRNAs in host gene regulation. The production of TNF-α was promoted by exRNAs via the TLR-8 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Numerous studies have linked periodontal disease to neuroinflammatory diseases but without elucidating specific mechanisms for the connection. We show here that intracardiac injection of Aa OMVs in mice showed successful delivery to the brain after crossing the blood-brain barrier, the exRNA cargos increasing expression of TNF-α in the mouse brain. The current study indicates that host gene regulation by microRNAs originating from OMVs of the periodontal pathogen Aa is a novel mechanism for host gene regulation and that the transfer of OMV exRNAs to the brain may cause neuroinflammatory diseases like Alzheimer's.-Han, E.-C., Choi, S.-Y., Lee, Y., Park, J.-W., Hong, S.-H., Lee, H.-J. Extracellular RNAs in periodontopathogenic outer membrane vesicles promote TNF-α production in human macrophages and cross the blood-brain barrier in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2975275554,"The gastrointestinal microbiota is emerging as a unique and inexhaustible source for metabolites with potential to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of microbiota-derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut microbiota and the host via modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling. Together, this highlights the emerging therapeutic potential in the exploration of the microbiota metabolome in the specific targeting of key GPCRs, with pleiotropic actions that span both the CNS and periphery.-Torres-Fuentes, C., Golubeva, A.

https://openalex.org/W2973729125,"Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems, such as Cas9 and Cas12, have been widely used to target DNA sequences in eukaryotic genomes. However, class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems, which represent about 90% of all CRISPR systems in nature, remain largely unexplored for genome engineering applications. Here, we show that class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems can be expressed in mammalian cells and used for DNA targeting and transcriptional control. We repurpose type I variants of class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems from Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes, which target DNA via a multi-component RNA-guided complex termed Cascade. We validate Cascade expression, complex formation and nuclear localization in human cells, and demonstrate programmable CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-mediated targeting of specific loci in the human genome. By tethering activation and repression domains to Cascade, we modulate the expression of targeted endogenous genes in human cells. This study demonstrates the use of Cascade as a CRISPR-based technology for targeted eukaryotic gene regulation, highlighting class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems for further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2975067332,"At least two members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, TLR7 and TLR9, can recognize self-RNA and self-DNA, respectively. Despite the structural and functional similarities between these receptors, their contributions to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus can differ. For example, TLR7 and TLR9 have opposing effects in mouse models of systemic lupus erythematosus-disease is exacerbated in TLR9-deficient mice but attenuated in TLR7-deficient mice1. However, the mechanisms of negative regulation that differentiate between TLR7 and TLR9 are unknown. Here we report a function for the TLR trafficking chaperone UNC93B1 that specifically limits signalling of TLR7, but not TLR9, and prevents TLR7-dependent autoimmunity in mice. Mutations in UNC93B1 that lead to enhanced TLR7 signalling also disrupt binding of UNC93B1 to syntenin-1, which has been implicated in the biogenesis of exosomes2. Both UNC93B1 and TLR7 can be detected in exosomes, suggesting that recruitment of syntenin-1 by UNC93B1 facilitates the sorting of TLR7 into intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies, which terminates signalling. Binding of syntenin-1 requires phosphorylation of UNC93B1 and provides a mechanism for dynamic regulation of TLR7 activation and signalling. Thus, UNC93B1 not only enables the proper trafficking of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, but also sets the activation threshold of potentially self-reactive TLR7."
https://openalex.org/W2973326578,"Immune-disease-associated variants are enriched in active chromatin regions of T cells and macrophages. However, whether these variants function in specific cell states is unknown. Here we stimulated T cells and macrophages in the presence of 13 cytokines and profiled active and open chromatin regions. T cell activation induced major chromatin remodeling, while the presence of cytokines fine-tuned the magnitude of changes. We developed a statistical method that accounts for subtle changes in the chromatin landscape to identify SNP enrichment across cell states. Our results point towards the role of immune-disease-associated variants in early rather than late activation of memory CD4+ T cells, with modest differences across cytokines. Furthermore, variants associated with inflammatory bowel disease are enriched in type 1 T helper (TH1) cells, whereas variants associated with Alzheimer's disease are enriched in different macrophage cell states. Our results represent an in-depth analysis of immune-disease-associated variants across a comprehensive panel of activation states of T cells and macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2974108795,"Recent anatomical evidence suggests a functionally significant back-projection pathway from the subiculum to the CA1. Here we show that the afferent circuitry of CA1-projecting subicular neurons is biased by inputs from CA1 inhibitory neurons and the visual cortex, but lacks input from the entorhinal cortex. Efferents of the CA1-projecting subiculum neurons also target the perirhinal cortex, an area strongly implicated in object-place learning. We identify a critical role for CA1-projecting subicular neurons in object-location learning and memory, and show that this projection modulates place-specific activity of CA1 neurons and their responses to displaced objects. Together, these experiments reveal a novel pathway by which cortical inputs, particularly those from the visual cortex, reach the hippocampal output region CA1. Our findings also implicate this circuitry in the formation of complex spatial representations and learning of object-place associations."
https://openalex.org/W2973960665,"Glycolysis plays a central role in producing ATP and biomass. Its control principles, however, remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a method that combines 2H and 13C tracers to determine glycolytic thermodynamics. Using this method, we show that, in conditions and organisms with relatively slow fluxes, multiple steps in glycolysis are near to equilibrium, reflecting spare enzyme capacity. In Escherichia coli, nitrogen or phosphorus upshift rapidly increases the thermodynamic driving force, deploying the spare enzyme capacity to increase flux. Similarly, respiration inhibition in mammalian cells rapidly increases both glycolytic flux and the thermodynamic driving force. The thermodynamic shift allows flux to increase with only small metabolite concentration changes. Finally, we find that the cellulose-degrading anaerobe Clostridium cellulolyticum exhibits slow, near-equilibrium glycolysis due to the use of pyrophosphate rather than ATP for fructose-bisphosphate production, resulting in enhanced per-glucose ATP yield. Thus, near-equilibrium steps of glycolysis promote both rapid flux adaptation and energy efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2974282989,"Hedgehog (HH) ligands, classical morphogens that pattern embryonic tissues in all animals, are covalently coupled to two lipids-a palmitoyl group at the N terminus and a cholesteroyl group at the C terminus. While the palmitoyl group binds and inactivates Patched 1 (PTCH1), the main receptor for HH ligands, the function of the cholesterol modification has remained mysterious. Using structural and biochemical studies, along with reassessment of previous cryo-electron microscopy structures, we find that the C-terminal cholesterol attached to Sonic hedgehog (Shh) binds the first extracellular domain of PTCH1 and promotes its inactivation, thus triggering HH signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations show that this interaction leads to the closure of a tunnel through PTCH1 that serves as the putative conduit for sterol transport. Thus, Shh inactivates PTCH1 by grasping its extracellular domain with two lipidic pincers, the N-terminal palmitate and the C-terminal cholesterol, which are both inserted into the PTCH1 protein core."
https://openalex.org/W2973812625,"Nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are subject to complex regulation to facilitate the recognition of microbial DNA and RNA while limiting the recognition of an organism's own nucleic acids1. Failure to properly regulate these TLRs can lead to autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases2-6. Intracellular localization of these receptors is thought to be crucial for the discrimination between self and non-self7, but the molecular mechanisms that reinforce compartmentalized activation of intracellular TLRs remain poorly understood. Here we describe a mechanism that prevents the activation of TLR9 from locations other than endosomes. This control is achieved through the regulated release of the receptor from its trafficking chaperone UNC93B1, which occurs only within endosomes and is required for ligand binding and signal transduction. Preventing release of TLR9 from UNC93B1, either by mutations in UNC93B1 that increase affinity for TLR9 or through an artificial tether that impairs release, results in defective signalling. Whereas TLR9 and TLR3 are released from UNC93B1, TLR7 does not dissociate from UNC93B1 in endosomes and is regulated by distinct mechanisms. This work defines a checkpoint that reinforces the compartmentalized activation of TLR9, and provides a mechanism by which activation of individual endosomal TLRs may be distinctly regulated."

https://openalex.org/W2975614847,"Oxalate, a ubiquitous compound in many plant-based foods, is absorbed through the intestine and precipitates with calcium in the kidneys to form stones. Over 80% of diagnosed kidney stones are found to be calcium oxalate. People who form these stones often experience a high rate of recurrence and treatment options remain limited despite decades of dedicated research. Recently, the intestinal microbiome has become a new focus for novel therapies. Studies have shown that select species of Lactobacillus, the most commonly included genus in modern probiotic supplements, can degrade oxalate in vitro and even decrease urinary oxalate in animal models of Primary Hyperoxaluria. Although the purported health benefits of Lactobacillus probiotics vary significantly between species, there is supporting evidence for their potential use as probiotics for oxalate diseases. Defining the unique metabolic properties of Lactobacillus is essential to define how these bacteria interact with the host intestine and influence overall health. We addressed this need by characterizing and comparing the metabolome and lipidome of the oxalate-degrading Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. We report many species-specific differences in the metabolic profiles of these Lactobacillus species and discuss potential probiotic relevance and function resulting from their differential expression. Also described is our validation of the oxalate-degrading ability of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri, even in the presence of other preferred carbon sources, measuring in vitro 14C-oxalate consumption via liquid scintillation counting."

https://openalex.org/W2976303951,"Annual soil moisture estimates are useful to characterize trends in the climate system, in the capacity of soils to retain water and for predicting land and atmosphere interactions. The main source of soil moisture spatial information across large areas (e.g., continents) is satellite-based microwave remote sensing. However, satellite soil moisture datasets have coarse spatial resolution (e.g., 25–50 km grids); and large areas from regional-to-global scales have spatial information gaps. We provide an alternative approach to predict soil moisture spatial patterns (and associated uncertainty) with higher spatial resolution across areas where no information is otherwise available. This approach relies on geomorphometry derived terrain parameters and machine learning models to improve the statistical accuracy and the spatial resolution (from 27km to 1km grids) of satellite soil moisture information across the conterminous United States on an annual basis (1991–2016). We derived 15 primary and secondary terrain parameters from a digital elevation model. We trained a machine learning algorithm (i.e., kernel weighted nearest neighbors) for each year. Terrain parameters were used as predictors and annual satellite soil moisture estimates were used to train the models. The explained variance for all models-years was >70% (10-fold cross-validation). The 1km soil moisture grids (compared to the original satellite soil moisture estimates) had higher correlations (improving from r2 = 0.1 to r2 = 0.46) and lower bias (improving from 0.062 to 0.057 m3/m3) with field soil moisture observations from the North American Soil Moisture Database (n = 668 locations with available data between 1991–2013; 0-5cm depth). We conclude that the fusion of geomorphometry methods and satellite soil moisture estimates is useful to increase the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite-derived soil moisture. This approach can be applied to other satellite-derived soil moisture estimates and regions across the world."
https://openalex.org/W2976828099,"The Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt regulates essential biological processes such as cell survival, growth, and metabolism. Upon growth factor stimulation, Akt is phosphorylated at Ser474; however, how this phosphorylation contributes to Akt activation remains controversial. Previous studies, which induced loss of Ser474 phosphorylation by ablating its upstream kinase mTORC2, have implicated Ser474 phosphorylation as a driver of Akt substrate specificity. Here we directly studied the role of Akt2 Ser474 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by preventing Ser474 phosphorylation without perturbing mTORC2 activity. This was achieved by utilizing a chemical genetics approach, where ectopically expressed S474A Akt2 was engineered with a W80A mutation to confer resistance to the Akt inhibitor MK2206, and thus allow its activation independent of endogenous Akt. We found that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of four bona fide Akt substrates (TSC2, PRAS40, FOXO1/3a, and AS160) was reduced by ∼50% in the absence of Ser474 phosphorylation. Accordingly, insulin-stimulated mTORC1 activation, protein synthesis, FOXO nuclear exclusion, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake were attenuated upon loss of Ser474 phosphorylation. We propose a model where Ser474 phosphorylation is required for maximal Akt2 kinase activity in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2975154014,"Bahamian hutias (Geocapromys ingrahami) are the only endemic terrestrial mammal in The Bahamas and are currently classified as a vulnerable species. Drawing on zooarchaeological and new geochemical datasets, this study investigates human management of Bahamian hutias as cultural practice at indigenous Lucayan settlements in The Bahamas and the Turks & Caicos Islands. In order to determine how hutia diet and distribution together were influenced by Lucayan groups we conducted isotopic analysis on native hutia bone and tooth enamel recovered at the Major’s Landing site on Crooked Island in The Bahamas and introduced hutias from the Palmetto Junction site on Providenciales in the Turks & Caicos Islands. Results indicate that some hutias consumed 13C-enriched foods that were either provisioned or available for opportunistic consumption. Strontium isotope ratios for hutia tooth enamel show a narrow range consistent with local origin for all of the archaeological specimens. In contrast, analysis of strontium isotopes in modern Bahamian hutia teeth from animals relocated to Florida from The Bahamas demonstrates that these animals rapidly lost their Bahamian signature and adopted a Florida signature. Therefore, strontium should be used cautiously for determining hutia provenance, particularly for individuals that were translocated between islands. Overall, our findings suggest that ancient human presence did not always result in hutia vulnerability and that the impact to hutia populations was variable across pre-Columbian indigenous settlements."

However, the molecular mechanisms governing the biogenesis and growth of LDs remain poorly understood. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a precursor of phospholipids and triacylglycerols and substrate of CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) synthase 1 (CDS1) and CDS2, which catalyze the formation of CDP-DAG. Here, using siRNA-based gene knockdowns and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts, along with immunological, molecular, and fluorescence microscopy approaches, we examined the role of CDS1 and CDS2 in LD biogenesis and growth. Knockdown of either CDS1 or CDS2 expression resulted in the formation of giant or supersized LDs in cultured mammalian cells. Interestingly, down-regulation of cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC), encoding a prominent regulator of LD growth in adipocytes, restored LD size in CDS1- but not in CDS2-deficient cells. On the other hand, reducing expression of two enzymes responsible for triacylglycerol synthesis, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 4 (GPAT4), rescued the LD phenotype in CDS2-deficient, but not CDS1-deficient, cells. Moreover, CDS2 deficiency, but not CDS1 deficiency, promoted the LD association of DGAT2 and GPAT4 and impaired initial LD maturation.

LDs can be classified into initial LDs (iLDs) and expanding LDs (eLDs) according to their size and stage in life cycle. iLDs are those LDs of 400–800-nm diameter that are formed from the ER. eLDs are converted from iLDs through a maturation/growth process, mediated by specific proteins such as triglyceride synthesis enzymes (12Wilfling F.

Finally, pre-LDs that give rise to iLDs must exist, but these LDs cannot be stained by common neutral lipid dyes, such as BODIPY and LipidTox Deep Red, due to their tiny size and lack of neutral lipids. Thus, markers, such as Livedrop and Hpos, have been artificially made to label these pre-LDs (11Kassan A. Herms A. Fernández-Vidal A. Bosch M. Schieber N.L. Reddy B.J. Fajardo A. Gelabert-Baldrich M.

The size of LDs varies in different tissues and even in the same cell types (1Yang H. Galea A. Sytnyk V. Crossley M. Controlling the size of lipid droplets: lipid and protein factors.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2012; 24 (22726586): 509-51610.1016/j.ceb.2012.05.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). How LDs grow is not fully understood, although lipid transfer from smaller LDs to bigger ones, a process mainly mediated by CIDE family proteins, and increased lipid synthesis are two driving factors. Under specific conditions, CIDE proteins can generate “fusion pores” between LDs and facilitate the transfer of neutral lipids from small to large LDs (18Gong J. Sun Z. Wu L. Xu W. Schieber N. Xu D. Shui G. Yang H. Parton R.G. Li P. Fsp27 promotes lipid droplet growth by lipid exchange and transfer at lipid droplet contact sites.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195 (22144693): 953-96310.1083/jcb.201104142Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). LDs can also grow by locally incorporating lipids. For example, some TAG synthesis enzymes, such as glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3/4 (GPAT3/4) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), may translocate from the ER to LDs to synthesize lipids locally for the expansion of LDs (12Wilfling F.

In addition, phospholipids, such as phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), are also important regulators of LD growth. Giant LDs can be formed when reducing the amount of PC and/or increasing the level of PA (24Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese R.V.

CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) synthase (CDS) enzymes convert PA, the precursor of all phospholipids and TAG synthesis, into CDP-DAG for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin (28Kuchler K. Daum G. Paltauf F. Subcellular and submitochondrial localization of phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165 (3005242): 901-91010.1128/jb.165.3.901-910.1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biochemical function of CDS1 and CDS2 has been characterized, little is known about their involvement in cellular lipid storage (LD formation). In a genome-wide screen, we previously reported that the depletion of CDS1 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells causes the formation of sLDs (15Qi Y. Kapterian T.S. Du X. Ma Q. Fei W. Zhang Y. Huang X. Dawes I.W. Yang H. CDP-diacylglycerol synthases regulate the growth of lipid droplets and adipocyte development.J.

Here, we show that CDS1 and CDS2 control LD growth through distinct mechanisms. We confirmed our previous findings in CDS1 and CDS2 knockdown (KD) cells (Fig. 1, A–D and H), and here, we further extended those observations in CDS1 and CDS2 knockout (KO) cells generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig. 1, E–G), that CDS depletion resulted in sLD formation (15Qi Y. Kapterian T.S. Du X. Ma Q. Fei W. Zhang Y. Huang X. Dawes I.W. Yang H. CDP-diacylglycerol synthases regulate the growth of lipid droplets and adipocyte development.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57 (26946540): 767-78010.1194/jlr.M060574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells with LD diameters larger than 3 μm increased dramatically in the KO cells compared with the KD cells (Fig. 1F). Moreover, the average diameter of three largest LDs per cell in the KO and KD cells increased significantly over the control cells (Fig. 1H). The increase in TAG also became more obvious in CDS2 KO cells (Fig. 1I). With the KO cells, we were able to more accurately examine the rescue effect of CDS1 or CDS2. CDS1 overexpression could restore normal LD morphology in both CDS1- and CDS2-deficient cells. Likewise, CDS2 overexpression could also restore LD morphology in both cells (Fig. 1, J–L). Thus, CDS1 and CDS2 appear to share overlapping functions in relation to regulating LD size. Although CDS1 and CDS2 share certain core functions, it remains a key question as to why mammalian cells have two isoforms of the same enzyme. One possibility is different substrate preferences (29D'Souza K. Kim Y.J. Balla T. Epand R.M. Distinct properties of the two isoforms of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25375833): 7358-736710.1021/bi501250mCrossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and another possibility could be distinct cellular localization. For instance, CDS enzymes were proposed to function at ER–plasma membrane (PM) contact sites during the synthesis and transfer of PI (30Kim Y.J. Guzman-Hernandez M.L. Balla T. A highly dynamic ER-derived phosphatidylinositol-synthesizing organelle supplies phosphoinositides to cellular membranes.Dev.

We therefore carefully examined the localization of CDS1 and CDS2 in relation to the ER, LDs, ER–PM contact sites, and mitochondria using markers of Sec61β (31Cui X.A. Zhang H. Ilan L. Liu A.X. Kharchuk I. Palazzo A.F. mRNA encoding Sec61β, a tail-anchored protein, is localized on the endoplasmic reticulum.J.

Labeling mitochondria with MitoTracker dyes.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2011; 2011 (21807856): 990-99210.1101/pdb.prot5648PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. We found that CDS1 and CDS2 mainly localized to the ER (Fig. S1A, top array), with CDS1 also localizing to mitochondria (Fig. S1A, bottom array). In addition, we also examined the distribution of LDs in CDS KD cells by labeling the ER (DsRed-ER) (Fig. S1B), Golgi (DsRed-Golgi) (Fig. S1C), and mitochondria (MitoTracker Deep Red) (Fig. S1D). Interestingly, the giant LDs in CDS-deficient cells colocalized with mitochondria, especially in CDS1 KD cells (Fig. S1, D and E). These data indicate that the ablation of CDS, especially CDS1, may affect mitochondrial function. Overall, the increase in LD size in CDS1- or CDS2-deficient cells was rather striking, and it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. LD growth can be mediated by CIDE family proteins, including CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC, which mediate lipid transfer from small to large LDs. It is possible that CIDE proteins promote sLD formation in CDS1/2-deficient cells. We first examined the expression of CIDE genes in CDS1/2-deficient cells. Whereas CDS1 KD had minor effects on the mRNA levels of CIDEA, -B, and -C (Fig. S2), CDS1 KO in HeLa cells significantly increased CIDEC mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2, A–C). Interestingly, neither CDS2 KD nor KO had any effects on the expression of CIDE genes (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). We next sought to investigate whether the depletion of CIDE genes (Fig. 2D) has any impacts on LD size in CDS1/2-deficient cells. Down-regulation of CIDE genes almost completely eliminated sLDs in CDS1-deficient cells, where LD size became similar to that of control cells, with silencing CIDEC showing the strongest rescue effect (Fig. 2, E–G). LD size in CDS2-deficient cells was also decreased by down-regulation of CIDE proteins, but remained significantly larger than that of control cells (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, there was a significantly stronger expression of CIDEC protein localizing on LDs in CDS1-deficient cells, but not in CDS2-deficient cells, based on fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2, H–J). Finally, no significant changes were observed in the total TAG level when CIDEC was knocked down in CDS1- or CDS2-deficient cells (Fig. 2K). This indicates that CIDEC regulates the growth of LDs through the fusion-transfer mechanism without affecting TAG metabolism. Together, these data suggest that sLD formation in CDS1-deficient cells mainly results from an enhanced LD fusion event mediated by CIDE proteins, especially CIDEC, whereas sLD formation in CDS2-deficient cells may be driven by different factors. We next sought to understand how sLDs are formed in CDS2-deficient cells. Apart from LD fusion, increased TAG synthesis is another factor that drives LD expansion (1Yang H. Galea A. Sytnyk V.

Enzymes such as DGAT2 and GPAT3/4 can relocate from the ER to LD surface, where they locally synthesize TAG to meet the requirement of LD growth (12Wilfling F. Wang H. Haas J.T. Krahmer N. Gould T.J.

Hence, we first examined the mRNA levels of DGAT1/2 and GPAT3/4 in CDS1/2-deficient cells (Fig. 3, A) and found that CDS1 or CDS2 KD had no effect on the mRNA expression of DGAT1, whereas CDS2 KD significantly increased the mRNA expression of DGAT2. The expression of GPAT3 was dramatically decreased in both CDS1- and CDS2-deficient cells, whereas that of GPAT4 was not affected.

A total of 1,300 bacterial strains were isolated and screened for herbicidal activity against grass and broadleaf weeds. Among primarily selected 102 strains, the herbicidal activity of bacterial fermentation broths from the following three isolates strain-101, strain-128, and strain-329 reduced the growth of D. sanguinalis by 66.7%, 78.3%, and 100%, respectively as compared with control. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing determined that the strain-329 has 99% similarity to Streptomyces anulatus (HBUM 174206). The potential bioherbicidal efficacy of Streptomyces strain-329 was tested on grass and broadleaf weeds for phytotoxic activity through pre- and post-emergence applications. At pre-emergence application, the phytotoxic efficacy to D. sanguinalis and S. bicolor on seed germination were 90.4% and 81.3%, respectively at the 2x concentration, whereas in the case of Solanum nigrum, 85.2% phytotoxic efficacy was observed at the 4x concentration. The efficacy of Streptomyces strain-329 was substantially higher at post-emergence application, presenting 100% control of grass and broadleaf weeds at the 1x concentration. Two herbicidal compounds coded as 329-C1 and 329-C3 were extracted and purified by column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography methods. The active compound 329-C3 slightly increased leaf electrolytic leakage and MDA production as concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that new Streptomyces sp. strain-329 produced bioherbicidal metabolites and may provide a new lead molecule for production an efficient bioherbicide to regulate grass and broadleaf weeds."

Endomucin (EMCN) is an anti-inflammatory membrane glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in venous and capillary endothelial cells. However, the function of EMCN in diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression is still completely unknown. We first investigated the change of EMCN expression in the retina and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. We then overexpressed EMCN in the retina with adeno-associated virus and induced DR with streptozotocin (STZ). We analyzed EMCN's effect on the integrity of endothelial glycocalyx under conditions of DR. Furthermore, we investigated EMCN's protective effect against inflammation and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) destruction. We found that EMCN is specifically expressed in retinal endothelial cells and that its levels are decreased during hyperglycemia in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of EMCN can restore the retinal endothelial glycocalyx of STZ-induced diabetic rats. Furthermore, EMCN overexpression can decrease leukocyte-endothelial adhesion to ameliorate inflammation and stabilize the BRB to inhibit vessel leakage in rats with DR. EMCN may protect patients with diabetes from retinal vascular degeneration by restoring the endothelial glycocalyx. EMCN may thus represent a novel therapeutic strategy for DR because it targets endothelial glycocalyx degradation associated with this disease.-Niu, T., Zhao, M., Jiang, Y., Xing, X., Shi, X., Cheng, L., Jin, H., Liu, K.

https://openalex.org/W2975286349,"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is a microbial process responsible for significant nitrogen loss from the oceans and other ecosystems. The redox reactions at the heart of anammox are catalyzed by large multiheme enzyme complexes that rely on small cytochrome c proteins for electron shuttling. Among the most highly abundant of these cytochromes is a unique heterodimeric complex composed of class I and class II c-type cytochromes called NaxLS, which has distinctive biochemical and spectroscopic properties. Here, we present the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structure of this complex from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis (KsNaxLS). The structure reveals that the heme irons in each subunit exhibit a rare His/Cys ligation, which, as we show by substitution, causes the observed unusual spectral properties. Unlike its individual subunits, the KsNaxLS complex binds nitric oxide (NO) only at the distal heme side, forming 6cNO adducts. This is likely due to steric immobilization of the proximal heme-binding motifs upon complex formation, a finding that may be of functional relevance, because NO is an intermediate in the central anammox metabolism. Pulldown experiments with K. stuttgartiensis cell-free extract showed that the KsNaxLS complex binds specifically to one of the central anammox enzyme complexes, hydrazine synthase, which uses NO as one of its substrates. It is therefore possible that the KsNaxLS complex plays a role in binding the volatile NO to retain it in the cell for transfer to hydrazine synthase.

Indeed, the genome of the anammox model organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis encodes 65 c-type cytochromes that are predicted to be located inside the anammoxosome (10van Niftrik L.

Among the most abundant small cytochrome c proteins in anammox organisms are NaxL (a member of class IIb) and NaxS (class I). In the anammox model organism K. stuttgartiensis, the genes encoding NaxL and NaxS (kusta0087 and kust0088, respectively) show the highest transcription levels of all monoheme c-type cytochromes (3Kartal B.

Previously, the homologues of these proteins from Jettenia caeni were purified as a heterodimeric complex (JcNaxLS) and were partially spectroscopically characterized (12Ukita S. Fujii T. Hira D. Nishiyama T. Kawase T. Migita C.T. Furukawa K. A heterodimeric cytochrome c complex with a very low redox potential from an anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing enrichment culture.FEMS Microbiol.

The UV-visible spectrum of JcNaxLS shows a blue shift of the Soret and α,β absorption peaks upon reduction, whereas other cytochrome c proteins typically show a red shift. Based on this, as well as on the sequence and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data, it was postulated that the heme in each subunit possesses a rare His/Cys ligation (12Ukita S. Fujii T. Hira D. Nishiyama T. Kawase T. Migita C.T. Furukawa K. A heterodimeric cytochrome c complex with a very low redox potential from an anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing enrichment culture.FEMS Microbiol.

Moreover, the NaxLS complex is the first example of a complex between a class I and a class IIb c-type cytochrome. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the NaxLS complex from K. stuttgartiensis (KsNaxLS). We provide a full analysis of the UV-visible spectroscopic properties of KsNaxLS, including the molecular origins of these unusual spectral shifts. We also demonstrate that KsNaxLS binds NO and CO. Importantly, we also show that the KsNaxLS complex interacts specifically with the hydrazine synthase complex, suggesting a function in NO and/or electron transport. KsNaxLS was purified from K. stuttgartiensis as a stable heterodimer (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the recombinantly expressed components KsNaxL and KsNaxS could be reconstituted into a heterodimer in vitro (Fig. 1B). The sedimentation coefficient distribution c(S) of the native KsNaxLS complex obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity (AUC-SV) resulted in a single symmetric peak at 2.7 S (Fig. S1). Using the calculated molecular mass of the KsNaxLS heterodimer (24,397 Da), the maximum possible sedimentation coefficient (i.e. the sedimentation coefficient of a perfectly spherical molecule of the same molecular mass) can be calculated as Smax ≈0.00361 × M2/3. The ratio of this value and the measured sedimentation coefficient corrected to water at 20 °C s20, w and Smax indicates a protein complex with a globular shape (Smax/s20, w = 1.11) (13Erickson H.P. Size and shape of protein molecules at the nanometer level determined by sedimentation, gel filtration, and electron microscopy.Biol. Proced. Online. 2009; 11 (19495910): 32-5110.1007/s12575-009-9008-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient distribution c(S) of the recombinantly produced individual components of the KsNaxLS complex also resulted in single symmetric peaks at 1.8 S and 1.7 S for KsNaxL and KsNaxS, respectively (Fig. S1). The comparison of the measured s20, w values and the maximum possible sedimentation coefficients indicate that the components are globular and monomeric in solution (Smax/s20, w of 1.17 and 1.14 for KsNaxL and KsNaxS, respectively). AUC-SV of the reconstituted KsNaxLS complex from its overexpressed subunits (both with C-terminal His6-tags) resulted in a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S (s20, w of 2.78 S), which is also consistent with a heterodimeric complex of the NaxL and NaxS components with a Smax/s20, w ratio of 1.16. AUC-SE of the native KsNaxLS complex resulted in a molecular mass of 23.9 kDa, which also corresponds well to the calculated value for the heterodimer (24.4 kDa) (Fig. S2). An analysis of the native KsNaxLS complex and its reconstitution from heterologously expressed components by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) is shown in Fig. 1B. The size-exclusion chromatograms of KsNaxLS and its component KsNaxL all showed single peaks at elution volumes of 11.9 and 13.1 ml, respectively. MALS analysis resulted in 20.4 and 13.4 kDa for the KsNaxLS complex and KsNaxL, respectively. When the KsNaxL and KsNaxS components were mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio, they could be reconstituted into a stable complex, with the excess of KsNaxL remaining in a monomeric state. MALS analysis of the reconstituted complex resulted in a molecular mass of 22.8 kDa. The results of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Fig. S3) are also consistent with a KsNaxLS heterodimer; the radius of gyration as determined by Guinier analysis (Fig. S3B) was 19.9 Å (using data between 0.58 < qRg <1.30), which is close to the value of 17.2 Å calculated from the crystal structure (see below). The Porod volume is 39,880 Å3, which when multiplied by 0.625 (14Petoukhov M.V. Franke D. Shkumatov A.V. Tria G. Kikhney A.G. Gajda M. Gorba C. Mertens H.D. Konarev P.V. Svergun D.I.

Moreover, a dummy-atom reconstruction reproduces the overall dimensions of the complex observed in the crystal (see below) (Fig. S3). The 1.7 Å resolution X-ray structure of the WT, natively purified KsNaxLS complex, contains a heterodimer consisting of one KsNaxL and one KsNaxS subunit in the asymmetric unit. The molecular shape of the complex is somewhat elongated and resembles a pointing hand (Fig. 2), where the KsNaxL subunit forms the pointing finger(s) and KsNaxS the rest of the hand. The KsNaxL subunit forms a four-helix bundle, which is a typical characteristic of class II c-type cytochromes. KsNaxS possesses a class I cytochrome c-fold consisting of six α-helices. The contact surface area between the two subunits is 2120 Å2 (out of the total surface area of the complex of 10,950 Å2); it is formed by the regions Asp-82 to Tyr-92 and Arg-115 to Thr-129 of KsNaxL as well as Glu-29 to Gly-61 and Val-119 to Lys-126 of KsNaxS. The c-type heme moieties of KsNaxL and KsNaxS are 19 Å apart in the complex (using the edge–to–edge distance (15Moser C.C. Chobot S.E. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Distance metrics for heme protein electron tunneling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777 (18471429): 1032-103710.1016/j.bbabio.2008.04.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), and both are hexa-coordinated, with histidines serving as the proximal ligands (i.e. located on the side of the CXXC heme-binding motif), although cysteine residues, rarely acting as heme ligands in other c-type cytochromes, serve as the distal ligands (i.e. on the opposite side, Fig. 3, A and B). The distances between the heme iron and histidine Nɛ atoms are 2.0 Å in both KsNaxL and KsNaxS, and the heme-iron–to–cysteine–sulfur distances are 2.4 Å in both subunits. As expected for a class II c-type cytochrome, the heme-binding motif (120CRNCH124) in KsNaxL is located near the C terminus of the protein sequence, whereas the distal cysteine (Cys-32) ligand originates from the N-terminal part. The opposite is the case in KsNaxS where the heme-binding motif (54CYYCH58) is located close to the N terminus and the distal cysteine ligand (Cys-101) is located close to the C terminus, as is the case in other class I c-type cytochromes. The distal environment of the heme in KsNaxL is amphipathic, with several hydrophilic residues such as Gln-28, Ser-73, and Asn-7 at the side of the B and C pyrrole rings. Together with a solvent molecule, these residues form a hydrogen-bonding network. Interestingly, the Gln-28 Nɛ atom is within hydrogen-bonding distance (3.1 Å) of the iron-coordinating Sγ atom of Cys-32. The opposite side (above the A and B pyrrole rings) contains hydrophobic residues such as Met-35, Trp-36, and Val-70. The environment at the proximal face of the NaxL heme is mainly hydrophobic, containing residues such as Leu-133, Val-134, and the terminal Pro-135 residue (Fig. 3A). The heme environment in KsNaxS is distinctly hydrophobic, being made up of several aromatic amino acids (such as Tyr-43, Phe-71, Phe-76, Phe-81, and Tyr-104) as well as other hydrophobic residues, e.g. Met-35, Val-73, and Ile-94 at both distal and proximal sides. Interestingly, the iron-coordinating Sγ of the distal Cys-101 is within hydrogen-bonding distance (3.1 Å) of the Nɛ atom of His-93 (Fig. 3B). Because cysteine as a distal heme ligand is relatively rare, we made several mutants for structural and spectroscopic investigations by replacing one or both distal cysteines with either methionine or glycine. Of these, mutants KsNaxL C32G/NaxS WT and KsNaxL C32M/NaxS C101M formed crystals, and we determined their X-ray crystal structures to 2.0 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively, to assess the mutations' impact on the overall structure and heme environment. For the most part, there are no major structural differences between WT and mutant KsNaxLS complexes, and the cysteine–to–methionine mutations resulted in the methionine coordinating the heme iron as expected. Only the mutation of Cys-32 to methionine in KsNaxL caused some larger-scale structural effects: Gln-28 moves away from the heme, destroying the hydrogen bond network with Ser-73 and Asn-7 (Fig. 4A), which results in helix α1 moving outward compared with the situation in the WT. This in turn allows residues 33–38 on the opposite helix to move slightly inward, with the side chain of Met-35 adopting a more stretched-out conformation than in the WT protein. Other than that, the mutations cause local changes only. In the KsNaxL C32G/NaxS WT crystal structure, a water molecule acts as a sixth heme ligand, which is within hydrogen-bonding distance from Gln-28 (Fig. S4). Moreover, upon mutation of Cys-101 to methionine in KsNaxS, His-93 rotates away causing the formation of a hydrogen bond with one of the propionate groups of the heme (Fig. 4B). The heterologously expressed KsNaxLS complex and its components were reddish brown. In all proteins (from which His-tags were removed), the Soret band in the as-isolated state was found to be located at 419–420 nm (Fig. 5, A–C). Upon reduction with 0.5 mm Ti(III)citrate, the Soret band showed a clear blue shift and the typical α- and β-bands appeared at 553 nm (551 nm for KsNaxL and KsNaxS) and 523 nm (521 nm for KsNaxL and 522 nm for KsNaxS), respectively (Fig. 5, A–C). Interestingly, when Ti(III)-reduced KsNaxLS and it constituents were re-oxidized by sparging the sample with 1–2 ml of air, the Soret band further blue-shifted to 412 nm with simultaneous disappearance of α- and β-bands. Re-oxidation with 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, however, resulted in a red shift of the Soret bands back to 420 nm for KsNaxLS and its constituent KsNaxL and to 419 nm for KsNaxS (Fig. 6, A–C). UV-visible spectra of different distal-cysteine–to–methionine mutants (with His-tags) in their as-isolated state as well as after reduction with 0.5 mm Ti(III)citrate are shown in Fig. 5, D–F. The Soret bands of the as-isolated states of all these mutants were located around 413–415 nm. Upon reduction with Ti(III)citrate, a red shift of the Soret band to 417–418 nm was observed in these mutants, with concomitant appearance of α- and β-bands at around 553 and 523 nm (Fig. 5, D–F). The double methionine mutant KsNaxL C32M/NaxS C101M was apparently isolated in a partially reduced state given the presence of weak α- and β-bands (Fig. 5D). The Soret peaks shifted back to around 408–414 nm upon re-oxidation by sparging with air (except for the mutant KsNaxL WT/NaxS C101M, which has a Soret maximum at 416 nm in the re-oxidized state, Fig. 6, D–F). Moreover, after full reduction the re-oxidation by air of this mutant took more than 1 h, and it resulted in a noticeable decrease in intensity of the α- and β-bands. Although the mutant KsNaxL WT/NaxS C101G (Fig. S5) appeared to be in a completely oxidized state after purification, re-oxidation after full reduction yielded still partially reduced species as evident from minor α- and β-bands (in this case the spectra were measured immediately after sparging with air). Conversely, the single mutant KsNaxL C32G/NaxS WT (Fig. S5), which was isolated in its oxidized state, was immediately fully re-oxidized by air starting from the completely reduced state. Spectropotentiometric measurements with KsNaxLS in an optically transparent thin-layer electrochemical cell resulted in irreversible reactions at the working electrode. Ti(III)-reduced KsNaxLS was therefore titrated with ferricyanide under anoxic conditions while monitoring the redox potential and UV-visible spectrum. The absorption at 417 nm showed a single, sharp transition during titration between −300 and +50 mV versus SHE, from which a redox potential of −175 mV versus SHE could be extracted by fitting with the Nernst equation assuming a 2-electron transition (Fig. 7). Nearly identical results were obtained at absorption wavelengths of 552 and 454 nm. Redox potentials much lower than −300 mV or much higher than +50 mV versus SHE could not be reached without using amounts of reducing/oxidizing agents that resulted in protein aggregation. The KsNaxLS complex and its components were tested for their ability to bind several small molecule ligands such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydroxylamine (NH2OH), hydrazine (N2H4), nitrite (NO2−), azide (N3−), and cyanide (CN−). Of these ligands, NO and CO were found to coordinate to the c-type hemes in the KsNaxLS complex as judged by UV-visible spectroscopy. When non-His–tagged, reduced KsNaxLS was incubated with NO, the Soret band decreased in intensity and shifted from 417 to 415 nm, and the intensity of the α- and β-bands decreased, too (Fig. 8A). These latter bands did not, however, disappear completely. With His-tagged protein, the Soret intensity only decreased slightly, pointing to an effect of the presence of the His-tag on the NO-binding properties of the protein (Fig. 8B). The individual recombinantly-produced components of the complex displayed much larger spectral changes upon NO exposure. Upon incubation with NO, Ti(III)-reduced KsNaxL showed a prominent shift of the Soret band to ∼395 nm and formation of a shoulder at ∼416 nm indicating coordination of the nitrosyl ligand to the heme iron (Fig. 8C). In reduced KsNaxS, the Soret band shifted to 415 nm with formation of a shoulder at 396 nm (Fig. 8D). Titration of reduced KsNaxLS complex with NO, monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy, indicated a dissociation constant (Kd) for NO of ∼12 μm (Fig. 8E). When WT KsNaxLS as isolated from Kuenenia biomass was exposed to NO, the Soret band increased in intensity and showed a blue shift from 420 to 417 nm (Fig. S6A). With the recombinantly-produced His-tagged KsNaxLS protein, exposure to NO resulted in a much smaller increase in intensity of the Soret peak, although its position showed a clear blue shift from 419 to 417 nm (Fig. S6B). Thus, in both the reduced and as-isolated states, a difference in behavior toward NO was observed between His-tagged and non-His–tagged protein. At present, it is not clear what causes this difference in behavior. Titration of as-isolated KsNaxLS complex with NO followed by UV-visible spectroscopy did not allow the Kd value to be determined, as no saturation of any spectral feature could be reached using final NO concentrations up to 1 mm. This points to a low affinity with a Kd in the millimolar range or higher in the as-isolated state. Upon exposure to CO, the Soret bands of the reduced states of the KsNaxLS complex and its components sharpened and increased in their intensities (Fig. S7). The Soret band shifted from 417 to 415–416 nm for the recombinant KsNaxLS complex, as well as its subunits. Moreover, in all cases two broad bands around 540 and 570 nm appeared, replacing the α- and β-bands. The KsNaxLS complex (with a C-terminal His-tag on KsNaxS), individual KsNaxL and KsNaxS, as well as Kustc0563, another highly-expressed small cytochrome c from Kuenenia, were used as “bait” proteins in a pulldown assay. To this end, they were bound to Ni-IDA beads, which were then incubated with a cell-free extract of K. stuttgartiensis. After elution, SDS-PAGE (Fig. 9) followed by mass spectrometric analyses of the co-eluted proteins bands showed that only the KsNaxLS complex was able to pull down all three subunits of the HZS complex. In addition, a protein band at around 200 kDa appeared in all lanes when lysate was used. Peptide mass fingerprinting showed that this band belongs to KsHDH (6Maalcke W.J. Reimann J. de Vries S.

However, KsHDH was most likely bound nonspecifically, as it was also bound to the Ni-IDA beads without any bait protein.

Similar results were obtained when immobilized bait proteins were incubated with purified HZS protein solution. The crystal structure of KsNaxLS at 1.7 Å resolution provides the first molecular model of a complex between class I and class II c-type cytochromes. Moreover, based on its hexa-coordinated heme iron along with its four-helix bundle fold, NaxL can be assigned to subclass IIb of monoheme c-type cytochromes (11Ambler R.

https://openalex.org/W2973957921,"Chimpanzees hunt cooperatively in the wild, but the factors influencing food sharing after the hunt are not well understood. In an experimental study, groups of three captive chimpanzees obtained a monopolizable food resource, either via two individuals cooperating (with the third as bystander) or via one individual acting alone alongside two bystanders. The individual that obtained the resource first retained most of the food but the other two individuals attempted to obtain food from the ""captor"" by begging. We found the main predictor of the overall amount of food obtained by bystanders was proximity to the food at the moment it was obtained by the captor. Whether or not an individual had cooperated to obtain the food had no effect. Interestingly, however, cooperators begged more from captors than did bystanders, suggesting that they were more motivated or had a greater expectation to obtain food. These results suggest that while chimpanzee captors in cooperative hunting may not reward cooperative participation directly, cooperators may influence sharing behavior through increased begging."

https://openalex.org/W2975924285,"Introduction The shoulder, a very complex joint, offers a wide range of pathologies. Intraarticular abnormalities and rotator cuff injuries are mainly assessed and diagnosed by magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA). In contrast to this well-established gold standard, high-resolution ultrasound (US) offers an additional easy and excellent modality to assess the shoulder joint. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate in which anatomic structures and pathologies comparable results of US and MRA could be achieved. Materials and methods In this IRB-approved prospective study 67 patients with clinically suspected labral lesions, rotator cuff rupture, or injury of the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon were enrolled. Each participant was examined with high resolution US, and directly followed by MRA at 3 Tesla with a standard sequence protocol. To evaluate the agreement of the diagnostic performance between US and MRA a weighted kappa statistic was used. Results Both of the investigated modalities yielded a moderate to almost perfect agreement in assessing a wide range of shoulder joint pathologies. For the rotator cuff, consistency was found in 71.64% for the supraspinatus tendon, in 95.52% for the infraspinatus tendon, in 83.58% for the subscapularis tendon, and in 98.51% for the teres minor tendon. The diagnostic accuracy between both modalities was 80.60% for the LHB tendon, 77.61% for the posterior labroligamentous complex, 83.58% for the acromioclavicular joint, and 91.04% for the assessment of osseous irregularities and impaction fractures. Conclusions High resolution US is a reliable imaging modality for the rotator cuff, the LHB tendon, and the acromioclavicular joint, so for these structures we recommend a preference for US over MRA based on its diagnostic accuracy, comfortability, cost effectiveness, and availability. If the diagnosis remains elusive, for all other intraarticular structures we recommend MRA for further diagnostic assessment."

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out with perimenopausal women aged 40–59 years community-dwelling from Mexico City, Mexico. They participated in Menopause and Oxidative Stress Project. The baseline sample consisted of 476 women recruited to participate; 161 women were excluded due to different reasons. Hence, 315 women were selected to establish two groups, a) 145 premenopausal women (yet with menstrual bleeding), and b) 170 postmenopausal women (without menses). All women were free of cardiovascular, kidney, hepatic or cancer disease, and without antioxidant supplement intake for at least six months prior to the beginning of the study; none had previously received hormone therapy. As OS markers, we measured plasma malondialdehyde using the TBARS assay, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), uric acid, and total antioxidant status; also, we calculated SOD/GPx ratio, antioxidant gap and an oxidative stress score ranging from 0 to 7. The HFs were evaluated using the Menopause Rating Scale. The women completed Spanish version of the Athens Insomnia Scale, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and a questionnaire of pro-oxidant factors. Results Stress score increased with HFs severity (mild 2.7±0.17, moderate 2.9±0.20 and severe 3.7±0.20, p = 0.001) in postmenopausal women. We observed a positive correlation between HFs severity and stress score, r = 0.247 (p = 0.001) in postmenopausal women; other test scores were not correlated. Severe HFs were a risk factor for OS (OR = 5.12, 95%CI: 1.99–13.17, p<0.05) in an adjusted multivariate analysis by different postmenopausal symptoms and pro-oxidant factors; we did not see any association in premenopausal women. Conclusion Our findings suggest an association between HFs severity and OS in Mexican postmenopausal women."

We performed the genetic assessment of 637 patients with suspected HBOC. The region corresponding to the breakpoints for the 9–12 del BRCA1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An analysis of the clinical data of the carriers and non-carriers was done, searching for characteristics that correlated with the deletion. The 9–12 del BRCA1 was detected in 5% of patients with suspected HBOC (30/637). In patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer, 13 of 30 were 9–12 del BRCA1 carriers, which represents 43%. We found a significant association between the 9–12 del BRCA1 carriers with triple negative breast cancer and high-grade papillary serous ovarian cancer. We concluded that the detection of the 9–12 del BRCA1 is useful as a first molecular diagnostic strategy in the Mexican population.

We identified six allelic variants in the Mtor promoter region in BALB/cAnPt and DBA/2N mice. To determine the effects of these variants on Mtor transcription, we constructed a series of luciferase reporters containing these promoter variants and transfected them into mouse plasmacytoma cells. We could attribute the differences in Mtor promoter activity between the two mouse strains to a C → T change at the −6 position relative to the transcriptional start site Tssr 40273; a T at this position in the BALB promoter creates a consensus binding site for the transcription factor MZF1 (myeloid zinc finger 1).

https://openalex.org/W2975297399,"Complement factor B/C2 family (Bf/C2F) proteins are core complement system components in vertebrates that are absent in invertebrates and have been lost by numerous species, raising evolutionary questions. At least 3 duplication events have occurred from Cnidaria (ancestor) to mammals. Type II Bf/C2 genes appeared during separation of Proterostomia and Deuterostomes. The second event occurred during separation of vertebrates and invertebrates, yielding type II-2 Bf/C2. The third event occurred when jawed and jawless fish were separated, eventually producing Bf and C2 genes. Herein, we report the second mollusc Sinonovacula constricta Bf/C2-type gene (ScBf). ScBf is similar to Ruditapes decussatus Bf-like because both lack the first complement control protein module at the N terminus present in mammalian Bf/C2 proteins. Uniquely, the Ser protease (SP) module at the C terminus of ScBf is ∼50 aa longer than in other complement factor B/C2-type (Bf/C2T) proteins, and is Glu-rich. Bf/C2T proteins in molluscs lack the catalytic Ser in the SP module. Surprisingly, ScBf regulates rabbit erythrocyte agglutination, during which it is localized on the erythrocyte surface. Thus, ScBf may mediate the agglutination cascade and may be an upstream regulator of this process.

Halophytes are specialized plants that have the ability to complete their life cycle in saline environments.

Using RNA-seq data we have analyzed the expression patterns of certain TF families, predicted protein-protein interactions, and analyzed evolutionary trajectories to elucidate their possible roles in salt tolerance. We have detected the top differentially expressed (DE) transcription factor families (MYB, CAMTA, MADS-box and bZIP) that show the most pronounced response to salinity. The majority of DE genes in the four aforementioned TF families cluster together on TF phylogenetic trees, which suggests common evolutionary origins and trajectories. This research represents the first comprehensive TF study of a leaf succulent halophyte including their evolutionary relationships with TFs in other halophyte and salt-senstive plants.

Antimicrobial resistance and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of S. Enteritidis clinical isolates were detected by micro broth dilution method against ten classes 16 antimicrobial agents, and molecular genotyping were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). All (100%) isolates showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial. Resistance to nalidixic acid (98.7%) was the highest, followed by sulfamethoxazole (87.3%) and ampicillin (77.2%). The majority of isolates (92.4%) showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to the third and fourth-generation cephalosporins was observed. Twenty-six AMR profiles were observed, and the predominant AMR profile was ampicillin-streptomycin-sulfamethoxazole-amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-nalidixic acid. A high burden of multidrug resistance (MDR) (81.0%) was found. Seventy-nine S. Enteritidis isolates were divided into 33 different pulsotypes (PTs), and the most frequent PT was PT18. Twenty-six different MLVA types (MTs) were generated with seven VNTR loci analysis of these isolates. The dominant PTs and MTs were persistent during 2011–2016. S. Enteritidis clinical isolates showed higher genetic diversity using PFGE combined with MLVA grouped into 60 PT-MT genotypes. No correlation was observed between genotypes, AMR profiles and geographic location. These data revealed the characteristics of AMR and molecular genotyping of S.

These results highlight that strengthening the AMR and molecular genotyping surveillance is essential to prevent and control salmonellosis in Guizhou. PFGE combined with MLVA should be powerful tools for the molecular genotyping of S. Enteritidis isolates."

However, evidenced-based suicide-prevention psychological treatments are rarely available on in-patient wards. Understanding staff engagement with research investigating suicide-prevention psychological treatments is crucial for their effective, efficacious, and pragmatic implementation. A pilot randomised control trial and feasibility study of Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy provided the opportunity for a qualitative investigation of staff experiences and views of a psychological intervention for people with suicidal experiences on psychiatric in-patient wards.To investigate staff acceptability of Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy for psychiatric inpatients based on their perceptions of their experiences during the conduct of a clinical trial.Transcribed audio-recordings of qualitative interviews and a focus group (n = 19) of purposively sampled staff from eight psychiatric wards were analysed using inductive Thematic Analysis.Facilitators and barriers were identified for: i) the conduct of the research, and, ii) the suicide-prevention intervention (Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy). Research-related barriers comprised communication difficulties between staff and researchers, and increased staff workload. Research-related facilitators included effective staff/researcher relationships, and alignment of the intervention with organisational goals. Suicide-prevention intervention-related barriers comprised staffs' negative beliefs about suicide which impacted on their referral of inpatients to the clinical trial, and staff perceptions of insufficient information and unfulfilled expectations for involvement in the therapy. Facilitators included staff beliefs that the therapy was beneficial for inpatients, the service and their own clinical practice.Staff beliefs that 'suicide-talk' could precipitate suicidal behaviour resulted in covert gatekeeping and restricted referral of only inpatients judged as stable or likely to engage in therapy, which may not be those who could most benefit. Such threats to sample representativeness have implications for future therapy research design. The findings provide novel information for researchers and practitioners regarding the conduct of psychological treatment and research in psychiatric units."
https://openalex.org/W2976994820,"The improved split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was used to study the dynamic mechanical properties and failure characteristics of surrounding rock in deep rock mass engineering that is under high stress and affected by blasting excavation and other dynamic disturbances. In a three-dimensional high static load and frequent dynamic disturbance test, the preload high axial pressure and confining pressure are used to simulate the high crustal stress of deep rock, and the effect of small disturbances on the rock is simulated by the low impact load. The results show that there are two types of dynamic stress-strain curves of deep rock: an elastic-plastic curve and plastic-elastic-plastic curve. The curves consists of five parts: the compaction stage, micro-crack steady development stage, micro-crack unstable propagation stage, fatigue damage stage, and fatigue failure stage. Reductive phenomena of constringent strain after dynamic peak stress appear because of the different degrees of rock damage. Moreover, these phenomena include two conditions, namely, whether rebound occurs or not. The impact resistance of rock is strongest when the ratio of the confining pressure to axial pressure is optimal, and the dynamic average strength of rock and accumulative impact times decrease with the increase of the preloaded axial compression and increase with the increase of the preloaded confining pressure. Both the dynamic deformation modulus and dynamic peak stress decrease with the increase of the accumulative impact time, while the maximum strain and the dynamic peak strain increase. The corresponding rebound strain as a whole first increases and then decreases with the increasing impact times. For deep rock, tensile failure and single-bevel plane shear failure are the main failure modes, and pull-compression mixed friction failure is the auxiliary failure mode. Additionally, the lumpiness of broken rock decreases with the increase of the preloaded axial compression and increases with the increase of the preloaded confining pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2975291216,"Motorcyclists are involved in an exceptionally high number of crashes for the distance they travel, with one of the most common incidents being where another road user pulls out into the path of an oncoming motorcycle frequently resulting in a fatal collision. These instances have previously been interpreted as failures of visual attention, sometimes termed ‘Look but Fail to See’ (LBFTS) crashes, and interventions have focused on improving drivers’ visual scanning and motorcycles’ visibility. Here we show from a series of three experiments in a high-fidelity driving simulator, that when drivers’ visual attention towards and memory for approaching vehicles is experimentally tested, drivers fail to report approaching motorcycles on between 13% and 18% of occasions. This happens even when the driver is pulling out into a safety-critical gap in front of the motorcycle, and often happens despite the driver having directly fixated on the oncoming vehicle. These failures in reporting a critical vehicle were not associated with how long the driver looked at the vehicle for, but were associated with drivers’ subsequent visual search and the time that elapsed between fixating on the oncoming vehicle and pulling out of the junction. Here, we raise the possibility that interference in short-term memory might prevent drivers holding important visual information during these complex manoeuvres. This explanation suggests that some junction crashes on real roads that have been attributed to LBFTS errors may have been misclassified and might instead be the result of ‘Saw but Forgot’ (SBF) errors. We provide a framework for understanding the role of short-term memory in such situations, the Perceive Retain Choose (PRC) model, as well as novel predictions and proposals for practical interventions that may prevent this type of crash in the future."

We investigated the role of Axl as a specific regulator of chemokines and cell adhesion molecule in the distribution of intestinal γδ T cells. The population of γδ T-cell receptor-positive cells including Vγ1 and Vγ7 subsets was remarkably increased in the intraepithelial lymphocytes of Axl-/- mice compared with those of wild-type (WT) mice. An increased number of migrated γδ T cells were observed in the coculture with intraepithelial cells from Axl-/- mice. The mRNA expression level of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 25 was specifically higher in the small intestine of Axl-/- mice than in WT mice. In adoptive transfer, the migration of both thymic and extrathymic γδ T cells was increased in Axl-/- mice. The activation of Axl signaling down-regulated CCL25 expression via ERK signaling pathway and reduced the population of γδ T cells. Systemic dissemination was suppressed in Axl-/- mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium. Thus, our findings suggest that Axl plays a critical role in regulating the migration of γδ T cells for the maintenance of homeostasis and bacterial resistance.-Kim, S.-M., Park, M., Yee, S.-M., Ji, K.-Y., Lee, E.-H., Nguyen, T.-V., Nguyen, T.

However, the existence of association between OSEM and circadian misalignment has not been investigated in this population. Therefore, this study investigated whether shift work, sleep time and social jetlag (SJL) are associated with biochemical and hematological variables. A population consisting of 79 men working at night (n = 37) or during the day (n = 42), aged between 21 and 65 years and with a mean BMI of 27.56 ± 4.0 kg/m2, was investigated cross-sectionally in relation to sleep time, SJL, anthropometric (height, weight and waist circumference) and blood variables, with emphasis on the OSEM. SJL was calculated by the absolute difference between the midpoint of sleep on work and rest days. The Generalized Linear Model (GzLM) was used to investigate the existence of associations between SJL and average sleep time in relation to the analyzed variables. Workers without SJL presented lower baseline lysis values of erythrocytes in isotonic medium in relation to workers with SJL. In addition, workers who slept on average less than 6 hours had higher OSEM, and higher total and LDL-cholesterol in relation to those who slept more than 6 hours, regardless of the shift. It is possible that the association of sleep deprivation and SJL with erythrocyte membrane stability is mediated through changes in the lipid profile."
https://openalex.org/W2975807977,"The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are required for normal eukaryotic cellular functions. However, the minimum requirement for polyamines varies widely, ranging from very high concentrations (mm) in mammalian cells to extremely low in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast strains deficient in polyamine biosynthesis (spe1Δ, lacking ornithine decarboxylase, and spe2Δ, lacking SAM decarboxylase) require externally supplied polyamines, but supplementation with as little as 10−8 m spermidine restores their growth. Here, we report that culturing a spe1Δ mutant or a spe2Δ mutant in a standard polyamine-free minimal medium (SDC) leads to marked increases in cellular Mg2+ content. To determine which yeast Mg2+ transporter mediated this increase, we generated mutant strains with a deletion of SPE1 or SPE2 combined with a deletion of one of the three Mg2+ transporter genes, ALR1, ALR2, and MNR2, known to maintain cytosolic Mg2+ concentration. Neither Alr2 nor Mnr2 was required for increased Mg2+ accumulation, as all four double mutants (spe1Δ alr2Δ, spe2Δ alr2Δ, spe1Δ mnr2Δ, and spe2Δ mnr2Δ) exhibited significant Mg2+ accumulation upon polyamine depletion. In contrast, a spe2Δ alr1Δ double mutant cultured in SDC exhibited little increase in Mg2+ content and displayed severe growth defects compared with single mutants alr1Δ and spe2Δ under polyamine-deficient conditions. These findings indicate that Alr1 is required for the up-regulation of the Mg2+ content in polyamine-depleted cells and suggest that elevated Mg2+ can support growth of polyamine-deficient S. cerevisiae mutants. Up-regulation of cellular polyamine content in a Mg2+-deficient alr1Δ mutant provided further evidence for a cross-talk between Mg2+ and polyamine metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2975116386,"Background Determine TB-LAM Ag (LAM) is a point of care test developed to diagnose tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of LAM in people living with HIV using Brazilian public health network algorithm for TB diagnosis. Methods and findings A cross-sectional study design was used to enroll 199 adult patients in two sites in Rio de Janeiro and two in São Paulo. The study enrolled HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts ≤200 cells/mm3 (in the Alere PIMA CD4 assay at study screening), patients coughing for at least 2 weeks or presenting a chest radiography suggestive of TB. LAM, in conjunction with sputum smear microscopy or Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) as compared to Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, which was used as a reference standard. TB prevalence was 24.6%. Overall accuracy of LAM was 79.9% (73.8%-84.9%), positive and negative predictive values were 62.2% (46.1%-75.9%) and 84% (77.5%-88.8%), respectively. The overall LAM sensitivity was 46.9% (33.7%-60.6%) and specificity was 90.7% (84.9%-94.4%). The best performance of LAM was observed among patients with CD4 counts ≤50 cells/mm3 (sensitivity = 70.4% and specificity = 85.9%). When 2 respiratory smears were used in conjunction with LAM, sensitivity increased 22%, as compared to just 2 smears. Furthermore, LAM when used in conjunction with two respiratory smears, was as sensitive as compared to a single one. However, no improvement in TB diagnosis occurred when LAM was used with Xpert as compared to Xpert alone. Among 14 LAM false positive tests, Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria were isolated in three cases. Conclusion LAM is a point of care test that increased TB diagnosis in immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients when used in conjunction with smear microscopy, but not when used with Xpert in Brazilian public health network sites. Use of LAM test should be considered in settings where immunosuppressed HIV patients need rapid TB diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2975017852,"Quantitative MRI methods have recently gained extensive interest and are seeing substantial developments; however, their application in single patient vs control group comparisons is often limited by inherent statistical difficulties. One such application is detecting malformations of cortical development (MCDs) behind drug resistant epilepsies, a task that, especially when based solely on conventional MR images, may represent a serious challenge. We aimed to develop a novel straightforward voxel-wise evaluation method based on the Mahalanobis-distance, combining quantitative MRI data into a multidimensional parameter space and detecting lesion voxels as outliers. Simulations with standard multivariate Gaussian distribution and resampled DTI-eigenvalue data of 45 healthy control subjects determined the optimal critical value, cluster size threshold, and the expectable lesion detection performance through ROC-analyses. To reduce the effect of false positives emanating from registration artefacts and gyrification differences, an automatic classification method was applied, fine-tuned using a leave-one-out strategy based on diffusion and T1-weighted data of the controls. DWI processing, including thorough corrections and robust tensor fitting was performed with ExploreDTI, spatial coregistration was achieved with the DARTEL tools of SPM12. Additional to simulations, clusters of outlying diffusion profile, concordant with neuroradiological evaluation and independent calculations with the MAP07 toolbox were identified in 12 cases of a 13 patient example population with various types of MCDs. The multidimensional approach proved sufficiently sensitive in pinpointing regions of abnormal tissue microstructure using DTI data both in simulations and in the heterogeneous example population. Inherent limitations posed by registration artefacts, age-related differences, and the different or mixed pathologies limit the generalization of specificity estimation. Nevertheless, the proposed statistical method may aid the everyday examination of individual subjects, ever so more upon extending the framework with quantitative information from other modalities, e.g. susceptibility mapping, relaxometry, or perfusion."
