https://openalex.org/W1966155655,"Long-term memories for motor skill tasks are associated with enhanced synaptic efficacy in the motor cortex. Here, rapid structural responses in individual neurons are revealed to potentially underlie motor learning skill retention. In experiments in which mice were trained to perform a reaching task, new neuronal spines were selectively stabilized within hours, with different spines/putative synapse sets encoding distinct learned motor skills. These stabilized morphological changes are proposed to act as a motor memory substrate. The learning of novel motor skills through repetitive practice is associated with enhanced synaptic efficacy in the motor cortex. However, how motor learning affects neuronal circuitry at the level of individual synapses and how long-lasting memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain remain unknown. Synaptic connections in the living mouse brain are now shown to respond to motor-skill learning and permanently rewire; this could be the foundation of durable motor memory. Novel motor skills are learned through repetitive practice and, once acquired, persist long after training stops1,2. Earlier studies have shown that such learning induces an increase in the efficacy of synapses in the primary motor cortex, the persistence of which is associated with retention of the task3,4,5. However, how motor learning affects neuronal circuitry at the level of individual synapses and how long-lasting memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain remain unknown. Here we show that synaptic connections in the living mouse brain rapidly respond to motor-skill learning and permanently rewire. Training in a forelimb reaching task leads to rapid (within an hour) formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in the contralateral motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops. Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets of synapses. Practice of novel, but not previously learned, tasks further promotes dendritic spine formation in adulthood. Our findings reveal that rapid, but long-lasting, synaptic reorganization is closely associated with motor learning. The data also suggest that stabilized neuronal connections are the foundation of durable motor memory."
https://openalex.org/W1979019425,"Connections between neurons are thought to be remodelled when we learn new tasks or acquire new information. However, this plasticity must also occur against a backdrop of stable memory maintenance. In mice, a paradigm of either enhanced sensory experience or specific motor learning produced new putative neuronal connections that remained stable alongside developmentally preserved connections much later in life. This suggests that learning can produce changes in the neuronal connectivity that can be stable for the lifetime of the network. Connections between neurons are thought to be remodelled when we learn new tasks or acquire new information; however, it is unclear how neural circuits undergo continuous synaptic changes during learning while maintaining lifelong memories. Here, by following post-synaptic dendritic spines in the mouse cortex, it is shown that a small fraction of new spines induced by novel experience are preserved and provide a structural basis for lifelong memory retention. Changes in synaptic connections are considered essential for learning and memory formation1,2,3,4,5,6. However, it is unknown how neural circuits undergo continuous synaptic changes during learning while maintaining lifelong memories. Here we show, by following postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in the mouse cortex7,8, that learning and novel sensory experience lead to spine formation and elimination by a protracted process. The extent of spine remodelling correlates with behavioural improvement after learning, suggesting a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. Importantly, a small fraction of new spines induced by novel experience, together with most spines formed early during development and surviving experience-dependent elimination, are preserved and provide a structural basis for memory retention throughout the entire life of an animal. These studies indicate that learning and daily sensory experience leave minute but permanent marks on cortical connections and suggest that lifelong memories are stored in largely stably connected synaptic networks."
https://openalex.org/W2000300989,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and function by opening a transmembrane ion channel upon binding of glutamate. Despite their crucial role in neurobiology, the architecture and atomic structure of an intact ionotropic glutamate receptor are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor at 3.6 A resolution in complex with a competitive antagonist. The receptor harbours an overall axis of two-fold symmetry with the extracellular domains organized as pairs of local dimers and with the ion channel domain exhibiting four-fold symmetry. A symmetry mismatch between the extracellular and ion channel domains is mediated by two pairs of conformationally distinct subunits, A/C and B/D. Therefore, the stereochemical manner in which the A/C subunits are coupled to the ion channel gate is different from the B/D subunits. Guided by the GluA2 structure and site-directed cysteine mutagenesis, we suggest that GluN1 and GluN2A NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors have a similar architecture, with subunits arranged in a 1-2-1-2 pattern. We exploit the GluA2 structure to develop mechanisms of ion channel activation, desensitization and inhibition by non-competitive antagonists and pore blockers."
https://openalex.org/W2037063633,"Food waste contributes to excess consumption of freshwater and fossil fuels which, along with methane and CO2 emissions from decomposing food, impacts global climate change. Here, we calculate the energy content of nationwide food waste from the difference between the US food supply and the food consumed by the population. The latter was estimated using a validated mathematical model of metabolism relating body weight to the amount of food eaten. We found that US per capita food waste has progressively increased by ∼50% since 1974 reaching more than 1400 kcal per person per day or 150 trillion kcal per year. Food waste now accounts for more than one quarter of the total freshwater consumption and ∼300 million barrels of oil per year."

This result follows previously reported associations of this variant with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have described associations of variants in PNPLA3 with nonalcoholic fatty liver and plasma liver enzyme levels. We investigated the contributions of these variants to liver disease in Mestizo subjects with a history of alcohol dependence. We found that rs738409 in PNPLA3 is strongly associated with alcoholic liver disease and clinically evident alcoholic cirrhosis (unadjusted OR= 2.25, P=1.7 × 10−10; ancestry-adjusted OR=1.79, P=1.9 × 10−5)."
https://openalex.org/W2075145458,"With long delays observed between sampling and availability of results, the usefulness of blood cultures in the context of emergency infectious diseases has recently been questioned. Among methods that allow quicker bacterial identification from growing colonies, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was demonstrated to accurately identify bacteria routinely isolated in a clinical biology laboratory. In order to speed up the identification process, in the present work we attempted bacterial identification directly from blood culture bottles detected positive by the automate.We prospectively analysed routine MALDI-TOF identification of bacteria detected in blood culture by two different protocols involving successive centrifugations and then lysis by trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid. Of the 562 blood culture broths detected as positive by the automate and containing one bacterial species, 370 (66%) were correctly identified. Changing the protocol from trifluoroacetic acid to formic acid improved identification of Staphylococci, and overall correct identification increased from 59% to 76%. Lack of identification was observed mostly with viridans streptococci, and only one false positive was observed. In the 22 positive blood culture broths that contained two or more different species, only one of the species was identified in 18 samples, no species were identified in two samples and false species identifications were obtained in two cases. The positive predictive value of bacterial identification using this procedure was 99.2%.MALDI-TOF MS is an efficient method for direct routine identification of bacterial isolates in blood culture, with the exception of polymicrobial samples and viridans streptococci. It may replace routine identification performed on colonies, provided improvement for the specificity of blood culture broths growing viridans streptococci is obtained in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2035799305,"Germline mutations in PARK2 are a well-known cause of the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease. Here, Timothy Chan and colleagues report somatic mutations and intragenic deletions of PARK2 in glioblastoma, colon cancer and lung cancer. Mutation of the gene PARK2, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the most common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease1,2,3. In a search for multisite tumor suppressors, we identified PARK2 as a frequently targeted gene on chromosome 6q25.2–q27 in cancer. Here we describe inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies. The PARK2 mutations in cancer occur in the same domains, and sometimes at the same residues, as the germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the PARK2 protein. PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity, compromising its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E and resulting in mitotic instability. These data strongly point to PARK2 as a tumor suppressor on 6q25.2–q27. Thus, PARK2, a gene that causes neuronal dysfunction when mutated in the germline, may instead contribute to oncogenesis when altered in non-neuronal somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043126144,"Type IV secretion systems are secretion nanomachines spanning the two membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Three proteins, VirB7, VirB9 and VirB10, assemble into a 1.05 megadalton (MDa) core spanning the inner and outer membranes. This core consists of 14 copies of each of the proteins and forms two layers, the I and O layers, inserting in the inner and outer membrane, respectively. Here we present the crystal structure of a ∼0.6 MDa outer-membrane complex containing the entire O layer. This structure is the largest determined for an outer-membrane channel and is unprecedented in being composed of three proteins. Unexpectedly, this structure identifies VirB10 as the outer-membrane channel with a unique hydrophobic double-helical transmembrane region. This structure establishes VirB10 as the only known protein crossing both membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Comparison of the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystallographic structures points to conformational changes regulating channel opening and closing. The transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through conjugation is a major factor in bacterial evolution, and of practical importance as a mechanism for the exchange of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Most pathogenic bacteria in humans are Gram-negatives in which the type IV secretion system mediates this DNA transfer. This system consists of three proteins assembled into a core spanning the inner and outer membranes. The crystal structure of the outer membrane complex of a type IV secretion system has now been determined; at 0.6 megadaltons it the largest outer membrane complex for which a structure is known. The structure suggests mechanisms by which the DNA passes through the bacterial cell membrane and provides a step towards the development of drugs to target type IV secretion systems as a counter to the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. Type IV secretion systems span the two membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, with three proteins —— VirB7, VirB9 and VirB10 — assembled into a 1.05 megadalton core spanning the inner and outer membranes. Here, the crystal structure of an outer-membrane complex is presented. The structure is the largest determined for an outer-membrane channel and is unprecedented in being composed of three proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2034491455,"In an effort to target the in vivo context of tumor-specific moieties, we screened a large library of nuclease-resistant RNA oligonucleotides in tumor-bearing mice to identify candidate molecules with the ability to localize to hepatic colon cancer metastases. One of the selected molecules is an RNA aptamer that binds to p68, an RNA helicase that has been shown to be upregulated in colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037667982,"Hausp is a deubiquitinase that has been shown to regulate the p53–Mdm2 pathway. Cotransfection of p53 and Hausp stabilizes p53 through the removal of ubiquitin moieties from polyubiquitinated p53. Interestingly, knockout or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Hausp in human cells also resulted in the stabilization of p53 due to the destabilization of Mdm2, suggesting a dynamic role of Hausp in p53 activation. To understand the physiological functions of Hausp, we generated hausp knockout mice. Hausp knockout mice die during early embryonic development between embryonic days E6.5 and E7.5. The hausp knockout embryos showed p53 activation, but no apparent increase in apoptosis. Embryonic lethality was caused by a dramatic reduction in proliferation and termination in development, in part due to p53 activation and/or abrogation of p53-independent functions. Although deletion of p53 did not completely rescue the embryonic lethality of the hausp knockout, embryonic development was extended in both hausp and p53 double knockout embryos. These data show that Hausp has a critical role in regulating the p53–Mdm2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1968968087,"Background microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate target genes at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in cancer pathogenesis and development. Variation amongst individuals is a significant confounding factor in miRNA (or other) expression studies. The true character of biologically or clinically meaningful differential expression can be obscured by inter-patient variation. In this study we aim to identify miRNAs with consistent differential expression in multiple tumor types using a novel data analysis approach. Methods Using microarrays we profiled the expression of more than 700 miRNAs in 28 matched tumor/normal samples from 8 different tumor types (breast, colon, liver, lung, lymphoma, ovary, prostate and testis). This set is unique in putting emphasis on minimizing tissue type and patient related variability using normal and tumor samples from the same patient. We develop scores for comparing miRNA expression in the above matched sample data based on a rigorous characterization of the distribution of order statistics over a discrete state set, including exact p-values. Specifically, we compute a Rank Consistency Score (RCoS) for every miRNA measured in our data. Our methods are also applicable in various other contexts. We compare our methods, as applied to matched samples, to paired t-test and to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Results We identify consistent (across the cancer types measured) differentially expressed miRNAs. 41 miRNAs are under-expressed in cancer compared to normal, at FDR (False Discovery Rate) of 0.05 and 17 are over-expressed at the same FDR level. Differentially expressed miRNAs include known oncomiRs (e.g miR-96) as well as miRNAs that were not previously universally associated with cancer. Specific examples include miR-133b and miR-486-5p, which are consistently down regulated and mir-629* which is consistently up regulated in cancer, in the context of our cohort.

https://openalex.org/W1996655258,"FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) plays a key role as a mobile floral induction signal that initiates the floral transition. Therefore, precise control of FT expression is critical for the reproductive success of flowering plants. Coexistence of bivalent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3K4me3 marks at the FT locus and the role of H3K27me3 as a strong FT repression mechanism in Arabidopsis have been reported. However, the role of an active mark, H3K4me3, in FT regulation has not been addressed, nor have the components affecting this mark been identified. Mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana Jumonji4 (AtJmj4) and EARLY FLOWERING6 (ELF6), two Arabidopsis genes encoding Jumonji (Jmj) family proteins, caused FT-dependent, additive early flowering correlated with increased expression of FT mRNA and increased H3K4me3 levels within FT chromatin. Purified recombinant AtJmj4 protein possesses specific demethylase activity for mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4. Tagged AtJmj4 and ELF6 proteins associate directly with the FT transcription initiation region, a region where the H3K4me3 levels were increased most significantly in the mutants. Thus, our study demonstrates the roles of AtJmj4 and ELF6 as H3K4 demethylases directly repressing FT chromatin and preventing precocious flowering in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W1984795762,"The membrane bound receptor tyrosine kinase Her2 is overexpressed in approximately 30% of human breast cancers, which correlates with poor prognosis. Her2-induced signaling pathways include MAPK and PI3K/Akt, of which the latter has been shown to be critical for Her2+ breast cancer cell growth and survival. In addition, the NF-κB pathway has been shown to be activated downstream of Her2 overexpression; however, the mechanisms leading to this activation are not currently clear. Using Her2+/ER− breast cancer cells, we show that Her2 activates NF-κB through the canonical pathway which, surprisingly, involves IKKα. Knockdown of IKKα led to a significant decrease in transcription levels of multiple NF-κB-regulated cytokine and chemokine genes. siRNA-mediated knockdown of IKKα resulted in a decrease in cancer cell invasion, but had no effect on cell proliferation. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway had no effect on NF-κB activation, but significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Our study suggests different roles for the NF-κB and PI3K pathways downstream of Her2, leading to changes in invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells. In addition this work indicates the importance of IKKα as a mediator of Her2-induced tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1982195338,"Synaptic inputs underlying spike receptive fields are important for understanding mechanisms of neuronal processing. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from neurons in mouse primary visual cortex, we examined the spatial patterns of their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs evoked by On and Off stimuli. Neurons with either segregated or overlapped On/Off spike subfields had substantial overlaps between all the four synaptic subfields. The segregated receptive-field structures were generated by the integration of excitation and inhibition with a stereotypic 'overlap-but-mismatched' pattern: the peaks of excitatory On/Off subfields were separated and flanked colocalized peaks of inhibitory On/Off subfields. The small mismatch of excitation/inhibition led to an asymmetric inhibitory shaping of On/Off spatial tunings, resulting in a great enhancement of their distinctiveness. Thus, slightly separated On/Off excitation, together with intervening inhibition, can create simple-cell receptive-field structure and the dichotomy of receptive-field structures may arise from a fine-tuning of the spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2007179439,"Increased activity of MYC protein-family members is a common feature in many cancers. Using neuroblastoma as a tumor model, we established a microRNA (miRNA) signature for activated MYCN/c-MYC signaling in two independent primary neuroblastoma tumor cohorts and provide evidence that c-MYC and MYCN have overlapping functions. On the basis of an integrated approach including miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) gene expression data we show that miRNA activation contributes to widespread mRNA repression, both in c-MYC- and MYCN-activated tumors. c-MYC/MYCN-induced miRNA activation was shown to be dependent on c-MYC/MYCN promoter binding as evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, we show that pathways, repressed through c-MYC/MYCN miRNA activation, are highly correlated to tumor aggressiveness and are conserved across different tumor entities suggesting that c-MYC/MYCN activate a core set of miRNAs for cooperative repression of common transcriptional programs related to disease aggressiveness. Our results uncover a widespread correlation between miRNA activation and c-MYC/MYCN-mediated coding gene expression modulation and further substantiate the overlapping functions of c-MYC and MYCN in the process of tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2079130456,"Background Elucidating geographic locations from where migratory birds are recruited into adult breeding populations is a fundamental but largely elusive goal in conservation biology. This is especially true for species that breed in remote northern areas where field-based demographic assessments are logistically challenging. Methodology/Findings Here we used hydrogen isotopes (δD) to determine natal origins of migrating hatch-year lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) harvested by hunters in the United States from all North American flyways during the hunting seasons of 1999–2000 (n = 412) and 2000–2001 (n = 455). We combined geospatial, observational, and analytical data sources, including known scaup breeding range, δD values of feathers from juveniles at natal sites, models of δD for growing-season precipitation, and scaup band-recovery data to generate probabilistic natal origin landscapes for individual scaup. We then used Monte Carlo integration to model assignment uncertainty from among individual δD variance estimates from birds of known molt origin and also from band-return data summarized at the flyway level. We compared the distribution of scaup natal origin with the distribution of breeding population counts obtained from systematic long-term surveys. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis revealed that the proportion of young scaup produced in the northern (above 60°N) versus the southern boreal and Prairie-Parkland region was inversely related to the proportions of breeding adults using these regions, suggesting that despite having a higher relative abundance of breeding adults, the northern boreal region was less productive for scaup recruitment into the harvest than more southern biomes. Our approach for evaluating population declines of migratory birds (particularly game birds) synthesizes all available distributional data and exploits the advantages of intrinsic isotopic markers that link individuals to geography."
https://openalex.org/W2026290208,"An elevated level of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) is reported in the sera of patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared with that of benign diseases and healthy adults. We investigated the mechanistic role of MIC-1 overexpression in the metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Our study showed a progressive increase in secretory MIC-1 production correlated with the increase in the metastatic potential of PC-3 and LNPCa prostate cancer metastatic variants. Further, the in vitro studies using ‘loss-’ and ‘gain’-of-function approaches showed that ectopic overexpression of MIC-1 (PC-3-MIC-1) and forced downregulation of MIC-1(PC-3M-siMIC-1) enhanced and reduced the motility and invasiveness of these cells, respectively. Supporting our in vitro observations, all the mice orthotopically implanted with PC-3-MIC-1 cells developed metastasis compared with none in the PC-3-vector group. Our results showed that MIC-1 overexpression was associated with apparent changes in actin organization. In addition, an enhanced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP)-bound RhoA was also seen; however, no significant change was observed in total FAK and RhoA levels in the PC-3-MIC-1 cells. Altogether, our findings show that MIC-1 has a role in prostate cancer metastasis, in part, by promoting the motility of these cells. Activation of the FAK–RhoA signaling pathway is involved in MIC-1-mediated actin reorganization, and thus, leads to an increase in the motility of prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058624670,"The low molecular weight compound PRIMA-1(MET) reactivates mutant p53 and triggers mutant p53-dependent apoptosis in human tumor cells. We investigated the effect of PRIMA-1(MET) on global gene expression using microarray analysis of Saos-2 cells expressing His273 mutant p53 and parental p53 null Saos-2 cells. PRIMA-1(MET) affected transcription of a significantly larger number of genes in the mutant p53-expressing cells compared to the p53 null cells. Genes affected by PRIMA-1(MET) in a mutant p53-dependent manner include the cell-cycle regulators GADD45B and 14-3-3gamma and the pro-apoptotic Noxa. Several of the affected genes are known p53 target genes and/or contain p53 DNA-binding motifs. We also found mutant p53-dependent disruption of the cytoskeleton, as well as transcriptional activation of the XBP1 gene and cleavage of its mRNA, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our data show that PRIMA-1(MET) induces apoptosis through multiple transcription-dependent and -independent pathways. Such integral engagement of multiple pathways leading to apoptosis is consistent with restoration of wild-type properties to mutant p53 and is likely to reduce the risk of drug resistance development in clinical applications of PRIMA-1(MET)."
https://openalex.org/W2003465484,"Malaria is re-emerging in most of the African highlands exposing the non immune population to deadly epidemics. A better understanding of the factors impacting transmission in the highlands is crucial to improve well targeted malaria control strategies.A conceptual model of potential malaria risk factors in the highlands was built based on the available literature. Furthermore, the relative importance of these factors on malaria can be estimated through ""classification and regression trees"", an unexploited statistical method in the malaria field. This CART method was used to analyse the malaria risk factors in the Burundi highlands. The results showed that Anopheles density was the best predictor for high malaria prevalence. Then lower rainfall, no vector control, higher minimum temperature and houses near breeding sites were associated by order of importance to higher Anopheles density.In Burundi highlands monitoring Anopheles densities when rainfall is low may be able to predict epidemics. The conceptual model combined with the CART analysis is a decision support tool that could provide an important contribution toward the prevention and control of malaria by identifying major risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2039871926,"Despite the ubiquity of raptors in terrestrial ecosystems, many aspects of their predatory behaviour remain poorly understood. Surprisingly little is known about the morphology of raptor talons and how they are employed during feeding behaviour. Talon size variation among digits can be used to distinguish families of raptors and is related to different techniques of prey restraint and immobilisation. The hypertrophied talons on digits (D) I and II in Accipitridae have evolved primarily to restrain large struggling prey while they are immobilised by dismemberment. Falconidae have only modest talons on each digit and only slightly enlarged D-I and II. For immobilisation, Falconini rely more strongly on strike impact and breaking the necks of their prey, having evolved a ‘tooth’ on the beak to aid in doing so. Pandionidae have enlarged, highly recurved talons on each digit, an adaptation for piscivory, convergently seen to a lesser extent in fishing eagles. Strigiformes bear enlarged talons with comparatively low curvature on each digit, part of a suite of adaptations to increase constriction efficiency by maximising grip strength, indicative of specialisation on small prey. Restraint and immobilisation strategy change as prey increase in size. Small prey are restrained by containment within the foot and immobilised by constriction and beak attacks. Large prey are restrained by pinning under the bodyweight of the raptor, maintaining grip with the talons, and immobilised by dismemberment (Accipitridae), or severing the spinal cord (Falconini). Within all raptors, physical attributes of the feet trade off against each other to attain great strength, but it is the variable means by which this is achieved that distinguishes them ecologically. Our findings show that interdigital talon morphology varies consistently among raptor families, and that this is directly correlative with variation in their typical prey capture and restraint strategy."

Much attention has been paid to reducing adiposity as a way to improve adipose tissue function and systemic insulin sensitivity. PFKFB3/iPFK2 is a master regulator of adipocyte nutrient metabolism. Using PFKFB3+/− mice, the present study investigated the role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in regulating diet-induced adiposity and systemic insulin resistance. On a high-fat diet (HFD), PFKFB3+/− mice gained much less body weight than did wild-type littermates. This was attributed to a smaller increase in adiposity in PFKFB3+/− mice than in wild-type controls. However, HFD-induced systemic insulin resistance was more severe in PFKFB3+/− mice than in wild-type littermates. Compared with wild-type littermates, PFKFB3+/− mice exhibited increased severity of HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction, as evidenced by increased adipose tissue lipolysis, inappropriate adipokine expression, and decreased insulin signaling, as well as increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in both isolated adipose tissue macrophages and adipocytes. In an in vitro system, knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused a decrease in the rate of glucose incorporation into lipid but an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inappropriately altered the expression of adipokines, decreased insulin signaling, increased the phosphorylation states of JNK and NFκB p65, and enhanced the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

For example, feeding an HFD to rats for 10 weeks causes a significant increase in visceral fat mass, which is accompanied by a decrease in systemic insulin sensitivity as evidenced by decreased rate of clamp glucose infusion (1Kusunoki M. Hara T. Tsutsumi K. Nakamura T. Miyata T. Sakakibara F. Sakamoto S. Ogawa H. Nakaya Y. Storlien L.H. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, after a feeding of HFD for 20 weeks, both of the two different strains of wild-type mice gain a significant increase in fat mass, which is associated with systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (2Gallou-Kabani C. Vigé A. Gross M.S. Rabès J.P. Boileau C. Larue-Achagiotis C. Tomé D. Jais J.P. Junien C. Obesity. 2007; 15: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A recent study even indicates that feeding an HFD to mice for only 6 weeks is sufficient to induce adiposity and systemic insulin resistance (3Llagostera E. Carmona M.C. Vicente M. Escorihuela R.M. Kaliman P. FEBS Letters. 2009; 583: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as documented in mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, a larger augmentation in adiposity is accompanied by a greater increase in the severity of systemic insulin resistance (3Llagostera E.

On the other hand, reducing adiposity has been considered as an effective way to reverse systemic insulin resistance (1Kusunoki M. Hara T. Tsutsumi K. Nakamura T. Miyata T. Sakakibara F. Sakamoto S.

Following the investigation into the insight of altered systemic insulin sensitivity, it has been suggested that adipose tissue dysfunction is far more important than adiposity in terms of causing systemic insulin resistance (13Stienstra R.

In mice fed an HFD, chronic low grade inflammation in adipose tissue is evident and characterized by an increase in macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine production (17Weisberg S.P.

Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This brings about adipose tissue dysfunction, demonstrated by an increase in the production pro-hyperglycemic factors such as free fatty acids and resistin and a decrease in the production of anti-hyperglycemic factors such as adiponectin (4Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 15Qatanani M.

These changes, along with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) from both adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages, impair insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive tissues including the liver and skeletal muscle, leading to systemic insulin resistance (21Hotamisligil G.S.

In contrast, treatment with thiazolidinediones ameliorates adipose tissue inflammation, which in turn contributes, at least in part, to the reversal of diet-induced adipose tissue dysfunction and systemic insulin resistance (13Stienstra R. Duval C. Keshtkar S. van der Laak J. Kersten S. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22620-22627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G.

For this reason, adipose tissue inflammation is of particular importance to the regulation of systemic insulin sensitivity.PFKFB3 is the gene that codes for the inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2) that is highly expressed in adipose tissue (28Atsumi T. Nishio T. Niwa H. Takeuchi J. Bando H. Shimizu C. Yoshioka N. Bucala R. Koike T. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PFKFB3/iPFK2 generates fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26P2), which in turn activates 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (6PFK1) to enhance glycolysis (29Okar D.A. Wu C. Lange A.J. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. Vol. 44. Elsevier, New York2004: 123-154Google Scholar, 30Rider M.H. Bertrand L. Vertommen D. Michels P.A. Rousseau G.G. Hue L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 561-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This effect is involved in adipocyte lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis (28Atsumi T. Nishio T. Niwa H. Takeuchi J. Bando H. Shimizu C. Yoshioka N. Bucala R. Koike T. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether the metabolic properties of PFKFB3/iPFK2 are related to the regulation of adipose tissue function, in particular adipose tissue inflammatory response. The present study provides evidence to support a novel role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in regulating diet-induced systemic insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammatory response in a manner independent of adiposity.DISCUSSIONFeeding an HFD to mice induces adiposity, which is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction, a key contributor of systemic insulin resistance (42Haugen F. Drevon C.A. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2007; 66: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Morin C.L. Eckel R.H. Marcel T. Pagliassotti M.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This is the case in wild-type littermates. However, in PFKFB3+/− mice, although bringing about a much smaller increase in adiposity, feeding an HFD caused a much greater increase in the severity of HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction and systemic insulin resistance than in wild-type littermates. These changes were attributed, at least in part, to the increased adipose tissue inflammatory response, which was evidenced by higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in both isolated adipose tissue macrophages and adipocytes in PFKFB3+/− mice. Consistently, in cultured adipocytes, knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 caused a decrease in lipid accumulation and an increase in the status of oxidative stress, which were accompanied by enhanced inflammatory signaling, increased mRNA levels of TNFα and IL-6, and decreased insulin signaling. Together, these data argue in favor of a novel and unique role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in regulating HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction and systemic insulin resistance in a manner independent of adiposity.The unique role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in dissociating HFD-induced adiposity and adipose tissue dysfunction is attributed, at a large extent, to the metabolic properties of PFKFB3/iPFK2. Notably, PFKFB3/iPFK2 stimulates adipocyte glycolysis (28Atsumi T. Nishio T. Niwa H. Takeuchi J. Bando H. Shimizu C. Yoshioka N. Bucala R. Koike T. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An increase in PFKFB3/iPFK2-stimulated glycolysis not only provides lactate and pyruvate (which are converted into acetyl-CoA and used for lipogenesis to provide free fatty acids), but also increases the production of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is converted into glycerol-3-phosphate as a required substrate for adipocyte triglyceride synthesis. Upon disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2, both glycolysis and glycolysis-derived lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis are impaired, which is supported by the data that PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes exhibited a decrease in the incorporation of glucose into lipid, and thereby adipocyte lipid accumulation. This contributes to a smaller gain in adiposity in PFKFB3+/− mice after HFD feeding. Importantly, the impairment in using glucose as a fuel due to disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 likely causes a compensatory increase in fatty acid oxidation, which is supported by increased expression of CPT1, as well as PPARα and PGC1 in adipose tissue of PFKFB3+/− mice. The compensatory increase in fatty acid oxidation not only contributes to a smaller gain in adiposity in PFKFB3+/− mice after HFD feeding, but more importantly, appears to trigger oxidative stress. In support of this concept, PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes exhibited an increase in the production of ROS under both basal and palmitate-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by etomoxir caused a marked decrease in palmitate-stimulated production of ROS in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes. In agreement with the role oxidative stress in disturbing adipokine expression and initiating the inflammatory response in adipocytes (15Qatanani M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1443-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), the increased production of ROS in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes was associated, on the one hand, with inappropriately altered expression of resistin and adiponectin, and on the other hand, with increased phosphorylation states of JNK and NFκB p65 and increased mRNA levels of TNFα and IL-6 in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes. Apparently, PFKFB3/iPFK2 links nutrient metabolism and adipocyte function.The role of adipose tissue dysfunction in causing systemic insulin resistance has been well documented (17Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7308) Google Scholar, 18Lumeng C.N. DeYoung S.M. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Indeed, this role is illustrated by at least two plausible mechanisms (4Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 15Qatanani M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1443-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 19Rosen E.D.

Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2103-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the first mechanism, adipose tissue dysfunction causes an increase in the production of free fatty acids, resistin, and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and a decrease in the production of adiponectin. These factors are carried to the insulin-sensitive tissues including the liver and skeletal muscle through circulation to impair insulin signaling and ultimately bring about systemic insulin resistance (24Boden G. Cheung P. Stein T.P. Kresge K. Mozzoli M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E12-E19Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat.

McGehee Jr., R.E. Fried S.K. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the second mechanism, adipose tissue-derived proinflammatory cytokines are similarly carried to insulin-sensitive tissues through circulation to directly impair insulin signaling in the tissues (22Cheung A.T. Ree D. Kolls J.K. Fuselier J. Coy D.H. Bryer-Ash M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4928-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Görgün C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In the present study, PFKFB3+/− mice exhibited an increase in the severity of HFD-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. This was attributed, at least in part, to increased adipose tissue dysfunction, as evidenced by increased adipose tissue lipolysis, inappropriate adipokine expression, and decreased insulin signaling, as well as increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL-6 in the adipose tissue. These data support a pivotal role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in protecting against HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction, and thereby systemic insulin resistance. Moreover, because PFKFB3/iPFK2 disruption-associated changes in adipose tissue dysfunction were nearly identical to those in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes, PFKFB3/iPFK2 in adipocytes is thereby responsible largely for the regulation of adipose tissue function. It should be pointed out that PFKFB3/iPFK2 is also expressed in tissues other than adipose tissue (31Chesney J. Telang S. Yalcin A. Clem A. Wallis N. Bucala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in non-adipose tissue in regulating systemic insulin sensitivity cannot be ruled out. However, considering the profile of PFKFB3/iPFK2 expression, the role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in non-adipose tissue would not be as important as that in adipose tissue. Additionally, in terms of regulating systemic glucose homeostasis, dysregulated liver glucose metabolism is thought to contribute to hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (32Wu C. Okar D.A. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Wu C. Kang J.E. Peng L. Li H. Khan S.A. Hillard C.J. Okar D.A. Lange A.J. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 2: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Wu C. Khan S.A. Peng L.J. Li H. Camella S.G. Lange A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E536-E543Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Given that the amount of iPFK2 was undetectable in the liver, dysregulated liver glucose metabolism, if existed in PFKFB3+/− mice, was likely due to a secondary effect of PFKFB3 disruption in extrahepatic tissues, in particular adipose tissue.It is also a novel finding that disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 exacerbated HFD-induced adipose tissue inflammatory response, which was also independent of adiposity. Additionally, the increased adipose tissue inflammatory response was independent of macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue. In a generally accepted concept, HFD-induced adipose tissue inflammatory is characterized by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which is positively correlated with macrophage infiltration (17Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7308) Google Scholar, 18Lumeng C.N. DeYoung S.M. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). However, several lines of new evidence suggest that the inflammatory status of macrophages is more important than the number of macrophages in terms of controlling the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue. For example, mice that lack PPARγ in macrophages exhibit fewer macrophages in adipose tissue but have higher mRNA levels of IL-6 than wild-type control mice (56Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R. Goforth M.H. Morel C.R. Subramanian V. Mukundan L. Red Eagle A. Vats D. Brombacher F. Ferrante A.W. Chawla A. Nature. 2007; 447: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, increases the abundance of macrophages in adipose tissue, but decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 (13Stienstra R. Duval C. Keshtkar S. van der Laak J. Kersten S. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22620-22627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Considering this, disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 appears to increase the inflammatory activity of the infiltrated macrophages. This notion is indeed supported by the data that the mRNA levels of TNFα and IL-6 were higher in macrophages isolated from PFKFB3+/− mice than in wild-type littermates. Therefore, disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 exacerbates HFD-induced adipose tissue inflammatory response in a manner depending on increasing macrophage inflammatory status rather than macrophage infiltration. However, further study is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 blunts HFD-induced macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue.In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel and unique role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in regulating adiposity and adipose tissue function, and thereby systemic insulin sensitivity. This role is manifested by the fact that disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 ameliorates HFD-induced adiposity, but exacerbates HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction, in particular, adipose tissue inflammatory response, which contributes to an increase in the severity of systemic insulin resistance. Because of this, a potential risk of inducing systemic insulin resistance and enhancing adipose tissue inflammatory response should be taken into account when inhibition of PFKFB3/iPFK2 is considered as therapeutic approach. IntroductionAs demonstrated by numerous data generated from high fat diet (HFD) 3The abbreviations used are: HFDhigh fat dietiPFK2inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinaseF26P2fructose-2,6-bisphosphate6PFK16-phosphofructo-1-kinasePPARαperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor αPGC1peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor γ, coactivator 1CPT1carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseNFκBnuclear factor κBTNFαtumor necrosis factor αILinterleukinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumROSreactive oxygen speciesLFDlow fat diet. -fed rodents, overnutrition is associated with adiposity and systemic insulin resistance. For example, feeding an HFD to rats for 10 weeks causes a significant increase in visceral fat mass, which is accompanied by a decrease in systemic insulin sensitivity as evidenced by decreased rate of clamp glucose infusion (1Kusunoki M. Hara T. Tsutsumi K. Nakamura T. Miyata T. Sakakibara F. Sakamoto S. Ogawa H. Nakaya Y. Storlien L.H. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, after a feeding of HFD for 20 weeks, both of the two different strains of wild-type mice gain a significant increase in fat mass, which is associated with systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (2Gallou-Kabani C. Vigé A. Gross M.S. Rabès J.P. Boileau C. Larue-Achagiotis C. Tomé D. Jais J.P. Junien C. Obesity. 2007; 15: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A recent study even indicates that feeding an HFD to mice for only 6 weeks is sufficient to induce adiposity and systemic insulin resistance (3Llagostera E. Carmona M.C. Vicente M. Escorihuela R.M. Kaliman P. FEBS Letters. 2009; 583: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as documented in mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, a larger augmentation in adiposity is accompanied by a greater increase in the severity of systemic insulin resistance (3Llagostera E. Carmona M.C. Vicente M. Escorihuela R.M. Kaliman P. FEBS Letters. 2009; 583: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because of this, adiposity has been generally viewed as an important contributor of systemic insulin resistance (3Llagostera E. Carmona M.C. Vicente M. Escorihuela R.M. Kaliman P.

On the other hand, reducing adiposity has been considered as an effective way to reverse systemic insulin resistance (1Kusunoki M. Hara T. Tsutsumi K. Nakamura T. Miyata T. Sakakibara F. Sakamoto S.

This is particularly true in genetically modified mice and in mice treated with pharmacological agents (9Zhang J. Fu M. Cui T. Xiong C. Xu K. Zhong W. Xiao Y. Floyd D. Liang J. Li E. Song Q.

https://openalex.org/W1489076382,"JWA, a newly identified novel microtubule-associated protein (MAP), was recently demonstrated to be indispensable for the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and activation of MAPK cascades induced by arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) and phorbol ester (PMA). JWA depletion blocked the inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) on HeLa cell migration, but enhanced cell migration after PMA treatment. As cancer cell migration is a hallmark of tumor metastasis and the functional role of JWA in cancer metastasis is not understood, here we show that JWA has an important role in melanoma metastasis. Our data demonstrated that JWA knockdown increased the adhesion and invasion abilities of melanoma cells. Furthermore, JWA knockdown in B16-F10 and A375 melanoma cells significantly promoted the formation and growth of metastatic colonies in vivo. Moreover, in the tumor biopsies from human melanoma patients, JWA expression was significantly decreased in malignant melanoma compared with normal nevi. In addition, we found that JWA knockdown could intensify tumor integrin alpha(V)beta(3) signaling by regulating nuclear factor Sp1. These findings suggest that JWA suppresses melanoma metastasis and may serve a potential therapeutic target for human melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2009656293,"Background Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a mechanism where energy is transferred from an excited donor fluorophore to adjacent chromophores via non-radiative dipole-dipole interactions. FRET theory primarily considers the interactions of a single donor-acceptor pair. Unfortunately, it is rarely known if only a single acceptor is present in a molecular complex. Thus, the use of FRET as a tool for measuring protein-protein interactions inside living cells requires an understanding of how FRET changes with multiple acceptors. When multiple FRET acceptors are present it is assumed that a quantum of energy is either released from the donor, or transferred in toto to only one of the acceptors present. The rate of energy transfer between the donor and a specific acceptor (kD→A) can be measured in the absence of other acceptors, and these individual FRET transfer rates can be used to predict the ensemble FRET efficiency using a simple kinetic model where the sum of all FRET transfer rates is divided by the sum of all radiative and non-radiative transfer rates. Methodology/Principal Findings The generality of this approach was tested by measuring the ensemble FRET efficiency in two constructs, each containing a single fluorescent-protein donor (Cerulean) and either two or three FRET acceptors (Venus). FRET transfer rates between individual donor-acceptor pairs within these constructs were calculated from FRET efficiencies measured after systematically introducing point mutations to eliminate all other acceptors. We find that the amount of energy transfer observed in constructs having multiple acceptors is significantly greater than the FRET efficiency predicted from the sum of the individual donor to acceptor transfer rates. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that either an additional energy transfer pathway exists when multiple acceptors are present, or that a theoretical assumption on which the kinetic model prediction is based is incorrect."
https://openalex.org/W1980207397,"Mutational analysis of oncogenes is critical for our understanding of cancer development. Oncogenome screening has identified a fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) Y367C mutation in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB453. Here, we investigate the consequence of this missense mutation in cancer cells. We show that MDA-MB453 cells harbouring the mutation are insensitive to FGFR4-specific ligand stimulation or inhibition with an antagonistic antibody. Furthermore, the FGFR4 mutant elicits constitutive phosphorylation leading to an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade as shown by an enhanced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Cloning and ectopic expression of the FGFR4 Y367C mutant in HEK293 cells revealed high pErk levels and enhanced cell proliferation. Based on these findings, we propose that FGFR4 may be a driver of tumour growth, particularly when highly expressed or stabilized and constitutively activated through genetic alterations. As such, FGFR4 presents an option for further mutational screening in tumours and is an attractive cancer target with the therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2045675850,"Traders in the financial world are assessed by the amount of money they make and, increasingly, by the amount of money they make per unit of risk taken, a measure known as the Sharpe Ratio. Little is known about the average Sharpe Ratio among traders, but the Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that traders, like asset managers, should not outperform the broad market. Here we report the findings of a study conducted in the City of London which shows that a population of experienced traders attain Sharpe Ratios significantly higher than the broad market. To explain this anomaly we examine a surrogate marker of prenatal androgen exposure, the second-to-fourth finger length ratio (2D∶4D), which has previously been identified as predicting a trader's long term profitability. We find that it predicts the amount of risk taken by traders but not their Sharpe Ratios. We do, however, find that the traders' Sharpe Ratios increase markedly with the number of years they have traded, a result suggesting that learning plays a role in increasing the returns of traders. Our findings present anomalous data for the Efficient Markets Hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056907128,"MicroRNAs play essential roles in many cellular processes. However, limited information is available regarding the gene structure and transcriptional regulation of miRNAs. We explored the gene cluster encoding miR-433/127 in mammalian species using bioinformatics and in vitro “gene” expression approaches. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) showed that the precursors of miR-433 and of miR-127 exhibited 95% and 100% similarity, respectively, in human, chimpanzee, horse, dog, monkey, rat, cow, and mouse. MSA of the promoter sequences of miR-433 and of miR-127 revealed lower sequence similarity among these mammalian species. However, the distance between miR-433 and miR-127 was strikingly similar, which was between 986 and 1007 bp and the position of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, including estrogen related receptor response element (ERRE), was well conserved. Transient transfection assays showed that promoters of miR-433 and of miR-127 from human, rat, and dog were activated by estrogen related receptor gamma (ERRγ) and inhibited by small heterodimer partner (SHP). ChIP assays confirmed the physical association of ERRγ with the endogenous promoters of miR-433 and miR-127. In vitro over-expression of the human, rat, or dog miR-433/127 loci in cells, using an expression vector containing miR-433/127 and their promoter regions, markedly induced a differential expression of both primary and mature miR-433 and miR-127, indicating that miR-433 and miR-127 were possessed from their independent promoters. Our studies for the first time demonstrate a conserved gene structure and transcriptional regulation of miR-433 and miR-127 in mammals. The data suggest that the miR-433/127 loci may have evolved from a common gene of origin."
https://openalex.org/W1985662872,"Background Approximately 10 million Americans enter jails annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends routine opt-out HIV testing in these settings. The logistics for performing routine opt-out HIV testing within jails, however, remain controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal time to routinely HIV test newly incarcerated jail detainees using an opt-out strategy. Methods This prospective, controlled trial of routine opt-out HIV testing was conducted among 298 newly incarcerated male inmates in an urban men's jail in New Haven, Connecticut. 298 sequential entrants to the men's jail over a three week period in March and April 2008 were assigned to be offered routine opt-out HIV testing at one of three points after incarceration: immediate (same day, n = 103), early (next day, n = 98), or delayed (7 days, n = 97). The primary outcome was the proportion of men in each group consenting to testing. Results Routine opt-out HIV testing was significantly higher for the early (53%: AOR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.7) and immediate (45%: AOR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.0) testing groups compared to the delayed (33%) testing group. The immediate and early testing groups, however, did not significantly differ (p = 0.67). In multivariate analyses, factors significantly associated with routine opt-out HIV testing were assignment to the ‘early’ testing group (p = 0.0003) and low (bond ≥$5,000, immigration or federal charges or pre-sentencing >30 days) likelihood of early release (p = 0.04). Two subjects received preliminary positive results and one of them was subsequently confirmed HIV seropositive. Conclusions In this men's jail where attrition was high, routine opt-out HIV testing was not only feasible, but resulted in the highest rates of HIV testing when performed within 24 hours of incarceration.

https://openalex.org/W2052177094,"Plant sterols may induce a Th1 shift in humans. However, whether plant stanols have similar effects as well as the underlying mechanism are unknown. We have now shown that (like sitosterol) sitostanol, both 4-desmethylsterols, induces a Th1 shift when added in vitro at physiological concentrations to human PBMCs. This conclusion was based on a higher IFNgamma production, with no change in the production of IL-4 and IL-10. alpha-Amyrin, a 4.4-dimethylsterol, had comparable effects. Because 4.4-dimethylsterols cannot activate transcription factor LXR, this finding indicates that LXR activation was not involved. Sitosterol and sitostanol did not alter the production of IL-12 and IL-18 in PBMCs as well as in monocyte-derived U937 cells, suggesting that plant sterols directly affect T-helper cells, without activating APCs. However, in PBMCs treated with a TLR2 blocker (T2.5), IFNgamma production was completely inhibited, whereas blocking TLR4 with HTA125 had no such effect. To confirm these findings, PBMCs from TLR2(-/-) mice were cultured in the presence of sitosterol and sitostanol. In these cells, no Th1 shift was observed. Our results, therefore, indicate that TLR2 activation is essential to induce a Th1 shift in human PBMCs by plant stanols and plant sterols."
https://openalex.org/W2148449686,"Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is a major therapeutic target of hormonal therapies in breast cancer, and its expression in tumors is predictive of clinical response. Protein levels of ERα are tightly controlled by the 26S proteasome; yet, how the clinical proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, affects ERα regulation has not been studied. Bortezomib selectively inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. Unlike other laboratory proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib failed to stabilize ERα protein at a dose exceeding 90% inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity. Unexpectedly, however, chronic bortezomib exposure caused a reduction of ERα levels in multiple ER+ breast cancer cell lines. This response can be explained by the fact that bortezomib induced a dramatic decrease in ERα mRNA because of direct transcriptional inhibition and loss of RNA polymerase II recruitment on the ERα gene promoter. Bortezomib treatment resulted in promoter-specific changes in estrogen-induced gene transcription that related with occupancy of ERα and RNA polymerase II (PolII) on endogenous promoters. In addition, bortezomib inhibited estrogen-dependent growth in soft agar. These results reveal a novel link between proteasome activity and expression of ERα in breast cancer and uncover distinct roles of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome in the regulation of the ERα pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2086302655,"Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax. With the increased threat of anthrax in biowarfare, there is an urgent need to characterize new antimicrobial targets from B. anthracis. One such target is dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which catalyzes the committed step in the pathway yielding meso-diaminopimelate and lysine. In this study, we employed CD spectroscopy to demonstrate that the thermostability of DHDPS from B. anthracis (Ba-DHDPS) is significantly enhanced in the presence of the substrate, pyruvate. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies show that the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of the enzyme is 3-fold tighter in the presence of pyruvate compared with the apo form. To examine the significance of this substrate-mediated stabilization phenomenon, a dimeric mutant of Ba-DHDPS (L170E/G191E) was generated and shown to have markedly reduced activity compared with the wild-type tetramer. This demonstrates that the substrate, pyruvate, stabilizes the active form of the enzyme. We next determined the high resolution (2.15 A) crystal structure of Ba-DHDPS in complex with pyruvate (3HIJ) and compared this to the apo structure (1XL9). Structural analyses show that there is a significant (91 A(2)) increase in buried surface area at the tetramerization interface of the pyruvate-bound structure. This study describes a new mechanism for stabilization of the active oligomeric form of an antibiotic target from B. anthracis and reveals an ""Achilles heel"" that can be exploited in structure-based drug design."

The objective was to evaluate new CDC guidelines for routine opt-out HIV testing and examine the optimal time to implement routine opt-out HIV testing among newly incarcerated jail detainees.This prospective, controlled trial of routine opt-out HIV testing was conducted among 323 newly incarcerated female inmates in Connecticut's only women's jail. 323 sequential entrants to the women's jail over a five week period in August and September 2007 were assigned to be offered routine opt-out HIV testing at one of three points after incarceration: immediate (same day, n = 108), early (next day, n = 108), or delayed (7 days, n = 107). The primary outcome was the proportion of women in each group consenting to testing.Routine opt-out HIV testing was significantly highest (73%) among the early testing group compared to 55% for immediate and 50% for 7 days post-entry groups. Other factors significantly (p = 0.01) associated with being HIV tested were younger age and low likelihood of early release from jail based on bond value or type of charge for which women were arrested.In this correctional facility, routine opt-out HIV testing in a jail setting was feasible, with highest rates of testing if performed the day after incarceration. Lower testing rates were seen with immediate testing, where there is a high prevalence of inability or unwillingness to test, and with delayed testing, where attrition from jail increases with each passing day.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00624247."
https://openalex.org/W2072660697,"Background Many coral reef organisms are photosynthetic or have evolved in tight symbiosis with photosynthetic symbionts. As such, the tissues of reef organisms are often exposed to intense solar radiation in clear tropical waters and have adapted to trap and harness photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). High levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) associated with sunlight, however, represent a potential problem in terms of tissue damage. Methodology/Principal Findings By measuring UVR and PAR reflectance from intact and ground bare coral skeletons we show that the property of calcium carbonate skeletons to absorb downwelling UVR to a significant extent, while reflecting PAR back to the overlying tissue, has biological advantages. We placed cnidarians on top of bare skeletons and a UVR reflective substrate and showed that under ambient UVR levels, UVR transmitted through the tissues of cnidarians placed on top of bare skeletons were four times lower compared to their counterparts placed on a UVR reflective white substrate. In accordance with the lower levels of UVR measured in cnidarians on top of coral skeletons, a similar drop in UVR damage to their DNA was detected. The skeletons emitted absorbed UVR as yellow fluorescence, which allows for safe dissipation of the otherwise harmful radiation. Conclusions/Significance Our study presents a novel defensive role for coral skeletons and reveals that the strong UVR absorbance by the skeleton can contribute to the ability of corals, and potentially other calcifiers, to thrive under UVR levels that are detrimental to most marine life."

The main objective of this study was to characterize the fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms acquired in a S. Typhimurium mutant selected with ciprofloxacin from a susceptible isolate and to investigate its invasion ability.Three different amino acid substitutions were detected in the quinolone target proteins of the resistant mutant (MIC of ciprofloxacin, 64 microg/ml): D87G and G81C in GyrA, and a novel mutation, E470K, in ParE. A protein analysis revealed an increased expression of AcrAB/TolC and decreased expression of OmpC. Sequencing of the marRAB, soxRS, ramR and acrR operons did not show any mutation and neither did their expression levels in a microarray analysis. A decreased percentage of invasion ability was detected when compared with the susceptible clinical isolate in a gentamicin protection assay. The microarray results revealed a decreased expression of genes which play a role during the invasion process, such as hilA, invF and the flhDC operon. Of note was the impaired growth detected in the resistant strain. A strain with a reverted phenotype (mainly concerning the resistance phenotype) was obtained from the resistant mutant.In conclusion, a possible link between fluoroquinolone resistance and decreased cell invasion ability may exist explaining the low prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium clinical isolates. The impaired growth may appear as a consequence of fluoroquinolone resistance acquisition and down-regulate the expression of the invasion genes."
https://openalex.org/W2015384203,"Ebp1, an ErbB3 receptor-binding protein, inhibits cell proliferation and acts as a putative tumor suppressor. Ebp1 translocates into the nucleus and functions as a transcription co-repressor for E2F-1. Here, we show that Ebp1 p42 isoform can be sumoylated on both K93 and K298 residues, which mediate its nuclear translocation and are required for its anti-proliferative activity. We find that translocation in liposarcoma (TLS)/FUS, an RNA-binding nuclear protein that is involved in pre-mRNA processing and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, has Sumo1 E3 ligase activity for Ebp1 p42. Ebp1 directly binds TLS/FUS, which is regulated by genotoxic stress-triggered phosphorylation on Ebp1. Ebp1 sumoylation facilitates its nucleolar distribution and protein stability. Overexpression of TLS enhances Ebp1 sumoylation, whereas depletion of TLS abolishes Ebp1 sumoylation. Moreover, unsumoylated Ebp1 mutants fail to suppress E2F-1-regulated transcription, resulting in loss of its anti-proliferation activity. Hence, TLS-mediated sumoylation is required for Ebp1 transcriptional repressive activity."
https://openalex.org/W2001134683,"Emergence of tuberculosis as a global health threat has necessitated an urgent search for new antitubercular drugs entailing determination of 3-dimensional structures of a large number of mycobacterial proteins for structure-based drug design. The essential requirement of ferritins/bacterioferritins (proteins involved in iron storage and homeostasis) for the survival of several prokaryotic pathogens makes these proteins very attractive targets for structure determination and inhibitor design. Bacterioferritins (Bfrs) differ from ferritins in that they have additional noncovalently bound haem groups. The physiological role of haem in Bfrs is not very clear but studies indicate that the haem group is involved in mediating release of iron from Bfr by facilitating reduction of the iron core. To further enhance our understanding, we have determined the crystal structure of the selenomethionyl analog of bacterioferritin A (SeMet-BfrA) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Unexpectedly, electron density observed in the crystals of SeMet-BfrA analogous to haem location in bacterioferritins, shows a demetallated and degraded product of haem. This unanticipated observation is a consequence of the altered spatial electronic environment around the axial ligands of haem (in lieu of Met52 modification to SeMet52). Furthermore, the structure of Mtb SeMet-BfrA displays a possible lost protein interaction with haem propionates due to formation of a salt bridge between Arg53-Glu57, which appears to be unique to Mtb BfrA, resulting in slight modulation of haem binding pocket in this organism. The crystal structure of Mtb SeMet-BfrA provides novel leads to physiological function of haem in Bfrs. If validated as a drug target, it may also serve as a scaffold for designing specific inhibitors. In addition, this study provides evidence against the general belief that a selenium derivative of a protein represents its true physiological native structure."
https://openalex.org/W2164239216,"Background KaiC, a central clock protein in cyanobacteria, undergoes circadian oscillations between hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms in vivo and in vitro. Structural analyses of KaiC crystals have identified threonine and serine residues in KaiC at three residues (T426, S431, and T432) as potential sites at which KaiC is phosphorylated; mutation of any of these three sites to alanine abolishes rhythmicity, revealing an essential clock role for each residue separately and for KaiC phosphorylation in general. Mass spectrometry studies confirmed that the S431 and T432 residues are key phosphorylation sites, however, the role of the threonine residue at position 426 was not clear from the mass spectrometry measurements. Methodology and Principal Findings Mutational approaches and biochemical analyses of KaiC support a key role for T426 in control of the KaiC phosphorylation status in vivo and in vitro and demonstrates that alternative amino acids at residue 426 dramatically affect KaiC's properties in vivo and in vitro, especially genetic dominance/recessive relationships, KaiC dephosphorylation, and the formation of complexes of KaiC with KaiA and KaiB. These mutations alter key circadian properties, including period, amplitude, robustness, and temperature compensation. Crystallographic analyses indicate that the T426 site is phosphorylatible under some conditions, and in vitro phosphorylation assays of KaiC demonstrate labile phosphorylation of KaiC when the primary S431 and T432 sites are blocked. Conclusions and Significance T426 is a crucial site that regulates KaiC phosphorylation status in vivo and in vitro and these studies underscore the importance of KaiC phosphorylation status in the essential cyanobacterial circadian functions. The regulatory roles of these phosphorylation sites–including T426–within KaiC enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying circadian rhythm generation in cyanobacteria."

Genetic ancestry may influence genetic association studies due to differences in individual admixture within recently admixed populations like African Americans.We evaluated the genetic ancestry of Senegalese as well as European Americans and African Americans from Philadelphia. Senegalese mtDNA consisted of approximately 12% U haplotypes (U6 and U5b1b haplotypes, common in North Africa) while the NRY haplotypes belonged solely to haplogroup E. In Philadelphia, we observed varying degrees of admixture. While African Americans have 9-10% mtDNAs and approximately 31% NRYs of European origin, these results are not mirrored in the mtDNA/NRY pools of European Americans: they have less than 7% mtDNAs and less than 2% NRYs from non-European sources. Additionally, there is <2% Native American contribution to Philadelphian African American ancestry and the admixture from combined mtDNA/NRY estimates is consistent with the admixture derived from autosomal genetic data. To further dissect these estimates, we have analyzed our samples in the context of different demographic groups in the Americas.We found that sex-biased admixture in African-derived populations is present throughout the Americas, with continual influence of European males, while Native American females contribute mainly to populations of the Caribbean and South America. The high non-European female contribution to the pool of European-derived populations is consistently characteristic of Iberian colonization. These data suggest that genomic data correlate well with historical records of colonization in the Americas."

McVicar D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In the mouse the TREM family genes form a loose cluster on chromosome 17 and include Trem-1, -2, -3, and -4 (pDC-TREM), an uncharacterized TREM, and TREM-like transcript (Treml-1 and -2). The human gene cluster includes Trem-1 and -2, and Treml1, -2, and -3. Of these genes the receptors encoded by Trem-1 and -2 are the best characterized to date. TREM-1 is selectively expressed by neutrophils and monocytes and is a potent amplifier of pathogenesis associated with microbial sepsis (2Bouchon A. Dietrich J. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 3Bouchon A. Facchetti F. Weigand M.A. Colonna M. Nature. 2001; 410: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). TREM-1 ligation on neutrophils leads to secretion of IL-8 and myeloperoxidase, and co-engagement of TREM-1 during LPS stimulation of monocytes synergistically enhances production of TNFα and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Moreover, inhibition of TREM-1 with soluble receptor protein, small interfering RNA, or antagonistic peptides rescues mice from microbial sepsis and can lessen the severity of experimentally induced colitis (4Schenk M. Bouchon A. Seibold F. Mueller C. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3097-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, TREM-2 is expressed on murine macrophages, microglia, and osteoclasts and has been reported to play a role in the maturation and survival of human dendritic cells by inducing up-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 (5Bouchon A. Hernández-Munain C. Cella M. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Both TREM-1 and 2 associate with, and signal through DAP12, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing transmembrane adapter protein originally identified as a 16-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in NK cells functionally complexed with the non-inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors in humans and their murine counterparts within the Ly-49 gene family (6Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 7Mason L.H. Willette-Brown J. Anderson S.K. Gosselin P. Shores E.W. Love P.E. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4148-4152PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to NK cells, DAP12 is expressed in a variety of other innate immune cells including granulocytes, blood monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells where it is non-covalently associated with a variety of receptors including signal-regulatory protein β1, myeloid DAP12-associating lectin 1, myeloid associated immunoglobulin-like receptor II, CD200 receptor-like 3, and paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor β (8Whittaker G.C. Anderson S.K. McVicar D.W. UCSD-Nature Molecule Pages. 2007; (doi:10.1038/mp.a000750.01)Google Scholar).Supportive of the descriptions of TREM-1 as an amplifier of the septic response, Turnbull et al. (9Turnbull I.R. McDunn J.E. Takai T. Townsend R.R. Cobb J.P. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) described decreased levels of plasma TNFα and IL-6, an attenuated acute phase response, and increased survival during polymicrobial sepsis in Dap12−/− mice. However, Hamerman et al. (9Turnbull I.R. McDunn J.E. Takai T. Townsend R.R. Cobb J.P. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Hamerman J.A. Tchao N.K.

Moreover, these authors showed that bone marrow macrophages also express a TREM-2 ligand and that reconstitution of Dap12−/− macrophages with a TREM-2/DAP12 chimera restores normal inflammatory responses, suggesting that the hyper-responsiveness of Dap12−/− macrophages is due to a lack of TREM-2 signaling (10Hamerman J.A. Tchao N.K. Lowell C.A. Lanier L.L. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This conclusion was confirmed by the recent demonstration of increased in vitro cytokine production in Trem-2−/− macrophages (11Hamerman J.A. Jarjoura J.R. Humphrey M.B. Nakamura M.C. Seaman W.E. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Turnbull I.R. Gilfillan S. Cella M. Aoshi T. Miller M. Piccio L. Hernandez M. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Taken together these findings suggest opposing roles for TREM-1 and -2 during inflammation. Whereas TREM-1 on monocytes and neutrophils acts to amplify the septic response to facilitate the clearance of pathogens, TREM-2 on macrophages suppresses inflammatory responses perhaps to protect the host from endotoxemia and facilitate tissue repair.

McVicar D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In the mouse the TREM family genes form a loose cluster on chromosome 17 and include Trem-1, -2, -3, and -4 (pDC-TREM), an uncharacterized TREM, and TREM-like transcript (Treml-1 and -2). The human gene cluster includes Trem-1 and -2, and Treml1, -2, and -3. Of these genes the receptors encoded by Trem-1 and -2 are the best characterized to date. TREM-1 is selectively expressed by neutrophils and monocytes and is a potent amplifier of pathogenesis associated with microbial sepsis (2Bouchon A. Dietrich J. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 3Bouchon A. Facchetti F. Weigand M.A. Colonna M. Nature. 2001; 410: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). TREM-1 ligation on neutrophils leads to secretion of IL-8 and myeloperoxidase, and co-engagement of TREM-1 during LPS stimulation of monocytes synergistically enhances production of TNFα and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Moreover, inhibition of TREM-1 with soluble receptor protein, small interfering RNA, or antagonistic peptides rescues mice from microbial sepsis and can lessen the severity of experimentally induced colitis (4Schenk M. Bouchon A. Seibold F. Mueller C. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3097-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, TREM-2 is expressed on murine macrophages, microglia, and osteoclasts and has been reported to play a role in the maturation and survival of human dendritic cells by inducing up-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 (5Bouchon A. Hernández-Munain C. Cella M. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Both TREM-1 and 2 associate with, and signal through DAP12, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing transmembrane adapter protein originally identified as a 16-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in NK cells functionally complexed with the non-inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors in humans and their murine counterparts within the Ly-49 gene family (6Lanier L.L.

Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4148-4152PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to NK cells, DAP12 is expressed in a variety of other innate immune cells including granulocytes, blood monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells where it is non-covalently associated with a variety of receptors including signal-regulatory protein β1, myeloid DAP12-associating lectin 1, myeloid associated immunoglobulin-like receptor II, CD200 receptor-like 3, and paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor β (8Whittaker G.C. Anderson S.K. McVicar D.W. UCSD-Nature Molecule Pages. 2007; (doi:10.1038/mp.a000750.01)Google Scholar).Supportive of the descriptions of TREM-1 as an amplifier of the septic response, Turnbull et al. (9Turnbull I.R. McDunn J.E. Takai T. Townsend R.R. Cobb J.P. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) described decreased levels of plasma TNFα and IL-6, an attenuated acute phase response, and increased survival during polymicrobial sepsis in Dap12−/− mice. However, Hamerman et al. (9Turnbull I.R. McDunn J.E. Takai T. Townsend R.R. Cobb J.P. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Hamerman J.A. Tchao N.K.

Moreover, these authors showed that bone marrow macrophages also express a TREM-2 ligand and that reconstitution of Dap12−/− macrophages with a TREM-2/DAP12 chimera restores normal inflammatory responses, suggesting that the hyper-responsiveness of Dap12−/− macrophages is due to a lack of TREM-2 signaling (10Hamerman J.A. Tchao N.K. Lowell C.A. Lanier L.L. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This conclusion was confirmed by the recent demonstration of increased in vitro cytokine production in Trem-2−/− macrophages (11Hamerman J.A. Jarjoura J.R. Humphrey M.B. Nakamura M.C. Seaman W.E.

https://openalex.org/W2057320288,"Background Studies on the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene and gene products have thus far mainly concentrated on the fate of length mutation in the (CTG)n repeat at the DNA level and consequences of repeat expansion at the RNA level in DM1 patients and disease models. Surprisingly little is known about the function of DMPK protein products. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate here that transient expression of one major protein product of the human gene, the hDMPK A isoform with a long tail anchor, results in mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering in the perinuclear region. Clustering occurred in a variety of cell types and was enhanced by an intact tubulin cytoskeleton. In addition to morphomechanical changes, hDMPK A expression induces physiological changes like loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased autophagy activity, and leakage of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space accompanied by apoptosis. Truncation analysis using YFP-hDMPK A fusion constructs revealed that the protein's tail domain was necessary and sufficient to evoke mitochondrial clustering behavior. Conclusion/Significance Our data suggest that the expression level of the DMPK A isoform needs to be tightly controlled in cells where the hDMPK gene is expressed. We speculate that aberrant splice isoform expression might be a codetermining factor in manifestation of specific DM1 features in patients."

We found that early vulnerability in kindergarten is associated with the basic skills that underlie populations of children's academic achievement in reading, writing and math, indicating that the Early Development Instrument permits to predict achievement-related skills four years in advance.The EDI can be used to predict children's educational trends at the population level and can help select early prevention and intervention programs targeting pre-school populations at minimum cost."

Single transgene expressing mammary epithelial cells were shown to reconstitute mammary glands in vivo while immunohistochemical staining identified MaSCs in basal and luminal locations, with preponderance towards the basal position. By quantifying luciferase expression using bioluminescent imaging, we were able to track MaSCs non-invasively in individual mice over time. Using this model to monitor MaSC dynamics throughout pregnancy, we found that MaSCs expand in both total number and percentage during pregnancy and then drop down to or below baseline levels after weaning. However, in a second round of pregnancy, this expansion was not as extensive. These findings validate a powerful system for the analysis of MaSC dynamics in vivo, which will facilitate future characterization of MaSCs during mammary gland development and breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977965949,"Ras proteins play important roles in development especially for cell proliferation and differentiation in various organisms. However, their functions in the most insect species are still not clear. We identified three ras cDNAs from the silk worm, Bombyx mori. These sequences corresponded to three Ras of Drosophila melanogaster, but not to three mammalian Ras (H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras). Subsequently, the expression profiles of ras were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR using whole body of individuals from the embryonic to adult stages, and various tissues of 4th and 5th instar larvae. Each of three Bombyx ras showed different expression patterns. We also showed membrane localization of their products. These results indicate that the three Bombyx Ras are functional and have different roles."
https://openalex.org/W2167495578,"Aberrant activation of signaling pathways drives many of the fundamental biological processes that accompany tumor initiation and progression. Inappropriate phosphorylation of intermediates in these signaling pathways are a frequently observed molecular lesion that accompanies the undesirable activation or repression of pro- and anti-oncogenic pathways. Therefore, methods which directly query signaling pathway activation via phosphorylation assays in individual cancer biopsies are expected to provide important insights into the molecular ""logic"" that distinguishes cancer and normal tissue on one hand, and enables personalized intervention strategies on the other.We first document the largest available set of tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are, individually, differentially phosphorylated in lung cancer, thus providing an immediate set of drug targets. Next, we develop a novel computational methodology to identify pathways whose phosphorylation activity is strongly correlated with the lung cancer phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of classifying lung cancers based on multi-variate phosphorylation signatures.Highly predictive and biologically transparent phosphorylation signatures of lung cancer provide evidence for the existence of a robust set of phosphorylation mechanisms (captured by the signatures) present in the majority of lung cancers, and that reliably distinguish each lung cancer from normal. This approach should improve our understanding of cancer and help guide its treatment, since the phosphorylation signatures highlight proteins and pathways whose phosphorylation should be inhibited in order to prevent unregulated proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2093649990,"The central enzyme of the visual transduction cascade, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6), is regulated by its gamma-subunit (Pgamma), whose inhibitory constraint is released upon binding of activated transducin. It is generally believed that the last four or five C-terminal amino acid residues of Pgamma are responsible for blocking catalysis. In this paper, we showed that the last 10 C-terminal residues (Pgamma78-87) are the minimum required to completely block catalysis. The kinetic mechanism of inhibition by the Pgamma C terminus depends on which substrate is undergoing catalysis. We also discovered a second mechanism of Pgamma inhibition that does not require this C-terminal region and that is capable of inhibiting up to 80% of the maximal cGMP hydrolytic rate. Furthermore, amino acids 63-70 and/or the intact alpha2 helix of Pgamma stabilize binding of C-terminal Pgamma peptides by 100-fold. When PDE6 catalytic subunits were reconstituted with portions of the Pgamma molecule and tested for activation by transducin, we found that the C-terminal region (Pgamma63-87) by itself could not be displaced but that transducin could relieve inhibition of certain Pgamma truncation mutants. Our results are consistent with two distinct mechanisms of Pgamma inhibition of PDE6. One involves direct interaction of the C-terminal residues with the catalytic site. A second regulatory mechanism may involve binding of other regions of Pgamma to the catalytic domain, thereby allosterically reducing the catalytic rate. Transducin activation of PDE6 appears to require interaction with both the C terminus and other regions of Pgamma to effectively relieve its inhibitory constraint."
https://openalex.org/W2066908987,"Background Observing competitive games such as sports is a pervasive entertainment among humans. The inclination to watch others play may be based on our social-cognitive ability to understand the internal states of others. The mirror neuron system, which is activated when a subject observes the actions of others, as well as when they perform the same action themselves, seems to play a crucial role in this process. Our previous study showed that activity of the mirror neuron system was modulated by the outcome of the subject's favored player during observation of a simple competitive game (rock-paper-scissors). However, whether the mirror neuron system responds similarly in a more complex and naturalistic sports game has not yet been fully investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we measured the activity of motor areas when the subjects, who were amateur baseball field players (non-pitchers), watched short movie clips of scenes in professional baseball games. The subjects were instructed to support either a batter or a pitcher when observing the movie clip. The results showed that activity in the motor area exhibited a strong interaction between the subject's supported side (batter or pitcher) and the outcome (a hit or an out). When the subject supported the batter, motor area activity was significantly higher when the batter made an out than when he made a hit. However, such modulation was not apparent when the subject supported the pitcher. Conclusions/Significance This result indicates that mirror neuron system activity is modulated by the outcome for a particular player in a competitive game even when observing a complex and naturalistic sports game. We suggest that our inclination to watch competitive games is facilitated by this characteristic of the mirror neuron system."
https://openalex.org/W2134405284,"Markov segmentation is a method of identifying compositionally different subsequences in a given symbolic sequence. We have applied this technique to the DNA sequence of the human X chromosome to analyze its compositional structure. The human X chromosome is known to have acquired DNA through distinct evolutionary events and is believed to be composed of five evolutionary strata. In addition, in female mammals all copies of X chromosome in excess of one are transcriptionally inactivated. The location of a gene is correlated with its ability to undergo inactivation, but correlations between evolutionary strata and inactivation domains are less clear. Our analysis provides an accurate estimate of the location of stratum boundaries and gives a high-resolution map of compositionally different regions on the X chromosome. This leads to the identification of a novel stratum, as well as segments wherein a group of genes either undergo inactivation or escape inactivation in toto. We identify oligomers that appear to be unique to inactivation domains alone."
https://openalex.org/W2098008218,"The extinct Huia (Heteralocha acutirostris) of New Zealand represents the most extreme example of beak dimorphism known in birds. We used a combination of nuclear genotyping methods, molecular sexing, and morphometric analyses of museum specimens collected in the late 19(th) and early 20(th) centuries to quantify the sexual dimorphism and population structure of this extraordinary species. We report that the classical description of Huia as having distinctive sex-linked morphologies is not universally correct. Four Huia, sexed as females had short beaks and, on this basis, were indistinguishable from males. Hence, we suggest it is likely that Huia males and females were indistinguishable as juveniles and that the well-known beak dimorphism is the result of differential beak growth rates in males and females. Furthermore, we tested the prediction that the social organisation and limited powers of flight of Huia resulted in high levels of population genetic structure. Using a suite of microsatellite DNA loci, we report high levels of genetic diversity in Huia, and we detected no significant population genetic structure. In addition, using mitochondrial hypervariable region sequences, and likely mutation rates and generation times, we estimated that the census population size of Huia was moderately high. We conclude that the social organization and limited powers of flight did not result in a highly structured population."
