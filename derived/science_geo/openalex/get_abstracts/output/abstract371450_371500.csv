https://openalex.org/W1981737644,"Hippocampal place cells encode spatial information in rate and temporal codes. To examine the mechanisms underlying hippocampal coding, here we measured the intracellular dynamics of place cells by combining in vivo whole-cell recordings with a virtual-reality system. Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation. As we move around, spatial information is encoded and processed by 'place' cells in the hippocampus. Each of these neurons increases its firing rate when situated in its 'place', thus equating rate coding with location. The firing patterns of hippocampal place cells have been studied extensively over the past 40 years and theoretical models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms responsible for encoding place and time in neural circuits. Now the development of techniques allowing intracellular recording from place cells in awake, behaving mice navigating a virtual reality maze makes it possible to test these models. Initial results point to the existence of two subthreshold signatures of place fields: an increase in the amplitude of membrane potential oscillations at theta frequencies and a ramp-like depolarization of baseline membrane potential. As we navigate, spatial information is encoded in both rate and temporal codes by place cells located in the hippocampus. To investigate the origin of these codes, the intracellular dynamics of place cells are now measured in vivo in awake mice navigating a virtual-reality environment. Three subthreshold signatures of place fields are identified that underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes."

https://openalex.org/W2114050989,"CCL2 and interleukin (IL)-6 are among the most prevalent cytokines in the tumor microenvironment, with expression generally correlating with tumor progression and metastasis. CCL2 and IL-6 induced expression of each other in CD11b+ cells isolated from human peripheral blood. It was demonstrated that both cytokines induce up-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins cFLIPL (cellular caspase-8 (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein), Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL and inhibit the cleavage of caspase-8 and subsequent activation of the caspase-cascade, thus protecting cells from apoptosis under serum deprivation stress. Furthermore, both cytokines induced hyperactivation of autophagy in these cells. Upon CCL2 or IL-6 stimulation, CD11b+ cells demonstrated a significant increase in the mannose receptor (CD206) and the CD14+/CD206+ double-positive cells, suggesting a polarization of macrophages toward the CD206+ M2-type phenotype. Caspase-8 inhibitors mimicked the cytokine-induced up-regulation of autophagy and M2 polarization. Furthermore, E64D and leupeptin, which are able to function as inhibitors of autophagic degradation, reversed the effect of caspase-8 inhibitors in the M2-macrophage polarization, indicating a role of autophagy in this mechanism. Additionally, in patients with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic lesions exhibited an increased CD14+/CD206+ double-positive cell population compared with normal tissues. Altogether, these findings suggest a role for CCL2 and IL-6 in the survival of myeloid monocytes recruited to the tumor microenvironment and their differentiation toward tumor-promoting M2-type macrophages via inhibition of caspase-8 cleavage and enhanced autophagy.

IntroductionThe recruitment of migratory hematopoietic cells, including tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, to the supporting stroma is essential in the progression and metastasis of tumors (1.Balkwill F.

Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10947) Google Scholar). Resident macrophages are derived from monocytic precursor cells, which are released from the bone marrow and circulate in the blood stream until signaled to differentiate within target tissues, typically through interactions with cytokines and colony-stimulating factors (1.Balkwill F.

Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 2The abbreviations used are: TAMtumor-associated macrophageILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIpropidium iodideFSCforward scatterSSCside scattermAbmonoclonal antibodyPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePEphycoerythrincFLIPcellular caspase-8 (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein. perform a variety of functions essential for inflammation and tissue/matrix remodeling (3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Most malignant solid tumors contain a large number of TAMs that operate to attract additional macrophages to the developing cancer and also produce numerous growth factors, proteases, and cytokines that promote a more favorable tumor microenvironment (2.Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10947) Google Scholar, 3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J.

Cancer. 2004; 4: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar).An increase in TAM density characteristically potentiates tumor progression (3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). However, macrophage responses are diverse and multifaceted and therefore also exhibit anti-tumorigenic capacity (1.Balkwill F. Mantovani A. Lancet. 2001; 357: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5893) Google Scholar, 3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J.

Benelli R. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The malleability of macrophage function is vastly dependant upon pro- and anti-tumorigenic signals from the local tumor microenvironment, and the resulting macrophage-mediated tissue morphogenesis is therefore reliant not only upon TAM abundance but also upon the specific subset of macrophages expressed (2.Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10947) Google Scholar, 4.Pollard J.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 6.Mantovani A.

Mantovani A. Lancet. 2001; 357: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5893) Google Scholar). However, the TAM phenotype varies with the progression of tumor development. Although the proinflammatory, “classically activated,” M1-type macrophage phenotype predominates at sites of inflammation, tumor progression promotes a phenotypic switch in which TAMs exhibit a more immunosuppressive M2-type phenotype, which promotes tumor growth, survival, and metastasis (7.Murdoch C. Muthana M. Coffelt S.B. Lewis C.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 618-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 8.Sica A. Schioppa T. Mantovani A. Allavena P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). “Alternatively activated” M2 macrophages are typically induced by interaction with IL-4, IL-13, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor and result in the production and recruitment of angiogenic cytokines and chemokines (7.Murdoch C. Muthana M. Coffelt S.B. Lewis C.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 618-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 9.Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Locati M. Allavena P. Sica A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar).The mannose receptor CD206 was initially identified as part of a tissue-protective mechanism against inflammatory damage through the removal of mannosyl glycoconjugate ligands, including lysosomal hydrolases, both in vitro and in vivo (10.East L. Isacke C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 11.Taylor P.R. Gordon S. Martinez-Pomares L. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Additionally, in accordance with the M2-type phenotype, mannose receptor activity is increased in response to IL-4 and IL-13 and is inhibited by interferon-γ (10.East L. Isacke C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 12.Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4653) Google Scholar). Consequently, mannose receptor, which has been shown to be highly expressed by TAMs, is a key marker for the differential activation of the protumorigenic M2-type macrophage phenotype (9.Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Locati M. Allavena P. Sica A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar).The CC chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) is one of the most frequently observed chemokines in a wide range of tumors and has been suggested to be one of the principle determinants of human tumor macrophage content (9.Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Locati M. Allavena P. Sica A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar, 13.Mantovani A. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). CCL2 is abundantly expressed by macrophages and fibroblasts and by both endothelial and tumor cells (3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 13.Mantovani A. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). In certain carcinomas, CCL2 has also shown strong correlations to TAM accumulation and has been suggested to be involved in Th2 polarization (14.Gu L. Tseng S. Horner R.M. Tam C. Loda M. Rollins B.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) while increasing levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-8, indicating its close involvement in tumorigenic progression (3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 5.Brigati C. Noonan D.M. Albini A. Benelli R. Clin. Exp.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that CCL2 is one of the most prevalent cytokines in the microenvironment of prostate cancer bone metastases and has a significant impact on the promotion of survival mechanisms in prostate cancer, PC3 cells in vitro (15.Roca H. Varsos Z. Pienta K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25057-25073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16.Roca H. Varsos Z.S. Mizutani K. Pienta K.J.

Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Consequently, an understanding of the cytokine/chemokine-mediated cellular responses that promote cell survival and macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment has broad therapeutic implications. Here, the survival and activation of CD11b+ myeloid monocytes, isolated from human peripheral blood, was investigated.DISCUSSIONIn the tumor microenvironment, cross-talk between malignant cells and infiltrates of hematopoietic origin is critical in tumor progression and metastasis. By altering chemokine expression, tumor cells influence the recruitment of circulating inflammatory cells, which in turn secrete a wide array of cytokines and other factors that promote cancer growth and survival (2.Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10947) Google Scholar). Macrophages that derive from circulating monocytic myeloid precursors are a major component of leukocyte infiltrate in tumors (6.Mantovani A. Bottazzi B. Colotta F. Sozzani S. Ruco L. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). It is increasingly appreciated that TAMs are vital constituents of solid tumors and have been shown to be generally correlated with tumor progression and metastasis as well as poor clinical outcomes (3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Additionally, an increasing number of reports implicate CCL2, a chemokine central in the recruitment monocytes/macrophages to sites of inflammation, in cancer progression and metastasis (29.Loberg R.D. Ying C. Craig M. Day L.L. Sargent E. Neeley C. Wojno K. Snyder L.A. Yan L. Pienta K.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9417-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 30.Conti I. Rollins B.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Previously, we discovered a protective role of CCL2 in prostate cancer cells (15.Roca H. Varsos Z. Pienta K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25057-25073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); here we present the effect of this chemokine on the survival and activation of primary CD11b+ monocytes isolated from human peripheral blood.CCL2 is widely expressed in a variety of tumors (sarcomas, gliomas, and cervical, ovarian, bladder, breast, and lung tumors) (3.Bingle L. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 6.Mantovani A. Bottazzi B. Colotta F. Sozzani S. Ruco L. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), and more recently, it was found that it is also largely expressed in the tumors of prostate cancer bone metastasis (17.Loberg R.D. Day L.L. Harwood J. Ying C. St John L.N. Giles R. Neeley C.K. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that CCL2 is also expressed by human CD11b+ cells isolated from peripheral blood, which are composed mainly of monocytes (more than 80%). In these cells, IL-6, which is typically expressed by many cancer cells including prostate (31.Siegall C.B. Schwab G. Nordan R.P. FitzGerald D.J. Pastan I. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7786-7788PubMed Google Scholar), was only detected at very low levels; however, upon stimulation with CCL2 a 5-fold increase in the expression of IL-6 was observed. Similarly, a 2-fold induction of CCL2 was achieved when cells were treated with IL-6 (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings have important implications in the tumor microenvironment, where CCL2 could reach high concentrations, because multiple cells (macrophages, tumor, stromal, and endothelial) contribute to the expression of this chemokine (17.Loberg R.D. Day L.L. Harwood J. Ying C. St John L.N. Giles R. Neeley C.K. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30.Conti I. Rollins B.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IL-6 also has the potential to stimulate tumor cell proliferation and survival (32.Cavarretta I.T. Neuwirt H. Untergasser G. Moser P.L. Zaki M.H. Steiner H. Rumpold H. Fuchs D. Hobisch A. Nemeth J.A. Culig Z. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2822-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33.Tricot G. Lancet. 2000; 355: 248-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This amplification loop between CCL2 and IL-6 could have a direct effect not only in the CD11b+ infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (including TAMs), but also in malignant cell proliferation and survival acting in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.It was further demonstrated that both CCL2 and IL-6 inhibit apoptosis to promote CD11b+ cell survival under serum deprivation stress (Fig. 2, A–C). In fact, stimulation with either CCL2 or IL-6 inhibited the activation of the caspase cascade, detected as reduced cleavage product of caspase-8 (Asp391), caspase-6 (Asp162), caspase-3 (Asp175), caspase-7 (Asp198), and the subsequent lamin A (Asp230) (Fig. 2D). The activation of caspase-8 but not caspase-9 suggested that apoptosis was predominantly mediated by a death receptor (extrinsic) pathway, which typically results in the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 and involves the stimulation of members of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (34.Degterev A. Yuan J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 378-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These results correlate with previous reports showing that human monocytes cultured in vitro undergo apoptosis mediated by Fas-Fas ligand interaction in a process that can be accelerated and enhanced by the removal of serum (35.Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Starling G.C. Mehlin C. Klebanoff S.J. Ledbetter J.A. Liles W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that CCL2 and IL-6 induce the up-regulation of cFLIP (Fig. 2E). cFLIP was previously identified as an important regulator of apoptosis that is expressed as two alternative splice forms, cFLIPs (short) and cFLIPL (long) (19.Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schröter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). cFLIPL was the only isoform detected by immunoblotting and was up-regulated by CCL2 and IL-6 in CD11b+ cells. It has been demonstrated that cFLIPL can interact with the adaptor protein FADD and caspase-8 to inhibit apoptosis induced by death receptors (19.Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schröter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 36.Kataoka T. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 25: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast to monocytes that express very low levels of cFLIP and are highly sensitive to CD95-induced death, macrophages express substantial amounts of cFLIP and are more resistant to cell death (37.Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Georganas C. Mano T. Walsh K. Pope R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the up-regulation of cFLIPL, induced by CCL2 or IL-6, could protect the monocytes recruited to the tumor microenvironment, allowing their differentiation into mature macrophages. On the other hand, the stimulation of CD11b+ cells with CCL2 or IL-6 does not involve the up-regulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (also known as CSF-1) (Fig. 1, A and B), which has been identified to promote survival of macrophages and the pro-tumor function of these cells (38.Lin E.Y. Nguyen A.V. Russell R.G. Pollard J.W. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 39.Nowicki A. Szenajch J. Ostrowska G. Wojtowicz A. Wojtowicz K. Kruszewski A.A. Maruszynski M. Aukerman S.L. Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that CCL2 and IL-6 could play a crucial role (independently of macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in the survival of TAMs in human tumors, where macrophage populations are generally not sustained by in situ proliferation (6.Mantovani A. Bottazzi B. Colotta F. Sozzani S. Ruco L. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In support of these findings, it has been demonstrated that IL-6-deficient mice showed a defective recruitment of macrophages to the tumor site and a reduced incidence of myeloma (1.Balkwill F. Mantovani A. Lancet. 2001; 357: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5893) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-6 has been suggested to push myeloid precursors toward a macrophage-like phenotype and inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells, creating a microenvironment that potentiates the progression of metastatic tumors (40.Menetrier-Caux C. Montmain G. Dieu M.C. Bain C. Favrot M.C. Caux C. Blay J.Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 4778-4791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Katsenelson N.S. Shurin G.V. Bykovskaia S.N. Shogan J. Shurin M.R. Mod. Pathol. 2001; 14: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The results presented here also demonstrate that CCL2 and IL-6 induce the activation of M2-type macrophages, characterized by the expression of the plasma membrane receptor CD14 and the increased expression of mannose receptor CD206 (Fig. 5, A–D). Previous studies suggest that macrophages use CD14 to bind apoptotic cells before engaging receptors that drive phagocytosis, and the dying cells are cleared without inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (42.Devitt A. Moffatt O.D. Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simmons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is strong evidence that mannose receptor can mediate phagocytosis in an actin-dependent manner, a process that plays a critical role in tissue remodeling (43.Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar, 44.Kruskal B.A. Sastry K. Warner A.B. Mathieu C.E. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of mannose receptor has also been associated with the removal of lysosomal hydrolases and neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase that could reduce tissue damage during inflammation (45.Shepherd V.L. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 46.Stahl P. Schlesinger P.H. Sigardson E. Rodman J.S. Lee Y.C. Cell. 1980; 19: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These functions of mannose receptor are associated with the function of polarized M2 macrophages. TAMs predominantly function similarly to M2 macrophages, express high levels of mannose receptor, and promote tumor progression and metastasis (9.Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Locati M. Allavena P. Sica A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar). Because prostate cancer patients display an increased polarized cell population of CD14+/CD206+ in the metastatic lesions, as compared with normal tissues (Fig. 7), these findings strongly support the idea that the progression of metastatic tumors requires the activation of infiltrated macrophages that develop M2-type function.The dual role of CCL2 and IL-6 in the protection of monocytes from apoptosis and induction of M2-type macrophage activation suggests a possible molecular link between these two mechanisms. Considering that caspase-8 has been suggested to play a central role in lymphocyte activation (28.Chun H.J. Zheng L. Ahmad M. Wang J. Speirs C.K. Siegel R.M. Dale J.K. Puck J. Davis J. Hall C.G. Skoda-Smith S. Atkinson T.P. Straus S.E. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 2002; 419: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), it is suspected that the inhibition of caspase-8 cleavage by these cytokines could be essential in macrophage polarization. In fact, the inhibition of caspase-8 cleavage in human monocytes by using caspase-8 inhibitors induced a significant increase in the CD206+ and the double-positive CD14+/CD206+ cell populations, mimicking the effect of CCL2 and IL-6 (Fig. 6, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that cFLIPL, which is induced by both CCL2 and IL-6 (Fig. 2E), could also promote the activation of full-length caspase-8 but then restricts the degree of caspase-8 activation to a moderate nonapoptotic range as previously reported (47.Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that a nonapoptotic molecular form of caspase-8 plays an important role in the regulation of other cellular mechanisms, we surmise that this molecule could also mediate macrophage activation; however, this hypothesis merits further investigation.Because autophagy is activated as a direct response to starvation, the relationship between this mechanism, apoptosis, and macrophage activation was further analyzed. Surprisingly, CCL2 and IL-6 induced a marked up-regulation of autophagy (Fig. 3, A and B). The significant increase in autophagosome formation and autophagic degradation induced by CCL2 and IL-6 (and mimicked by caspase-8 inhibitors), suggests that autophagy may play an active role in the activation of macrophages. This hypothesis was investigated by using E64D and leupeptin, which are able to function as inhibitors of autophagic degradation (Fig. 6B). When these inhibitors were added in combination with caspase-8 inhibitors, they induced a marked decrease in the CD206+ and the double-positive CD14+/CD206+ cell populations to levels comparable with those of control cells (Fig. 6, C–G), suggesting that autophagy plays a significant role in M2 macrophage polarization. This process provides not only an additional source of nutrients and energy but also promotes the suppression of inflammation and supports tissue remodeling and repair, consistent with the function of M2 macrophages. Thus, CCL2 and IL-6 not only protect monocytes/macrophages from cell death but also facilitate the execution of the effective clearance of dying cells and other macromolecules. Additionally, the finding that caspase-8 inhibition substantially increases autophagy provides another example of a role that this molecule plays in the modulation of autophagic signaling (48.Yu L.

However, a more detailed elucidation of this mechanism requires further investigation.Altogether these findings reveal how CCL2 and IL-6, by inducing each other, potentiate their tumor-promoting roles, not only by protecting tumor infiltrating monocytes, but also by inducing myeloid-monocyte activation toward M2 macrophages (depicted in Fig. 8). Furthermore, this cytokine-mediated hyperinduction of autophagy enhances the M2-type phagocytic functions that promote tumor growth: clearance of dying cells, tissue remodeling, and repair. Thus, a combined target of these cytokines may represent a valid strategy in cancer therapeutics. IntroductionThe recruitment of migratory hematopoietic cells, including tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, to the supporting stroma is essential in the progression and metastasis of tumors (1.Balkwill F.

Resident macrophages are derived from monocytic precursor cells, which are released from the bone marrow and circulate in the blood stream until signaled to differentiate within target tissues, typically through interactions with cytokines and colony-stimulating factors (1.Balkwill F.

Most malignant solid tumors contain a large number of TAMs that operate to attract additional macrophages to the developing cancer and also produce numerous growth factors, proteases, and cytokines that promote a more favorable tumor microenvironment (2.Coussens L.M.

https://openalex.org/W2068727148,"Asymmetric divisions of radial glia progenitors produce self-renewing radial glia and differentiating cells simultaneously in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the developing neocortex. Whereas differentiating cells leave the VZ to constitute the future neocortex, renewing radial glia progenitors stay in the VZ for subsequent divisions. The differential behaviour of progenitors and their differentiating progeny is essential for neocortical development; however, the mechanisms that ensure these behavioural differences are unclear. Here we show that asymmetric centrosome inheritance regulates the differential behaviour of renewing progenitors and their differentiating progeny in the embryonic mouse neocortex. Centrosome duplication in dividing radial glia progenitors generates a pair of centrosomes with differently aged mother centrioles. During peak phases of neurogenesis, the centrosome retaining the old mother centriole stays in the VZ and is preferentially inherited by radial glia progenitors, whereas the centrosome containing the new mother centriole mostly leaves the VZ and is largely associated with differentiating cells. Removal of ninein, a mature centriole-specific protein, disrupts the asymmetric segregation and inheritance of the centrosome and causes premature depletion of progenitors from the VZ. These results indicate that preferential inheritance of the centrosome with the mature older mother centriole is required for maintaining radial glia progenitors in the developing mammalian neocortex."

https://openalex.org/W2139116236,"The transport of electrically charged quasiparticles (based on electrons or ions) plays a pivotal role in modern technology as well as in determining the essential functions of biological organisms. In contrast, the transport of magnetic charges has barely been explored experimentally, mainly because magnetic charges, in contrast to electric ones, are generally considered at best to be convenient macroscopic parameters, rather than well-defined quasiparticles. However, it was recently proposed that magnetic charges can exist in certain materials in the form of emergent excitations that manifest like point charges, or magnetic monopoles. Here we address the question of whether such magnetic charges and their associated currents-'magnetricity'-can be measured directly in experiment, without recourse to any material-specific theory. By mapping the problem onto Onsager's theory of electrolytes, we show that this is indeed possible, and devise an appropriate method for the measurement of magnetic charges and their dynamics. Using muon spin rotation as a suitable local probe, we apply the method to a real material, the 'spin ice' Dy(2)Ti(2)O(7) (refs 5-8). Our experimental measurements prove that magnetic charges exist in this material, interact via a Coulomb potential, and have measurable currents. We further characterize deviations from Ohm's law, and determine the elementary unit of magnetic charge to be 5 mu(B) A(-1), which is equal to that recently predicted using the microscopic theory of spin ice. Our measurement of magnetic charge and magnetic current establishes an instance of a perfect symmetry between electricity and magnetism."
https://openalex.org/W2034475135,"Alpha-amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as components of medicinally active molecules and chiral catalysts. Efficient chemo-enzymatic methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched alpha-amino acids have been developed, but it is still a challenge to obtain non-natural amino acids. Alkene hydrogenation is broadly useful for the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of many classes of amino acids, but it is not possible to obtain alpha-amino acids bearing aryl or quaternary alkyl alpha-substituents using this method. The Strecker synthesis-the reaction of an imine or imine equivalent with hydrogen cyanide, followed by nitrile hydrolysis-is an especially versatile chemical method for the synthesis of racemic alpha-amino acids. Asymmetric Strecker syntheses using stoichiometric amounts of a chiral reagent have been applied successfully on gram-to-kilogram scales, yielding enantiomerically enriched alpha-amino acids. In principle, Strecker syntheses employing sub-stoichiometric quantities of a chiral reagent could provide a practical alternative to these approaches, but the reported catalytic asymmetric methods have seen limited use on preparative scales (more than a gram). The limited utility of existing catalytic methods may be due to several important factors, including the relatively complex and precious nature of the catalysts and the requisite use of hazardous cyanide sources. Here we report a new catalytic asymmetric method for the syntheses of highly enantiomerically enriched non-natural amino acids using a simple chiral amido-thiourea catalyst to control the key hydrocyanation step. This catalyst is robust, without sensitive functional groups, so it is compatible with aqueous cyanide salts, which are safer and easier to handle than other cyanide sources; this makes the method adaptable to large-scale synthesis. We have used this new method to obtain enantiopure amino acids that are not readily prepared by enzymatic methods or by chemical hydrogenation."

The question of how these peptides reach the cytoplasm of cells is still widely debated. Herein, we have used a mass spectrometry-based method that enables quantification of internalized and membrane-bound peptides. Internalization of the most used CPP was studied at 37 °C (endocytosis and translocation) and 4 °C (translocation) in wild type and proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both translocation and endocytosis are internalization pathways used by CPP. The choice of one pathway versus the other depends on the peptide sequence (not the number of positive changes), the extracellular peptide concentration, and the membrane components. There is no relationship between the high affinity of these peptides for the cell membrane and their internalization efficacy. Translocation occurs at low extracellular peptide concentration, whereas endocytosis, a saturable and cooperative phenomenon, is activated at higher concentrations.

Among them, Antp, Tat-(48–60), and oligoarginine peptides are the most intensively studied. Despite the wide use of these CPPs as macromolecular delivery devices, the internalization mechanism of these peptides in cells still remains largely controversial. The energy dependence of the internalization mechanism is unique because all endocytotic pathways are inhibited at low temperature. Consequently, at low temperature, internalization likely reflects a direct translocation mechanism. Early studies proposed that Antp enters cells by an energy-independent membrane translocation mechanism (1.Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This first analysis was then contradicted by other studies that suggested, with the use of inhibitors, the involvement of endocytosis in the cellular internalization of cell-penetrating peptides (2.Duchardt F.

The hypothesis that endocytosis was the only internalization mechanism of CPP resulted from studies examining whether the temperature or the binding to cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were critical for peptide internalization. Most of these interpretations resulted from fluorescence microscopy data. For instance, it was reported that Antp, Tat, and oligoarginine peptides were not efficiently internalized in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant pgsA-745 cell line, which does not produce cell-surface heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate (5.Console S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, recent data indicates that Tat-mediated transduction occurs in the absence of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (7.Gump J.M. Dowdy S.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The discrepancies observed between studies may be explained in part by different incubation conditions (peptide/cells ratio and peptide concentration) (8.Hällbrink M. Oehlke J. Papsdorf G. Bienert M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1667: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), limits in fluorescence imaging, such as quenching (9.Ziegler A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8138-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or fluorophore-dependent intracellular trafficking (10.Puckett C.A. Barton J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8738-8739Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), as well as the possibility that endocytosis inhibitors might have nonspecific effects (11.Ivanov A.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 440: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Altogether, the existence of multiple internalization pathways was often suggested rather than demonstrated (12.Lee H.L. Dubikovskaya E.A. Hwang H. Semyonov A.N. Wang H. Jones L.R. Twieg R.J. Moerner W.E. Wender P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 9364-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using the mass spectrometry-based protocol we have reported to quantify the cellular uptake of peptides (13.Burlina F. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Chassaing G. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14.Burlina F. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Chassaing G. Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2005; 44: 4244-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we have analyzed herein the internalization and the membrane-binding of CPPs to wild type CHO (K1) and GAG-deficient CHO (pgsA-745) cells. Internalization and membrane-binding have been studied at 37 °C (endocytosis and translocation) and 4 °C (translocation). Cell-penetrating peptides with a different number of positively charged amino acids (see Fig. 1) were studied: (+7), Antp; (+7), an Antp analogue P1; (+7), (RW)9; (+8), Tat; and (+9), Arg9. To clarify the internalization mechanisms, kinetics of Antp analogue P1 internalization, the role of the extracellular peptide concentration, together with the impact of a specific phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) intracellular membrane binder on peptide internalization were also analyzed with the two cell types. Analysis of CPP intracellular distribution also has been visualized by confocal microscopy imaging. Our results clearly demonstrate that cell-penetrating peptides use endocytosis and translocation to internalize into cells. The balance between the two pathways depends strongly on the peptide sequence (and not directly on the number of positive charges), on the extracellular peptide concentration, and on the negatively charged cell-surface components, GAGs. In addition, the high affinity of cell-penetrating peptides for cell-surface components is not related to their internalization efficiency. Surprisingly, not only endocytosis but also translocation occurred within a restricted time window, an observation that gave evidence for a cell-penetrating peptide/lipid co-transport limiting step. Finally, GAG-mediated endocytosis is a cooperative and saturable process. Together, these results shed new light on the mechanisms of cell-penetrating peptide internalization and on the associated membrane components.

Wild type (CHO-K1) and xylose transferase-deficient (pgsA745) Chinese hamster ovary cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity in F12 growth medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, amphotericin B, and 100 units/ml of penicillin G. The internalization experiments were performed as described previously (13.Burlina F. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Chassaing G. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14.Burlina F. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Chassaing G. Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2005; 44: 4244-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All cell-penetrating peptides contained an isotope tag on the N terminus (Biotin-GGGG or msr; see Figs. 1 and 2) to allow absolute quantification by MALDI-TOF MS. CPPs were synthesized with the nondeuterated (1H-peptide) and deuterated tag (2H-peptide). One million adherent cells were incubated with the cell- penetrating 1H-peptide in culture medium (without fetal calf serum) at 4 or 37 °C (see Fig. 2). After washing with culture medium, trypsin or pronase was added to degrade the remaining extracellular and membrane-bound peptide and to detach cells. After addition of enzyme inhibitors mixed with bovine serum albumin cells were transferred to a microtube, centrifuged, and washed with Tris buffer. The cells were then lysed in a solution containing a controlled and relevant quantity of the chemically identical deuterated form (2H) of the CPP (which served as internal standard to quantify the internalized amount of 1H-CPP). The sample was then boiled for 15 min to kill protease activity and to destroy potential CPP intracellular partners molecular interactions. The CPPs (1H and 2H) were then purified with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads eluted in the α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix before MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The amount of intact internalized peptide was calculated from the area ratio of the [M + H+] signals of intact 1H-peptide and 2H-peptide. The 1H- and 2H-peptides were separated by 8 atomic mass units, so there was no overlap of their signals on the mass spectra. As for standard quantity, we found quantification to be more accurate when the 1H-CPP/2H-CPP signals ratio ranged from 0.2 to 5. In addition, for each experiment, we used duplicate or triplicate wells, and the experiments were repeated independently at least three times, as indicated in the figures. Amounts of intact peptide from ∼0.5 pmol could be measured without upper limit. This corresponds to intracellular concentrations of ∼0.5 μm (mean volume of one CHO cell, 1 picoliter). For neomycin assays, cells were preincubated for 30 min with 10 mm of neomycin, prior to peptide incubation. For all assays, after peptide incubation, cells were washed three times with 1 ml DMEM, treated with trypsin (37 °C) as described previously, or with 0.05% pronase (37 or 4 °C) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (positive ion reflector mode) on a Voyager DEPRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). 7.5 × 104 cells were cultured on coverglass in 24-well plates in DMEM. After washing with culture medium DMEM, cells were incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of 5 μm of the biotinylated peptide at the indicated temperature. Cells were then labeled as described (16.Dupont E. Prochiantz A. Joliot A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CLSM was performed on an inverted LSM510 laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). A sialic acid quantification kit was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CHO cells were harvested from confluent 225 cm2 tissue culture flasks. Sialic acid was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm according to the manufacturer's protocol. Internalization was studied at the kinetic plateau previously determined to be ∼30–45 min (15.Delaroche D. Aussedat B. Aubry S. Chassaing G. Burlina F. Clodic G. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the peptides Antp, P1, (R/W)9, R9, and Tat (Fig. 1) were incubated for 60 min, with cells at 37 °C before quantification by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 2). As the protocol of quantification was first settled down with trypsin, we had to assay another enzyme that could digest peptides at 4 °C. Therefore, the quantification protocol has been first assayed at 37 °C with trypsin or pronase in parallel. Similar intracellular peptide quantities were measured with trypsin (Fig. 3A) or pronase (Fig. 3B) in the two cell lines, with the exception of R9. Indeed, after pronase digestion, the amount of cell-associated R9 was twice the value obtained after trypsin digestion. However, this 2-fold increase was observed in the two cell lines. Therefore, pronase was used for further quantification performed in parallel at 4 and 37 °C in wild type and xylose transferase-deficient cells. In CHO-K1 cells, internalization of the different cell-penetrating peptides was differently affected by the temperature decrease (Fig. 3B). Indeed, when temperature was decreased to 4 °C, the internalization of 5 μm Antp or its analogue P1 was significantly inhibited by 68%, whereas for R9 and (R/W)9, internalization was reduced by 49 and 90%, respectively. In contrast, the decrease in Tat entry was not found significant. The situation was different with mutant GAG-deficient cells, in which the internalization of R9, Tat, and P1 was slightly affected by decreasing the temperature from 37 to 4 °C, whereas Antp and (R/W)9 internalization was inhibited by 42 and 90%, respectively. Altogether, with the exception of (R/W)9 and R9, the quantity of peptide internalized at 4 °C in wild type cells was found very similar to the quantity internalized in mutant cells at 37 and 4 °C. Peptides were also incubated for 60 min with cells, but trypsin or pronase digestion was omitted. In this experiment, the amounts measured thus corresponded to the sum of the internalized peptide as well as the peptide bound to the membrane, which could not be eliminated with DMEM washing (Fig. 3C). With the exception of (R/W)9, decreasing the temperature from 37 to 4 °C led to an increase in membrane-bound peptides, to the same extent in wild type and xylose transferase-deficient cells: 4-fold for Antp, 1.5-fold for P1, 2.5-fold for R9, and 9-fold for Tat. In contrast, the affinity of (R/W)9 was not significantly different for the two membrane cell lines. We further analyzed the effects of temperature on internalization in the two cell lines (Fig. 4). The kinetics of internalization were analyzed with the Antp analogue P1, which behaved similarly to Antp in terms of temperature-dependent internalization in the two cell lines. This Antp analogue has the great advantage of having higher internalization quantity than the original peptide. Therefore, discrete differences in internalization kinetics would be better perceived with this peptide. As shown in Fig. 3A, the internalization rate and efficacy in wild type cells were temperature-dependent. Indeed, at 37 °C, the internalization kinetics reached the steady state after 50 min with a final intracellular concentration of ∼12 μm. At 4 °C, the uptake kinetics was slowed down and reached a plateau after 60 min. However, the internalized peptide concentration at the plateau was 3-fold less than that measured at 37 °C, which was 4 μm. A different situation occurred with mutant cells. At 37 °C, the plateau was attained after 30 min with an internalized maximal concentration of 4 μm. At 4 °C, the rate of internalization was similar to the one observed in wild type cells. The kinetics of entry reached the steady state after 60 min, which corresponded to 4 μm of internalized peptide. Kinetic analysis of the membrane-associated Antp analogue P1 is shown in Fig. 4B. For incubation times over 20 min, the amount of membrane-bound peptide was always superior with CHO-K1 cells than with mutant cells. Additionally, a slightly higher affinity of P1 for the cell membrane was observed at 4 °C when compared with 37 °C, in both cell types. To further dissect the mechanisms involved in the internalization of the Antp analogue P1 in wild type and mutant cells, we have followed the internalized peptide as a function of the extracellular peptide concentration (Fig. 4). We have used (Fig. 4C) peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 μm. In wild type cells, internalization according to extracellular peptide concentrations could be fitted to a cooperative sigmoidal-like curve that did not saturate (Fig. 4C). In contrast, in mutant cells, internalization according to the extracellular concentration best fitted a linear regression line (y = 1.2x, r = 0.91). At concentrations below 2 μm and higher than 5 μm, the two curves were parallel lines, merging below 2 μm and being equidistant above 5 μm. This observation demonstrated that the role of heparan and chondroitin sulfate in internalization was limited and saturating. When the two curves were subtracted, a pure cooperative and saturating sigmoidal curve could indeed be observed (Fig. 4C). Therefore, at concentrations below 2 μm, the internalization efficiency was the same in wild type and mutant cells. Similarly, the amount of membrane-bound peptide was measured as a function of extracellular peptide concentrations in the two cell lines (Fig. 4D). The quantity of membrane-bound peptide was found to be concentration-dependent and reached a maximum at 5 μm extracellular peptide concentration in wild type cells. In contrast, in mutant cells, saturation of the membrane binding sites was attained with 2 μm extracellular peptide concentration. At concentrations above 5 μm, the membrane binding sites in mutant cells represented ∼37% of those measured in wild type cells. Neomycin was preincubated with cells at 37 °C for 30 min prior to internalization assays at 37 (Fig. 5A) or 4 °C (Fig. 5C) with the Antp analogue P1 or (R/W)9. The antibiotic had different effects on peptide internalization in the two cell types according to temperature. The rate of internalization was slowed down by 53% (15 min) in wild type cells and 37% (30 min) in neomycin-treated cells (both at at 37 °C), but this effect was surmountable after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 5A). In mutant cells, the effect was different because pretreated cells had a constant and lower (∼35%) internalization efficiency compared with control cells, within the 1-h incubation with the peptide. The situation was different at 4 °C (Fig. 5A). In wild type cells pretreated with neomycin, the P1 analogue had significantly enhanced internalization efficiency (∼150%) compared with control cells, whatever the time incubation with the peptide. On the contrary, internalization efficiency of P1 at 4 °C in the mutant cells was not affected by the presence of neomycin. The effect of neomycin on the amount of membrane-bound peptide has also been examined in the two cell lines according to temperature (Fig. 5, B and D). At 37 °C (Fig. 5B), the pretreatment of cells with neomycin did not show any effect on the membrane-bound peptide as similar quantities were found whatever the internalization time for the two cell lines. On the contrary at 4 °C (Fig. 5D), a slight (25%, corresponding to 100 pmol) but significant decrease on the membrane-bound peptide could be observed for the wild type cells after a 1-h internalization. A slight decrease was also observed constantly in mutant cells but corresponded only to 40 picomoles of membrane-bound peptide. Cells were incubated with 5 μm Antp or P1 analogue at 37 °C for 1 h with wild type or mutant cells (Fig. 6). Internalization of the peptide was revealed by streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 after quenching of the membrane-bound peptide by avidin as described (16.Dupont E. Prochiantz A. Joliot A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The confocal microscopy observations were all performed with the same microscopy tuning parameters. Antp and its P1 analogue were visualized both in wild type (Fig. 6, b and c, respectively) and mutant cells (Fig. 6, f and g, respectively). To compare with the data obtained from quantitative analysis of internalization, the two cell lines were also pretreated for 30 min with neomycin before P1 peptide analogue incubation (Fig. 6, d and h). When using the same observation parameters, fluorescence appeared more intense in cells pretreated with neomycin (d and h) when compared with controls (c and g), whatever the cell line. Under the same conditions, Antp was also internalized at 4 °C in the two cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1). At 5 or 10 μm Antp, the two cells lines had similar fluorescence levels. The content in sialic acid was found similar (using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test) in 107 wild type (10.9 ± 4.5 nmol, n = 3) and mutant CHO cells (6.0 ± 2.5 nmol, n = 4). Cell-penetrating peptides could be quantified using mass spectrometry, either once internalized or when bound to the external leaflet of the membrane (13.Burlina F. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Chassaing G. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15.Delaroche D. Aussedat B. Aubry S. Chassaing G. Burlina F. Clodic G. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As described previously, one million cells were incubated with, for example, 7500 pmol of peptide in 1 ml total volume (corresponding to an extracellular concentration of 7.5 μm). This large volume was used to cover cells properly with a solution that could not be depleted in the peptide. Therefore, when a peptide is internalized in a quantity of ∼0.5 picomole, the cell volume of one million CHO cells being 1 μl, the internalized concentration corresponds to 0.5 μm, a limit concentration that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy (17.Aubry S. Burlina F. Dupont E. Delaroche D. Joliot A. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Sagan S. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 2956-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, it must be noted that this low concentration represents ∼300,000 peptide molecules inside one cell. Therefore, when five pmol Antp are internalized in one million cells, the intracellular and extracellular concentrations are almost balanced, 5 versus 7.5 μm, respectively. In addition, using Antp to convey a protein kinase C inhibitor inside cells, micromolar concentration of the cargo was obtained (18.Aussedat B. Sagan S. Chassaing G. Bolbach G. Burlina F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which was sufficient to observe a biological activity (19.Théodore L. Derossi D. Chassaing G. Llirbat B. Kubes M. Jordan P. Chneiweiss H. Godement P. Prochiantz A. J Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this quantitative method has the great advantage over imaging techniques of giving access to the molecular integrity of the CPP (15.Delaroche D. Aussedat B. Aubry S. Chassaing G. Burlina F. Clodic G. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, no intracellular degradation of CPPs was detected (similar mass spectra showing no degradation after internalization at 37 and 4 °C) within the time range of internalization (15–120 min) (data not shown) (14.Burlina F.

We have studied the internalization of cell-penetrating peptides bearing different numbers of positive charges (from 7–9) in two cell types. CHO-K1 cells have been reported to contain heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, together with sialic acid present on N-glycosylated proteins and GM3, the only ganglioside found in CHO cells (20.Saito M. Iwamori M. Lin B. Oka A. Fujiki Y. Shimozawa N. Kamoshita S. Yanagisawa M. Sakakihara Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21.Rosales Fritz V.M. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas in xylose transferase-deficient pgA745 CHO cells, the heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are lacking (22.Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We have shown herein that the cell-surface sialic acid content was similar for the wild type and the xylose transferase-deficient cells, that is, ∼1000 picomoles for one million cells, which is the number of cells used in quantification studies. Thus, differences between internalization in the two cell types could be reasonably related to the difference in cell-surface heparan and chondroitin sulfates. The data obtained herein clearly established that internalization of cell-penetrating peptides is a multimechanism process, which varies with the peptide sequence and the cell-surface composition. Indeed, we have measured the internalization of cell-penetrating peptides with a different number of positive charges and amphipathicity: (+7), (R/W)9; (+7), Antp; (+7), P1; (+8), Tat; and (+9), R9 (see Fig. 1 for peptide primary sequences). In CHO-K1 wild type cells, at least two pathways of entry coexist: a temperature-sensitive endocytotic and a temperature-insensitive or less sensitive (likely translocation) pathway. These two pathways are not equivalently taken by the CPPs studied here (Table 1 and Fig. 7). By assuming that all active endocytotic processes are inhibited at 4 °C, we could evaluate for equivalent concentrations of the different cell-penetrating peptides, the relative percentage of peptide translocation versus endocytosis (Table 1). It is clear from these results that the presence at the cell surface of heparan and chondroitin sulfate has different effects on internalization depending on the CPP sequence. Indeed, in the absence of heparan and chondroitin sulfate (GAG), Tat (+8) and R9 (+9) only entered via a nonendocytotic temperature-independent process, whereas in the presence of GAG, translocation represented 75 and 50% of the internalization pathway, respectively, for the two peptides. In the absence of GAG, Antp (+7) and P1 (+7) entered principally (60 and 75%, respectively) via translocation, whereas (R/W)9 (+7) still entered preferentially via endocytosis (85%). For Tat, these results are in agreement with recent work in which a knockdown of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a knock-out of caveolin-mediated endocytosis did not affect the ability of Tat to enter cells, even at low temperature (23.Ter-Avetisyan G.

https://openalex.org/W2025476226,"Cricket Paralysis virus (CrPV) is a member of the Dicistroviridae family of RNA viruses, which infect a broad range of insect hosts, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila has emerged as an effective system for studying innate immunity because of its powerful genetic techniques and the high degree of gene and pathway conservation. Intra-abdominal injection of CrPV into adult flies causes a lethal infection that provides a robust assay for the identification of mutants with altered sensitivity to viral infection. To gain insight into the interactions between viruses and the innate immune system, we injected wild type flies with CrPV and observed that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were not induced and hemocytes were depleted in the course of infection. To investigate the contribution of conserved immune signaling pathways to antiviral innate immune responses, CrPV was injected into isogenic mutants of the Immune Deficiency (Imd) pathway, which resembles the mammalian Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in several Imd pathway genes displayed increased sensitivity to CrPV infection and higher CrPV loads. Our data show that antiviral innate immune responses in flies infected with CrPV depend upon hemocytes and signaling through the Imd pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1964638276,"Background Diatoms are largely responsible for production of biogenic silica in the global ocean. However, in surface seawater, Si(OH)4 can be a major limiting factor for diatom productivity. Analyzing at the global scale the genes networks involved in Si transport and metabolism is critical in order to elucidate Si biomineralization, and to understand diatoms contribution to biogeochemical cycles. Methodology/Principal Findings Using whole genome expression analyses we evaluated the transcriptional response to Si availability for the model species Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Among the differentially regulated genes we found genes involved in glutamine-nitrogen pathways, encoding putative extracellular matrix components, or involved in iron regulation. Some of these compounds may be good candidates for intracellular intermediates involved in silicic acid storage and/or intracellular transport, which are very important processes that remain mysterious in diatoms. Expression analyses and localization studies gave the first picture of the spatial distribution of a silicic acid transporter in a diatom model species, and support the existence of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Conclusions/Significance Our global analyses revealed that about one fourth of the differentially expressed genes are organized in clusters, underlying a possible evolution of P. tricornutum genome, and perhaps other pennate diatoms, toward a better optimization of its response to variable environmental stimuli. High fitness and adaptation of diatoms to various Si levels in marine environments might arise in part by global regulations from gene (expression level) to genomic (organization in clusters, dosage compensation by gene duplication), and by post-transcriptional regulation and spatial distribution of SIT proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2055888253,"Timely care by general practitioners in the community keeps children out of hospital and provides better continuity of care. Yet in the UK, access to primary care has diminished since 2004 when changes in general practitioners' contracts enabled them to 'opt out' of providing out-of-hours care and since then unplanned pediatric hospital admission rates have escalated, particularly through emergency departments. We hypothesised that any increase in isolated short stay admissions for childhood illness might reflect failure to manage these cases in the community over a 10 year period spanning these changes.We conducted a population based time trends study of major causes of hospital admission in children <10 years using the Hospital Episode Statistics database, which records all admissions to all NHS hospitals in England using ICD10 codes. Outcomes measures were total and isolated short stay unplanned hospital admissions (lasting less than 2 days without readmission within 28 days) from 1997 to 2006. Over the period annual unplanned admission rates in children aged <10 years rose by 22% (from 73.6/1000 to 89.5/1000 child years) with larger increases of 41% in isolated short stay admissions (from 42.7/1000 to 60.2/1000 child years). There was a smaller fall of 12% in admissions with length of stay of >2 days. By 2006, 67.3% of all unplanned admissions were isolated short stays <2 days. The increases in admission rates were greater for common non-infectious than infectious causes of admissions.Short stay unplanned hospital admission rates in young children in England have increased substantially in recent years and are not accounted for by reductions in length of in-hospital stay. The majority are isolated short stay admissions for minor illness episodes that could be better managed by primary care in the community and may be evidence of a failure of primary care services."
https://openalex.org/W2043661900,"Somites are transient segments formed in a rostro-caudal progression during vertebrate development. In chick embryos, segmentation of a new pair of somites occurs every 90 minutes and involves a mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition of cells from the presomitic mesoderm. Little is known about the cellular rearrangements involved, and, although it is known that the fibronectin extracellular matrix is required, its actual role remains elusive. Using 3D and 4D imaging of somite formation we discovered that somitogenesis consists of a complex choreography of individual cell movements. Epithelialization starts medially with the formation of a transient epithelium of cuboidal cells, followed by cell elongation and reorganization into a pseudostratified epithelium of spindle-shaped epitheloid cells. Mesenchymal cells are then recruited to this medial epithelium through accretion, a phenomenon that spreads to all sides, except the lateral side of the forming somite, which epithelializes by cell elongation and intercalation. Surprisingly, an important contribution to the somite epithelium also comes from the continuous egression of mesenchymal cells from the core into the epithelium via its apical side. Inhibition of fibronectin matrix assembly first slows down the rate, and then halts somite formation, without affecting pseudopodial activity or cell body movements. Rather, cell elongation, centripetal alignment, N-cadherin polarization and egression are impaired, showing that the fibronectin matrix plays a role in polarizing and guiding the exploratory behavior of somitic cells. To our knowledge, this is the first 4D in vivo recording of a full mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition. This approach brought new insights into this event and highlighted the importance of the extracellular matrix as a guiding cue during morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2141869864,"When cellular glucose concentrations fall below normal levels, in general the extent of protein O-GlcNAc modification (O-GlcNAcylation) decreases. However, recent reports demonstrated increased O-GlcNAcylation by glucose deprivation in HepG2 and Neuro-2a cells. Here, we report increased O-GlcNAcylation in non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells and various other cells in response to glucose deprivation. Although the level of O-GlcNAc transferase was unchanged, the enzyme contained less O-GlcNAc, and its activity was increased. Moreover, O-GlcNAcase activity was reduced. The studied cells contain glycogen, and we show that its degradation in response to glucose deprivation provides a source for UDP-GlcNAc required for increased O-GlcNAcylation under this condition. This required active glycogen phosphorylase and resulted in increased glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Interestingly, glucose deprivation reduced the amount of phosphofructokinase 1, a regulatory glycolytic enzyme, and blocked ATP synthesis. These findings suggest that glycogen is the source for increased O-GlcNAcylation but not for generating ATP in response to glucose deprivation and that this may be useful for cancer cells to survive."
https://openalex.org/W2157786923,"Parasites are able to evolve rapidly and overcome host defense mechanisms, but the molecular basis of this adaptation is poorly understood. Powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphales, Ascomycota) are obligate biotrophic parasites infecting nearly 10,000 plant genera. They obtain their nutrients from host plants through specialized feeding structures known as haustoria. We previously identified the AVRk1 powdery mildew-specific gene family encoding effectors that contribute to the successful establishment of haustoria. Here, we report the extensive proliferation of the AVRk1 gene family throughout the genome of B. graminis, with sequences diverging in formae speciales adapted to infect different hosts. Also, importantly, we have discovered that the effectors have coevolved with a particular family of LINE-1 retrotransposons, named TE1a. The coevolution of these two entities indicates a mutual benefit to the association, which could ultimately contribute to parasite adaptation and success. We propose that the association would benefit 1) the powdery mildew fungus, by providing a mechanism for amplifying and diversifying effectors and 2) the associated retrotransposons, by providing a basis for their maintenance through selection in the fungal genome."
https://openalex.org/W2029725902,"Circadian clocks control daily rhythms including sleep-wake, hormone secretion, and metabolism. These clocks are based on intracellular transcription-translation feedback loops that sustain daily oscillations of gene expression in many cell types. Mammalian astrocytes display circadian rhythms in the expression of the clock genes Period1 (Per1) and Period2 (Per2). However, a functional role for circadian oscillations in astrocytes is unknown. Because uptake of extrasynaptic glutamate depends on the presence of Per2 in astrocytes, we asked whether glutamate uptake by glia is circadian.We measured glutamate uptake, transcript and protein levels of the astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter, Glast, and the expression of Per1 and Per2 from cultured cortical astrocytes and from explants of somatosensory cortex. We found that glutamate uptake and Glast mRNA and protein expression were significantly reduced in Clock/Clock, Per2- or NPAS2-deficient glia. Uptake was augmented when the medium was supplemented with dibutyryl-cAMP or B27. Critically, glutamate uptake was not circadian in cortical astrocytes cultured from rats or mice or in cortical slices from mice.We conclude that glutamate uptake levels are modulated by CLOCK, PER2, NPAS2, and the composition of the culture medium, and that uptake does not show circadian variations."
https://openalex.org/W2026081908,"The pancreatic beta cell is sensitive to even small changes in PDX1 protein levels; consequently, Pdx1 haploinsufficiency can inhibit beta cell growth and decrease insulin biosynthesis and gene expression, leading to compromised glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Using metabolic labeling of primary islets and a cultured beta cell line, we show that glucose levels modulate PDX1 protein phosphorylation at a novel C-terminal GSK3 consensus that maps to serines 268 and 272. A decrease in glucose levels triggers increased turnover of the PDX1 protein in a GSK3-dependent manner, such that PDX1 phosphomutants are refractory to the destabilizing effect of low glucose. Glucose-stimulated activation of AKT and inhibition of GSK3 decrease PDX1 phosphorylation and delay degradation. Furthermore, direct pharmacologic inhibition of AKT destabilizes, and inhibition of GSK3 increases PDX1 protein stability. These studies define a novel functional role for the PDX1 C terminus in mediating the effects of glucose and demonstrate that glucose modulates PDX1 stability via the AKT-GSK3 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2092426552,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a dominant disease linked to contractions of the D4Z4 repeat array in 4q35. We have previously identified a double homeobox gene (DUX4) within each D4Z4 unit that encodes a transcription factor expressed in FSHD but not control myoblasts. DUX4 and its target genes contribute to the global dysregulation of gene expression observed in FSHD. We have now characterized the homologous DUX4c gene mapped 42 kb centromeric of the D4Z4 repeat array. It encodes a 47-kDa protein with a double homeodomain identical to DUX4 but divergent in the carboxyl-terminal region. DUX4c was detected in primary myoblast extracts by Western blot with a specific antiserum, and was induced upon differentiation. The protein was increased about 2-fold in FSHD versus control myotubes but reached 2-10-fold induction in FSHD muscle biopsies. We have shown by Western blot and by a DNA-binding assay that DUX4c over-expression induced the MYF5 myogenic regulator and its DNA-binding activity. DUX4c might stabilize the MYF5 protein as we detected their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. In keeping with the known role of Myf5 in myoblast accumulation during mouse muscle regeneration DUX4c over-expression activated proliferation of human primary myoblasts and inhibited their differentiation. Altogether, these results suggested that DUX4c could be involved in muscle regeneration and that changes in its expression could contribute to the FSHD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2115422581,"Genome sequencing projects have been completed for several species representing four highly diverged holometabolous insect orders, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The striking evolutionary diversity of insects argues a need for efficient methods to apply genome information from such models to genetically uncharacterized species. Constructing conserved synteny maps plays a crucial role in this task. Here, we demonstrate the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization with bacterial artificial chromosome probes as a powerful tool for physical mapping of genes and comparative genome analysis in Lepidoptera, which have numerous and morphologically uniform holokinetic chromosomes.We isolated 214 clones containing 159 orthologs of well conserved single-copy genes of a sequenced lepidopteran model, the silkworm, Bombyx mori, from a BAC library of a sphingid with an unexplored genome, the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. We then constructed a BAC-FISH karyotype identifying all 28 chromosomes of M. sexta by mapping 124 loci using the corresponding BAC clones. BAC probes from three M. sexta chromosomes also generated clear signals on the corresponding chromosomes of the convolvulus hawk moth, Agrius convolvuli, which belongs to the same subfamily, Sphinginae, as M. sexta.Comparison of the M. sexta BAC physical map with the linkage map and genome sequence of B. mori pointed to extensive conserved synteny including conserved gene order in most chromosomes. Only a few rearrangements, including three inversions, three translocations, and two fission/fusion events were estimated to have occurred after the divergence of Bombycidae and Sphingidae. These results add to accumulating evidence for the stability of lepidopteran genomes. Generating signals on A. convolvuli chromosomes using heterologous M. sexta probes demonstrated that BAC-FISH with orthologous sequences can be used for karyotyping a wide range of related and genetically uncharacterized species, significantly extending the ability to develop synteny maps for comparative and functional genomics."

NSPs are structurally related and share the conserved charge-relay triad, His57–Asp102–Ser195, where Ser is the active residue (chymotrypsinogen numbering) (1.Bode W. Meyer Jr., E. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). NSPs contribute to neutrophil oxygen-independent system-mediated protection of the host against invading pathogens (2.Ganz T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, NSPs serve a physiological role for killing of microbes (3.Belaaouaj A. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Activated neutrophils are also known to release NSPs in the setting of inflammation. In vitro, NSPs are capable of cleaving a panoply of substrates. These include extracellular matrix proteins, pro-inflammatory mediators, coagulation factors, and immunoglobulins (4.Lee W.L. Downey G.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). NE degrades pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, hence could alter the inflammatory response. The enzyme is capable of inducing the secretion of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-8, which could amplify the inflammation. Consequently, the release of these potent proteinases in diseased situations could create a proteolytic environment where degradation of different host molecules might occur and result in inappropriate inflammatory response. Because of their large substrate repertoire, NSPs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and tissue-destructive diseases, including acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, and COPD (5.Birrer P. Respiration. 1995; 62: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6.Janoff A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 417-433PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Kawabata K. Hagio T. Matsuoka S. Eur. J.

Cigarette smoke represents the major etiologic factor contributing to the development and progression of COPD. Advances in therapy against COPD have been limited due in part to poor understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. Various animal models and injurious stimuli mimicking human COPD are now available to help understand the development of this pathology (reviewed in Ref. 8.Mahadeva R. Shapiro S.D. Thorax. 2002; 57: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For example, several inbred strains of mice spontaneously develop emphysema, the main component of COPD, due to genetic abnormalities (reviewed in Ref. 8.Mahadeva R. Shapiro S.D. Thorax. 2002; 57: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). And mice exposed to cigarette smoke provide a valuable model of human COPD (9.Wright J.L. Cosio M. Churg A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2008; 295: L1-L15Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).The contribution of NSPs to COPD was first evidenced by the observation that patients lacking α1-Pi, the main physiological inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, were at greater risk of developing emphysema (10.Eriksson S. Acta Med. Scand. 1965; 432: 1-85Google Scholar, 11.Sandford A.J. Weir T.D. Paré P.D. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1380-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Subsequently, various studies reported the induction of emphysema in animal models following instillation of NSPs. Intratracheal instillation of mice with human neutrophil elastase or proteinase 3 leads to tissue destruction and airspace enlargement, characteristic features of emphysema (12.Lafuma C. Frisdal E. Harf A. Robert L. Hornebeck W. Eur. Respir. J. 1991; 4: 1004-1009PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been shown that mice deficient in NE are considerably protected against cigarette-induced emphysema. Despite these compelling observations, the mechanisms by which NSPs injure the lung are not understood. Part of this concern may be because full characterization of mouse NSPs is still lacking. Although we and others have cloned and characterized murine NSPs genes/cDNAs (13.Belaaouaj A. Moog-Lutz C. Just J. Houzel-Charavel A. Shapiro S.D. Cayre Y. Mamm.

Chem. 1989; 264: 13412-13419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their corresponding proteins have not been purified. More importantly, unlike human NSPs, no specific peptides substrates for mouse NSPs are available to detect and quantify their specific activities especially in disease models.To address these concerns, we purified the three mouse NSPs and carried out a detailed analysis by comparison to human NSPs. Our studies revealed critical differences between mouse and human NSPs, which prompted us to develop new specific FRET peptides substrates for mouse NSPs. Molecular modeling approach in association with kinetic studies enabled us to generate/synthesize new sensitive substrates to both detect and measure all three mouse NSPs activities in the subnanomolar range.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we purified mouse neutrophil serine proteases and characterized them by comparison to their human counterparts. This allowed us to generate sensitive peptide substrates to individual murine proteases namely mNE, mCG, and mPr3.Purification of Mouse NE, CG, and Pr3As shown in Fig. 1A, intraperitoneal instillation of glycogen resulted in massive recruitment of inflammatory cells. In accordance with our previous work and as judged by morphologic criteria, the cellular infiltrate was predominately neutrophils. Mouse peritonea were lavaged, and collected cells were processed for NSPs purification as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” To ensure the presence of mouse NSPs, aliquots of cell protein extracts were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies specific to mNE, mCG, and mPr3 (Fig. 1B). Next, mouse NSPs were extracted/purified as outlined in Fig. 1C. Following loading of neutrophil protein extracts on heparin-Sepharose column, we detected peptidase activity in both flow-through and NaCl gradient-eluted fractions using our polyvalent FRET substrate Abz-HPVPVYAFSPQ-EDDnp, a peptide sensitive to both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like human proteases. The eluted fraction showed an asymmetric peak and was subjected to further fractionation using cation-exchange chromatography. This step allowed us to identify/separate peptidase activities into two fractions. The flow-through fraction of the heparin column was loaded onto phenyl-Sepharose, and peptidase activity was found in the fraction eluted with 50% isopropanol (Fig. 1C). All three fractions were HPLC-purified and processed for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Peptide sequence analyses found that the phenyl-Sepharose fraction corresponded to mPr3, whereas each of the two fractions with peptidase activity eluted from the cation-exchange column corresponded to mNE or mCG (Fig. 1D). Comparison of the net charges of mouse and human NSPs showed that the murine NSPs were less cationic than their human counterparts with mCG and mPr3 being the most positively and negatively charged enzymes. Of interest, amino acid sequence analyses identified, in addition to mouse NSPs, a protein called calgranulin. This protein is a member of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family, also known as cystic fibrosis antigen. It is expressed in neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells (22.Andersson K.B. Sletten K. Berntzen H.B. Fagerhol M.K. Dale I. Brandtzaeg P. Jellum E. Nature. 1988; 332: 688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). While its presence might suggest potential interaction with cationic proteases, in vivo significance of this finding is awaited. Interestingly, analysis of the net charge of murine NSPs calculated from their cDNA-deduced amino acid sequences support our purification strategy (Table 1). Next, the kinetic properties of all three isolated proteases were determined.TABLE 1Net charge of mouse and human neutrophil serine proteasesNet charge (pH 7.4)MouseHumanElastase+9+11Proteinase 3−2+1Cathepsin G+16+23 Open table in a new tab Characterization of Purified Mouse NSPsIn recent years, we have generated highly specific FRET substrates enabling us to detect human NSPs in the 0.1 nm range. Because of the conservation of the active site triad and the physicochemical property closeness between human and mouse NSPs, we first investigated kinetic properties of purified mNE, mCG, and mPr3 using human NSP substrates. Although incubation of hCG FRET peptide with mCG resulted in a high recorded fluorescence value, no changes in fluorescence were detected with hNE and hPr3 substrates in the presence of mNE or mPr3 (Tables 2 and 3). These data indicate that mNE and mPr3 substrate specificities differ from those of their human counterparts. In support of these differences in substrate recognition between human and mouse NSPs, the potent recombinant human elastase inhibitor EPI-hNE4 did not interact with mNE (23.Attucci S. Gauthier A. Korkmaz B. Délepine P. Martino M.F. Saudubray F. Diot P. Gauthier F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the human serpin α1-Pi inhibited both mNE and mPr3, and human ACT inhibited mCG. In this regard, we were able to titrate the activities of the three murine proteases using Abz-HPVPVYAFSPQ-EDDnp, against mNE and mPr3, and the hCG substrate Abz-TPFSGQ-EDDnp against mCG (Fig. 2). The titrated mouse proteases were then used to raise new specific mouse NSPs substrates and to determine the kinetic parameters of their hydrolysis. To this end, we first identified the structural differences between mouse and human proteases that could potentially account for their differences in substrate specificity. We constructed molecular models of the three mouse NSPs using the three-dimensional crystal structures of their human counterparts as templates and compared the structures of the critical subsites previously identified as participating in substrate binding.TABLE 2Specificity constants kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of FRET elastase substrateskcat/KmmNEhNEmPr3mm−1s−1Abz-APEEI MDRQ-EDDnpnshansh, non-significant hydrolysis.68312Abz-APEEI MRRQ-EDDnpnsh531nshAbz-APEEI MDRYQ-EDDnpnsh123nshAbz-APEEI MDYQ-EDDnpnsh296nshAbz-HPVPV YAFSPQ-EDDnp52306867192Abz-QPMAV VQSVPQ-EDDnp43931093129Abz-QPMDV VQSVPQ-EDDnp<1nsh17a nsh, non-significant hydrolysis.

Fluorescence was recorded spectrofluorometrically for 3–5 min. Purified protease working solutions were all in the nanomolar range.

We hypothesized that the inability of mNE to target such peptides could be due to the presence of charged residues at P2–P3 and P2′–P3′. 4The nomenclature used for the individual amino acid residues (e.g. P1, P2, etc.) of a substrate and corresponding residues of the enzyme subsites (e.g. S1, S2, etc.) is that of Schechter and Berger (32.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4730) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, the peptide substrate Abz-HPVPVYAFSPQ-EDDnp, which is cleaved by both hNE and mNE at the VY bond, bears no charge at these positions as well (Table 2). Of interest, when we compared the electrostatic surface potentials of mNE and hNE, we found that the S side of mNE active site was far more negative than that of hNE (Fig. 3), which may explain why mNE does not accommodate the E–E pair at P2–P3 in hNE substrates (Table 2). On the S′ side, the two L → R amino acid substitutions at position 143 and position 35 in mNE also create a positively charged environment close to S2′ and possibly S3′ subsites (Fig. 3B). This may explain why hNE substrates with positively charged residues at P2′ and/or P3′ are not accommodated by mNE. But substitution in hNE substrates of one or the two positively charged residues at P2′ and P3′ by negative or neutral residues did not allow cleavage by mNE (Table 2). Because Abz-HPVPVYAFSPQ-EDDnp is cleaved by all three mouse NSPs, we sought to produce a mNE-specific FRET substrate from a sequence in a natural NE substrate, which has neither charged residues at P2–P3 and P2′–P3′ nor a putative cleavage site for cathepsin G. We identified such a sequence in both mouse and human leukemogenic PML-RARα protein (24.Lane A.A. Ley T.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 305-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The resulting substrate Abz-QPMAVVQSVPQ-EDDnp was indeed rapidly hydrolyzed by mNE with a kcat/Km in the 106 m−1s−1 range (Table 2). Although this peptide was resistant to cleavage by mCG, it was cleaved at the V–V bond 34 times more slowly by mPr3. When we attempted to prevent mPr3-mediated hydrolysis by introducing a negatively charged residue at the P2 position (Abz-QPMDVVQSVPQ-EDDnp), the resulting substrate was no longer cleaved by mNE probably due to the electronegative surroundings of mNE S2–S3 subsites. Our strategy to introduce a single negative charge at P3 failed as well but did confirm that the hNE-APEEIMDRQ-EDDnp substrate was not cleaved by mNE because of its unprimed negative sequence.FIGURE 3Active site region of murine elastase compared with that of human elastase. A, the sequence of murine neutrophil elastase (mNE) was aligned with its orthologous human counterpart (hNE) using Jalview. Identical residues are shown against a gray background. Residue numbers based on the chymotrypsinogen sequence numbering system are indicated above the alignment. Asterisks denote the position of the amino acids of the catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser195). Amino acid sequences were from UniProtKB data base files ELNE_MOUSE and ELNE_HUMAN for mouse and human elastase, respectively. B, the solvent-accessible surface of each protease is colored to show its positive (dark blue) and negative (red) electrostatic potential calculated with DELPHI software. The boxed region of each protease, which corresponds to the active site region, has been enlarged to show the location of S4 to S3′ subsites as inferred from the side-chain location of the P4–P3′ residues of OMTKYIII inhibitor complexed to HNE (PDB accession number: 1PPF). In the close-up view, the catalytically active serine (Ser195) is colored yellow. Charged critical residues that lie in the vicinity of the active site are indicated. The main difference lies in residues lining the S2′ subsite of both proteases where the neutral Leu143 in hNE is replaced by a positively charged arginyl residue (Arg143) in mNE. The substitution of Leu for Arg at position 35 in mNE may also have an influence on the P3′ specificity. The contour lines of electrostatic potential are −5 kT/e (red) and +5 kT/e (blue). Model of murine elastase was built as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the atomic coordinates for human NE were extracted from PDB file 1PPF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Generation of an mPr3 Substrate following Specific Amino Acid Substitution in hPr3 SubstratesWe have previously identified critical residues in the reactive site of human Pr3 that contribute to its substrate specificity. These are Lys99 at the S2 subsite, Asp61 at both S1′ and S3′, and most importantly Arg143 at the S2′ subsite (21.Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Asp61 and Arg143 remained conserved while Lys99 was substituted with Asn99 in mPr3 (25.Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Reuter N. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5685-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Features of hPr3 substrates are characterized by a negatively charged residue at P2 that is accommodated within the S2 lysyl-containing subsite (Table 3). We replaced the P2 aspartyl residue by an arginyl residue in the lead human Pr3 substrate, Abz-VA(D→R)CRDRQ-EDDnp. Hydrolysis of the new substrate, Abz-VARCRDRQ-EDDnp, resulted in a 12-fold increase of mPr3 kcat/Km while hPr3 kcat/Km decreased by 160-fold (Table 3). Its cleavage site, C–R bond, remained unchanged as judged by comparison of the reversed-phase HPLC retention time of the EDDnp-containing peptide with that of hPr3-cleaved Abz-VADCRDRQ-EDDnp (21.Korkmaz B.

Of note, neither mNE nor mCG cleaved Abz-VARCRDRQ-EDDnp. To improve the sensitivity of this substrate to mPr3 we substituted the P′ sequence -RDRQ- with the sequence -ADYQ-, which increased cleavage susceptibility of hPr3 substrates (21.Korkmaz B.

The kcat/Km values for both mPr3 and hPr3 increased significantly suggesting that the S′ subsites are less important for discriminating between hPr3 and mPr3. Mouse Pr3 did not cleave the hPr3 substrate derived from the NFκB internal sequence that also contains an aspartyl residue at P2 (21.Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) further highlighting the importance of the S2 subsite for discriminating between human and mouse Pr3. In support of these observations, analysis of the three-dimensional model of mPr3 confirmed that the main difference between the mouse and human Pr3 resides in the S2 subsite (Fig. 4B); the R60Q and K99N substitutions generated an overall negative environment surrounding the S2 subsite in mPr3. This is also reflected by the fact that mouse Pr3 had a more negative net charge than human Pr3 (Table 1). Unlike their S subsites, the overall conformations of the S′ subsites of the mouse and human Pr3 seem to be very similar (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Comparison of murine and human proteinase 3 active sites. A, alignment of murine (UniProtKB accession name PRTN3_MOUSE) and human (UniProtKB accession name PRTN3_HUMAN) proteinase 3 sequences showing identical (gray background) and substituted residues between both sequences. Amino acid numbers correspond to those of the chymotrypsinogen sequence. Asterisks denote the position of the amino acids of the catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser195). B, values of electrostatic potentials (calculated as in Fig. 3) of murine and human proteinase 3 were mapped onto the solvent-accessible surface of each protease. Positive and negative regions of the molecular surface are colored blue and red, respectively. Critical charged residues suspected in substrate specificity are indicated in the close-up view of the protease active site (boxed region). Note the positive residues Arg60 and Lys99 of the substrate binding region in hPr3 are replaced by the neutral Gln60 and Asn99 in mPr3, respectively. The structural model of mPr3 was derived from hPr3 x-ray structure (PDF file: 1FUJ) by homology modeling as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Positioning of the S4 to S3′ subsites was assessed as in Fig. 3. The catalytic serine (Ser195) is colored yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Targeted Changes in hCG Amino Acid Substrates Explain mCG Substrate SpecificityContrary to mNE and mPr3, mCG cleaved hCG substrates particularly the FRET peptide Abz-TPFSGQ-EDDnp with a far better kcat/Km value (Table 4). This latter peptide is derived from hCG protein substrate, the protease-activated thrombin receptor PAR-1 (26.Attucci S. Korkmaz B. Juliano L. Hazouard E. Girardin C. Brillard-Bourdet M. Réhault S. Anthonioz P. Gauthier F. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 965-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest, hCG-mediated cleavage at the F–S bond was conserved in mCG. The other sensitive hCG peptide, Abz-EPFWEDQ-EDDnp, a peptide derived from the reactive loop of the human serpin ACT, was also cleaved by mCG at the F–W bond (Table 4). Of note, human ACT inhibits not only hCG but also mCG.TABLE 4Specificity constants kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of cathepsin G-directed FRET substrateskcat/KmmCGhCGmNEmPr3mm−1s−1Abz-TPF SGQ-EDDnp5500162nshansh, non-significant hydrolysis.nshAbz-EPF WEDQ-EDDnp543243nshnsha nsh, non-significant hydrolysis. Open table in a new tab To better our understanding of mCG-FRET peptide substrate interaction, molecular modeling studies revealed that only slight differences in the partition of charged residues between mCG and hCG reside in the surrounding of active site (Fig. 5B) indicating that mCG and hCG might exhibit similar substrate specificity. There remains, however, some obvious difference namely the hCG Arg at position 41 in the vicinity of the S2′ binding sites that is replaced with Ala in mCG (Fig. 5B). Such difference does not prevent mCG and hCG from accommodating a negatively charged residue at P2′ as observed using the Abz-EPFWEDQ-EDDnp substrate. However, if a positive residue was present at P2′, it could possibly impair interaction with hCG, but not (or to a lesser degree) mCG. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the P2′ D residue in the polyvalent MNEI-derived Abz-GIATFCDLMPEQ-EDDnp substrate cleaved at the F–C bond by hCG, by an Arg residue. Analysis of substrate cleavage found that the Arg-containing substrate was cleaved 10 times more slowly by hCG, and ∼3 times faster by mCG suggesting that the S2′ subsite in cathepsin G is important for substrate binding and that residue at position 41 is involved in the P2′ specificity of cathepsin G (Table 5). Another difference between hCG and mCG G is the absence of Glu226 at the bottom of the S1 pocket in mCG (Fig. 5C). This negatively charged residue could explain why both P1-Phe and P1-Lys residues are accommodated in the hCG S1 pocket (27.Hof P. Mayr I. Huber R. Korzus E. Potempa J. Travis J. Powers J.C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consequently, unlike its human homolog, mCG should not cleave after Lys residues. This assumption was tested by comparing cleavage rates of two FRET substrates that differed only by Phe or Lys at P1, by hCG and mCG. Under similar experimental conditions, mCG cleaved only Abz-TPFSALQ-EDDnp at a significant rate, whereas hCG hydrolyzed both Abz-TPFSALQ-EDDnp and Abz-TPKSALQ-EDDnp, although the latter peptide was cleaved ∼10 times slower (Table 5).FIGURE 5Compared structures of the active site regions of murine and human cathepsin G.

Asterisks denote the position of the amino acids of the catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser195). The critical Glu226 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) of the S1 pocket of hCG is replaced by an alanyl residue in mCG. Both residues are shown against a red background. B, the solvent-accessible surface of mCG and hCG has been colored according to values of electrostatic potentials calculated with DELPHI software (blue, positive; red, negative; yellow, catalytic Ser195). The positively charged Arg41 in hCG active site is substituted by the neutral and small Ala residue in mCG. As seen in the zoomed view of each active site (boxed region), this leads to major differences in the shape and charge of the S2′–S3′ binding region. mCG model was built by comparative modeling techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”) based on the hCG x-ray structure (PDB accession number 1CGH). Location of S4 to S3′ subsites in each protease active site was inferred as described in Fig. 3. C, close-up view of the active sites (ribbon representation) of murine CG and human CG. Glu226 in hCG, which allows accommodation of a Lys side chain in the S1 pocket of hCG, is replaced by an Ala residue in mCG. Both views were prepared with PyMOL (DeLano, W. L.

Here, we demonstrate that in the mouse mammary gland, loss of one Syk allele profoundly increases proliferation and ductal branching and invasion of epithelial cells through the mammary fat pad during puberty. Mammary carcinomas develop by one year. Syk also suppresses proliferation and invasion in vitro. siRNA or shRNA knockdown of Syk in MCF10A breast epithelial cells dramatically increased proliferation, anchorage independent growth, cellular motility, and invasion, with formation of functional, extracellular matrix-degrading invadopodia. Morphological and gene microarray analysis following Syk knockdown revealed a loss of luminal and differentiated epithelial features with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and a gain in invadopodial cell surface markers CD44, CD49F, and MMP14. These results support the role of Syk in limiting proliferation and invasion of epithelial cells during normal morphogenesis, and emphasize the critical role of Syk as a tumor suppressor for breast cancer. The question of breast cancer risk following systemic anti-Syk therapy is raised since only partial loss of Syk was sufficient to induce mammary carcinomas."

First, we showed that the method identified the protein targets of small-molecules in affinity purification experiments with high precision. Second, we re-analyzed a mass spectrometric data set designed to identify proteins regulated by microRNAs.

INTRODUCTIONA crucial step in cancer progression is the ability of the cells to escape apoptosis. There are numerous mechanisms that can mediate apoptosis resistance, and they vary between cancers and cancer subtypes. The identification of such mechanisms would be highly valuable in the search for novel therapeutic targets. For breast cancer, there are several potential signaling pathways that can be targeted to remove the survival support. One of these is the protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMKPMAPK phosphataseMEKMAPK/ERK kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAZ-VAD-fmkbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)fluoromethyl ketoneEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolAPCallophycocyaninPI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinase. family of serine/threonine kinases.The PKC family is divided into three subgroups depending on the structure of the regulatory domain: classical (PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ), novel (PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCθ), and atypical (PKCζ and PKCι/λ) isoforms. Classical and novel PKCs contain diacylglycerol-binding C1 domains and are therefore regulated by activation of pathways that lead to diacylglycerol generation. Classical PKCs also possess a Ca2+-sensitive C2 domain. The novel C2-like domain is Ca2+-insensitive. Atypical PKCs are diacylglycerol- and Ca2+-insensitive and regulated in a different manner (1.Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The functions of PKC isoforms are cancer and cell type-specific, but several studies have implicated PKCδ and PKCϵ in the regulation of cancer cell survival.PKCδ is generally considered to have anti-tumorigenic roles because it has pro-apoptotic effects in many cell types (2.Reyland M.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3.Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of PKCδ by caspases is a common event during apoptosis, and expression of its isolated catalytic domain induces apoptosis (4.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S.

On the other hand, PKCδ has also been shown to be crucial for induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells (14.Zeidan Y.H. Wu B.X. Jenkins R.W. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A.

FEBS J. 2008; 275: 4005-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for most cell types, including breast cancer cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, down-regulation of PKCϵ reduces the tumor growth and metastatic capacity in mice (17.Pan Q. Bao L.W. Kleer C.G. Sabel M.S. Griffith K.A. Teknos T.N. Merajver S.D.

The ERK1/2 pathway has been assigned oncogenic effects because it is associated with the ability of cancer cells to grow independently of normal proliferation signals and is deregulated in many human cancers. On the other hand, the p38 and JNK pathways have been associated with tumor suppressor effects because of their roles in stress-induced apoptosis (22.Dhillon A.S. Hagan S. Rath O. Kolch W. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation of essential threonine and tyrosine residues in their activation loop by the dual specificity MAPK kinases and are inactivated by dephosphorylation of these residues by the dual specificity MKPs (23.Keyse S.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that PKCδ silencing per se induces apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Apoptosis is induced via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway through increased phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and degradation of MKP3.DISCUSSIONMany studies have implicated PKCδ as a pro-apoptotic protein in a wide range of cell types (2.Reyland M.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3.Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, for breast cancer cells, there are indications of PKCδ having both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival effects. PKCδ has been shown to promote resistance to tamoxifen, γ-irradiation, retinoic acid, and TRAIL (8.McCracken M.A. Miraglia L.J. McKay R.A. Strobl J.S. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 273-281PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Nabha S.M. Glaros S. Hong M. Lykkesfeldt A.E. Schiff R. Osborne K. Reddy K.B.

Biochem. 2005; 96: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, apoptosis induced by UV light is mediated via PKCδ (14.Zeidan Y.H. Wu B.X. Jenkins R.W. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15.Pedram A. Razandi M. Wallace D.C. Levin E.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Here, we report that down-regulation of PKCδ per se leads to apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. This has not previously been reported, and one reason for this may be that a rather long period with lowered levels is necessary for death induction to be detectable.As mentioned previously, PKCδ is generally considered to be pro-apoptotic because it is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis and because expression of the isolated PKCδ catalytic domain induces apoptosis (4.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that although PKCδ has a survival role in breast cancer cells, as opposed to most other cell types, the free catalytic domain induces apoptosis. This latter effect therefore seems to be universal, whereas upstream PKCδ effects on cell survival are more cell-specific.We also observed increased apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells following expression of the free catalytic domain of PKCϵ. Although PKCϵ is considered to support survival by protecting cells against apoptotic insults (18.Lu D. Sivaprasad U. Huang J. Shankar E. Morrow S. Basu A. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Sivaprasad U. Shankar E. Basu A. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), cleavage at Asp383 by caspases creates an active catalytic fragment, and depending on the intracellular context and cell type, the released catalytic domain can promote or protect against apoptosis (21.Basu A.

Signal. 1999; 11: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, Lee et al. (38.Lee Y.J. Soh J.W. Jeoung D.I. Cho C.K. Jhon G.J. Lee S.J. Lee Y.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of the catalytic domain of PKCϵ in mouse fibroblasts enhances irradiation-induced cell death. Several of these observations are in line with our finding that transfection with the isolated catalytic domain of PKCϵ induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells. However, the siRNA experiments support a pro-survival role for PKCϵ in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. The finding that the free catalytic domains of PKCδ and PKCϵ induce apoptosis whereas at the same time down-regulation of the endogenous proteins has the same effect can potentially explain the sometimes opposing effects on cell survival of these isoforms.Our results further suggest that PKCδ supports survival via inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. This is also the cell line with the highest basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with the other breast cancer cell lines investigated, which conceivably can be explained by the fact that it harbors an activated K-Ras because of a mutation in codon 13 of the KRAS gene (39.Kozma S.C. Bogaard M.E. Buser K. Saurer S.M. Bos J.L. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PKCδ silencing led to increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is in line with a previous report showing that treatment with GF109203X, an inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isoforms, induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in this cell line (33.Pettersson F. Couture M.C. Hanna N. Miller W.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7053-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the ERK1/2 pathway has been connected to apoptosis induction in other cell types as well (40.Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 41.Tang D. Wu D. Hirao A. Lahti J.M. Liu L. Mazza B. Kidd V.J. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12710-12717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Oncogene-induced accelerated cell cycle progression can be halted by checkpoints that activate failsafe mechanisms or tumor suppressor networks, i.e. mechanisms like senescence and apoptosis that are activated to prevent further progression toward malignancy. However, cells can evade this by enhancing pro-survival signaling that increases the threshold for apoptosis induction (42.Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 43.Schmitt C.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has been reported, for example, that NFκB suppresses apoptosis induced by oncogenic Ras in mouse fibroblasts (44.Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Because PKCδ silencing apparently induced apoptosis by higher activity in the ERK1/2 pathway, PKCδ might be crucial to prevent the activation of failsafe mechanisms induced by Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells.One signaling pathway that is often involved in escaping oncogene-induced failsafe mechanisms is the PI3K/Akt pathway (43.Schmitt C.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PKCδ is required for survival of mouse fibroblasts with mutated constitutively activated Ras by mediating Akt activation (29.Xia S. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13199-13210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERK1/2 has been shown to suppress Akt phosphorylation in many breast cancer cell lines (28.Mirzoeva O.K. Das D. Heiser L.M. Bhattacharya S. Siwak D. Gendelman R. Bayani N. Wang N.J. Neve R.M. Guan Y. Hu Z. Knight Z. Feiler H.S. Gascard P. Parvin B. Spellman P.T. Shokat K.M. Wyrobek A.J. Bissell M.J. McCormick F. Kuo W.L. Mills G.B. Gray J.W. Korn W.M. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It might therefore be expected that decreased Akt phosphorylation, as a consequence of either lower PKCδ levels or increased ERK activity, mediates induction of apoptosis. However, we did not observe a decrease in Akt phosphorylation after PKCδ silencing. Thus, PI3K/Akt signaling is likely not involved in the PKCδ-regulated survival of MDA-MB-231 cells.PKCδ conceivably regulates ERK phosphorylation both upstream and downstream of ERK activation because PKCδ silencing resulted in increased MEK1/2 phosphorylation and decreased expression levels of the ERK1/2 phosphatase MKP3. Reduction of MKP3 alone by siRNA did not induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell death to the same extent as PKCδ silencing. Thus, both regulation points of ERK1/2 activation are most probably crucial for the pro-survival effect of PKCδ in MDA-MB-231 cells.We also observed that MKP3 is expressed only in MDA-MB-231 cells and not in any of the other cell lines investigated. MKP3 is encoded at a chromosomal region that exhibits loss of heterozygosity and has reduced expression in some cancers. This and functional studies support a role for MKP3 as a tumor suppressor. However, MKP3 can be up-regulated in cancers with deviant receptor tyrosine kinase and Ras/Raf signaling (30.Patterson K.I. Brummer T. O'Brien P.M. Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In the human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A, which does not express MKP3, stable overexpression of H-Ras results in MKP3 expression (45.Warmka J.K. Mauro L.J. Wattenberg E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33085-33092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our finding that MDA-MB-231 is the only cell line expressing MKP3 is therefore in line with these observations.MKP3 levels are largely regulated by ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (30.Patterson K.I. Brummer T. O'Brien P.M. Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We observed that inhibition of the proteasome led to increased MKP3 levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. For this reason, we searched for potential E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the MKP3 degradation induced by PKCδ silencing and found Nedd4 to be up-regulated in cells with down-regulated PKCδ. Furthermore, Nedd4 silencing led to increased levels of MKP3, suggesting that Nedd4 mediates MKP3 degradation and might be an E3 ubiquitin ligase for MKP3. Nedd4 has several known substrates that are targeted for proteasomal degradation, including PTEN (32.Chen C. Matesic L.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 46.Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell. 2007; 128: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This unspecific substrate selectivity of Nedd4 may be the reason that we observed slightly increased cell death after Nedd4 silencing, which prevented us from studying the effect of simultaneous down-regulation of Nedd4 and PKCδ.In conclusion, PKCδ is a pro-survival factor in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. PKCδ conceivably prevents activation of failsafe mechanisms leading to apoptosis by suppressing the Ras oncogene-induced constitutively activated MEK/ERK pathway. This is regulated both upstream and downstream of ERK1/2 activation by inhibiting MEK1/2 activity and stabilizing MKP3. Finally, Nedd4 is a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase for MKP3. Our results highlight PKCδ and other suppressors of the ERK1/2 pathway as potential targets for therapy of breast cancers with high activity of the Ras pathway. INTRODUCTIONA crucial step in cancer progression is the ability of the cells to escape apoptosis. There are numerous mechanisms that can mediate apoptosis resistance, and they vary between cancers and cancer subtypes. The identification of such mechanisms would be highly valuable in the search for novel therapeutic targets. For breast cancer, there are several potential signaling pathways that can be targeted to remove the survival support. One of these is the protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMKPMAPK phosphataseMEKMAPK/ERK kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAZ-VAD-fmkbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)fluoromethyl ketoneEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolAPCallophycocyaninPI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinase. family of serine/threonine kinases.The PKC family is divided into three subgroups depending on the structure of the regulatory domain: classical (PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ), novel (PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCθ), and atypical (PKCζ and PKCι/λ) isoforms. Classical and novel PKCs contain diacylglycerol-binding C1 domains and are therefore regulated by activation of pathways that lead to diacylglycerol generation. Classical PKCs also possess a Ca2+-sensitive C2 domain. The novel C2-like domain is Ca2+-insensitive. Atypical PKCs are diacylglycerol- and Ca2+-insensitive and regulated in a different manner (1.Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The functions of PKC isoforms are cancer and cell type-specific, but several studies have implicated PKCδ and PKCϵ in the regulation of cancer cell survival.PKCδ is generally considered to have anti-tumorigenic roles because it has pro-apoptotic effects in many cell types (2.Reyland M.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3.Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of PKCδ by caspases is a common event during apoptosis, and expression of its isolated catalytic domain induces apoptosis (4.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 5.Emoto Y. Manome Y.

This cofactor-independent activation of PKCδ further activates caspase-3 and function as a positive feedback loop (6.Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7.Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, in breast cancer, the role of PKCδ is more ambiguous. It has been suggested to have less favorable effects by conferring resistance to tamoxifen and irradiation in breast cancer cells (8.McCracken M.A. Miraglia L.J. McKay R.A. Strobl J.S. Mol.

In particular, herbivores occupy a central place in food webs as the species richness and composition of this trophic level may simultaneously influence the transmission of resource and predator effects to higher and lower trophic levels, respectively. Yet, these interactions are poorly understood.Using an experimental seagrass mesocosm system, we factorially manipulated water column nutrient concentrations, food chain length, and diversity of crustacean grazers to address two questions: (1) Does food web composition modulate the effects of nutrient enrichment on plant and grazer biomasses and stoichiometry? (2) Do ecosystem fluxes of dissolved oxygen and nutrients more closely reflect above-ground biomass and community structure or sediment processes? Nutrient enrichment and grazer presence generally had strong effects on biomass accumulation, stoichiometry, and ecosystem fluxes, whereas predator effects were weaker or absent. Nutrient enrichment had little effect on producer biomass or net ecosystem production but strongly increased seagrass nutrient content, ecosystem flux rates, and grazer secondary production, suggesting that enhanced production was efficiently transferred from producers to herbivores. Gross ecosystem production (oxygen evolution) correlated positively with above-ground plant biomass, whereas inorganic nutrient fluxes were unrelated to plant or grazer biomasses, suggesting dominance by sediment microbial processes. Finally, grazer richness significantly stabilized ecosystem processes, as predators decreased ecosystem production and respiration only in the zero- and one- species grazer treatments.Overall, our results indicate that consumer presence and species composition strongly influence ecosystem responses to nutrient enrichment, and that increasing herbivore diversity can stabilize ecosystem flux rates in the face of perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2059894395,"Adaptor protein c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2, also referred to SH3BP2) regulates immune receptor-mediated signal transduction. In this report we focused on the molecular mechanism of 3BP2 function in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Engagement of BCR induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. Genetic analysis demonstrated that Syk is critical for BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. Mutational analysis of 3BP2 revealed that both Tyr(183) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain are necessary for 3BP2-mediated BCR-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Point mutation of Tyr(183) or Arg(486) in the SH2 domain of 3BP2 diminished BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. Endogenous 3BP2 forms a complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular signaling molecules. Peptide binding experiments demonstrated that only phosphorylated Tyr(183) in 3BP2 could form a complex with the SH2 domain(s) of phospholipase Cgamma2 and Vav1 from B cell lysates. These interactions were represented by using bacterial glutathione S-transferase-phospholipase Cgamma2 or -Vav1 SH2 domain. Furthermore, pulldown and Far Western experiments showed that the 3BP2-SH2 domain directly binds to B cell linker protein (BLNK) after BCR stimulation. These results demonstrated that 3BP2 induces the protein complex with cellular signaling molecules through phosphorylation of Tyr(183) and SH2 domain leading to the activation of NFAT in B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002529746,"Biological systems adapt to changing environments by reorganizing their cellular and physiological program with metabolites representing one important response level. Different stresses lead to both conserved and specific responses on the metabolite level which should be reflected in the underlying metabolic network.Starting from experimental data obtained by a GC-MS based high-throughput metabolic profiling technology we here develop an approach that: (1) extracts network representations from metabolic condition-dependent data by using pairwise correlations, (2) determines the sets of stable and condition-dependent correlations based on a combination of statistical significance and homogeneity tests, and (3) can identify metabolites related to the stress response, which goes beyond simple observations about the changes of metabolic concentrations. The approach was tested with Escherichia coli as a model organism observed under four different environmental stress conditions (cold stress, heat stress, oxidative stress, lactose diauxie) and control unperturbed conditions. By constructing the stable network component, which displays a scale free topology and small-world characteristics, we demonstrated that: (1) metabolite hubs in this reconstructed correlation networks are significantly enriched for those contained in biochemical networks such as EcoCyc, (2) particular components of the stable network are enriched for functionally related biochemical pathways, and (3) independently of the response scale, based on their importance in the reorganization of the correlation network a set of metabolites can be identified which represent hypothetical candidates for adjusting to a stress-specific response.Network-based tools allowed the identification of stress-dependent and general metabolic correlation networks. This correlation-network-based approach does not rely on major changes in concentration to identify metabolites important for stress adaptation, but rather on the changes in network properties with respect to metabolites. This should represent a useful complementary technique in addition to more classical approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2067016596,"Integrin-mediated cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is essential for protection of epithelial cells against apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. Here we show that migfilin, an integrin-proximal adaptor protein, interacts with Src and contributes to cell-ECM-mediated survival signaling. Loss of cell-ECM adhesion markedly reduces the migfilin level in untransformed epithelial cells and concomitantly induces apoptosis. Overexpression of migfilin substantially desensitizes cell detachment-induced apoptosis. Conversely, depletion of migfilin promotes apoptosis despite the presence of cell-ECM adhesion. At the molecular level migfilin directly interacts with Src, and the migfilin binding surface overlaps with the inhibitory intramolecular interaction sites in Src. Consequently, the binding of migfilin activates Src, resulting in suppression of apoptosis. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which cell-ECM adhesion regulates Src activation and survival signaling. This migfilin-mediated signaling pathway is dysfunctional in multiple types of carcinoma cells, which likely contributes to aberrant Src activation and anoikis resistance in the cancerous cells."

In addition, treatment of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with dynamin 2 small interfering RNA or the dynamin GTPase inhibitor, Dynasore, attenuated hyperoxia-mediated ROS production and p47phox recruitment to CEMs. Using purified recombinant proteins, we observed that c-Abl tyrosine-phosphorylated dynamin 2, and this phosphorylation increased p47phox/dynamin 2 association (change in the dissociation constant (Kd) from 85.8 to 6.9 nm).

Purinergic signaling is one of the most primitive forms of eukaryotic cell communication with pharmacological evidence for its existence in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (1.Burnstock G. Verkhratsky A. Acta Physiol. 2009; 195: 415-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Receptors that mediate responses to extracellular purines include both ligand gated ion channels (P2X receptors) and G-protein-coupled receptors (P2Y, adenosine and cAMP receptors). ATP is the exclusive endogenous ligand at mammalian P2X receptors, which consist of seven distinct subtypes (P2X1–7) that assemble at the cell surface as homo- or hetero-trimeric channels and play key roles in a wide range of physiological processes such as neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, and immune cell function (2.Khakh B.S. North R.A. Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 3.North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Definitive molecular and functional evidence for P2X receptors has also been obtained in several lower organisms, including species of trematode (4.Agboh K.C. Webb T.E. Evans R.J. Ennion S.J. J.

Biol. 2009; 9: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), making it clear that the emergence of P2X receptors was an early event in eukaryotic evolution. What is less clear however is whether the physiological roles of these lower organism P2X receptors are analogous to the cell surface function of vertebrate P2X receptors. The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has recently emerged as a potential model system for fundamental aspects of purinergic signaling due to the simplicity and genetic tractability of this organism, with the availability of powerful functional screens, and also due to the absence of P2X-like proteins in the genomes of other key model organisms such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila.

Nature. 2005; 435: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of five genes with weak homology to vertebrate P2X receptors (named p2xA, p2xB, p2xC, p2xD, and p2xE in Dictybase (9.Kreppel L. Fey P. Gaudet P. Just E. Kibbe W.A. Chisholm R.L. Kimmel A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D332-D333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Of these five genes p2xA shows the most homology to vertebrate P2X receptors and was shown to encode an ATP-gated ion channel when exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells (5.Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, rather than being located on the plasma membrane analogous to vertebrate P2X receptors, the native dP2XA protein was found to be localized to the intracellular membranes of the contractile vacuole where it is thought to be required for osmoregulation (5.Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), thus highlighting the possibility of potential novel intracellular roles for vertebrate P2X receptors. In addition to the intracellular signaling mediated by dP2XA, Dictyostelium also possesses a purinergic signaling system for extracellular nucleotides more analogous to that found in vertebrate cells. Using an apoaequorin-expressing strain we have previously demonstrated that both extracellular ATP and ADP evoke a robust and rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ in Dictyostelium (10.Ludlow M.J. Traynor D. Fisher P.R. Ennion S.J. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The characteristics of this purinergic response are indicative of the involvement of an ionotropic P2X rather than a metabotropic P2Y-like receptor, because it is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and is unaffected by ablation of either the G-protein subunit gene Gβ or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor gene iplA (10.Ludlow M.J. Traynor D. Fisher P.R. Ennion S.J. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, there are notable differences compared with Ca2+ responses via vertebrate P2X receptors, including equal sensitivity to both ATP and ADP and lack of effect of the common P2 receptor antagonists PPADS 2The abbreviations used are: PPADSpyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRFPred fluorescent proteinbsrblasticidin S resistance cassetteMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acideGFPenhanced GFPPBSphosphate-buffered salineTBSTris-buffered saline. and suramin. The exclusive involvement of either the p2xA or p2xE genes in the extracellular purinergic response was ruled out by ablation of these genes (10.Ludlow M.J. Traynor D. Fisher P.R. Ennion S.J. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), leaving, p2xB, p2xC, and p2xD as the most likely candidate receptors. pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid green fluorescent protein red fluorescent protein blasticidin S resistance cassette 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid enhanced GFP phosphate-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline. In this study we aimed to determine whether the other four members of the Dictyostelium P2X receptor family also correspond to ATP-gated ion channels and to assess the roles of dP2X receptors in purinergic signaling by generating a quintuple knock-out strain with all five p2x genes ablated. We show that dP2XB and dP2XE do correspond to ATP-gated channels but could not obtain functional currents for dP2XC or dP2XD receptors. Apart from a decrease in magnitude, the extracellular purinergic response remained unaffected in quintuple p2x knock-out Dictyostelium, demonstrating that the cell surface ATP/ADP receptor is not a P2X channel. Indeed all five dP2X proteins proved to be intracellular, localized to the contractile vacuole membrane with the ligand binding domain facing the lumen. When exposed to distilled water, quintuple p2x null cells displayed a slight delay in their osmoregulatory response but, in marked contrast to previous studies with p2xA null cells (5.Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), were still capable of regulating their cell volume demonstrating a minor and nonessential role for dP2X receptors in osmoregulation. Calcium responses to both calmidazolium and ATP, however, were reduced in quintuple p2x null cells suggesting that dP2X receptors play a role in intracellular calcium signaling. Oligonucleotide primers (pairs 1–5, see Table 1) designed to amplify the coding regions of the five predicted Dictyostelium P2X receptor genes (DDB0238349, DDB0238356, DDB0238363, DDB0238366, and DDB0238352 for p2xA–E, respectively) were utilized for reverse transcription-PCR on cDNA prepared from Ax2 Dictyostelium.

Manually defolliculated stage V Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 ng of cRNA and stored at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) prior to recording 3–7 days later. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from dP2X-expressing Xenopus oocytes at room temperature using an Axoclamp 900A amplifier with a Digidata 1440A data acquisition system and pClamp 10 acquisition software (Molecular Devices). For construction of concentration response data, the extracellular recording solution (ND98K+) consisted of 98 mm KCl, 1.8 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MES, pH 6.2. Membrane currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV. ATP (Mg2+ salt, Sigma) was applied from a nearby U-tube perfusion system, whereas antagonists (PPADS and suramin (Sigma)), CuCl2, and ivermectin (Sigma) were bath perfused as well as being present at the appropriate concentration in the U-tube application of ATP. For dP2XE reproducible currents were obtained with a 5-min recovery period between sequential applications of agonist allowing concentration response data to be obtained sequentially in individual cells. Marked current rundown, however, occurred with dP2XA and dP2XB, which was highly dependent on the previous history of ATP applications. This prevented construction of concentration response data in the same cells, and, to overcome this, a single application of agonist was made to 10–15 oocytes from the same batch for each concentration of agonist, and a mean peak response was taken. Non-injected and water-injected oocytes tested from at least five batches of oocytes gave no detectable currents in response to ATP or ADP application (tested at 3 mm). Concentration response data were fitted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (San Diego, CA). For permeability ratio studies the external recording solution consisted of: either NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, or choline chloride at 98 mm, 1.8 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MES (pH 6.2). Reversal potentials (Vrev) for currents in different test cation solutions were obtained using a dual ramp protocol, which stepped from a holding potential of −70 mV to +70 mV for 0.2 s followed by a ramp down to −100 mV over 1.6 s and a ramp up to +70 mV over 1.6 s before a step back to −70 mV. This voltage protocol was first applied in the absence of ATP to control for endogenous voltage-activated currents, and then in the presence of ATP (3 mm) the two traces were superimposed. The reversal potential was taken as the points where the current traces crossed on the ramps (Fig. 4A). The difference between the two cross-over points obtained for each cell (up-ramp and down-ramp) was typically <2 mV, and the mean of the two values was taken as the reversal potential for each cell (n ≥ 6 cells). Relative permeability ratios for monovalent cations were calculated using Equation 1, PX/PNa=exp(ΔVrevF/RT)(Eq. 1) where F is Faraday's constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Chloride permeability measurements were made in external solutions where KCl was substituted with potassium gluconate so as to keep [K+] constant while lowering [Cl−]. Gluconate has previously been show to be impermeable to human P2X5 channels (11.Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol.

Solutions consisted of 1.8 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MES, and either 9.8 mm KCl plus 88.2 mm potassium gluconate, 49 mm KCl plus 49 mm potassium gluconate, or 98 mm KCl (pH 6.2). ATP was applied at 3 mm, and the reversal potential at different Cl− concentrations was determined with the dual ramp voltage protocol described above. Theoretical reversal potentials at different chloride concentrations were estimated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation assuming intracellular concentrations of Cl− (33.4 mm), K+ (92.5 mm), and Na+ (6.2 mm) were similar to those previously determined for Xenopus oocytes by Barish (12.Barish M.E.

Flanking homology regions were generated by PCR using primer pairs 11–16 (Table 1) and cloned on either side of the blasticidin S resistance cassette (bsr) via the exogenous restriction endonuclease sites introduced by the primers during amplification (5′ ApaI-HindIII and 3′ NotI-SacII). Disruption cassettes were liberated as ApaI/SacII fragments, and 15 μg was used to transform Ax2 Dictyostelium. Independent null strains were isolated from 96-well tissue culture plates in axenic medium plus 10 μg/ml blasticidin S as the selective agent. Gene disruptants were identified by PCR, using oligonucleotides located outside the disruption cassette and within bsr, with Southern blot analysis performed to verify a single site of integration (supplemental Fig. S1). To generate the quintuple p2xA/B/C/D/E knock-out strain bsr was recycled by transient expression of Cre recombinase (pDEX-NLS-cre (15.Faix J. Kreppel L. Shaulsky G. Schleicher M. Kimmel A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e143Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)). Recombinants were isolated following 3–6 days selection in 30 μg/ml G418. Accurate recombination was verified by PCR, using oligonucleotides located either side of bsr. HindIII- or EcoRV-digested genomic DNA was probed with α-[32P]dCTP-labeled SacI-HindIII-restricted bsr. Hybridization was as described in a previous study (10.Ludlow M.J. Traynor D. Fisher P.R. Ennion S.J. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In vivo reconstitution of aequorin was achieved as described previously (10.Ludlow M.J. Traynor D. Fisher P.R. Ennion S.J. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Luminescence signals were recorded between 1 and 2 h after aequorin reconstitution using a custom built luminometer (Cairn Research UK), with 1.5 ml of stirred cell suspension. Agonists or lysis solution (75 μl) were delivered using the auto-injector of the luminometer so as to standardize the speed and force of injection between experiments. For each experiment the total cell aequorin content was determined in at least 5 aliquots of cells by injecting lysis solution (10 mm MOPS, 10 mm calcium acetate, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.0) to compare response magnitudes between experiments and strains as percent total aequorin consumption. Responses were analyzed using WinWCP software (Dr. J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Scotland) to determine peak area prior to determination of EC50 values using GraphPad Prism software. Strains expressing eGFP- or RFP-tagged dP2XB, dP2XC, dP2XD, and dP2XE (pDXA/dP2XB-eGFP and pDXA/dP2XB–E-RFP) were produced in Ax2 using expression vectors based on pDXA (16.Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene. 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). dP2XB–E coding regions integrating an exogenous 5′ AAAAA sequence (17.Cohen S.M. Knecht D. Lodish H.F. Loomis W.F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3361-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18.Vervoort E.B. van Ravestein A. van Peij N.N. Heikoop J.C. van Haastert P.J. Verheijden G.F. Linskens M.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2069-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were generated by PCR using primer pairs 6–9 (Table 1). eGFP was digested from the plasmid pEGFPN1 (Clontech) as a BamHI-XbaI fragment, and mRFPmars was amplified by PCR from plasmid 339-3 (19.Fischer M. Haase I. Simmeth E. Gerisch G. Müller-Taubenberger A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with primer pair 10 (Table 1). eGFP or RFP sequences were ligated at the C terminus of dP2X sequences, and the complete construct was cloned into pDXA utilizing restriction sites introduced by the PCR primers (BamHI and HindIII-XbaI, respectively). A STREP II tag with a two-amino acid spacer (LEWSHPQFEK) was introduced into the predicted dP2XA inter-transmembrane domain between positions Thr71 and Phe72. dP2XA Met1–Thr71 and Phe72–Leu378 coding regions were amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs: Met1–Thr71 forward, 5′-TGGTAAGCTTAAAAAATGGGTTTTAGTTTTGATTGG-3′ and Met1–Thr71 reverse, 5′-GGGGCTCGAGAGTATTTGGACCTTTTAAACTTG-3′; Phe72–Leu378 forward, 5′-CCCCCTCGAGTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAATTTGCATCAAATTTAACATATTG-3′ and Phe72–Leu378 reverse, 5′-CCCCGGATCCAATAAACCTTCAATTCTTGTATATAAAAC-3′. The Phe72–Leu378 forward primer incorporated the STREP II tag. The two PCR products were ligated utilizing exogenous XhoI restriction sites introduced by the PCR primers and cloned into pDXA/dP2XD-eGFP (HindIII-BamHI). Confocal images were taken with a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning microscope. Cells were preincubated in LoFlo medium (9.Kreppel L. Fey P. Gaudet P. Just E. Kibbe W.A. Chisholm R.L. Kimmel A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D332-D333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to reduce auto-fluorescence, and imaged in LoFlo medium diluted 1:2 in KK2 buffer (16 mm KH2PO4, 4 mm K2HPO4). The orientation of dP2X receptors in intracellular organelle membranes was determined using a protease protection assay on tagged dP2X receptors. Cells from axenic cultures were washed twice in proteinase K digestion buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) before resuspending at 1 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were then forced through a double layer of 5-μm filters twice, which was sufficient to disrupt the cell membrane of the majority of cells while leaving the membranes of intracellular organelles intact. Undisrupted cells were pelleted by centrifugation (425 × g, 5 min, and 4 °C), and intracellular organelles were enriched from the supernatant by further centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted organelles were then resuspended in proteinase K digestion buffer (2 μg of protein/μl) and digested with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 22 °C. Control total protein digestion with proteinase K was achieved following lysis of organelle membranes with 1% Triton X-100. Proteinase K-digested protein (typically 25 μg) was mixed 50:50 with gel sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol), heated for 2 min at 70 °C, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel before transfer to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated with anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000 dilution, Sigma) in PBST (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20)/5% milk powder for 2 h or with anti-STREP antibody (1:2000 dilution, Qiagen) in TBS (2 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl)/5% milk powder for 2 h and washed with PBST (3 × 10 min) or TBST (1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 × 10 min) and TBS (1 × 10 min), respectively. Membranes were subsequently incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution, Dako, Denmark) in PBST or TBS/5% milk powder for 45 min and washed with PBST (2 × 10 min) and PBS (2 × 10 min) or TBST (4 × 10 min), respectively. Visualization of the protein bands was achieved with an ECL (Plus) kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type and p2x knock-out cells grown in HL5 media were transferred to 3-cm culture dishes and allowed to settle for 20 min. Reference differential interference contrast images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope (20× objective) and Openlab software before replacement of HL5 media with distilled water after two brief washes in distilled water. Differential interference contrast images were then collected at 5-min intervals, and cell area was subsequently measured for the same 20–40 cells from each image using ImageJ analysis software. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between means were assessed by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post test (GraphPad Prism software). Reverse transcription-PCR on cDNA prepared from vegetative Ax2 cells using primers for the five Dictyostelium P2X receptor genes (Table 1) yielded cDNA clones that were a 100% match to the Dictybase-predicted coding sequence for p2xA, p2xB, and p2xC. Clones for p2xD differed from the Dictybase sequence at three codons, Asp95 (GAT), Val107 (GTT), and Asn403 (AAT), in the Dictybase sequence were GGT (Gly), GAT (Asp), and AGT (Ser), respectively, in two independent PCR products cloned for p2xD. Two independent clones sequenced for p2xE had a silent mutation from the predicted Dictybase sequence at codon P339 (CCC in Dictybase sequence versus CCA in cDNA clones). Due to their very low sequence homology with vertebrate P2X receptors, it was not known whether, similar to dP2XA (5.Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the other four members of the Dictyostelium P2X-like family also exhibit P2X channel function. Here we show that dP2XB and dP2XE also represent ATP-gated ion channels and further characterize the permeation properties of dP2XA. No nucleotide-evoked currents, however, could be recorded from dP2XC- or dP2XD-expressing oocytes tested under a range of extracellular recording solutions and pH. The typical extracellular recording solution for the study of P2X ion channel function in Xenopus oocytes is ND96 (pH 7.5) with 1.8 mm BaCl2 replacing the 1.8 mm CaCl2 to prevent activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels (20.Khakh B.S. Proctor W.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Labarca C. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7289-7299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In initial experiments using this solution with dP2XB- or dP2XE-expressing oocytes we obtained no or very small (<50 nA) currents upon ATP application (tested up to 3 mm). Substitution of BaCl2 with CaCl2 or omission of MgCl2 in ND96 had no effect on these very small current amplitudes. ND96 with a more acid pH (pH 6.2) produced slightly larger currents (Fig. 1A), but these were still small (160 ± 45 nA for dP2XB and 696 ± 211 nA for dP2XE) in comparison to other non-vertebrate P2X channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (4.Agboh K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2145454534,"Recently, neurotrophic factors and cytokines have been shown to be associated in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family, serves as a neurotrophic molecular and plays a significant role in the brain. We generated mice in which HB-EGF activity is disrupted specifically in the ventral forebrain. These knockout mice showed (a) behavioral abnormalities similar to those described in psychiatric disorders, which were ameliorated by typical or atypical antipsychotics, (b) altered dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, (c) decreases in spine density in neurons of the prefrontal cortex, (d) reductions in the protein levels of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and post-synaptic protein-95 (PSD-95), (e) decreases in the EGF receptor, and in the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) signal cascade. These results suggest the alterations affecting HB-EGF signaling could comprise a contributing factor in psychiatric disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1975211168,"Background African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia) exhibit a wide range of social structures, from solitary to eusocial. We previously found a lack of sex differences in the external genitalia and morphology of the perineal muscles associated with the phallus in the eusocial naked mole-rat. This was quite surprising, as the external genitalia and perineal muscles are sexually dimorphic in all other mammals examined. We hypothesized that the lack of sex differences in naked mole-rats might be related to their unusual social structure. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the genitalia and perineal muscles in three African mole-rat species: the naked mole-rat, the solitary silvery mole-rat, and the Damaraland mole-rat, a species considered to be eusocial, but with less reproductive skew than naked mole-rats. Our findings support a relationship between social structure, mating system, and sexual differentiation. Naked mole-rats lack sex differences in genitalia and perineal morphology, silvery mole-rats exhibit sex differences, and Damaraland mole-rats are intermediate. Conclusions/Significance The lack of sex differences in naked mole-rats is not an attribute of all African mole-rats, but appears to have evolved in relation to their unusual social structure and reproductive biology."
https://openalex.org/W1976082550,"The ability to disrupt the function of a specific protein on a rapid time scale provides a powerful tool for biomedical research. Specific proteases provide a potential method to selectively cleave a chosen protein, but rapid control of protease activity is difficult.A heterologous expression system for rapid target-directed proteolysis in mammalian cells was developed. The system consists of an inducible NIa protease from the tobacco etch virus (TEVp) and a chosen protein into which a TEVp substrate recognition sequence (TRS) has been inserted. Inducible activity was conferred to the TEVp using rapamycin-controlled TEVp fragment complementation. TEVp activity was assayed using a FRET-based reporter construct. TEVp expression was well tolerated by mammalian cells and complete cleavage of the substrate was possible. Cleavage at 37 degrees C proceeded exponentially with a time constant of approximately 150 minutes. Attempts to improve cleavage efficiency were hampered by substantial background activity, which was attributed to inherent affinity between the TEVp fragments. A second TEVp assay, based on changes in inactivation of a modified K(V)3.4 channel, showed that functional properties of a channel can be using altered using an inducible TEVp system. Similar levels of background activity and variability were observed in both electrophysiological and FRET assays.The results suggested that an optimum level of TEVp expression leading to sufficient inducible activity (with minimal background activity) exists but the variability in expression levels between cells makes the present system rather impractical for single cell experiments. The system is likely to be more suitable for experiments in which the cell-to-cell variability is less of an issue; for example, in experiments involving large populations of cells."

A cost-effectiveness model to estimate the costs and health benefits of the intervention was implemented.The model used data from a randomised controlled trial conducted in an Australian tertiary metropolitan hospital. Participants were acute medical admissions aged >65 years with at least one risk factor for re-admission: multiple comorbidities, impaired functionality, aged >75 years, recent multiple admissions, poor social support, history of depression. The intervention was a comprehensive nursing and physiotherapy assessment and an individually tailored program of exercise strategies and nurse home visits with telephone follow-up; commencing in hospital and continuing following discharge for 24 weeks. The change to cost outcomes, including the costs of implementing the intervention and all subsequent use of health care services, and, the change to health benefits, represented by quality adjusted life years, were estimated for the intervention as compared to existing practice. The mean change to total costs and quality adjusted life years for an average individual over 24 weeks participating in the intervention were: cost savings of $333 (95% Bayesian credible interval $ -1,932:1,282) and 0.118 extra quality adjusted life years (95% Bayesian credible interval 0.1:0.136). The mean net-monetary-benefit per individual for the intervention group compared to the usual care condition was $7,907 (95% Bayesian credible interval $5,959:$9,995) for the 24 week period.The estimation model that describes this intervention predicts cost savings and improved health outcomes. A decision to remain with existing practices causes unnecessary costs and reduced health. Decision makers should consider adopting this program for elderly hospitalised patients."

Overexpression of PDK isoforms and therefore reduced PDC activity prevails in cancer and diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the role of the invariant C-terminal DW-motif in inhibition of human PDK2 by dichloroacetate (DCA). Substitutions were made in the DW-motif (Asp-382 and Trp-383) and its interacting residues (Tyr-145 and Arg-149) in the other subunit of PDK2 homodimer. Single and double mutants show 20–60% residual activities that are not stimulated by the PDC core. The R149A and Y145F/R149A mutants show drastic increases in apparent IC50 values for DCA, whereas binding affinities for DCA are comparable with wild-type PDK2. Both R149A and Y145F variants exhibit increased similar affinities for ADP and ATP, mimicking the effects of DCA. The R149A and the DW-motif mutations (D382A/W383A) forestall binding of the lipoyl domain of PDC to these mutants, analogous to wild-type PDK2 in the presence of DCA and ADP.

https://openalex.org/W2018064393,"Mutations in the transcription factor GLI3, a downstream target of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, are responsible for the development of malformation syndromes such as Greig-cephalopolysyndactyly-syndrome (GCPS), or Pallister-Hall-syndrome (PHS). Mutations that lead to loss of function of the protein and to haploinsufficiency cause GCPS, while truncating mutations that result in constitutive repressor function of GLI3 lead to PHS. As an exception, some point mutations in the C-terminal part of GLI3 observed in GCPS patients have so far not been linked to loss of function. We have shown recently that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity a of GLI3 function.We have shown recently that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the ubiquitin ligase MID1 regulate the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of GLI3. Here we show mapping of the functional interaction between the MID1-alpha4-PP2A complex and GLI3 to a region between amino acid 568-1100 of GLI3. Furthermore we demonstrate that GCPS-associated point mutations, that are located in that region, lead to misregulation of the nuclear GLI3-localization and transcriptional activity. GLI3 phosphorylation itself however appears independent of its localization and remains untouched by either of the point mutations and by PP2A-activity, which suggests involvement of an as yet unknown GLI3 interaction partner, the phosphorylation status of which is regulated by PP2A activity, in the control of GLI3 subcellular localization and activity.The present findings provide an explanation for the pathogenesis of GCPS in patients carrying C-terminal point mutations, and close the gap in our understanding of how GLI3-genotypes give rise to particular phenotypes. Furthermore, they provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic overlap between Opitz syndrome patients with dysregulated PP2A-activity and syndromes caused by GLI3-mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2098441260,"Background Hubbell's 2001 neutral theory unifies biodiversity and biogeography by modelling steady-state distributions of species richness and abundances across spatio-temporal scales. Accurate predictions have issued from its core premise that all species have identical vital rates. Yet no ecologist believes that species are identical in reality. Here I explain this paradox in terms of the ecological equivalence that species must achieve at their coexistence equilibrium, defined by zero net fitness for all regardless of intrinsic differences between them. I show that the distinction of realised from intrinsic vital rates is crucial to evaluating community resilience. Principal Findings An analysis of competitive interactions reveals how zero-sum patterns of abundance emerge for species with contrasting life-history traits as for identical species. I develop a stochastic model to simulate community assembly from a random drift of invasions sustaining the dynamics of recruitment following deaths and extinctions. Species are allocated identical intrinsic vital rates for neutral dynamics, or random intrinsic vital rates and competitive abilities for niche dynamics either on a continuous scale or between dominant-fugitive extremes. Resulting communities have steady-state distributions of the same type for more or less extremely differentiated species as for identical species. All produce negatively skewed log-normal distributions of species abundance, zero-sum relationships of total abundance to area, and Arrhenius relationships of species to area. Intrinsically identical species nevertheless support fewer total individuals, because their densities impact as strongly on each other as on themselves. Truly neutral communities have measurably lower abundance/area and higher species/abundance ratios. Conclusions Neutral scenarios can be parameterized as null hypotheses for testing competitive release, which is a sure signal of niche dynamics. Ignoring the true strength of interactions between and within species risks a substantial misrepresentation of community resilience to habitat loss."
https://openalex.org/W2004827026,"We have previously reported that ADP ribosylation factor like 2 (Arl2), a small GTPase, content influences microtubule dynamics and cell cycle distribution in breast tumor cells, as well as the degree and distribution of phosphorylated P53. Here we show, in two different human breast adenocarcinoma models, that Arl2 content has a major impact on breast tumor cell aggressivity both in vitro and in vivo. Cells with reduced content of Arl2 displayed reduced contact inhibition, increased clonogenic or cluster formation as well as a proliferative advantage over control cells in an in vitro competition assay. These cells also caused larger tumors in SCID mice, a phenotype which was mimicked by the in vivo administration of siRNA directed against Arl2. Cells with increased Arl2 content displayed reduced aggressivity, both in vitro and in vivo, with enhanced necrosis and were also found to contain increased PP2A phosphatase activity. A rt-PCR analysis of fresh human tumor breast samples suggested that low Arl2 expression was associated with larger tumor size and greater risk of lymph node involvement at diagnosis. These data underline the role of Arl2, a small GTPase, as an important regulator of breast tumor cell aggressivity, both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2010454319,"Background The link between biodiversity and ecosystem processes has firmly been established, but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly documented. Most studies have focused on terrestrial plant systems where resource use can be difficult to quantify as species rely on a limited number of common resources. Investigating resource use at the bulk level may not always be of sufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in resource use, as species-specific nutritional niches at the biochemical level may also moderate diversity effects on resource use. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use three co-occurring marine benthic echinoderms (Brissopsis lyrifera, Mesothuria intestinalis, Parastichopus tremulus) that feed on the same phytodetrital food source, to determine whether resource partitioning is the principal mechanism underpinning diversity effects on resource use. Specifically we investigate the use of phytodetrital pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) because many of these are essential for biological functions, including reproduction. Pigments were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high performance liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and data were analysed using a combination of extended linear regression with generalised least squares (GLS) estimation and standard multivariate techniques. Our analyses reveal no species-specific selectivity for particular algal pigments, confirming that these three species do not partition food resources at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, we demonstrate increased total resource use in diverse treatments as a result of selection effects and the dominance of one species (B. lyrifera). Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for resource partitioning at the biochemical level, as pigment composition was similar between individuals, which is likely due to plentiful food availability. Reduced intra-specific competition in the species mixture combined with greater adsorption efficiency and differences in feeding behaviour likely explain the dominant use of resources by B. lyrifera."
https://openalex.org/W2068221826,"In this study, we identify determinants in dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) necessary for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), transmission. Although human B cell lines expressing DC-SIGN efficiently capture and transmit HIV-1 to susceptible target cells, cells expressing the related molecule liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) do not. To understand the differences between DC-SIGN and L-SIGN that affect HIV-1 interactions, we developed Raji B cell lines expressing different DC-SIGN/L-SIGN chimeras. Testing of the chimeras demonstrated that replacement of the DC-SIGN carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with that of L-SIGN was sufficient to impair virus binding and prevent transmission. Conversely, the ability to bind and transmit HIV-1 was conferred to L-SIGN chimeras containing the DC-SIGN CRD. We identified Trp-258 in the DC-SIGN CRD to be essential for HIV-1 transmission. Although introduction of a K270W mutation at the same position in L-SIGN was insufficient for HIV-1 binding, an L-SIGN mutant molecule with K270W and a C-terminal DC-SIGN CRD subdomain transmitted HIV-1. These data suggest that DC-SIGN structural elements distinct from the oligosaccharide-binding site are required for HIV-1 glycoprotein selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1994486161,"Background The terminal organelle is a complex structure involved in many aspects of the biology of mycoplasmas such as cell adherence, motility or cell division. Mycoplasma genitalium cells display a single terminal organelle and duplicate this structure prior to cytokinesis in a coordinated manner with the cell division process. Despite the significance of the terminal organelle in mycoplasma virulence, little is known about the mechanisms governing its duplication. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we describe the isolation of a mutant, named T192, with a transposon insertion close to the 3′ end of the mg192 gene encoding for P110 adhesin. This mutant shows a truncated P110, low levels of P140 and P110 adhesins, a large number of non-motile cells and a high frequency of new terminal organelle formation. Further analyses revealed that the high rates of new terminal organelle formation in T192 cells are a direct consequence of the reduced levels of P110 and P140 rather than to the expression of a truncated P110. Consistently, the phenotype of the T192 mutant was successfully complemented by the reintroduction of the mg192 WT allele which restored the levels of P110 and P140 to those of the WT strain. Quantification of DAPI-stained DNA also showed that the increase in the number of terminal organelles in T192 cells is not accompanied by a higher DNA content, indicating that terminal organelle duplication does not trigger DNA replication in mycoplasmas. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate the existence of a mechanism regulating terminal organelle duplication in M. genitalium and strongly suggest the implication of P110 and P140 adhesins in this mechanism."

The homologous gene in HHV-6B is dr6. Since p53 is deregulated in both HHV-6A and -6B, we characterized the expression of dr6 mRNA and the localization of the translated protein during HHV-6B infection of HCT116 cells. Expression of mRNA from dr6 was inhibited by cycloheximide and partly by phosphonoacetic acid, a known characteristic of herpesvirus early/late genes. DR6 could be detected as a nuclear protein at 24 hpi and accumulated to high levels at 48 and 72 hpi. DR6 located in dots resembling viral replication compartments. Furthermore, a novel interaction between DR6 and the viral DNA processivity factor, p41, could be detected by confocal microscopy and by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. In contrast, DR6 and p53 were found at distinct subcellular locations. Together, our data imply a novel function of DR6 during HHV-6B replication."

Stabilized transcripts were enriched for AU-Response elements (AREs), and an ARE-containing domain from the interleukin-6 (IL-6) 3′-UTR rendered a heterologous gene responsive to IL-3-mediated transcript stabilization. Many IL-3-stabilized transcripts had been associated with leukemic transformation. Deregulated Abl kinase shared with IL-3 the ability to delay turnover of transcripts involved in proliferation or differentiation blockade, relying, in part, on signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway. These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of an mRNA network linked to IL-3 contributes to leukemic cell growth."

Earlier studies reported that DC present at the site of infection trap virus particles via DC-SIGN and transfer the virus to the interacting naïve T cells. This prompted us to ask the question whether DC could acquire virus from infected T cells during DC-T cell interaction. To address this, we investigated the likely transfer of virus from HIV-1 infected T cells to DC and the underlying mechanisms involved. Results indicate that DC acquire virus from infected T cells via antigen uptake mechanism and this results in infection of DC with expression of proteins directed by viral DNA. Further studies with HIV-1 lacking the Env protein also resulted in infection of DC. The use of antibodies against DC-SIGN and DC-SIGN-R ruled out a role for receptor in the infection of DC. Additional data show that DC infection is directly correlated with the ability of DC to take up antigen from infected T cells. Overall, these studies provide evidence to suggest that HIV-1, besides infecting immune cells, also utilizes immunological mechanism(s) to acquire and disseminate virus."
