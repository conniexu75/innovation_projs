https://openalex.org/W2014737845,"Todorokite of chemical composition (Mg(0.77)Na(0.03))(Mg(0.18)Mn(2+)(0.60)Mn(4+)(5.22)22) O(12).3.07 H(2)O was synthesized by a two-step procedure. First, sodium birnessite was synthesized and magnesium was exchanged for sodium to form magnesium birnessite, which was autoclaved under a saturated steam pressure at 155 degrees C for 8 hours to form well-crystallized todorokite. Synthesized todorokite particles consisted of fibers extending from a central plate. The plate itself was made of twinned fibers forming a trilling pattern. The infrared spectra and x-ray diffraction patterns were similar to those of natural todorokite samples. Calcium birnessite and nickel birnessite, when autoclaved under conditions similar to those for magnesium birnessite, yielded a todorokite structure. However, the formation of todorokite from calcium and nickel birnessite was less extensive."

The results indicate that the logarithmic law for steady-state friction with a negative velocity dependence breaks down when friction becomes nearly equal to the shear resistance required for ductile flow and that the law changes into a flow law in shear upon further decrease in velocity. The frictionvelocity relation is crucial in stability analyses of fault motion, and the results are important for earthquake and state-of-stress problems, especially in the application of laboratory data to the slow average motion of natural faults and to the behavior of deep faults along which ductile deformation becomes increasingly predominant."
https://openalex.org/W1995450465,"The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in south-central Saskatchewan is marked by coincident anomalies in abundance of iridium and fern spores at the extinction level of a suite of Cretaceous pollen taxa. Evidence of disruption of the terrestrial flora includes the fern-spore abundance anomaly and local extinction of as much as 30 percent of angiosperm species. The reorganized earliest Tertiary flora is made up largely of surviving species that assumed new roles of dominance. Persistence of climatically sensitive taxa across the boundary indicates that if paleoclimate was altered by the terminal Cretaceous event, it returned quickly to the pre-event condition."
https://openalex.org/W1986600484,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens induces tumors in plants by transferring and integrating oncogenes (T-DNA) into the chromosomes of host plant cells. Agrobacterium strains were used to transfer complementary DNA copies of a potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) to plant cells at a wound site on tomato plant stems. Subsequently, infectious viroid RNA was found in the leaves of these plants, indicating systemic PSTV infection. This process utilized the T-DNA transfer mechanisms of Agrobacterium since PSTV infection required most virulence genes (vir) as well as one of the DNA sequences that flank either side of the Agrobacterium T-DNA. However, transfer still occurred from virE mutants of Agrobacterium, strains that fail to induce tumors even though a completely functional T-DNA is present. The virE gene seems to be directly involved in the integration of foreign DNA into plant chromosomes."

These methods exist for measuring almost all physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. The methods have been culled from the literature, from the organizations that write voluntary standards, and some have been developed by the agencies. Few provide adequate estimates of precision, and fewer still provide any evaluation of interlaboratory bias. The societal costs of these poor measurements are large. Much needs to be done to meet the physical and statistical requirements for establishing and maintaining dependable measurements. Excepting those directly supported by the National Bureau of Standards, most of the nation's measurement systems are uncontrolled."
https://openalex.org/W1983386306,"For nearly 50 years there has been a strong belief that the proton is absolutely stable. The current experimental upper bound on its decay rate is less than one proton decay per 3 tons of matter per year, which corresponds to a mean lifetime of more than 10(30) years. Even more sensitive searches for proton decay are now in progress. These are partially motivated by the development of a class of models that combine the presently accepted theories of electromagnetic, weak, and strong inter-actions into an elegant unified form. Some of these theories predict a proton lifetime short enough for the decays to be detectable by the proposed experiments. If the proton is unstable, a plausible explanation can be given for the apparent excess of matter over antimatter in the universe."

https://openalex.org/W2081374665,"The high brightness of synchrotron radiation produced by storage rings has enhanced research capability by factors of 10(6) to 10(8), from the ultraviolet to the x-ray region. There has been a steady growth in synchrotron radiation research of interest in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and the other physical sciences and their associated technologies. A large number of university, government, and industrial research organizations are utilizing this new capability at existing facilities. In the process, new partnerships have been created among these communities that have enabled each to contribute its expertise and to obtain its needed capability. A 6-gigaelectron volt storage ring, designed for use with periodic magnetic insertion devices called wigglers and undulators, has been proposed; such a facility could provide further enhancements of 10(4) to 10(6) in capability and could double the synchrotron radiation research capacity in the United States. This enhanced capability and capacity will provide new opportunities for a broad range of scientific and technological interests."
