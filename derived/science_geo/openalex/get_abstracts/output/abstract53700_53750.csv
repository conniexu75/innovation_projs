https://openalex.org/W1971251657,Balb/c mouse embryo lines maintained in culture for over 200 generations under conditions that minimize cell-cell contact do not become tumorigenic. Lines cultivated under conditions where there is extensive cell contact become tumor-producing within 30 generations. The tissue-culture property that correlates best with tumorigenicity is the loss of contact inhibition of cell division.
https://openalex.org/W2027152330,"Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, at a concentration of 40 micrograms per milliliter, inhibits the growth of HeLa and strain L cells in culture. The inhibition becomes progressively greater during the incubation of the cells. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate and adenosine, metabolites of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, do not affect the growth of either cell culture. This suggests that 3',5'-monophosphate enters the cell without alteration. Dibutyryl-adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, reported to have a greater activity than adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate on several tissues, inhibited the growth of the cells much less."

https://openalex.org/W1653687002,"Abstract The luminescent peroxidation of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (luminol) by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been investigated by stopped flow and fluorescence polarization techniques. Titration studies show that luminol acts as a 2-electron donor during the reduction of the HRP-H2O2 complexes, while electron paramagnetic resonance measurements indicate the intermediate formation of luminol radicals. Second order rate constants for the reaction between the HRP-H2O2 complex and luminol and between Complex II and luminol were found to be 2.3 x 106 m-1 sec-1 and 7.2 x 104 m-1 sec-1, respectively. An interesting feature of luminol peroxidation is that, in the presence of excess H2O2, light is one of the products. We have made a number of observations relative to the development of an appropriate mechanism for light emission. These are (a) light production occurs in a step subsequent to Complex II formation but prior to the formation of free HRP, (b) fluorescence polarization measurements have shown that Complex II is not a ternary complex and thus does not contain bound luminol, (c) Complex III does not constitute a pathway to luminescence, (d) more than 1 mole of H2O2 per mole of HRP is required for light emission, (e) light production is dependent on the square of the luminol radical concentration, this being confirmed by computer simulation of the luminescence time course, and (f) the effects of both luminol and H2O2 concentration on the initial luminescence rate show normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics when such measurements are done on the stopped flow apparatus. A kinetic scheme has been formulated and a rate equation derived from it that accounts for the data outlined above and which is consistent with current concepts of peroxidase mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1564750982,"The inhibition of several enzyme activities by free fatty acids has been examined. The inhibition of rat liver microsomal linolenate-activating enzyme activity by linolenate was found to be due to the inactivation of enzyme by substrate fatty acid. Stearoyl coenzyme A was also found to inhibit linolenate-activating enzyme. Likewise, microsomal glucose 6-phosphatase was inhibited by oleate; the extent of inhibition by oleate was related to the relative concentration of microsomal material. Citrate synthase from pig heart was inhibited by linoleate and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase of yeast was inhibited by oleate. The inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was time-dependent and the presence of glucose 6-phosphate gave considerable protection against inactivation. The marked similarity in the observed inhibition of diverse enzymes by long chain unsaturated fatty acids to that of reported inhibitions by fatty acyl-CoA esters suggests that inhibitory effects are due to detergent properties of these inhibitors. In view of these and other considerations it is suggested that the extrapolation of observed inhibitions in vitro of enzyme activities by free fatty acids to regulation of metabolism in vivo must be made with caution."
https://openalex.org/W1507258766,"Abstract These studies report the isolation of a DNA polymerase from rat liver mitochondria. The enzyme has been purified 22-fold by differential ultracentrifugation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The partially purified enzyme manifests all of the requirements shown by the known DNA polymerases of mammalian nuclei and bacteria. The enzyme has an optimal pH of 7.5, and requires Mg++ (12 mm) and the presence of all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The reaction is inhibited by pyrophosphate and by the addition of deoxyribonuclease but not by ribonuclease. Enzyme purified in this manner is free of nuclear DNA polymerase, terminal addition enzyme, and DNase. The enzyme shows an absolute requirement for added DNA template which can be furnished rather specifically by native, double-stranded, circular, mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, the labeled DNA was shown to be mitochondrial in nature by virtue of the fact that it had the same buoyant density in CsCl as unlabeled, highly purified, mitochondrial DNA and the fact that it was renaturable after heat denaturation, a property shown by mitochondrial DNA but not by mammalian nuclear DNA. The product of the reaction was shown to be a double stranded replica of the mitochondrial DNA template on the basis of autocatalytic synthesis by the enzyme with the use of nonsaturating levels of mitochondrial DNA template. A 3.5-fold synthesis of new DNA was achieved."

https://openalex.org/W1985918359,A study was undertaken in rabbits to determine how late in the course of keratoconjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex recovery could be effected by an inducer of interferon. Interferon was induced by means of synthetic double-stranded RNA copolymer formed with polynosinic acid: polycytidilic acid RNA. Therapy promotes recovery from severe and fully established keratoconjunctivitis for which treatment was begun as late as 3 days after virus inoculation. No drug toxicity was observed in the therapeutic dose range. These findings further support the proposed role of the interferon mechanism in the natural recovery of already established viral infection. They also suggest the usefulness of interferon inducers in viral infections of man.
https://openalex.org/W1491099873,"Abstract From the deacylated lipids of yeast cells grown on labeled inositol or 32Pi two compounds were isolated by ion exchange and paper chromatography. These were indistinguishable from glycerophosphorylinositol phosphate and glycerophosphorylinositol diphosphate from rat brain. The compounds treated with alkaline phosphatase gave rise to glycerophosphorylinositol and Pi in the expected ratios. The alkaline hydrolysis products were the same as those from the respective compounds obtained from rat brain. It is probable that the acylated parent lipids, diphosphoinositide and triphosphoinositide, are present in bakers' yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1523744795,"Abstract The binding of Mn2+ and substrates to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has been studied by four methods: equilibrium dialysis, gel filtration, electron paramagnetic resonance, and the proton relaxation rate of water (PRR). A binary enzyme-Mn2+ complex was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and PRR. Binary enzyme-substrate complexes were detected for guanosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate by equilibrium dialysis and for inosine diphosphate by gel filtration. Ternary complexes containing enzyme, Mn2+, and substrate were detected for IDP by gel filtration and PRR, for phosphoenolpyruvate by equilibrium dialysis and PRR, and for inosine triphosphate and oxalacetate by PRR. Higher order complexes of the form eMn-sMn were detected for GDP and GTP by equilibrium dialysis. Phospholactate, an analogue of phosphoenolpyruvate, formed ternary complexes with enzyme and Mn2+ and a stable quaternary complex with enzyme, Mn2+, and IDP, as detected by PRR. Where comparable, the dissociation constants obtained by the various methods were in good agreement. The enzyme enhanced the effect of Mn2+ on the PRR of water (eb = 14.2), and this enhancement was reduced in the ternary complexes with phosphoenolpyruvate (et = 6.7) and with IDP (et = 10.4). Since the relaxation mechanism was the same for each of these complexes (measuring the rate of chemical exchange of water protons into the coordination sphere of Mn2+), the relative values of e are consistent with the formation of enzyme-metal-substrate bridge complexes. The related enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, gives similar results, forming a binary enzyme-Mn2+ complex (eb = 13.8) and a ternary complex with phosphoenolpyruvate (et â‰¤ 11.3). The Kd of the binary complex agrees with the activator constant for Mn2+ obtained kinetically. The complexes formed by both carboxylating enzymes are thus similar to those found previously for muscle pyruvate kinase and, therefore, suggest homologous mechanisms for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1512878241,"Abstract It has been demonstrated that cell-free extracts of Corynebacterium sp. (7E1C) oxidize n-octane to 1-octanol and octanoic acid. This oxidation was catalyzed by a soluble enzyme system and required specifically NADH and molecular O2. It was insensitive to cyanide but it was inhibited by low concentrations of carbon monoxide. The active enzyme system was resolved into two protein fractions by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and both were required for n-octane oxidation. One fraction exhibited the spectral characteristics of cytochrome P-450 which could be converted to the P-420 form. The other fraction exhibited the spectral characteristic of a flavoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1560489852,"Abstract Titration of submitochondrial particles with 14C-piericidin A, labeled by biosynthesis, results in linear binding which continues well beyond the point at which NADH oxidase activity is completely inhibited. However, when the titrated particles are treated with a bovine serum albumin solution, excellent proportionality is found between the binding and inhibition curves, indicating that binding is only at the specific site associated with NADH oxidase activity, and not at unspecific sites. The titer for 14C-piericidin A at the specific site in membrane fragments of varying complexity in cytochrome composition is 1 to 1.5 times the estimated concentration of NADH dehydrogenase. These findings confirm and extend previous studies with 14C-rotenone which binds at the same site but with a lower affinity, requiring indirect rather than direct calculation of the titer. The binding of 14C-piericidin A to the specific site is noncovalent, since the radiocarbon bound to this site is released by protein denaturants, phospholipase A, and proteolytic enzymes. Rotenone and Amytal, which bind at the same specific site as piericidin A, do not effectively compete with piericidin A nor remove it from this site, while piericidin A readily displaces bound rotenone from the specific site. Thus, piericidin A is a more specific and more tightly bound inhibitor of the NADH oxidase segment of the respiratory chain than either rotenone or barbiturates. Several labeled 14C-compounds related to piericidin A, although qualitatively acting in the same manner, are less effective inhibitors and bind less tightly. The inhibition of succinoxidase activity by piericidin A reported in the literature requires high inhibitor concentration and is probably associated with unspecific binding. Only cytochrome b reduction accompanies NADH oxidation in piericidin A-inhibited submitochondrial particles, whereas all the cytochromes are slowly reduced in piericidin A-inhibited mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1597350723,"Abstract Coenzyme A-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli strain B was purified 170-fold over cell-free extracts, and certain of its properties were investigated. The enzyme is essentially inactive in the absence of sulfhydryl compounds such as dithiothreitol and Î²-mercaptoethanol. Addition of a thiol reagent after incubation of the enzyme with substrates results in very slow reactivation. Incubation of aldehyde dehydrogenase with DPN plus mercaptan before addition of other substrates is required in order to obtain normal initial velocities. The kinetics of the system was investigated from both sides of the reaction. Initial velocity experiments suggest the mechanism is ping-pong. These studies, although still preliminary, imply that acetyl-CoA adds to the dehydrogenase before addition of DPNH. With regard to the other side of the reaction, it is thought that DPN and acetaldehyde interact with the enzyme prior to the addition of CoA. The last step in the reaction sequence may be a transacetylation between the enzyme and CoA to form acetyl-CoA. Additional properties of the enzyme, such as optimum pH, substrate specificity, and reaction stoichiometry, were also studied."

https://openalex.org/W1533460149,"Abstract The possible involvement of mutarotases in glucose metabolism has been studied by examining the anomeric specificities of a number of glycolytic enzymes. Hexokinases from yeast or Ehrlich ascites tumor cells showed only a marginal preference for the Î± anomer of glucose. (All configurations, unless otherwise specified, refer to the d configuration of glucose and its derivatives.) The Km values for Î±- and Î²-glucose were 58 and 66 Âµm, respectively, for the yeast enzyme, 77 Âµm, and 82 Âµm for the tumor enzyme. Turnover numbers were also 10 to 20% higher with Î±-glucose. The anomeric composition and mutarotation rate of glucose 6-phosphate were measured under different conditions by utilizing the specificity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase for Î²-glucose 6-phosphate. The anomeric composition (39% Î±, 61% Î²) is similar to glucose, but the mutarotation rate (k = 0.157 min-1 at -0.5Â°) is approximately 270 times that of glucose. The anomeric composition of the glucose liberated from glucose 6-phosphate by acid or alkaline phosphatases and by glucose 6-phosphatase from rat liver was the same as that of the substrate, indicating a lack of anomeric specificity for these enzymes also. This lack of anomeric preference in the enzymatic phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of glucose, the extremely rapid spontaneous mutarotation of glucose 6-phosphate which is unaffected by mutarotase, and the low measured levels of mutarotase in certain tissues which nevertheless have high glycolytic rates suggest that this enzyme is not involved directly in glucose metabolism. It also appears that the existence of rate-limiting anomerizations in glucose metabolism is unlikely."

When a rapid eye movement was made across the same stimulus, many of these neurons continued to give an excitatory response. But the discharge of other neurons was unchanged or was suppressed during the eye movement."
https://openalex.org/W124723856,"Abstract Synthetic cytochrome c peroxidases were reconstituted from the apoenzyme and unnatural hemins such as hemato-, meso-, and deuterohemins and 90% 57Fe-enriched protohemin. These synthetic enzymes were crystallized by dialysis against distilled water. On the addition of a stoichiometric amount of hydroperoxide, these synthetic enzymes were converted to stable peroxide intermediates (Complex ES), which retained 2 oxidizing eq derived from hydroperoxide and exhibited an intense electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal of a free radical type at g = 2.004. The synthetic enzymes reacted with various heme ligands such as fluoride, azide, cyanide, and CO to form well defined complexes. The light absorption maxima of these synthetic enzymes and their derivatives were shifted to shorter wave lengths in comparison with the corresponding derivatives of the natural enzyme. However, the over-all patterns of absorption spectra of these derivatives of the synthetic enzymes were very similar to those of the natural enzyme. The EPR spectra of these synthetic enzymes indicated that these enzymes were a mixture of high and low spin compounds at -196Â°. Cytochrome c peroxidase containing 57Fe-enriched protohemin exhibited slightly broader EPR signals of high and low spin ferric types. However, no hyperfine splitting was observed under the present conditions. The enzymic activities of these synthetic enzymes in the peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocytochrome c, ferrocyanide, and ascorbate were found to be quite similar, indicating that the side chains of porphyrin IX at positions 2 and 4 were not essential for the catalytic activity of cytochrome c peroxidase."

https://openalex.org/W1498398798,"Abstract By selective modification of the lysyl residues in cytochrome b5 reductase with ethyl acetimidate, acetic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and trinitrobenzenesulfonate, derivatives were prepared in which one or several of the properties of the native enzyme had been altered. A comparison of these derivatives and the unmodified flavoprotein identified three classes of lysyl residues. The most reactive group includes the residues which are essential for the interaction of the reductase with its natural electron acceptor, cytochrome b5. The remaining lysyl residues, which react in the presence of NADH, are essential for a stable holoenzyme structure and for the normal sequence of apoprotein refolding to an active conformation following acid denaturation. Finally, a single amino group is protected from these reagents by NADH, and appears to be involved in the binding of this substrate and in the direct hydrogen transfer from the pyridine nucleotide to the flavoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1531964899,"Abstract Rabbit renal tubule segments, prepared by collagenase digestion, were used to study glycine transport. A distinct two-limbed curve found when studying the effects of substrate concentration on transport indicated the presence of at least two transport systems for glycine. These systems could not be distinguished by their response to metabolic inhibitors or the removal of sodium from the incubation medium. Proline and alanine both inhibited glycine competitively, but were shown to share different transport systems with glycine. The use of alanine and proline at maximal inhibitory concentrations allowed the separation of glycine transport into three kinetically distinct systems. The kinetic constants derived from this analysis were examined with the aid of a computer program and the computed values were found to agree with the experimental determinations."
https://openalex.org/W1484045710,"Abstract Inosinic acid dehydrogenase was partially purified from sarcoma 180 cells. The concentrations of each reactant, inosine 5'-phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and K+, altered both the apparent Km and Vmax values for each of the other reactants. Enzymatic activity was inhibited by both products of the reaction, xanthosine 5'-phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; the inhibition produced by XMP was competitive with respect to IMP, whereas the inhibition caused by NADH was not competitive with respect to either IMP, NAD+, or K+. The data are consistent with an enzymatic mechanism involving ordered sequential addition of IMP, NAD+, and K+ to the enzyme to form active enzyme-substrate complexes. Substrate inhibition occurred at NAD+ concentrations several-fold higher than the optimal concentration of NAD+; the kinetics suggests that formation of an abortive ternary complex between the enzyme, XMP, and NAD+ is involved in producing this substrate inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1492980527,"Abstract Threonyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase from Escherichia coli was purified 320-fold in 10% yield. The Km for the over-all reaction, in which threonyl-tRNA is formed, is 10-4 m for ATP and 12 x 10-6 m for threonine. The molecular weight is 117,000 Â± 9% as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The enzyme readily catalyzes a threonine-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction. Threonyl adenylate-enzyme complex was isolated, and, in the presence of MgCl2 and tRNA, the amino acid was rapidly esterified to tRNA. At pH 7, the complex has a half-life of 29 min at 30Â° and 78 min at 10Â°. When threonyl adenylate-enzyme complex is treated with hydroxylamine, no threonine hydroxamate is formed and free threonine is the product, but if the complex is first treated with p-chloromercuribenzoate followed by hydroxylamine, threonine hydroxamate can be recovered in 50% yield. The phenylalanyl adenylate-enzyme complex was isolated, and it readily reacted with hydroxylamine to form phenylalanine hydroxamate. This complex has a half-life of 7 min at 30Â° and 35 min at 10Â°."

A proposed model of the active site that contains other knowledge of the specificity and the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme postulates the existence of three nonequivalent phosphate binding subsites and a closely related phosphodiester hydrolytic subsite.

The substrate requirements of the enzymes used and an efficient fractionation method based on precipitation of interfering substances with zinc sulfate-barium hydroxide made the determination specific for 3',5'-AMP. The method detected as little as 6 x 10-12 moles of 3',5'-cyclic adenylate and was effectively applied to the detection of the nucleotide in tissues and in urine."

The glycolipid contains 2 fatty acid groups per molecule. Small amounts of decanoic, lauric, palmitic, and stearic acids are present, but the major fatty acids have not been identified. Methylation and periodate oxidation studies indicate that one fatty acid is esterified to position 6 of mannose and the other to position 1 of myoinositol. Phosphatidylmyoinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate are also major components of the extract."

The position of the oligonucleotides was ascertained by radioautography, and their sequence was determined by further digesting them with alkali or any of a number of nucleases of different specificities. The quantitative yield of oligonucleotides suggests that KB cell 5 S RNA has a nucleotide sequence of 120 base residues with pGpU- as the 5'-terminal sequence and -GpCpUpU as the 3'-terminal sequence, or an alternative sequence of 121 base residues with an additional 3'-terminal pU."

https://openalex.org/W1496818967,"Abstract A neutral, heat-labile compound (II) has been detected as a product of lysine fermentation by cell-free extracts of Clostridium SB4. A 2 to 5% yield of II from lysine is observed when coenzyme A is omitted from an otherwise complete reaction mixture. 3,5-Diaminohexanoate appears to be the immediate precursor of Compound II since it can be converted to II under conditions not permitting the utilization of lysine or Î²-lysine. Under favorable conditions, 3,5-diaminohexanoate is enzymically converted to Compound II in 20 to 30% yield. The cofactors required for the reaction are NAD and Î±-ketoglutarate or pyruvate; the latter is active only when lactic dehydrogenase is also added. The formation of Compound II appears to occur by a reversible NAD-dependent oxidative deamination of 3,5-diaminohexanoate. The keto acids function as oxidants in the reoxidation of NADH by the appropriate dehydrogenases. Although Compound II has not been isolated as a pure compound because of its instability, chemical and enzymic studies indicate that its structure is 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate. Compound II is reduced by borohydride to a heat-stable hydroxyamino acid, and is decarboxylated to a basic methyl ketone. The latter reacts with hypoiodite to give iodoform and Î²-aminobutyrate; therefore, it appears to be 2-keto-4-aminopentane."
https://openalex.org/W1514620408,"Abstract Fourteen partially purified Escherichia coli aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases were tested for their rates of amino acid hydroxamate formation relative to the rates of aminoacyl-tRNA formation. Three groups of reactivity were observed: tyrosyl-, phenylalanyl-, tryptophanyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze hydroxamate formation at rates comparable to those for aminoacyl-tRNA formation; with lysyl-, alanyl-, isoleucyl-, glycyl-, cysteinyl-, leucyl-, seryl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases, the relative rates of hydroxamate formation progressively decrease; and glutaminyl- and threonyl-tRNA synthetases do not catalyze hydroxamate formation. In an unfractionated enzyme extract, threonine hydroxamate forms, but this is totally accounted for by the mistaken activation of threonine by the valyl-tRNA synthetase. Purified threonyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes hydroxamate formation only when tRNA is present, by catalyzing the formation of threonyl-tRNA, which reacts nonenzymatically with hydroxylamine. The mammalian threonyl-tRNA synthetase also fails to catalyze formation of threonine hydroxamate from amino acid and ATP."

https://openalex.org/W98728878,"Abstract In the course of digestion of nucleic acids by micrococcal nuclease in the presence of low Ca++ concentration, three distinct phases of the reaction are observed. The first and the third are slow, and the second is fast. The reaction rate during the first phase is proportional to Ca++ concentration. An autoaccelerated second phase, showing little dependence on Ca++ concentration, has been observed with native DNA, denatured DNA, and RNA. The apparent end point (termination of the third phase) occurs earlier with decreasing Ca++ concentration. Of the three substrates studied, native DNA, RNA, and denatured DNA, native DNA is the most resistant. However, since each has a different requirement for Ca++, the relative hydrolytic rates vary widely with Ca++ concentration. Introduction of 0.15 m NaCl into the reaction medium accelerates the first phase and decelerates the second phase. The over-all reaction is slower, and the extent of hydrolysis is decreased. Under identical conditions, micrococcal nuclease hydrolyzes denatured DNA much faster than native DNA. However, in the presence of both substrates, it does not hydrolyze denatured DNA exclusively. The autoacceleration phenomenon suggests that the best substrate for micrococcal nuclease is a polynucleotide chain of intermediate length (between nucleic acids and short oligonucleotides), and, therefore, the enzyme should be classified as a polynucleotidase."

The number of half-cystines per 32,000 g of protein is 4.5 as determined by amino acid analysis. Thus, there are no disulfide bonds in the native enzyme. In the absence of urea, approximately 2.0 thiol groups per 32,000 g of protein are accessible to titration with either DTNB or p-chloromercuribenzoate (CMB). In addition, only 2.1 moles of 14C-CMB are bound in the absence of urea. The two accessible groups per 32,000 g of protein are very reactive with CMB, and at least one of the two is very reactive with DTNB. The reaction with DTNB and the biphasic loss in activity with time when the enzyme was incubated with cystamine suggest that at least two types of thiol groups are accessible in the absence of a denaturing agent. The enzyme activity is inhibited by monovalent and divalent mercurials, by disulfides, and by oxidizing agents. The extent of inhibition, and the reversal of the inhibition by 2-mercaptoethanol are dependent on the reagent used. The disulfide reagents are more effective inhibitors than p-chloromercuribenzoate. The inhibition caused by the different reagents is greater on the activity at pH 6.9 than on the activity at pH 8.2. Studies on the role of thiol residues on the kinetics of the enzyme revealed that when one-half of the accessible thiol groups are allowed to react with CMB, the enzyme has the following properties: (a) a decreased affinity for fructose-6-P, (b) a decreased maximum catalytic activity, (c) a loss in cooperativity between fructose-6-P binding sites at pH 6.9 and (d) a complete loss in cooperativity in the presence of an activator. Reacting the enzyme sulfhydryl groups with the various reagents apparently results in a conformational change in the protein, thus modifying the catalytic sites."
