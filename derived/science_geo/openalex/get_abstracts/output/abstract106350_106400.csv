https://openalex.org/W1549512600,"Arginine vasopressin modulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Release is mediated by the V1b receptor through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. In contrast to its well characterized peripheral actions, such as antidiuresis, contraction of vascular smooth muscle, and stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, the exact site and mechanism of vasopressin action in the pituitary remain unclear. This is largely due to a lack of information on the molecular identity and exact localization of the V1b receptor. This lack prompted us to try to isolate this receptor subtype. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional expression of a complementary DNA encoding the human V1b receptor. The deduced 424-amino acid sequence of the receptor has highest overall homology with the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors, with homologies of 45, 39, and 45%, respectively. The receptor expressed in COS-1 cells has a single binding site for arginine vasopressin with a Kd of 0.17 +/- 0.04 nM. It binds various agonists and antagonists of vasopressin with affinities distinct from those of V1a and V2 receptors but consistent with those anticipated for the V1b receptor on the basis of the pharmacological studies. Furthermore, arginine vasopressin evoked calcium-dependent chloride current in Xenopus oocytes transfected with the receptor, which was not affected by a V1a/V2 antagonist. In contrast, the current evoked in oocytes transfected with V1a receptor was abolished by the antagonist. Northern blot analysis revealed that the receptor expression is restricted to the pituitary. These data clearly indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the V1b receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1564583863,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent growth regulatory protein normally secreted by cells in a latent form. Primary regulation of TGF-beta activity occurs through factors which control the processing of the latent to the biologically active molecule. Thrombospondin (TSP), a platelet alpha-granule and extracellular matrix protein, forms specific complexes with active TGF-beta in platelet releasate and activates endogenous latent TGF-beta secreted by endothelial cells via a cell- and protease-independent mechanism. In order to better understand TSP-mediated activation of cell-secreted latent TGF-beta, we examined the consequences of interactions of the large (platelet-derived) and small (recombinant) forms of latent TGF-beta with TSP in a chemically defined system. Data from these studies show that interactions between TSP and both forms of latent TGF-beta result in the generation of biologically active TGF-beta as assayed by the ability of NRK-49F cells to form colonies in soft agar, by the ability to compete for binding to TGF-beta receptors on endothelial cells, and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay selective for the active form of TGF-beta. Activation of latent TGF-beta by TSP stripped of associated TGF-beta activity (sTSP) is time- and concentration-dependent, but temperature-independent. The mechanism whereby sTSP activates latent TGF-beta appears to involve the direct binding of sTSP to the latent molecule as shown by gel permeation chromatography. In addition, a polyclonal antibody specific for the amino-terminal region of the latency-associated peptide (amino acids 81-94) inhibits sTSP-mediated activation of latent TGF-beta in both the chemically defined system and in endothelial cell conditioned medium. These data and the observation that similar concentrations of sTSP activate latent TGF-beta in both the chemically defined system and in the endothelial cell system indicate that there is a common mechanism by which TSP activates the small, large, and endothelial cell-derived latent TGF-beta complexes. The ability of TSP to convert latent TGF-beta to biologically active TGF-beta suggests that TSP is a major regulatory factor in the control of TGF-beta activity."
https://openalex.org/W1571622263,"Poliovirus proteinase 3CDpro by itself is not an RNA-binding protein. Two cellular proteins have been purified from HeLa cells (p50 and p36) which interact with purified 3CDpro but only p36-3CDpro bind to the 5'-terminal 110 nucleotides of polioviral RNA genome, an RNA segment whose secondary structure resembles a cloverleaf. The identity of these factors was determined by microsequencing tryptic digests of the purified proteins. Host protein p50 is the eukaryotic elongation factor EF-1 alpha, and p36 an N-terminal fragment thereof. p36, referred to as host factor, did not appear to interact with purified 3Cpro or 3Dpol. Significantly, the formation of a 3CDpro-cloverleaf complex was also observed in the presence of purified poliovirus polypeptide 3AB, the precursor of VPg. 3AB by itself does not stably bind to the cloverleaf. Competition experiments have demonstrated that the RNA-protein interactions are specific for the full-length cloverleaf. UV cross-linking studies were employed to examine the protein components of the cloverleaf ribonucleoproteins. RNA footprinting was used to determine the site on the cloverleaf where the viral and cellular factors bind. Finally, we have discovered that 3AB-3CDpro also interacts with the 3'-terminal sequence of poliovirus RNA. In contrast to the 5'-terminal cloverleaf, the 3'-terminal RNA can bind 3AB in the absence of other proteins. A model for initiation of poliovirus RNA synthesis is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1659420318,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is complexed with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the alpha-granules of stimulated platelets. TSP stripped of associated TGF-beta activity (sTSP) activates latent TGF-beta secreted by bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAE) in culture. To better understand the interactions of TSP with TGF-beta, we investigated which region of sTSP interacts with TGF-beta. The chymotrypsin-resistant core of TSP, which contains the procollagen-like region and the properdin-like type 1 repeats, activated both latent TGF-beta secreted by BAE and a recombinant form of the small latent TGF-beta complex at levels similar to or better than sTSP. The core fragment bound 125I-TGF-beta in solution and shifted the elution profile of 125I-TGF-beta in gel permeation chromatography. Fusion constructs of the type 1, 2, and 3 repeats and the COOH terminus of TSP1 were tested for their ability to activate latent TGF-beta. Only the type 1 construct, containing the three properdin-like repeats of TSP found in the 50-kDa fragment, activated latent TGF-beta. In addition, a polyclonal antibody against the type 1 construct inhibits activation of latent TGF-beta by intact TSP, suggesting that this region is exposed in the intact molecule. These results show that the type 1 properdin-like repeats of TSP are responsible for activating recombinant and endothelial cell-derived latent TGF-beta and that this site is exposed in intact TSP."

https://openalex.org/W1544291394,"A new regulatory element for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers was found in the promoter of the malic enzyme gene. Similar to previously characterized peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs), it consists of a direct repeat of sequences related to the half-site consensus AGGTCA with an interspacing of 1 base pair. Specific binding of PPAR/RXR heterodimers to this element was demonstrated. Furthermore, this sequence conferred ciprofibrate responsiveness of a reporter through the homologous malic enzyme or heterologous thymidine kinase promoters. This PPRE presumably mediates the transcriptional effects of peroxisome proliferators on malic enzyme expression. The presence of a PPRE in the promoter of this lipogenic enzyme suggests a broader function for the PPAR in the regulation of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1519091149,"Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family promote angiogenesis and wound repair, modulate early developmental events and survival of neurons, and have been associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases. FGFs interact with specific FGF receptors (FGFRs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces to mediate mitogenesis. Using protein structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of basic FGF (bFGF), we have identified two FGFR binding sites on bFGF which act in concert to initiate signal transduction. Both FGFR binding surfaces are distinct from the heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding domain. The primary, higher affinity, binding interaction comprises a cluster of solvent exposed hydrophobic amino acids (Tyr-24, Tyr-103, Leu-140, and Met-142), and two polar residues (Arg-44 and Asn-101). The hydrophobic contacts dominate the primary binding interaction and provide approximately 75% of the binding affinity. The secondary FGFR binding site on bFGF has an approximately 250-fold lower affinity and is composed of amino acids Lys-110, Tyr-111, and Trp-114 in a surface-exposed type I beta-turn (formerly known as the putative receptor binding loop). Binding of FGFR to both bFGF surfaces in a stoichiometry of 2FGFR:1bFGF is required for growth factor mediated cell proliferation. This represents a mechanism for the fibroblast growth factor/receptor family in which FGF facilitates FGFR dimerization and subsequent signal transduction events as a monomeric ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2136483193,"Are two eyes needed for judging direction of self-motion? Traditional analyses stress that the pattern of optic flow in one eye is sufficient. The main difficulty is how to deal with the eye or head rotation. Extraretinal signals help, but humans can also discount the effect of rotation purely on the basis of monocular flow provided the scene contains depth. Depth differences give rise to changing binocular disparities when the observer moves. These disparities are ignored in monocular theories of judgements of heading. Using computer generated displays, we investigated whether stereoscopic presentation improves heading judgements for conditions that pose problems to the monocular observer. We found that adding disparities to simulated ego-motion through a cloud of dots made heading judgements up to four times more tolerant to motion noise. The same improvement was found when the disparities specify the initial distances throughout the motion sequence. We conclude that binocular disparities improve judgements of heading by imposing a depth order on the elements of the scene, not because they provide additional information on the elements' motion in depth."
https://openalex.org/W1506201015,"We have found that a strong DNA synthesis arrest site forms in the chicken beta-globin promoter in vitro under physiological conditions. The arrest site is located in a G+C-rich region in which the guanines are located predominately on the top strand and the pyrimidines on the bottom strand. This region is non-palindromic and has no mirror symmetry. Arrest of DNA synthesis is only observed when the G-rich strand of the promoter is used as the template, and shows an absolute requirement for K+. The sequence G16CG(GGT)3 is necessary and sufficient to arrest DNA synthesis. This arrest is template concentration independent and is eliminated by blocking the N7 positions of the last 4 guanine residues in the arrest site. These observations suggest that the basis of the block to chain extension is the formation of an unusual tetraplex-like structure by the template strand. Sequences able to form intrastrand tetraplexes are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. We show that known intrastrand tetraplex-forming sequences arrest DNA synthesis in vitro, suggesting that this may be a general property of DNA tetraplexes. We suggest that the arrest of DNA synthesis by some of these structures may account for some of the high frequency of recombination associated with these loci, perhaps by promoting strand slippage or providing an opportunity for strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1598239389,"We have cloned and sequenced the human genomic DNA segments encoding the 5'-flanking region and the first two exons of the DOPAchrome tautomerase (DT)/tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) gene. The DT gene is a member of the tyrosinase gene family and specifically expressed in melanin-producing cells. A transcriptional initiation site of the DT gene was identified by S1 nuclease-mapping and primer-extension analyses using RNA prepared from human pigmented melanoma cells. To study the mechanism for pigment cell-specific expression of the human DT gene, we analyzed the promoter function of its 5'-flanking region by transient expression assays. The fusion genes, containing the DT gene promoter upstream from a firefly luciferase reporter gene, were introduced into human pigmented melanoma cells and HeLa cells, and the pigment cell-specific promoter activity was evaluated by comparing the luciferase activity expressed in both cell lines. A series of 5' deletion studies of the human DT gene promoter revealed that the 32-bp element, located between -447 and -415, is sufficient to confer pigment cell-specific expression of a reporter gene on a homologous promoter, but not on a heterologous simian virus 40 promoter. Internal deletion studies using a homologous or a heterologous promoter revealed that the pigment cell-specific expression of a reporter gene mediated by the 32-bp element is dependent on the presence of another region of the DT gene spanning from -268 to -56, which was termed the proximal region. However, the proximal region by itself is not sufficient to confer cell type-specific expression. These results indicate that the presence of two regulatory regions, the 32-bp element and the proximal region, is required for pigment cell-specific expression of the DT gene. Both regulatory regions contain a CANNTG motif, a well known binding site for a large family of transcription factors possessing a basic helix-loop-helix structure."
https://openalex.org/W1511732870,"Purified recombinant poliovirus polypeptide 3AB interacts with 3CDpro and 3Dpol as shown by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-3Dpol antibodies. A consequence of this interaction is an accelerated autoprocessing of 3CDpro to produce 3Cpro and 3Dpol. The activation of 3Dpol polymerase activity by cleavage of 3CDpro, a polypeptide that has no polymerase activity, can be shown by template- and primer-dependent poly(U) synthesis. Anti-VPg antibodies (VPg = 3B) added to HeLa translation extracts programmed with poliovirion RNA inhibit cleavage of 3CDpro whereas addition of purified 3AB or VPg to these translation reactions increases 3CDpro processing. 3AB stimulates also 3Cpro-related proteolysis of 2BC, a poliovirus-specific, nonstructural processing intermediate. In contrast, 3CDpro-specific cleavage of the structural precursor P1 is inhibited by the addition of 3AB as shown by a decrease in the production of VP0 and VP3. These data shed new light on a phenomenon in the regulation of expression of poliovirus genetic information: whereas the proteinase 3CDpro is needed for processing of the capsid precursor, the cleavage product of this relatively stable precursor is required for RNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1502992048,"The cAMP response element (CRE)-binding transcription factor CREB can mediate induction of gene transcription in response to calcium as well as to cAMP. Since the rat insulin I gene 5'-flanking region contains a CRE with an octamer-like motif (TGACGTCC), CREB binding and cAMP/calcium responsiveness of the insulin CRE were investigated. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in Southwestern blot experiments, bacterially expressed recombinant CREB bound to the insulin CRE as it did to the rat glucagon and rat somatostatin gene CREs. However, in nuclear extracts of the pancreatic islet cell line HIT, protein complexes binding to the insulin CRE did not contain proteins with CREB-like immunoreactivity, although these bound to the glucagon and somatostatin CREs. When reporter fusion genes were transfected into HIT cells, the isolated insulin CRE increased basal activity and mediated transcriptional activation by cAMP. However, cAMP stimulation of transcription through the insulin CRE was weak when compared with the response through the glucagon and somatostatin CREs. Furthermore, the insulin CRE did not confer responsiveness to membrane depolarization and calcium influx, in contrast to the glucagon and somatostatin CREs. These results demonstrate that the functional properties of the rat insulin I gene CRE are different from those of the rat glucagon and somatostatin CREs which may be explained by a distinct pattern of nuclear protein binding and suggest the existence of post-translational mechanisms that decrease the binding of cellular CREB to the insulin CRE."
https://openalex.org/W1675828477,"Human amphiregulin (AR) is a heparin-binding growth factor which functions by binding to and activating the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. AR contains an EGF-like domain (residues 44-84) and a Lys/Arg-rich NH2-terminal extension (residues 1-43). Synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 8-26, 26-44, and 68-84 of AR were tested for their ability to compete for the binding of AR to immobilized heparin. AR8-26 and AR68-84 had no significant effect on the binding of AR to heparin, whereas AR26-44 bound to heparin and blocked the binding of AR to heparin. Both soluble heparin and heparan sulfate inhibited AR-induced mitogenesis in MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells with an IC50 of 5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas soluble chondroitin sulfate had only a slight inhibitory effect. When MCF-10A cells were grown in the presence of chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfation, or exposed to the glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes heparitinase or heparinase, the ability of AR to evoke mitogenesis in these cells was lost. Chlorate, heparitinase, or heparinase treatment inhibited AR-induced autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the EGF receptor. None of these treatments had any significant effect on EGF-triggered mitogenic signaling by the EGF receptor. These results indicate that extracellular heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan is essential to AR-induced mitogenic signaling by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2128485064,"Minichromosome plasmid DNA templates containing oriC and two Ter sites, oriented as they are on the Escherichia coli chromosome, have been used to study the role of Tus in termination of bidirectional replication. In replication reactions reconstituted with purified proteins where it could be demonstrated that each active template was replicating bidirectionally, Tus was required to prevent extensive overreplication. In the presence of Tus, both replication forks terminated DNA synthesis at one or the other Ter site in an apparent stepwise manner. First, the progress of one replication fork was arrested by a properly oriented Tus-Ter complex. Then, either because of steric hindrance resulting from the stalled replication machinery of the first fork or because of the formation of a branched DNA structure, the progression of the second opposing fork was halted at the same site on the DNA template. In the absence of Tus, overreplication required DNA ligase and arose via a template strand-switching mechanism. Thus, the role of Tus in E. coli is more likely to prevent overreplication rather than to ensure accurate termination."
https://openalex.org/W1586091975,"We have examined the regulation by retinoic acid of the gene encoding apolipoprotein D (apoD), a human plasma protein belonging to the superfamily of the lipocalins that is produced by a specific subtype of highly differentiated breast carcinomas. Northern blot analysis revealed that all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) strongly induced the accumulation of apoD mRNA in T-47D and ZR-75-1 estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, while no inductive effect was observed in estrogen receptor-negative cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435. The effect of RA on apoD expression by T-47D cells was at least 12-fold more potent than the effect of the steroids dihydrotestosterone and dexamethasone, which had been previously described as hormonal up-regulators of apoD expression in these cells. A time course study demonstrated that the induction of apoD mRNA reached a level of 15-fold over the untreated control cells after 48 h of incubation in the presence of a 10(-7) M concentration of RA. A dose-response analysis showed that as little as 10(-13) M RA produced an accumulation of 5-fold over the control, while incubation of the cells in the presence of 10(-5) M RA induced a maximal accumulation of 24-fold over the control untreated cells. The induction of apoD mRNA was independent of the synthesis of proteins de novo, as demonstrated by the fact that the induction was also detected in the presence of cycloheximide. The incubation of the cells in the presence of RA did not affect significantly the stability of apoD mRNA. By contrast, treatment of the T-47D cells with RA produced an increase of approximately 8-fold in the rate of transcription of the apoD gene. Furthermore, treatment of the T-47D cells with RA induced the synthesis and secretion to the culture medium of apoD. This increased expression of apoD was accompanied by an inhibition of cell proliferation and a progression through a more differentiated phenotype, suggesting that the mechanisms controlling RA-induced growth arrest, cell differentiation, and apoD synthesis may be directly coordinated in human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605318792,"A mouse kidney cDNA isolated by differential screening was found to be highly homologous to rat, human, and bovine plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx) sequences. Analysis of the full-length coding region sequence demonstrated an in-frame selenocysteine-encoding opal codon and putative signal sequence, suggesting that the sequence represents the mouse homolog of plasma GPx. The level of expression of plasma GPx in various mouse tissues and during development was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Plasma GPx mRNA was observed to be very abundant in kidney compared with placenta, epididymis, intestine, lung, heart, testis, ovary, salivary gland, spleen, thymus, stomach, brain, and fetal kidney and could not be detected in pancreas or in liver except from pregnant mice. In addition, plasma GPx mRNA levels were shown to increase during postnatal development of the kidney. In situ hybridization localized plasma GPx mRNA to proximal tubules, while primary cell culture demonstrated that plasma GPx is synthesized and secreted by proximal tubular epithelial cells. The relative abundance of plasma GPx mRNA in mouse kidney suggests that proximal tubules may be the primary source of the enzyme detectable in plasma and further suggests that plasma GPx has an important function in protecting the kidney from oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W1588180355,"Bradykinin is a potent vasodilatory peptide hormone involved in a broad range of physiological actions. While it acts through at least two types of receptors which are named B1 and B2, most of its effects are mediated via activation of the B2 receptor. The gene for this receptor was isolated from a rat genomic library and shown to span more than 28 kilobases, including four introns. The relative positions of the exons were mapped and all exons, intron-exon boundaries, and 5'- and 3'-flanking regions were sequenced. While the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA is distributed on all four exons, the coding and the 3'-untranslated region are located entirely on the fourth exon. Characterization of the region upstream to the transcriptional start site detected by primer extension analysis shows that the bradykinin B2 receptor promoter contains no typical TATA or CCAAT boxes. Nevertheless, the promoter sequence was shown to be functional in NG108-15 cells transfected with a construct bearing 1.1 kilobases of 5'-flanking sequence fused to a luciferase reporter gene. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected two different bradykinin B2 receptor mRNAs containing or lacking exon 3 in all rat tissues tested, providing evidence for alternative splicing of the 5'-untranslated sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1606408161,"The effect of heparin and other glycosaminoglycans on the activation of factor X by the phospholipid membrane-bound human factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex (intrinsic fXase) was studied. Standard heparin inhibited purified intrinsic fXase by 50% at approximately 0.08 unit/ml (0.4 microgram/ml), which is below the normal range of heparin concentrations achieved during antithrombotic therapy (0.2-0.7 unit/ml). Kinetic and binding experiments revealed that heparin behaves as a partial noncompetitive inhibitor. The inhibition constant of heparin with affinity for antithrombin was indistinguishable from heparin with high affinity for antithrombin (Ki = 20 nM). Additionally, low molecular heparin, which also is used as an antithrombotic drug, was a potent inhibitor of intrinsic fXase (Ki = 60 nM). Dermatan sulfate inhibited intrinsic fXase much more weakly than standard heparin (IC50 = 80 micrograms/ml). The IC50 of the other mammalian glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid, were greater than 100 micrograms/ml. Purified prothrombinase and extrinsic fXase were not inhibited by heparin. We propose that part of the antithrombotic action of heparin and molecular weight heparin is due to anti-thrombin-independent inhibition of intrinsic fXase and that heparin with affinity for antithrombin may be useful as an antithrombotic agent."
https://openalex.org/W1645877609,"In pancreatic beta-cells, the high Km glucose transporter GLUT2 catalyzes the first step in glucose-induced insulin secretion by glucose uptake. Expression of the transporter has been reported to be modulated by glucose either at the protein or mRNA levels. In this study we used the differentiated insulinoma cell line INS-1 which expresses high levels of GLUT2 and show that the expression of GLUT2 is regulated by glucose at the transcriptional level. By run-on transcription assays we showed that glucose induced GLUT2 gene transcription 3-4-fold in INS-1 cells which was paralleled by a 1.7-2.3-fold increase in cytoplasmic GLUT2 mRNA levels. To determine whether glucose regulatory sequences were present in the promoter region of GLUT2, we cloned and characterized a 1.4-kilobase region of mouse genomic DNA located 5' of the translation initiation site. By RNase protection assays and primer extension, we determined that multiple transcription initiation sites were present at positions -55, -64, and -115 from the first coding ATG and which were identified in liver, intestine, kidney, and beta-cells mRNAs. Plasmids were constructed with the mouse promoter region linked to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and transiently and stably transfected in the INS-1 cells. Glucose induced a concentration-dependent increase in CAT activity which reached a maximum of 3.6-fold at 20 mM glucose. Similar CAT constructs made of the human GLUT2 promoter region and the CAT gene displayed the same glucose-dependent increase in transcriptional activity when transfected into INS-1 cells. Comparison of the mouse and human promoter regions revealed sequence identity restricted to a few stretches of sequences which suggests that the glucose responsive element(s) may be conserved in these common sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1554897462,"The D-glucuronyl C-5 epimerase involved in the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate was purified from the high speed supernatant fraction of a homogenate of bovine liver by chromatography on immobilized O-desulfated heparin, red Sepharose, phenyl Sepharose, and concanavalin A-Sepharose. After close to 1 million-fold purification, in 10-15% yield, the product gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining and had a mobility corresponding to an M(r) of approximately 52,000. Since the epimerase assay used in the course of purification was based on release of tritium, as [3H]H2O, from a [5-3H]uronyl-labeled substrate, it was important to establish that the purified enzyme did indeed catalyze the actual conversion of D-glucuronyl to L-iduronyl residues. Upon incubation of the purified enzyme with 3H-labeled heparosan N-sulfate, prepared by metabolic labeling (with D-[1-3H]glucose) of a capsular polysaccharide from Escherichia coli K5 and subsequent chemical partial N-deacetylation and N-sulfation, approximately 30% of the D-glucuronyl residues located between two N-sulfated glucosamine units were converted to L-iduronyl units."
https://openalex.org/W1637024185,"The gene encoding the 50-kDa subunit of Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase alpha has been cloned. A comparison of the predicted polypeptide sequence of the Drosophila protein with the equivalent subunits from mouse and yeast suggests that they are closely related and defines three conserved regions which are likely to be important for enzyme activity. The expression patterns of both the 50-kDa protein and its transcript (a single RNA message of 1.6 kilobases) throughout development are consistent with a role of the protein in DNA replication. When overexpressed and purified the 50-kDa subunit displays DNA primase activity. The products of the reaction, mainly oligoribonucleotides 12-14 nucleotides in length, plus dimers and some trimers, are similar to those synthesized by either the intact DNA polymerase alpha, or the biochemically isolated primase heterodimer. The isolated primase also shows similar sensitivity to antibodies, magnesium and monovalent cations, and the same nucleotide requirements as complexed forms of the primase. The isolated subunit, however, is more thermally labile, suggesting a role for the additional subunits in DNA polymerase alpha in stabilizing the primase activity of the 50-kDa primase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1495128775,"Phosphoglucomutase is the acceptor for UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucose-1-phosphotransferase and contains Glc in a phosphodiester linkage to O-linked Man. In this study, we have characterized the glycosylation of phosphoglucomutase by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to heat shock and growth in media containing carbon sources other than Glc. Phosphoglucomutase synthesized under these conditions is underglucosylated relative to that synthesized during logarithmic growth in Glc. The underglucosylation results in increased UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucose-1-phosphotransferase acceptor activity in in vitro assays and a newly appearing less negatively charged form of phosphoglucomutase resolvable by anion exchange chromatography. Utilizing a yeast strain in which phosphoglucomutase is overexpressed via a multicopy plasmid, metabolic labeling of the enzyme with [35S]Met and [3H]Man increased in response to heat shock, whereas [3H]Glc labeling decreased. The glucosylation state of phosphoglucomutase was also compared in cells grown in media containing various carbon sources and was found to be lowest in cells utilizing Gal as the sole carbon source compared with Glc or lactate. In mammalian cells, the glucosylation of phosphoglucomutase has been shown to be sensitive to changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and to correlate with a change in its membrane association. The change in phosphoglucomutase's oligosaccharide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be important to alterations in its distribution under conditions of nutrient deprivation or metabolic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1549570910,"Latency of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) is regulated by the interaction of a free cysteine residue (Cys-75) in the conserved amino acid sequence Pro-Arg-Cys-Gly-Val-Pro-Asp located in the COOH-terminal portion of the propeptide with a chelated zinc atom in the active site of the catalytic domain. Proteolytic activation of full-length human pro-MMP-3 involves the removal of approximately 35 amino acids from the NH2-terminal portion of the propeptide, forming a 53-kDa unstable intermediate that undergoes intermolecular autocatalysis to form the 45-kDa mature active enzyme. In this study, we have evaluated the contribution of the NH2-terminal 35 amino acids to the maintenance of latency. Full-length human pro-MMP-3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded to form latent pro-MMP-3 capable of activation by chymotrypsin or aminophenylmercuric acetate. Renaturation of pro-MMP-3 expressed in bacteria with 20 or more amino acids removed from the NH2-terminal region of the propeptide yielded only an active enzyme. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pro-MMP-3 expression vectors containing the single amino acid substitutions Y20A, L21A, and C75S also secreted active forms of the enzyme. These data suggest that simultaneous interactions of the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the propeptide are required for maintenance of the latent form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1490347122,"Abstract The mode of inactivation of glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme 3-3 from rat by the active site-directed inhibitor 2-(S-glutathionyl)-3,5,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (GSTCBQ) has been investigated by a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and mass spectrometric analysis of the sites of reaction of the reagent with the enzyme. This very reactive reagent is shown to target 3 residues in or near the active site, including the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-6 and Tyr-115 and the sulfhydryl group of Cys-114. Although the covalent attachment of one 2-(S-glutathionyl)dichloro-1,4-benzoquinonyl group/active site is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme ( < 5% residual activity), the 1 mol of reagent appears to be distributed among all three target sites. Mutant enzymes in which the reactive functional groups of these 3 residues have been individually removed remain susceptible to GSTCBQ. Evidence from amino acid sequencing and peptide maps visualized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry suggests that both Tyr-6 and Tyr-115 are primary targets of the reagent in the native enzyme. Docking of a model of GSTCBQ in a model of the active site derived from the crystal structure of the enzyme indicates that the trichlorobenzoquinonyl group can be positioned so that both tyrosine hydroxyl groups can act as nucleophiles to add to the reagent or alternatively act as electrophiles to assist in the nucleophilic addition of the other. The reaction of GSTCBQ with Cys-114 appears to require a conformation different from that in the crystal structure."

https://openalex.org/W1542247295,"Three double negative (BoCD4-, BoCD8-) bovine T cell lines, BTL-PC3, BLT2, and Pr2181, which have been established from bovine lymphosarcomas, were examined for expression and molecular function of bovine c-myb genes. BTL-PC3 expressed 4.0- and 3.6-kilobase c-myb transcripts, and BLT2 and Pr2181 expressed a 3.8-kilobase c-myb message. The c-Myb protein (75 kDa) was detected in Pr2181 but not as a clear band in BLT2, while BTL-PC3 exhibited a 65-kDa c-Myb band in immunoprecipitation tests with anti-Myb antiserum. Nucleotide sequences for c-myb cDNA clones from BTL-PC3 and BLT2 indicated that the predicted bovine wild-type c-Myb from BLT2 consists of 640 amino acids whereas that from BTL-PC3 consists of 555 amino acids lacking 85 internal amino acids. This deleted DNA region (255 base pairs consisting of 85 amino acids) corresponds to the human genomic exon 9 encoding a negative regulatory domain in the c-myb gene. Upon cotransfections with reporter plasmids containing myb binding sites, the internally deleted c-Myb exhibited a 3-fold higher transcriptional activity than the wild-type c-Myb in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays. These results indicate that internal DNA deletion in the c-myb gene is directly involved in the enhancement of transcriptional activation in bovine T lymphoma cells."
