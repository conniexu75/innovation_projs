https://openalex.org/W2035912870,"Intravenous doses of amantadine hydrochloride, an antiviral drug, as small as 0.08 milligram per kilogram may release dopamine and other catecholamines from neuronal storage sites in dogs primed with dopamine. This release may account for the reported efficacy of amantadine hydrochloride in the treatment of human parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W1982481884,"Pulmonary surfactant has been looked for and found in 11 representatives of four vertebrate classes. The amount of surfactant, estimated by quantitative spreading as a surface film, correlates well with alveolar surface area and with the amount of saturated, mainly dipalmitoyl, phosphatidylcholine in the lung parenchyma. The quantities of other phospholipids do not correlate well with alveolar surface area."
https://openalex.org/W2039867697,Vitamin E deficiency in rats is associated with a greater susceptibility to lethal levels of ozone. Exposure of rats to sublethal ozone concentrations produces an accelerated decline in serum vitamin E levels. These findings are consistent with the possibility that lipid peroxidation is a mechanism of ozone toxicity.

In turn, human (from systemic lupus erythematosus patients) antibodies to native DNA do not react with double-strand RNA. Both types of antibodies show cross-reactions (from 1 percent to 50 percent) with RNA-DNA hybrids, but antibodies to the hybrids do not react at all with double-strand RNA or with native DNA. Antibodies to polydeoxyguanylate.polydeoxycytidylate also failed to react with native DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2007453257,"A high frequency of Hb J Tongariki (alpha 115 Ala --> Asp) was found in a Kilenge village in New Britain. Heterozygotes had 45 to 50 percent of the Hb J component (determined by cellulose acetate electrophoresis). Two homozygotes for Hb J had no Hb A, suggesting that in this family only one Hbalpha structural locus is present."

https://openalex.org/W1603842606,"Abstract A purification and crystallization procedure has been developed for uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase from human liver. The 500-fold purified enzyme was found to be almost homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation velocity. The crystalline enzyme has an absolute requirement for divalent cations. Magnesium at 3.0 mm and manganese at 1.0 mm gave about equal and maximum activation while cobalt at 1.0 mm resulted in 40% activation of the pyrophosphorylase. The pH optimum is broad, ranging between 7.6 and 9.2. In the direction of uridine diphosphate glucose synthesis, the equilibrium constant is 0.15. The apparent Michaelis constants from Lineweaver-Burk plots for uridine diphosphate glucose, glucose 1-phosphate, and uridine triphosphate are 5.0 x 10-5, 9.5 x 10-5, and 4.8 x 10-5 m, respectively. With the pyrophosphorylase, sigmoidal kinetics was observed when the reaction was initiated with inorganic pyrophosphate. The slope of the Hill plot decreased from 2.5 to 1.5 when the enzyme was previously incubated in 2 mm inorganic pyrophosphate for 5 min. The apparent Km for inorganic pyrophosphate was estimated to be 2.1 to 2.6 x 10-4 m. Uridine diphosphate is a competitive inhibitor of uridine diphosphate glucose. The enzyme was not specific for either nucleoside or the hexose component of the nucleoside diphosphate hexose. At nonlimiting substrate concentrations, the activity ratio of the pyrophosphorylase with uridine diphosphate glucose and uridine diphosphate galactose as substrates remained constant throughout the purification and crystallization procedures. Thus, human liver does not appear to contain a separate uridine diphosphate galactose pyrophosphorylase."

Bacterial densities and concentrations of chlorophyll a are also reduced. Slight stimulation of production may occur in the absence of chlorination. Based on the available supply of ""new"" water, we calculate a maximum loss of primary production of 6.6 percent for the adjacent tidal segment of the Patuxent River."
https://openalex.org/W1540491873,"Abstract Incubation of rat thymocytes with either puromycin, cycloheximide, or actinomycin D resulted in a progressive inhibition of the accumulation of radioactivity derived from amino acids and uridine in the trichloracetic acid-soluble fraction. No further inhibitory effects on incorporation into either the trichloracetic acid-soluble or trichloracetic acid-insoluble fraction were produced by 1 x 10-6 m cortisol when incubations were carried out for 3 hours in the presence of the antibiotic. However, with antibiotic added late in the incubation period, inhibitory effects of steroid on incorporation into both trichloracetic acid fractions, similar to those obtained without antibiotic, were still evident. Cortisol and puromycin inhibited incorporation of orotic acid into the trichloracetic acid-insoluble fraction, with no corresponding effects on the trichloracetic acid-soluble fraction. Moreover, in the presence of puromycin, an additional inhibitory effect of cortisol on orotic acid incorporation into RNA was obtained. An inhibitory effect of cortisol on incorporation of uridine into the trichloracetic acid-insoluble fraction occurred in the absence of significant effects on the trichloracetic acid-soluble fraction when cells were incubated in the presence of puromycin for 6 hours. Fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation of the total RNA obtained from thymocytes exposed to cortisol and labeled with uridine revealed no differential effects of the steroid on a specific species of RNA. Incubation of thymocytes with cortisol resulted in a progressive decrease of RNA polymerase activity as measured directly with either a nuclear or aggregate enzyme preparation. This inhibitory effect on polymerase activity was also produced by incubation of thymocytes with 6α, 9α-difluoro-11α,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxy-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione-16,17-acetonide (fluocinolone acetonide) (1 x 10-7 m) but not by incubation with progesterone (1 x 10-6 m). Incubation of the cells with puromycin also resulted in decreased polymerase activity; however, a further inhibitory effect of cortisol was evident in the presence of the antibiotic. It is concluded that continuing protein synthesis throughout the incubation period is required for amino acid transport, for uridine transport or conversion to UMP (or both), and for the manifestation of the steroid effects on these processes. In contrast, continuing protein synthesis is not required for the inhibitory effect of cortisol on RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1984309739,"The concentration of adenosine triphosphate in the brain decreased before the onset of generalized convulsions in unanesthetized rats subjected to acute hypoxia or treated with hydroxylamine or pentylenetetrazole (Metrazol). As the convulsive episode continued, adenosine triphosphate decreased further. Stimulation of adenosine triphosphate production forestalled its disappearance from the brain and delayed the development of seizure activity."

https://openalex.org/W2064042397,"Evoked potentials have been recorded from humans in response to two moving gratings presented stereoscopically to both eyes. The amplitude of the evoked potential is greater when the two gratings have slightly different spatial frequencies, which produces an apparent inclination of the binocularly fused image. The amplitude of the response is correlated with the degree of the perceived inclination."
https://openalex.org/W1975149973,"The main products of carbon dioxide-fixation in washed suspensions of Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum are a polyglucose, α-ketoglutarate, and α-keto-β-methylvalerate. All of these can be formed by a mechanism involving the reductive carboxylic acid cycle. The reductive pentose phosphate cycle appears to play a quantitatively minor role in carbon dioxide-fixation under these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2065780692,"Heating the thorax of the sphinx moth, Manduca sexta, evoked pulsations of the heart in the abdomen. These pulsations were of relatively high rate and amplitude, and traveled from the abdomen into the thorax. While heat was continuously applied exclusively to the thorax, thoracic temperature often stabilized and abdominal temperature increased sharply. Thoracic heating of moths with transected nerve cord, however, did not evoke these responses. It is inferred that the heart in the abdomen responds to overheating of the thorax through neural influence."
https://openalex.org/W1530838650,Abstract Dicarboxylic acid inhibitors and the amino and keto acid substrates interact with aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) to form spectrally distinct enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-substrate complexes. The spectra of solutions of the enzyme and varying concentrations of inhibitor or substrate are analyzed by computer methods to obtain the spectra of the enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-substrate complexes. Programs have been written which permit the computation of the pKa values and the dissociation constants of the complexes with the use of the spectral data at many wave lengths. The complete spectra of the individual ionic species of the complexes are drawn. Comparison plots of the experimental spectral data and the calculated spectra can also be obtained. These computer methods are applied to four enzyme-inhibitor complexes and to complexes of the enzyme with its substrates and two pseudosubstrates. Spectra of apoaspartate aminotransferase containing bound pyridoxal phosphate analogues have also been analyzed.
https://openalex.org/W1987213039,"KNOWLEDGE of the early development of Eimeria stiedae, before the appearance of trophozoites in the liver of its rabbit host, is remarkably scanty. After initial penetration of the duodenal epithelium by the sporozoites, the earliest observation of trophozoite formation has been 72 h after infection. The route of migration of the sporozoites during this period has long been a subject for speculation, and the most favoured theory has been passage to the liver from the mesenteric lymph node in the portal blood. Slater, Quisenberry and Fitzgerald1 gave support to this theory by reporting the presence of sporozoites in the mucosa after 5–9 h, free and in monocytes in the mesenteric lymph nodes and in monocytes in the peripheral blood 16–20 h after infection."

The maximum effect was obtained with 10-7 molar gibberellic acid, whereas concentrations greater than 5 × 10-7 mole per liter were inhibitory. The effect of the compound is observed as a marked shortening of the lag period, which is normally 6 to 8 days after innoculation."
https://openalex.org/W2020271778,Acetylsalicylic acid was added to cultures of human leukocytes at several time periods over a wide range of concentrations (0.1 to 300.0 micrograms per milliliter). Leukocytes were also cultured from human volunteers during the ingestion of two 300-milligram tablets four times daily (2400 milligrams per day) over a 1-month period. No significant increase in chromosome aberrations was detected in vitro or in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1547181411,"Abstract Particulate fractions of rat brain catalyze the hydrolysis of radiochemically pure monogalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides, which had been synthesized in vitro by enzymes derived from rat brain or spinach chloroplasts. Monogalactosyl-U-14C diglyceride (the galactose being uniformly labeled) yields 14C-galactose when incubated with the mitochondrial fraction of brain at the optimum pH of 4.4 (galactosidase conditions) and monogalactosyl-U-14C glycerol when incubated with the microsomal fraction of brain at the optimum pH of 7.2 (galactolipase conditions). Biosynthesized digalactosyl-U-14C diglyceride is degraded in a similar way. There is no cross-contamination of the two degradative enzyme systems. Studies of activity plotted against age reveal that the galactolipase activity with either monogalactosyl or digalactosyl diglyceride as substrate increases with age (up to at least 40 days) except during the period of most active myelination (approximately 10 to 20 days of age), at which time the galactolipase activity is notably depressed."
https://openalex.org/W2061211935,"A relationship between crystallographic structure and morphological form of calcium oxalates in urinary sediments is established. The common tetragonal bipyramids have been confirmed as weddellite from their electron diffraction patterns. Other solid forms, such as needles, biconcave disks, and dumbbell forms, that can appear in hyperoxalurias, of both metabolic and alimentary origin, have been identified as whewellite. Micrographs reveal fibrous structure on those whewellite polycrystalline aggregates."

The electrophoretic pattern of bands in an apparent genetic variant is incompatible with a model of tetrameric molecular structure, and suggests, rather, that the three more anodally migrating isozymes are dimer molecules, the polypeptide subunits of which are encoded by two genetic loci and are not involved in the formation of the lower triad of isozymes."

https://openalex.org/W2071895817,"STEINITZ has reported a remarkable epidemiological study in Israel which indicated that persons with a tuberculosis history, active or arrested, showed a five to ten-fold increase in the risk of subsequent development of primary lung cancer1. Steinitz was, of course, acutely aware of the excessive risk of lung cancer in cigarette smokers and gave careful attention to this variable. Recently, she has also indicated that there is no reason to believe that persons with a past history of tuberculosis smoked cigarettes more than did those in the general population sample (personal communication). It therefore seems that by some mechanism other than cigarette smoking a record of extensive therapy of tuberculosis implies a high risk of primary lung cancer. The magnitude of excess risk of lung cancer in tuberculous persons is comparable with that for cigarette smoking in non-tuberculous persons. Is tuberculosis per se responsible for the observed excessive risk of future primary lung cancer ? We think not. We propose that frequent nuoroscopies of the chest, associated with the past extensive use of pneumothorax collapse therapy, is the aetiological factor responsible."
