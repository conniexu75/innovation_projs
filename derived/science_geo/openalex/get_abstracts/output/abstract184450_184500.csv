https://openalex.org/W2154473845,"The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth and hair follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem cells1,2. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud structure by changing their polarity and cell–cell contacts. Here we show that this process is achieved through simultaneous receipt of two external signals: a Wnt protein to stabilize β-catenin, and a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor to produce Lef1. β-Catenin then binds to, and activates, Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin, an important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion. When either signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made, and E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired. In Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and cytoskeletal dynamics3. Consistent with this notion, we show that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and follicle production. Our findings reveal an intricate molecular programme that links two extracellular signalling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit follicle formation."

Thioflavin T (ThT) is a reagent known to become strongly fluorescent upon binding to amyloid fibrils. Here, we show that, by monitoring ThT fluorescence with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), amyloid fibrils of औ2-microgobulin (औ2-m) can be visualized without requiring covalent fluorescence labeling. One of the advantages of TIRFM would be that we selectively monitor fibrils lying along the slide glass, so that we can obtain the exact length of fibrils. This method was used to follow the kinetics of seed-dependent औ2-m fibril extension. The extension was unidirectional with various rates, suggesting the heterogeneity of the amyloid structures. Since ThT binding is common to all amyloid fibrils, the present method will have general applicability for the analysis of amyloid fibrils. We confirmed this with the octapeptide corresponding to the C terminus derived from human medin and the Alzheimer's amyloid औ-peptide.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 947-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Hammarstrom P. Schneider F. Kelly J.W.

Moreover, several proteins not known to be involved in disease and various polyamino acids have been shown to form amyloid fibrils in vitro under carefully selected conditions (4Hamada D. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2427-2436PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fändrich M. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 21: 5682-5690Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although no sequence or structural similarity between the amyloid precursor proteins has been found, amyloid fibrils share several common structural and spectroscopic properties (6Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Irrespective of the protein species, electron microscopy and x-ray fiber diffraction indicate that the amyloid fibrils have relatively rigid structures with diameters of 10–15 nm consisting of cross-औ-strands. Making use of an NMR technique in combination with hydrogen/deuterium exchange of amide protons and dissolution of amyloid fibrils by dimethyl sulfoxide, we have shown that the amyloid fibrils of औ2-m are stabilized by a hydrogen-bond network which is more extensive than that in the native state (7Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibril formation is considered to be a nucleation-dependent process in which non-native precursor proteins slowly associate to form the nuclei (8Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This process is followed by an extension reaction, where the nucleus grows by sequential incorporation of more precursor protein molecules. This model has been validated by the observation that fibril extension kinetics is accelerated by the addition of preformed fibrils,i.e. by a seeding effect. However, the mechanism of fibril formation by individual polypeptide chains is not completely understood, and there are several variations of the nucleation-dependent model (9Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Depace A.H. Weissman J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar). To address the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation, it is important to observe the process at the single-fibril level. Recently, epifluorescence with a newly introduced fluorescent dye (11Inoue Y. Kishimoto A. Hirao J. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35227-35230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (12Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) have been utilized for the direct observation of individual amyloid fibrils. Although these techniques are quite useful in providing information on the mode of fibril growth, the need to introduce the fluorescence probe prevents their general application. On the other hand, the strong interaction of amyloid proteins and the mica surface used in AFM measurements resulted in the formation of fibrils morphologically different from the intact amyloid fibrils (13Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). ThT is known to bind rapidly to amyloid fibrils accompanied by a dramatic increase of fluorescence at around 485 nm, when excited at 455 nm (14Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). This makes ThT one of the most useful probes to detect the formation of amyloid fibrils. Fluorescence at around 485 nm becomes useful in fluorescence microscopic studies, which make use of lasers for the incident beam of excitation. On the other hand, TIRFM has been developed to monitor single molecules (15Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 16Yamasaki R. Hoshino M. Wazawa T. Ishii Y. Yanagida T. Kawata Y. Higurashi T. Sakai K. Nagai J. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by effectively reducing the background fluorescence under the evanescent field formed on the surface of slide glass (Fig. 1). By combining amyloid fibril-specific ThT fluorescence and TIRFM, it would be possible to observe the amyloid fibrils and their formation process without introducing any fluorescence reagent covalently bound to the protein molecule. We examined this possibility using the औ2-m amyloid fibrils. Recombinant human औ2-m with four additional residues at the N-terminal (Glu−4-Ala−3-Tyr−2-Vla−1-Ile1) was expressed and purified as described (17Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2219-2229Google Scholar). Synthesized medC fragment (NFGSVQFV) and Aऔ-(1–40) were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The purities of the peptides were >957 according to elution patterns of high performance liquid chromatography. The fluorescence microscopic system used to observe individual amyloid fibrils was developed based on an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (16Yamasaki R. Hoshino M. Wazawa T. Ishii Y. Yanagida T. Kawata Y. Higurashi T. Sakai K. Nagai J. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ThT molecule was excited using an argon laser (model 185F02-ADM; Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA). The fluorescent image was filtered with a bandpass filter (D490/30 Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and visualized using an image intensifier (model VS4–1845; Video Scope International, Sterling, VA) coupled with a SIT camera (C2400–08; Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). औ2-m amyloid fibrils were prepared as described previously (17Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2219-2229Google Scholar). Seed fibrils prepared by the fragmentation of amyloid fibrils were mixed with 25 ॖm monomeric औ2-m in polymerization buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 2.5, and 100 mm KCl) at 37 °C. After 6-h incubation, the sample solution was diluted 10-fold with polymerization buffer, and 100 ॖm ThT was added at the final concentration of 5 ॖm. An aliquot (14 ॖl) of sample solution was deposited on quartz slide glass, and the fibril image was obtained with TIRFM. All images were recorded on digital videotape and analyzed using Image-pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Aऔ-(1–40) amyloid fibrils were prepared from synthetic Aऔ-(1–40) (19Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To obtain seed, preformed fibrils were fragmented by sonication as described above. The seeds were added at a final concentration of 10 ॖg/ml to 50 ॖm monomeric Aऔ-(1–40) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and 100 mmNaCl. After 3-h incubation at 37 °C in the test tube, the solution was diluted 5-fold, and ThT was added at a final concentration of 5 ॖm. The fibril formation of औ2-m or Aऔ-(1–40) on the slide glass was also examined. In the case of औ2-m, seed fibrils were mixed with 50 ॖm monomeric औ2-m in polymerization buffer (50 mm sodium citrate at pH 2.5 and 100 mm KCl). After ThT was added at 5 ॖm, the solution was deposited on quartz slide glass, and the growth of individual fibrils was observed every 15 min under a microscope at 37 °C. For medC, seed fibrils were prepared by incubating the monomeric peptide at 1 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 24 h. The fibrils were fragmented by a sonicator as described above. An aliquot (1 ॖl) of the seed solution was mixed with 1 mmmedC monomer in the same buffer containing 5 ॖm ThT and deposited on quartz slide glass at 37 °C for visualization with TIRFM. The images of amyloid fibrils grown under TIRFM recorded on digital video tape were captured on a personal computer and the lengths of the fibrils were calculated using Image-pro Plus. औ2-m, a 99-residue protein with a typical immunoglobulin domain fold (20Bjokman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Willy D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar), is the light chain of the major histocompatibility complex class I antigen. However, it is also found as a major component of amyloid fibrils deposited in dialysis-related amyloidosis, a common and serious complication in patients receiving hemodialysis for more than 10 years (8Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Gejyo F. Yamada T. Odani S. Nakagawa Y. Arakawa M. Kunitomo T. Kataoka H. Suzuki M. Nirasawa Y. Shirahama T. Cohen A.S. Schmid K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of the औ2-m amyloid fibril deposition in vivo is still unknown, amyloid fibrils are easily formed in vitro by a seed-dependent extension reaction at pH 2.5, in which acid-unfolded monomeric औ2-m is added to seed fibrils taken from patients (8Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2219-2229Google Scholar). We first examined the औ2-m amyloid fibrils already extended in test tubes (Fig. 2, A andB). TIRFM images indicated the presence of 1–5-ॖm-long fibrils in the presence of ThT. No such fibrillar structures were found either in the absence of ThT or in the absence of fibrils. This indicated that amyloid-specific fluorescence from ThT enables one to visualize the औ2-m amyloid fibrils. Intriguingly, the length range of the detected fibrils is similar to that observed with electron microscopy (EM) (8Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or AFM (18Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2219-2229Google Scholar). This indicates that the evanescent field is very useful for determining the length of amyloid fibrils. To obtain the exact length of fibrils by conventional epifluorescence microscopy, one has to analyze the image by three-dimensional reconstruction because the orientation of fibrils relative to slide glass is not always parallel to the glass surface. In contrast, since the penetration depth of the evanescent field formed by the total internal reflection of laser light is quite shallow (∼150 nm for laser light at 455 nm) in comparison with the width of amyloid fibrils (∼15 nm from EM), TIRFM selectively monitors long fibrils lying along the slide glass (Fig. 1). Consequently, the length of observed fibrils is close to the exact length. On the other hand, the apparent width of the fibrils observed by fluorescence was larger than the exact width because the observed emission fields extend the dye localization. We then determined whether औ2-m amyloid fibrils also formed on the slide glass. Goldsbury et al. (13Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) reported using synthetic human amylin that amylin fibrils that assembled on a mica surface for AFM measurement exhibited distinct morphological features. The seeds,i.e. fragmented fibrils, were mixed with monomeric औ2-m and immediately the solution was deposited on quartz slide glass. As can be seen, the amyloid fibrils extended on the slide glass with an incubation time of 6 h (Fig. 2, C and D) were similar to those prepared in the test tube (Fig. 2,A and B). We monitored the seed-dependent extension reaction (Fig. 2, E–H; also see movie b2m.mov, which is published in the Supplemental Material). At time 0, we identified the location of seeds. As we increased the incubation time, we could clearly follow the extension of fibrils: the extension ended at around 2 h under the conditions used. This fact constitutes direct evidence that the fibril formation by औ2-m is a seed-dependent process, as suggested for other amyloid fibrils (9Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Depace A.H. Weissman J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar, 11Inoue Y. Kishimoto A. Hirao J. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35227-35230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A majority of extended औ2-m fibrils exhibited unidirectional elongation from the seeds which were marked with red (Fig. 2H). Moreover, when the fibrils with bidirectional elongation were observed, the superposition of the seeds was suggested. Therefore, we can conclude that the elongation is mostly unidirectional. Unidirectional fibril formation was first observed using Sup35, a yeast prion determinant, by epifluorescence microscopy (11Inoue Y. Kishimoto A. Hirao J. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35227-35230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, another group reported the bidirectional elongation of Sup35 based on the observations with EM in conjunction with selective staining by gold particles (9Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the interaction with the glass surface was responsible for the unidirectional extension, the unidirectional picture is likely to hold for the fibril formation of औ2-m. The unidirectional elongation was also dominant in the formation of fibrils by medC (see below). The rate of extension of individual amyloid fibrils was analyzed by plotting the length of fibrils as a function of time (Fig.3a). For the respective fibrils, the extension reaction could be well fitted to a single exponential curve, consistent with a previous observation of the seed-dependent extension reaction in test tubes (8Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,18Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2219-2229Google Scholar). Importantly, the rates of fibril extension, however, varied significantly depending on the fibrils, although the rate for each fibril remained constant. The initial fibril growth rate showed a wide distribution with a mean value of 47.4 ± 15.0 nm min−1 (Fig. 3b), which cannot be explained by the statistical distribution of the fibril growth rate. Taking into account the fact that the extension rate for each fibril is constant, the diversity in the rate may be related to the difference in the structure of individual fibrils. Recently, the direct observation of fibril formation by AFM indicated that the fibril-forming region of Sup35 forms a diverse population of fibrils that could be distinguished on the basis of their kinetic properties, including polarity and elongation rate (10Depace A.H. Weissman J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, another study with NMR (22Ippel J.H. Olofsson A. Schleucher J.S. Lundgren E. Wijmenga S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) indicated that amyloid fibrils formed by the Aऔ-(25–35) peptide exhibit a heterogeneity in the kinetics of their hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior for each amide group. Thus, current data obtained for औ2-m as well as the results discussed for Sup35 and Aऔ peptide suggest that heterogeneity of structure is a common characteristic of amyloid fibrils. This could be partly consistent with the idea that the rate of crystal growth may be affected by bonding topology at the crystal surface (23Grimbergen R.F.P. Bennema P. Meekes H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1999; 55: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To confirm the overall applicability of this method, we examined two other amyloid fibrils. One is medC corresponding to the C-terminal octapeptide of medin (24Häggqvist B. Näslund J. Sletten K. Westermark G.T. Mucchiano G. Tjernberg L.O. Nordstedt C. Engström U. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8669-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Medin, a 50 amino acid internal cleavage peptide of lactadherin, is a component of the very common age-related amyloidosis deposited on the aortic wall. It has been shown that the C-terminal 8-amino acid peptide NFGSVQFV from human medin is associated with amyloid fibrils at neutral pH, 37 °C (24Häggqvist B. Näslund J. Sletten K. Westermark G.T. Mucchiano G. Tjernberg L.O. Nordstedt C. Engström U. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8669-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We first prepared the seed fibrils. In the case of medC, it was difficult to prepare extensively fragmented seeds by sonication. This might be related to the very rigid and sharp morphology of the medC fibrils. The extension reaction was monitored every 5 min under microscopic conditions (Fig.4, A and B). We observed the extension of the fibrils, which was mostly unidirectional as was the case for औ2-m. Analysis of the extension rate also indicated significant heterogeneity of the extension rate (data not shown). Another example is Aऔ (Fig. 4, C and D). The intracerebral accumulation of Aऔ as senile plaques or vascular amyloid is one of the dominant characteristics in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (19Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Aऔ-(1–40) fibrils prepared in test tubes and on slide glass, both by the extension reaction, were compared. Fibrillar structures specifically stained by ThT were formed both in the test tube (Fig. 4C) and on the slide glass (Fig.4D). On the slide glass, we often observed clustered aggregates even in the presence of seeds. In conclusion, we reported a new method to visualize the amyloid fibrils at the single fibril level. The method makes use of the specific ThT binding to amyloid fibrils and TIRFM. Since ThT binding is common to all amyloid fibrils, the present method will have general applicability for the analysis of amyloid fibrils. One of the advantages of TIRFM is that only amyloid fibrils lying in parallel with the slide glass surface were observed, so that we can obtain the exact length of fibrils. Consequently, the method will be particularly important for following the rapid kinetics of fibril formation, which is paramount to elucidating the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and little accessible by other approaches.

Despite its enormous success, X-ray radiography1 has its limitations: an inability to penetrate dense objects, the need for multiple projections to resolve three-dimensional structure, and health risks from radiation. Here we show that natural background muons, which are generated by cosmic rays and are highly penetrating, can be used for radiographic imaging of medium-to-large, dense objects, without these limitations and with a reasonably short exposure time. This inexpensive and harmless technique may offer a useful alternative for detecting dense materials — for example, a block of uranium concealed inside a truck full of sheep."

Here we investigate changes in the carbon-isotope composition of benthic foraminifera throughout the Holocene and find that deep-water production varied on a centennial–millennial timescale. These variations may be linked to surface and atmospheric events that hint at a contribution to climate change over this period."

The existence of a new subfamily of Nephrin-like molecules including Neph1 was recently described. Genetic deletion of Nephrin or Neph1 resulted in similar phenotypes of podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria. The subcellular localization of Neph1 and the possibility that Nephrin and Neph1 interact was investigated. Polyclonal antiserum for Neph1 was raised and characterized. Neph1 migrated as a 90-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Neph1 was identified in a glomerular and podocyte-specific distribution in adult rat kidney. Like Nephrin and Podocin, Neph1 was enriched in Triton X-100 detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Consistent with this observation, immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that Neph1 localized exclusively to lateral margins of podocyte foot processes at the insertion of the slit diaphragm. Neph1 and Nephrin participate in a direct cis-interaction involving their cytoplasmic domains. In addition, interactions between the extracellular domain of Nephrin and itself and between the extracellular domain of Nephrin and that of Neph1 were detected. Neph1 did not interact via a homophilic interaction. These observations suggest that Nephrin and Neph1 form a hetero-oligomeric receptor complex in the plane of the membrane that might interact across the foot process intercellular junction through interactions between Nephrin with itself and Neph1.

Glomerular visceral epithelial cells or podocytes are responsible for maintaining the filtration barrier of the renal glomerulus. These cells attach to the basement membrane of glomerular capillaries via their octopus-like, interdigitated “foot processes” that arise from a central cell body. Normally, glomerular filtrate passes between these foot processes and across a specialized intercellular junction known as the slit diaphragm. When podocytes are injured, the intercellular junctions and cytoskeletal structure of the foot processes is altered and the cell takes on an “effaced” phenotype that is associated with the development of proteinuria (1Kanwar Y.S. Liu Z.Z. Kashihara N. Wallner E.I. Semin. Nephrol. 1991; 4: 390-413Google Scholar). For this reason, it is thought that the slit diaphragm is an important component of the glomerular filter. The molecular composition and function of the foot process intercellular junction remains incompletely characterized. Emerging evidence suggests that this specialized junction is composed of a large complex of proteins associated in part within a specialized lipid microdomain. Presently, at least three transmembrane proteins have been identified at this site, including Nephrin (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), FAT1 (3Inoue T. Yaoita E. Hidetake K. Shimizu F. Sakai T. Kobayashi T. Ohshiro K. Kawachi H.

J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significant attention has focused on Nephrin, the protein product of NPHS1. In humans, mutation of NPHS1 results in congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish-type that is manifest by foot process effacement and proteinuria (5Kestila M. Lenkkeri U. Mannikko M. Lamerdin J. McCready P. Putaala H. Routsalainen V. Morita T. Nissinen M. Herva R. Kashtan C.E. Peltonen L. Holmberg C. Olsen A. Tryggvason K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). That Nephrin participates in a protein complex important for maintenance of glomerular filter integrity has been suggested by observations that deletion or mutation of proteins that are physically associated with Nephrin, such as Podocin and CD2ap, also result in foot process effacement and proteinuria (6Fuchshuber A.

Nephrin is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily characterized by eight C2 type Ig-like domains and a fibronectin type III repeat in its extracellular region. For this reason, it has been proposed that Nephrin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; ECD, extracellular domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CD, cytoplasmic domain; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Fc, Fc domain of human Ig. that participates in forming the glomerular filter via homophilic or heterophilic interactions involving its extracellular domain (9Routsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 10Jalanko H. Patrakka J. Tryggvason K. Holmberg C. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the Nephrin ligand has not been identified. Recent progress in genome and expressed sequence tag sequencing and work by mouse and Drosophila geneticists has provided important new clues regarding the true Nephrin ligand. Search of the genetic data base demonstrated the existence of three mammalian Nephrin-like Ig superfamily CAMs including Neph1 and two additional structurally similar proteins (11Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). While little characterization of Neph1 has been published, deletion of mouse Neph1 results in a podocyte effacement phenotype (12Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G. Hawkins E. Barrish J.P. Mathur B.N. Turner C.A. Geske R. Montgomery C.A. Starbuck M. Brandt M. Gupta A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zambrowicz B.P. Powell D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A family of four CAMs was also identified in Drosophila that are structurally related to Nephrin (13Dworak H.A. Charles M.A. Pellerano L.B. Sink H. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4265-4276PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins form two subfamilies: Hibris and Sticks and Stones that are most closely related to Nephrin, and Dumbfounded and Irregular Chiasm that are structurally similar to mammalian Neph1, Neph2, and Neph3. Importantly, Dumbfounded (the Neph1 homologue) interacts with Hibris and Sticks and Stones, but Hibris (the Nephrin homologue) does not interact with itself (13Dworak H.A. Charles M.A. Pellerano L.B. Sink H. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4265-4276PubMed Google Scholar). These results predict that Nephrin interacts with Neph1. In the present study we sought to investigate whether Neph1 and Nephrin interact via heterophilic and/or homophilic interactions. It was observed that both Nephrin and Neph1 are expressed in a glomerular epithelial cell-specific fashion in kidney and co-localize at the insertion of the glomerular slit diaphragm. Nephrin and Neph1 co-fractionate with a detergent-resistant lipid micro-domain and participate in a direct cis-interaction involving their cytoplasmic domains. In addition, interactions between the extracellular domain of Nephrin and itself and between the extracellular domain of Nephrin and that of Neph1 were detected. Neph1 did not interact via a homophilic interaction. Eukaryotic Expression Constructs—A mammalian expression plasmid encoding mouse Myc-Nephrin has been described previously (2Holzman L.B.

Full-length mouse Neph1 cDNA was a gift of Dr. G. Walz (University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). The cDNA encoding mouse Neph1 open reading frame was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and a FLAG-epitope or V5-epitope tag was placed at the 3′ end of the open reading frame using standard a PCR-based cloning technique (16Nihalani D. Merritt S.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A mammalian construct expressing a FLAG-tagged mouse Nephrin cytoplasmic domain (Nephrin-CD) fragment encoding the COOH-terminal 155 amino acid residues was prepared in a similar fashion (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain (ECD) of Nephrin (Fc-mNephrin-ECD) or Neph1 (Fc-FLAG-Neph1-ECD) was fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc segment by placing it in a modified pCDM7 vector (Invitrogen). This vector also contained a signal peptide sequence, a CD5:Hinge:CH2:CH3 region, and a Myc tag at the 3′ end of the processed Nephrin or a FLAG tag at the 3′ end of the processed Neph1 ECD open reading frame (14Gil O.D. Zanazzi G. Struyk A.F. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9312-9325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). The ECD of Nephrin included amino acid residues 35–1059 of the previously published mouse Nephrin sequence (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the ECD of Neph1 included amino acid residues 55–521 of the previously published mouse Neph1 sequence (11Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The Fc-mNephrin-ECD was expressed as a 180-kDa protein and the Fc-FLAG-Neph1-ECD expressed a 90-kDa protein when reduced on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Bacterial Fusion Proteins—Plasmid encoding GST-Neph1-CD (amino acid residues 554–789 (11Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)) fusion protein was prepared using standard techniques. Briefly, PCR was performed using 5′ primer (GGA ATT CCG ACG TCG CAA AGG CAG T-3′) and 3′ primer (CCC TCG AGC ACA TGA GTC TGC ATG CG-5′) and using the full-length mouse Neph1 cDNA as a template. The PCR fragment was then cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). This plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli, then purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma, G-4510). The eluted GST fusion protein was covalently linked to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose C-l-4B beads (Sigma, CL-4B-200) and used for pull-down experiments as well as affinity purification of Neph1 antiserum. A plasmid (pRSET-A, Invitrogen) encoding hexahistidine-tagged Neph1-CD was prepared as above. A hexahistidine-tagged Nephrin-CD construct was described previously (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Both proteins were prepared from bacterial lysate and purified using a commercially prepared nickel-agarose column according to the directions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-Nephrin cytoplasmic domain (CD) polyclonal antibody was prepared as described previously (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-Myc (9E10, Oncogene Science), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), and anti-human IgG (Fc specific) (Sigma, A-0170) antibodies were obtained commercially. Mouse anti-rat GLEPP1 monoclonal antibody was a gift of Dr. Roger Wiggins (University of Michigan). Neph1 antiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits with hexahistidine-tagged-Neph1 cytoplasmic domain antigen. For antibody preparation, hexahistidine-Neph1 CD was solubilized in 6 m urea, purified by nickel affinity chromatography, separated on SDS-PAGE, and gel slices were used for rabbit inoculation. Antiserum was affinity purified on a GST-Neph1-CD affinity column after ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 200 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (16Nihalani D. Merritt S.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection using RIPA buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (17Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Moeller M.J. Sanden S.K. Soofi A. Wiggins R.C. Holzman L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and were autoradiographed. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (16Nihalani D. Merritt S.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For affinity chromatography experiments using Fc-chimeric proteins, lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma, P-5906). Beads were washed six times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and protease inhibitor. Immune complexes were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, then immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. Glomerular Isolation and Flotation Gradient Preparation—Adult rat kidney glomeruli were isolated by sieving as described elsewhere (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19Salant D.J. Darby C. Couser W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The average purity of glomerular preparations was ∼90%. Glomeruli were lysed using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors at a concentration of ∼10,000 glomeruli/ml of extraction buffer. For preparation of the floatation gradient, glomeruli were isolated and homogenized from rat kidneys at 4 °C with 14 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer containing 250 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Triton X-100 was added to the homogenate to give a final concentration of 1%. The homogenate was mixed with 60% Optiprep solution (Nycomed Pharma AS) to obtain a final density of 40%. Five ml of this mixture was added to precooled centrifuge tubes and layered with 3 ml of 30% Optiprep and 4 ml of 5% Optiprep solution. Optiprep dilutions were obtained by diluting 60% stock Optiprep with Tricine buffer containing 20 mm Tricine, 0.25 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. The gradient was centrifuged at 37,000 rpm using a Beckman SW 41Ti rotor (169,000 × g) for 3 h at 4 °C. The Triton X-100-insoluble lipid layer was identifiable at the interface between the 5 and 30% Optiprep solutions. Top to bottom 1-ml fractions were sequentially collected. Immunofluorescence—Six-μm adult rat kidney cryosections were fixed with cold acetone. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse Neph1 polyclonal antibody (1:50) or mouse anti-rat GLEPP1 monoclonal antibody (1:200) were used as a primary antibody. Species-appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothyocyanate or Cy3 (Jackson Laboratories, Westgrove, PA) were employed as indicated. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Kidneys from adult rats were fixed in 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde, 0.1% distilled glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 6–12 h at 4 °C, soaked in sucrose, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Ultra-thin frozen sections of rat kidney were processed for indirect immunogold labeling as described previously (20Regele H.M. Fillipovic E. Langer B. Poczewki H. Kraxberger I. Bittner R.E. Kerjaschki D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 403-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Breiteneder-Geleff S. Matsui K. Soleiman A. Meraner P. Poczewski H. Kalt R. Schaffner G. Kerjaschki D. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 1511: 1141-1152Google Scholar). In all experiments, control sections were prepared with affinity-purified rabbit anti-podocalyxin IgG to assess background and specificity. A polyclonal antiserum directed against the cytoplasmic domain of mouse Neph1 was raised in rabbits and was affinity purified. To assess the specificity of the affinity-purified anti-body and to test the structural predictions made by the mouse Neph1 cDNA sequence, full-length mouse Neph1 was expressed by transient transfection in COS7 cells. Fig. 1 demonstrates that anti-Neph1 antibody specifically recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa in Neph1 transfected cells but not in vector control transfectants or in untransfected COS7 cell lysates. A protein of similar mobility was identified using this antibody in lysates obtained from isolated rat glomeruli. Neph1 Is Expressed in a Podocyte-specific Fashion in Kidney—Indirect immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression pattern of Neph1 in adult rat kidney. Neph1 immunoreactivity was identified in a glomerular-specific pattern (Fig. 2, A–C). To determine whether the immunoreactivity observed was podocyte-specific, cryosections of adult rat kidney were double labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against GLEPP1 and with rabbit anti-Neph1 antibody (Fig. 2, D–F). GLEPP1 is a transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed only on podocytes in the kidney (22Thomas P.E. Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19953-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Merged photomicrographs demonstrated that immunoreactivity for GLEPP1 and Neph1 produce superimposable signals and suggested that Neph1 is expressed in a podocyte-specific pattern in kidney. Neph1 Fractionates with the Triton X-100-insoluble Lipid Microdomain of Isolated Rat Glomeruli—Nephrin was found previously to associate in part with a Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction obtained from isolated glomeruli (23Yuan H. Takeuchi E. Salant D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F585-F591Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Simons M. Schwarz K. Kriz W. Miettinen A. Reiser J. Mundel P. Holthofer H. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For this reason, the possibility that Neph1 also fractionates with this membrane fraction was investigated. Rat glomeruli were isolated and lysed at 4 °C in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Lysate was fractionated by floatation gradient centrifugation. The lipid fraction was identified in fraction four at the interface between 5 and 30% Optiprep (Fig. 3). One-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom, and each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting for Neph1, Nephrin, Podocin, and CD2ap (Fig. 3). Like Podocin, another podocyte-specific detergent-resistant membrane fraction associated-protein (27Schwartz K. Simons M. Reiser J. Saleem M.A. Faul C. Kriz W. Shaw A.S. Holzman L.B. Mundel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), Neph1 was isolated only in the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction (fraction 4). As described previously, Nephrin, in part, fractionated in the same lipid membrane fraction. Neph1 Subcellular Localization in Glomeruli—To examine the distribution of Neph1 within glomeruli in more detail, immunoelectron microscopy was carried out using post-embedding colloidal gold immunolabeling of rat kidney sections (Fig. 4). Gold particles were identified exclusively on lateral pedicel surfaces of podocytes in a distribution consistent with that of the insertion of the slit diaphragm. As anticipated, because the polyclonal antibody utilized in these experiments was raised against the cytoplasmic domain of Neph1, gold particles were not observed within the slit pore itself. There was no labeling for Neph1 detected elsewhere within membrane or cell body of the podocyte or within glomerular basement membrane or endothelial cells (Fig. 4). Importantly, this subcellular distribution of Neph1 within the podocyte was similar to that previously reported for Nephrin (2Holzman L.B. St. John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Routsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Neph1 and Nephrin Interactions—Given the co-localization and structural similarity of Neph1 and Nephrin, it was hypothesized that Neph1 and Nephrin might engage in heterophilic and/or homophilic interactions occurring either in cis or trans at the podocyte foot process intercellular junction. To investigate this hypothesis, an initial series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed after co-expressing Nephrin and/or Neph1, or their truncated mutants, by transient transfection of COS7 cells. In preliminary experiments, full-length Neph1 co-immunoprecipitated with full-length Nephrin (Fig. 5A). However, full-length FLAG-tagged Neph1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with full-length V5-tagged Neph1 (Fig. 5B). A potential Nephrin-Nephrin interaction was examined in experiments described below. To assess whether endogenous Nephrin interacts with endogenous Neph1, Nephrin was immunoprecipitated from isolated glomerular lysate prepared by extraction with RIPA buffer (that had been shown in preliminary experiments to extract both Nephrin and Neph1 from membrane fractions). In these experiments, Neph1 co-immunoprecipitated with Nephrin immune complexes (Fig. 5C). To define the domains that mediate the observed interaction between Neph1 and Nephrin, additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. ECD interactions were examined by preparing plasmids encoding chimeric proteins of the ECD of Nephrin (Fc-mNephrin-ECD) and the ECD of Neph1 (Fc-FLAG-Neph1-ECD) fused to the Fc domain of human Ig (Fig. 6). In these experiments, the ECD of Nephrin co-immunoprecipitated with full-length FLAG-tagged Neph1 (Fig. 6A). Reciprocally, the ECD of Neph1 co-immunoprecipitated with full-length Nephrin (Fig. 6B). In similar experiments, Fc-mNephrin-ECD co-immunoprecipitated with full-length Nephrin, while Fc-FLAG-Neph1-ECD did not interact with full-length Neph1 (Fig. 6, D and C, respectively). In a control experiment, Nephrin ECD did not co-immunoprecipitate with the Nephrin CD (Fig. 6E). In summary, the extracellular domain of Nephrin interacts both with itself and with that of Neph1, while the extracellular domain of Neph1 does not interact with itself. Intracellular domain interactions were examined by preparing plasmids encoding the cytoplasmic domain of Nephrin. COS7 cells were co-transfected with Nephrin-CD and full-length FLAG-tagged Neph1 or full-length Nephrin. In these experiments, the CD of Nephrin co-immunoprecipitated with full-length FLAG-tagged Neph1 (Fig. 7A). However, the CD of Nephrin did not co-immunoprecipitate with full-length Nephrin (Fig. 7B). To confirm the interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of Neph1 and Nephrin, pull-down experiments were performed (Fig. 7, C and D). Rat glomerular lysate was incubated with either GST alone or GST-Neph1-CD (Neph1 cytoplasmic domain) covalently linked to Sepharose beads. As anticipated, Nephrin was pulled down from glomerular lysate with the GST-Neph1-CD but not with GST alone. Neph1 was not pulled down from glomerular lysate with GST-Neph1-CD or with GST protein (Fig. 7C). To determine whether the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of Neph1 and Nephrin occurred via a direct interaction, GST alone or GST-Neph1-CD covalently linked to Sepharose beads was incubated in vitro with hexahistidine-tagged purified recombinant Nephrin-CD (Fig. 7D). A direct interaction was detected between Neph1-CD and Nephrin-CD, but not between GST protein and Nephrin-CD. In summary, the cytoplasmic domain of Nephrin directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of Neph1, while neither Nephrin nor Neph1 engage in homophilic interactions via their respective cytoplasmic domains. The composition and function of the Nephrin-associated protein complex remains incompletely characterized. Given its structure and localization, it has been hypothesized that Nephrin mediates homophilic cell-cell interactions between podocyte foot processes that may account for the electron microscopic appearance and theoretical filtering function of the slit diaphragm (9Routsalainen V.

However, this model has not been validated experimentally. Nephrin and Neph1 share a number of important similarities. Deletion of either Neph1 (12Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G.

Both proteins are expressed in a glomerular epithelial cell-specific fashion in kidney and are localized to the podocyte slit diaphragm as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy of glomerular sections (2Holzman L.B.

Neph1 and Nephrin also have been shown to interact with Podocin, a lipid raft-associated component of the glomerular slit diaphragm (11Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Schwartz K. Simons M. Reiser J. Saleem M.A. Faul C. Kriz W. Shaw A.S. Holzman L.B. Mundel P. J. Clin.

As suggested by recent work in Drosophila, a new family of structurally related Nephrin-like molecules has been described (13Dworak H.A. Charles M.A. Pellerano L.B. Sink H. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4265-4276PubMed Google Scholar). Within this family is Hibris, a protein member of the Ig superfamily. Although their location and activity differ, Hibris bears strong structural similarity to mammalian Nephrin. In a study by Dworak et al. (13Dworak H.A. Charles M.A. Pellerano L.B. Sink H. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4265-4276PubMed Google Scholar), Hibris mediated cell aggregation via a heterophilic interaction with Dumbfounded, a protein that bears structural similarity to Neph1. Therefore, these results predict that Nephrin interacts with Neph1. The present results identify Neph1 as a newly recognized component of the Nephrin-associated protein complex existent at the intercellular junction between foot processes. Importantly, Nephrin and Neph1 appear to form a cis-interacting hetero-oligomeric complex associated with a detergent resistant lipid membrane microdomain. Nephrin and Neph1 directly interact via their cytoplasmic domains. In addition, Podocin, a stomatin-like protein, binds both Nephrin and Neph1 via their cytoplasmic domains (11Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Schwartz K. Simons M. Reiser J. Saleem M.A. Faul C. Kriz W. Shaw A.S. Holzman L.B. Mundel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and all three fractionate with the detergent-resistant membrane fraction. While Nephrin and Neph1 interact directly via their cytoplasmic domains, Podocin interaction might serve to stabilize their interaction and target the entire complex to the detergent-resistant membrane at the intercellular junction. In the present study both homophilic and heterophilic interactions were also identified between the ECD of Nephrin and itself and between Nephrin and Neph1. Because multiple members of the Ig superfamily mediate cell-cell interaction via either homophilic or heterophilic associations, it is tempting to speculate that the Nephrin-Neph1 complex functions in a similar fashion. Several models have been proposed for cell adhesion mediated by classical CAMs (29Kiselyov V.V. Berezin V. Maar T.E. Soroka V. Edvardsen K. Schousboe A. Block E. J. Biol.

In general, these models suggest that CAM-mediated cell-cell adhesion may be initiated by parallel cis-dimerization followed by an anti-parallel adhesive trans-interaction of the cis-dimers on opposing cells (31Ahrens T.

Therefore, it is possible that Neph1 and Nephrin participate in foot process-to-foot process trans-interactions only after formation of a cis-hetero-oligomeric complex. This model would be consistent with our previous failure to demonstrate Nephrin-only mediated homophilic cell-cell interactions 2I. A. Kovari and L. B.

https://openalex.org/W2130100167,"Abstract The high toxicity of most chemotherapeutic drugs and their inactivation by multidrug resistance phenotypes motivated extensive search for drugs with new modes of action. We designed a short cationic diastereomeric peptide composed of d- and l-leucines, lysines, and arginines that has selective toxicity toward cancer cells and significantly inhibits lung metastasis formation in mice (86%) with no detectable side effects. Its ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of cancer cells at the same rate (within minutes) and concentration (3 μm), at which it shows biological activity, suggests a killing mechanism that involves plasma membrane perturbation. Confocal microscopy experiments verified that the cells died as a result of acute injury, swelling, and bursting, suggesting necrosis. Biosensor binding experiments and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using model membranes have substantiated its high selectivity toward cancer cells. Although this is an initial study that looked at tumor formation rather than the ability of the peptides to reduce established tumors, the simple sequence of the peptide, its high solubility, substantial resistance to degradation, and inactivation by serum components might make it a good candidate for future anticancer treatment."

However, galectin-3 utilized protein kinases C and A to induce this process, whereas galectin-1 did not. We also found that thiodigalactoside, a potent inhibitor of β-galactoside binding, attenuated the effects of both galectins. In addition, galectin-1, but not galectin-3, promoted the migration of HSCs. Thus, it appears that galectin-1 and galectin-3, generated by activated HSCs, could participate in β-galactoside binding and induce different intracellular signaling pathways leading to the proliferation of HSCs.

Resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), infiltrating macrophages, platelets, and sinusoidal endothelial cells secrete growth factors at the inflammatory sites, such as transforming growth factor-β and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These growth factors trigger the proliferation and the secretion of ECMs by HSCs.

Galectin-3 expression was induced in regenerative nodules of cirrhotic liver tissues and in hepatocellular carcinomas (33Hsu D.K. Dowling C.A. Jeng K.C. Chen J.T. Yang R.Y. Liu F.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 was examined in relation to the progression and infiltration of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and to preneoplastic and early neoplastic changes of biliary epithelial cells (23Shimonishi T.

A study on concanavalin A-induced acute liver injury showed that galectin-1 administration protects mice from liver injury by selectively eliminating activated T cells and preventing the synthesis of proinflammatory Th1-derived cytokines (34Santucci L. Fiorucci S. Cammilleri F. Servillo G. Federici B. Morelli A. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our previous proteome analysis of rat HSC proteins revealed that the amount of galectin-1 is greatly increased in activated HSCs compared with quiescent HSCs; the secretion of galectin-1 is also much enhanced by activated HSCs (32Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although a detailed analysis has not yet been performed, these results suggest that an enhanced level of galectin-1 modifies the function of HSCs themselves as well as other hepatic constituent cells in chronically injured liver. In this study, we investigated in detail the expression pattern of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in HSCs and in fibrotic liver tissues. We further demonstrated that both types of galectins activate MAPK pathways presumably by cross-linking with target molecules through their β-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates, leading to the proliferation of HSCs.

The final concentration of Me2SO in the culture medium was always below 0.1%, which did not affect the function of cultured HSCs. Animals—Pathogen-free male Wistar rats were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). Animals were housed at a constant temperature and supplied with laboratory chow and water ad libitum. Production of Recombinant Galectin-1 and Galectin-3—Recombinant human galectin-1 (r-galectin-1) and r-galectin-3 were generated in our laboratory as described previously (35Hirabayashi J. Ayaki H.

Briefly, DNA fragments encoding either human galectin-1 or galectin-3 were amplified by PCR using cloned cDNA as a template. The amplified fragments were ligated to pET21a. Generated prokaryotic expression vectors were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Recombinant proteins were induced in the cells by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.

After fibrosis developed, the peritoneal cavities of the rats were opened under ether anesthesia. The liver was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline via the portal vein to remove the blood completely and subsequently removed. Part of the liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and used for histological evaluation. The remaining parts were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at —80 °C until used. Preparation of Hepatic Constituent Cells—Hepatic constituent cells were isolated from rat livers as previously described in detail (39Kawada N. Kristensen D.B. Asahina K. Nakatani K. Minamiyama Y.

Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells were used immediately after isolation. HSCs were plated on plastic dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (FBS/DMEM). Hepatocytes were cultured on type I collagen-coated dishes in Williams' Medium E supplemented with 10% FBS (FBS/Williams' Medium E). The culture media were changed every day. HSCs isolated from normal and fibrotic livers are referred to as quiescent HSCs and in vivo activated HSCs, respectively, in this study (40Kawada N. Seki S. Inoue M. Kuroki T.

RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from hepatic constituent cells and liver tissues using Isogen. mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR using the GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit. The following primers were used: galectin-1, 5′-ATGGCCTGTGGTCTGGTCGC-3′ (forward) and 3′-AATTCACACACCGGAAACTC-5′ (reverse); galectin-3, 5′-ATGGCAGACGGCTTCTCACT-3′ (forward) and 3′-CGCGAAGGGTGCGGTACTAG-5′ (reverse); collagen α2(I), 5′-ATGCTCAGCTTTGTGGAT-3′ (forward) and 3′-CCCTTGAAACGACGAGTC-5′ (reverse); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 3′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-5′ (reverse). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from cultured HSCs and liver tissues using Isogen. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. After prehybridization, the membrane was incubated in buffer supplemented with PCR-amplified double-stranded cDNAs for galectin-1, galectin-3, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime DNA labeling system; this was followed by autoradiography on Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Immunoblotting—HSCs were cultured in the presence or absence of test agents and then homogenized in buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris, 0.1% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.8). After the samples (10 μg of protein) were heat-denatured, they were analyzed by 7.5–15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto Immobilon P membranes. After blocking, the membranes were treated for 2 h at room temperature with individual antibodies. After washing, they were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on Kodak XAR-5 film using ECL detection reagent. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical detection of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in rat liver tissues was performed according to the method described in detail by Nakatani et al. (42Nakatani K. Seki S. Kawada N. Kitada T. Yamada T. Sakaguchi H. Kadoya H. Ikeda K. Kaneda K. Virchows Arch. 2002; 441: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were visualized using 0.025% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.003% H2O2. Specimens were observed under an Olympus IX70 microscope. Cell Growth Assays—Isolated HSCs were cultured on plastic dishes for 3 days in FBS/DMEM and then maintained for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Isolated hepatocytes were cultured on type I collagen-coated dishes for 24 h in FBS/Williams' Medium E and then maintained for 24 h in serum-free Williams' Medium E. The cells were successively stimulated with test agents for 24 h and pulse-labeled with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine during the last 6 h. The incorporated radioactivity was subjected by liquid scintillation counting as previously described (38Okuyama H. Shimahara Y. Kawada N. Seki S. Kristensen D.B. Yoshizato K. Uyama N. Yamaoka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In another experiment, isolated HSCs (1 × 105 cells/well) were plated in six-well culture plates, incubated for 2 days in FBS/DMEM, and maintained for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. The cells were successively stimulated with either r-galectin-1 or r-galectin-3 for 24 or 48 h. They were successively fixed in 100% methanol and stained with a Giemsa solution. The number of HSCs was counted in a microscopic field (0.84 mm2) at a magnification of ×100. Five microscopic fields were randomly chosen for each specimen. Migration Assay—The migration activity of HSCs was assayed using cell culture insert as previously described (43Ikeda K. Wakahara T. Wang Y.Q. Kadoya H. Kawada N. Kaneda K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). HSCs (1 × 105 cells) cultured for 2 days were detached from the plates using trypsin, suspended in 400 μl of FBS/DMEM, introduced into the insert, and allowed to adhere to the upper surface of the membrane. HSCs were then maintained in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. Recombinant rat PDGF-BB (r-PDGF-BB; 20 ng/ml) or r-galectin-1 or r-galectin-3 (10 μg/ml) was successively introduced into the upper chamber. After 48 h of incubation, the culture medium was removed. Cells adhering to the membrane were fixed in 100% methanol and stained with a Giemsa solution. The number of HSCs on the upper surface of the membrane was counted at a magnification of ×400, and that on the lower surface was counted similarly by changing the focus. Five microscopic fields were randomly chosen for each specimen. The proportion of migrated cells (termed migration index) was calculated as follows: migration index (%) = (number of cells on lower surface of membrane)/(number on upper and lower surfaces of membrane) × 100. Statistical Analysis—Data presented as bar graphs are means ± S.D. of three independent experimental series. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test at a significance level of p < 0.05. Expression of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in Rat Hepatic Constituent Cells and Liver Tissues—HSCs, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated from normal rat livers. The expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 mRNAs was determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Galectin-1 mRNA was not detectable in any of the cells, whereas galectin-3 mRNA was detectable in Kupffer cells. Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells underwent apoptosis after a few days of culture as reported previously (44Ni R. Tomita Y. Matsuda K. Ichihara A. Ishimura K. Ogasawara J. Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 45Takei Y. Kawano S. Nishimura Y. Goto M. Nagai H. Chen S.S. Omae A. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Ikeda K. Kawada N. Kaneda K. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1995; 10: S65-S67Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, HSCs increased in number and morphologically transdifferentiated into myofibroblasts after 4 days of culture. The expression of both galectin-1 and galectin-3 mRNAs was increased in HSCs in a time-dependent manner as revealed by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Western blotting revealed that the protein levels of galectin-1 and galectin-3 increased in a time course similar to that for the expression of smooth muscle α-actin and PDGF receptor-β, well characterized markers for activated HSCs. In accordance with these observations on in vitro activated HSCs, in vivo activated HSCs isolated from TAA-induced fibrotic livers expressed mRNAs and proteins for galectin-1 and galectin-3, both of which were undetectable in quiescent HSCs isolated from normal livers (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemistry showed that galectin-1 was negligible in intact liver tissues (Fig. 1D, panel a), whereas in the septa of TAA-induced fibrotic livers, where activated HSCs were localized, it was prevalent (panel b). Galectin-3 immunoreactivity, which was sporadically positive in Kupffer cells in normal livers (panel c), was augmented around periportal areas and septa in fibrotic livers (panel d). These observations support the results obtained with HSCs and Kupffer cells isolated from normal and fibrotic livers described above. RT-PCR showed that the mRNA levels of both galectin-1 and galectin-3 were up-regulated in two models of liver fibrosis, the model obtained by TAA administration and the model obtained by common bile duct ligation (Fig. 1E). These results conclusively demonstrate that the expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 is augmented in activated HSCs. Effects of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 on HSC Proliferation— To clarify the role of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in the process of liver fibrosis, we examined their effects on the proliferation of HSCs and hepatocytes. As depicted in Fig. 2A, both galectin-1 and galectin-3 were found to stimulate DNA synthesis in HSCs in a dose-dependent manner, with the stimulation by the former higher than that by the latter. Their mitogenic activity at 10 μg/ml was less than that at 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, the most potent mitogen for HSCs (4Pinzani M. Marra F. Carloni V. Liver. 1998; 18: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G. Parola M. Herbst H. Dianzani M.U. Laffi G. Abboud H.E. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1297-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Neither galectin-1 nor galectin-3 affected DNA synthesis in hepatocytes (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the cell number of HSCs treated with either galectin-1 or galectin-3 (10 μg/ml) significantly increased at 2 or 4 days after stimulation compared with that of unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2C, panel a). In fact, microscopic observation showed that the cell density of HSCs increased at 4 days after stimulation with either galectin-1 or galectin-3 (10 μg/ml) compared with the unstimulated control culture of HSCs (panels b–e). The mitogenic activity of both galectins was again less than that of PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml). Intracellular Signaling Pathways in Galectin-stimulated HSCs—To reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the mitogenic activity of galectin-1 and galectin-3 for HSCs, we investigated their effects on the activity of MAPK cascades in HSCs. Both galectin-1 and galectin-3 induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, panel a). No such activation was observed with p38 MAPK, SAPK/JNK, and Akt (Fig. 3B). ERK1/2 was phosphorylated rather gradually, with a maximum intensity at 120 min of galectin (10 μg/ml) treatment. It was interesting that this time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was sharply different from that of PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation, where the initial and maximum level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed as early as 6 min after treatment. Phosphorylation of MEK1/2, an upstream signal of ERK1/2, also occurred later in galectinstimulated HSCs than in PDGF-BB-stimulated HSCs (Fig. 3A, panel b). Effects of MEK1/2 Inhibitors on ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and DNA Synthesis in Galectin-stimulated HSCs—We examined the effects of PD98059 and U0126, MEK1/2 inhibitors, on the galectin-induced appearance of phospho-ERK1/2 in HSCs (Fig. 4A). Both inhibitors attenuated the galectin-induced appearance of phospho-ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, neither SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, nor LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, affected this process (Fig. 4B). Thus, it appears that galectin-1 and galectin-3 stimulate HSCs through the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. In fact, galectin-induced DNA synthesis in HSCs was abolished by PD98059 or U0126 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Effects of Inhibitors of PKC and PKA on ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Galectin-stimulated HSCs—To obtain further insight into the mechanism of the galectin-induced activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in HSCs, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in galectin-stimulated HSCs was investigated in the presence of GF109203X, a specific PKC inhibitor, and H-89, a specific PKA inhibitor. The PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was suppressed by GF109203X, but not by H-89 (Fig. 5A), implying that this activation was PKC (but not PKA)-dependent, as previously reported (4Pinzani M. Marra F. Carloni V. Liver. 1998; 18: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by galectin-1 was not affected by GF109203X or by H-89, whereas that induced by galectin-3 was. These results indicate that galectin-1 and galectin-3 activate different signaling pathways leading to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and DNA Synthesis by Thiodigalactoside—Thiodigalactoside (TDG) is one of the potent hapten inhibitors of β-galactoside binding (46Bianchet M.A. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Proteins. 2000; 40: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 47Levy Y. Arbel-Goren R. Hadari Y.R. Eshhar S. Ronen D. Elhanany E. Geiger B. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31285-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies were performed to ensure that TDG has no stimulatory effect on both ERK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis in HSCs. Fig. 6A shows the results of such experiments. In fact, TDG at 10 and 20 mM did not affect either process at all, whereas PDGF-BB at 20 ng/ml stimulated them as expected. Next, galectin-1 and galectin-3 (10 μg/ml each) were pretreated with TDG at 20 mM, and HSCs were successively challenged with the pretreated galectin-1 or galectin-3 in the presence of excess TDG and examined for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6B). TDG significantly decreased the potential of galectin-1 or galectin-3 to activate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in HSCs. TDG (20 mM) also"

Here we show that the constitutive activity and constitutive endocytosis properties of US28 are separable entities in this viral chemokine receptor. We generated chimeric and mutant US28 proteins that were altered in either their constitutive endocytic (US28Δ300, US28Δ317, US28-NK1-ctail, and US28-ORF74-ctail) or signaling properties (US28R129A). By using this series of mutants, we show that the cytoplasmic tail domain of US28 per se regulates receptor endocytosis, independent of the signaling ability of the core domain of US28. The constitutive endocytic property of the US28 c-tail was transposable to other 7TM receptors, the herpes virus 8-encoded ORF74 and the tachykinin NK1 receptor (ORF74-US28-ctail and NK1-US28-ctail). Deletion of the US28 C terminus resulted in reduced constitutive endocytosis and consequently enhanced signaling capacity of all receptors tested as assessed by inositol phosphate turnover, NF-κB, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein transcription assays. We further show that the constitutive endocytic property of US28 affects the action of its chemokine ligand fractalkine/CX3CL1 and show that in the absence of the US28 C terminus, fractalkine/CX3CL1 acts as an agonist on US28. This demonstrates for the first time that the endocytic properties of a 7TM receptor can camouflage the agonist properties of a ligand.

G protein-coupled receptors is a mechanism that allows control of an appropriate cell surface receptor density in a given physiological setting. Typically, a receptor is activated by an agonist and initiates a signaling cascade before it undergoes endocytosis. However, there are receptors that can signal in a ligand-independent manner, the so-called constitutively active receptors. For some of these, constitutive internalization is an accompanying effect, e.g. for mutant parathyroid hormone receptors (PTH1Rc) (1Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the constitutively active mutants of the angiotensin II (1A) receptor (2Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or the human complement factor C5a receptor (3Whistler J.L. Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Baranski T.J. von Zastrow M. Bourne H.R. Traffic. 2002; 3: 866-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two examples of constitutively endocytosing 7TM receptors have been described in the chemokine system, one of which is the CXCR4 receptor. However, its constitutive internalization rate with ∼2.5% of total surface receptor/min in the absence of ligand is rather slow (4Signoret N. Oldridge J. Pelchen M.A. Klasse P.J. Tran T. Brass L.F. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Holmes W. Dallas W. Luther M.A. Wells T.N. Hoxie J.A. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The other receptor is US28, a 7TM receptor encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) that has been shown to both signal (5Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and endocytose in a ligand-independent manner at the rate of ∼7% of the cell surface pool/min (7Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Of the four chemokine receptors encoded by this large DNA virus, UL33, UL78, US27, and US28 (8Chee M.S. Satchwell S.C. Preddie E. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), US28 is so far the most extensively characterized receptor. It binds several CC-chemokines such as MIP-1α/CCL3, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1β/CCL4, and RANTES/CCL5 (9Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) as well as the CX3C-chemokine fractalkine/CX3CL1 with high affinity (10Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, despite its rather broad-spectrum ligand repertoire, US28 signals independently of any ligand in a highly constitutive manner. US28 stimulates the G protein Gq/phospholipase C pathway and up-regulates cellular transcription factors including the nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB) and the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (5Casarosa P.

Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in the absence of any ligand. US28 has been implicated to be important for the viral life cycle of HCMV; for example, it has been suggested to enhance cell-cell fusion, demonstrating its potential importance in the cell-to-cell spread of HCMV in vivo (10Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Haskell C.A. Cleary M.D. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34183-34189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, US28 has been linked to pathogenic diseases like atherosclerosis and restenosis, following observations that HCMV-infected smooth muscle cells are able to migrate toward a CC-chemokine gradient consisting of the US28-ligands RANTES/CCL5 and MCP-1/CCL2 (12Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In contrast to endogenous chemokine receptors, which are predominantly located on the cell surface, only a fraction of US28 (at most ∼20%) is expressed on the cell surface. The majority of the receptor is found in the membranes of intracellular organelles that include components of the endocytotic pathway, in particular multivesicular late endosomes or multivesicular bodies (7Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In fact, US28 has been shown to undergo rapid and constitutive agonist-independent endocytosis, similar to that of activated endogenous chemokine receptors. More specifically, the tonic internalization rate of US28 receptors is comparable with that of activated chemokine receptors (i.e. SDF-1 induced internalization in CXCR4 (4Signoret N. Oldridge J. Pelchen M.A. Klasse P.J. Tran T. Brass L.F. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Holmes W. Dallas W. Luther M.A. Wells T.N. Hoxie J.A. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, this seems to be a β-arrestin-independent mechanism, because the trafficking patterns of US28 are unaltered in mouse embryonic fibroblasts devoid of both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 proteins (13Fraile-Ramos A. Kohout T.A. Waldhoer M. Marsh M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have used truncated and chimeric US28 receptors to begin to elucidate the domain(s) of US28 necessary for constitutive signaling and endocytosis and have used these mutants to assess the functional consequences of altering receptor signaling and trafficking. Materials—Substance P was purchased from Peninsula (St. Helens, Merseyside, UK); CX3CL1 (i.e. the chemokine domain corresponding to amino acids 1– 69 of fractalkine) was from R & D Systems; and GCP-2/CXCL6 and IL-8/CXCL8 were purchased from PeproTech (London, UK). The radioligands125I-GCP-2/CXCL6,125I-CX3CL1, and125I-substance P were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. IL-8/CXCL8 was labeled with125I using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.125I-Labeled IL-8/CXCL8 was separated from free iodine (>99%) using a 25-cm, 10-ml Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Iodine incorporation and specific activity were determined via precipitation of the protein by the trichloroacetic acid method (14Bennett G.L. Horuk R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 288: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The H4A3 LAMP1 antibody developed by J. T. August and J. E. K. Hildreth was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by the University of Iowa, Dept. of Biological Sciences, Iowa City. cDNA Constructs—The DNA coding the US28 chemokine receptor (AD169 strain of HCMV) was kindly provided by Timothy N. C. Wells (Serono Pharmacological Research Institute, Geneva, Switzerland). The R129A mutant of US28 was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the receptor was re-introduced into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector. The truncated versions of the US28 receptor, US28Δ300 and US28Δ317, were constructed by inserting a STOP codon following residues Gln-300 or Val-317 of the wild type US28 receptor, respectively (see Fig. 2A), and thereafter introducing an EcoRI site for fusion into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector. The receptor chimeras ORF74-US28-ctail and NK1-US28-ctail were created as follows. The ORF74 receptor carrying the US28-ctail (Table I, D) was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, with oligonucleotides consisting of a 10 –15-bp overlap from both the C-terminal truncated part of the ORF74 receptor (truncation at residue Arg-335) and the C terminus (residues Gln-300 to Pro-354) of the US28 receptor. Likewise, the NK1 receptor bearing the C-terminal domains of US28 (Table I, E) was constructed by fusing the C terminus of the wild type US28 receptor (residues Gln-300 to Pro-354) to the NK1 receptor truncated at residue Arg-313. The receptor chimeras US28-NK1-ctail (Table I, F) and US28-ORF74-ctail (Table I, G) were created by fusing the C-terminal truncated part of the wild type US28 receptor (truncation at residue Arg-299) to either the C terminus of the human NK1 receptor (residues Leu-314 to Ser-407) or the C terminus of the ORF74 receptor (residues Gln-336 to Thr-355). All constructs were tagged by inserting the 9-amino acid sequence (YPYDVPDYA) recognized by the anti-HA 11 mouse monoclonal antibody immediately after the N-terminal initiate methionine of the respective receptor DNAs. Addition of the N-terminal HA tag did not impair binding of the respective ligands to any of the tested receptors. All constructs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTEJ8 (15Johansen T.E. Schøller M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W.

HEK293 cells were grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin G/streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with the respective amounts of cDNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in the luciferase-reporter assay. Phosphatidylinositol Assay—Inositol phosphate turnover in COS-7 cells was performed as described previously (6Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In brief, COS-7 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated in 12-well plates (Biotechline, Denmark) for 24 h with 5 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol, followed by a washing step in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of various concentrations of chemokines. The incubation was stopped by aspiration of the binding buffer and addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm formic acid. After incubation on ice for 60 min, the generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified using Dowex AG 1X8 anion-exchange columns (Bio-Rad) and counted by liquid scintillation. Reporter Gene Assays—COS-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected with reporter plasmids as described (6Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In short, cells (35,000 cells/well) were seeded out in 96-well plates and transiently transfected with either a “reporter/cDNA mixture” consisting of pFA2-CREB and pFR-Luc reporter plasmids (PathDetect CREB Trans-Reporting System, Stratagene) or pNF-κB-Luc (PathDetect Cis-Reporting System, Stratagene) and the indicated amounts of receptor DNA. Following transfection, cells were treated with the respective compounds in an assay volume of 100 μl for 24 h. When treated with chemokines, cells were maintained in low serum (2.5%) throughout the experiments. The assay was terminated with the addition of luciferase assay reagent (LucLite, Packard Instrument Co.), and luminescence was measured in a TopCounter (Top Count NXT™, Packard Instrument Co.) for 1 s. Luminescence values are given as relative light units (RLU). All reporter-gene experiments were conducted in parallel in HEK293 and COS-7 cells and showed comparable results; however, the chemokine stimulation assays in HEK293 cells yielded a better signal-to-noise ratio. Radioligand Binding Experiments—Whole cell radioligand binding assays were performed on transiently transfected COS-7 cells. 24 h post-transfection, cells were transferred to 24-well culture plates, and the number of cells seeded per well was such as to obtain 5–10% specific binding of the added radioactive ligand. Homologous competition binding was performed for 3 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 12 pm of the respective radioligands125I-GCP-2/CXCL6 or125I-CX3CL1 plus unlabeled ligand in the concentrations indicated. The binding buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Following incubation cells were washed quickly four times in 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl to reduce unspecific binding. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm of the corresponding unlabeled ligand.125I-Substance P binding was conducted in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 40 μg/ml bacitracin. Following binding, cells were washed twice in ice-cold buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.1 mm of unlabeled ligand. IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 2.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego), and Bmax values were calculated from the homologous competition binding curves using the equation Bmax = B0 × (IC50/[L]), where B0 indicates the specific bound radioligand, and [L] indicates the concentration of free radioligand. Saturation assays were performed for 3 h at 4 °C in 0.25 ml of binding buffer containing increasing amounts of125I-CX3CL1 radioligand, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm of the unlabeled ligand. Radioligand Endocytosis Assays—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were plated in 24-well culture plates and allowed to grow for 2 days. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with125I-CX3CL1 (0.3 nm) or125I-IL-8/CXCL8 (1.5 nm) for 3 h at 4 °C in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with cold binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, followed by one wash with prewarmed DMEM at 37 °C to remove free ligand. Cells were then incubated in DMEM at 37 °C to allow receptor internalization. Internalization was stopped by aspirating the medium and returning the samples on ice. For each time point, one set of cells was immediately lysed in 0.2 m NaOH, whereas a second set of cells was subjected to an acidic wash to remove surface-bound chemokine. Briefly, cells were rinsed once in ice-cold DMEM (pH 2.0), followed by two 3-min washes in the same medium, and finally lysed in 0.2 m NaOH. Samples were counted in a gamma-counter. Control binding experiments were conducted and showed that the acidic wash fully removed surface-bound chemokine while leaving the receptor surface intact. Immunofluorescence—Cells expressing the receptor constructs 2 days after transfection were used for immunofluorescence. 24 h post-transfection, cells were plated to coverslips and allowed to grow for 24 h. Living cells were fed monoclonal anti-HA 11 antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) for 30 min to label receptors. For co-localization studies with transferrin, cells were starved in serum-free medium for 60 min and fed Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X, essentially as described (17Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For co-localization studies with LAMP1, receptors were labeled with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse antibody to convert the HA-11 IgG1-labeled receptors into rabbit-IgGs and subsequently visualized with a secondary goat anti-rabbit FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibody. In parallel, cells were stained with the LAMP1 H4A3 IgG1 antibody from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and visualized with a CY5-conjugated secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). Controls (omission and cross-staining with either first or secondary antibodies) were made in order to verify that the staining was specific to both receptor and LAMP1, respectively. Following staining, cells were mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a Coolsnap CCD camera and a Zeiss LSM510 META Axioplan 2 confocal microscope. We emphasize that all the antibody feeding experiments were conducted in parallel in both HEK293 and COS-7 cells, but we could not detect any substantial differences between these two cell lines. An Inactive Signaling Mutant of US28 Is Constitutively Endocytosed—We first asked whether the constitutive endocytosis of US28 was a consequence of its high constitutive signaling activity (5Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 6Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine this, we generated a US28 mutant that was no longer constitutively active. The conserved DRY motif located at the boundary of transmembrane helix 3 and the second intracellular loop of most 7TM receptors plays a pivotal role in G protein activation (18Schwartz T.W. Forman J.C. Johansen T. Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Rotan, FL1996: 65-84Google Scholar, 19Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). We created a mutant US28 receptor where the arginine in this DRY motif was substituted with an alanine (US28 R129A). As expected, US28 R129A no longer showed constitutive signaling properties when tested in inositol phosphate turnover assays (Fig. 1O, black bar). To directly examine constitutive endocytosis, we conducted antibody feeding experiments, because this experimental setup allows us to assess distributions of receptors that were accessible to the HA antibody during a 30-min incubation period (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, this approach guarantees that the labeled receptors were in fact intact and reached the cell surface and were not merely stuck intracellularly or retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum due to improper protein folding. The cellular distribution of US28 R129A (Fig. 1, A–G) was indistinguishable from that of the wild type US28 receptor (H–N). Both US28 wild type and US28 R129A receptors were localized in early endosomes and lysosomes (G and N, respectively) as assessed by co-localization studies with the early endosomal marker transferrin (A–C and H–J, red) and the lysosomal marker lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (D–F and K–M, blue). In addition, US28-containing vesicles that lacked these markers were also observed (green). These data are in excellent agreement with the elaborate study of Fraile-Ramos et al. (7Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), where localization of US28 was assessed in HeLa cells. The same co-localization profiles were found in COS-7 cells (data not shown). We further verified that both US28wt and USR129A receptors were expressed on the cell surface in comparable amounts by conducting whole cell125I-CX3CL1 radioligand binding experiments. Because these experiments are performed at 4 °C, no endocytosis of receptors occurs, and therefore this assay represents a “snapshot” of the steady state level of receptors on the cell surface. Fig. 1P shows a homologous displacement curve for both US28wt (▵) and US28 R129A (♦), and Table II shows that the Bmax levels of US28R129A-expressing cells were comparable with those of US28wt receptor-expressing cells. In addition, we tested the constitutive endocytosis rate of US28wt and US28 R129A by radioligand internalization assays with the chemokine ligand125I-CX3CL1. When compared with the wild type receptor US28 (Fig. 1Q, ▵), US28 R129A (Fig. 1Q, ♦) was constitutively internalized at 37 °C at a slightly higher rate than the wild type US28 receptor. Summarized, these data show that constitutive activity of US28 is not necessary for its constitutive endocytosis.Table IISteady state surface expression of US28 constructs The table shows KD ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments (n), followed by Bmax ± S.E.ReceptorKDBmaxnMfmol/105cellsUS28wt0.23 ± 0.06 (3)13.2 ± 1.6US28R129A1.5 ± 0.3 (2)21.6 ± 4.2US28Δ3000.79 ± 0.01 (3)128.4 ± 4.1US28Δ3170.79 ± 0.15 (2)67.9 ± 4.3US28-NK1-ctail0.83 ± 0.12 (2)86.1 ± 1.1US28-ORF74-ctail0.66 ± 0.07 (2)66.1 ± 5.6 Open table in a new tab Effect of Full or Partial Truncation of the C Terminus on the Trafficking and Signaling, Properties of US28 —We next designed a set of experiments to determine what domain(s) in US28 were mediating its constitutive endocytosis. A very recent study (20Mokros T. Rehm A. Droese J. Oppermann M. Lipp M. Hopken U.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45122-45128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that the C terminus of US28 is constitutively phosphorylated and that the deletion of all phosphorylation sites resulted in increased surface expression of US28. Moreover, palmitoylation of the C terminus of various 7TM receptors (for review see Ref. 21Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and for one chemokine receptor, the CCR5 receptor, has been reported to be essential for (i) the expression of a functional receptor on the cell surface and for (ii) the endocytic properties of these receptors (22Percherancier Y. Planchenault T. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Blanpain C. Wittamer V. Vanderwinden J.M. Boom A. Renneboog B. Lee B. Le Poul E. El Asmar L.

Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, to date no study has been reported that palmitoylation of the C terminus plays a role in the function of US28 or any other viral chemokine receptor. We first tested whether truncation of the last 36 residues of the US28 C terminus (US28Δ317), thereby leaving its putative palmitoylation site intact, would alter the endocytic properties of US28. US28Δ317 protein was expressed predominantly on the surface of HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B, middle panel) as opposed to US28 wild type receptor, which was predominantly located intracellularly (Fig. 2B, left panel). Full truncation of the last 54 residues of the US28 C terminus (US28Δ300) resulted in the same phenotype as US28Δ317, with the majority of US28Δ300 protein expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 2C, right panel). Next we examined whether the US28Δ300 and US28Δ317 receptor proteins were still functionally coupled to G proteins. As we have demonstrated previously, US28 is a constitutively active receptor that signals via a Gq/phospholipase C-coupled pathway and up-regulates transcription factors such as NF-κB and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (5Casarosa P.

Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that the partial or full deletion of the C terminus of US28, US28Δ317 (gray bar), or US28Δ300 (hatched bar), respectively, did not impair constitutively induced inositol phosphate turnover in COS-7 cells when compared with wild type US28 (black bar). In fact, the fully truncated US28Δ300 (hatched bar) protein showed a slightly enhanced signaling profile compared with the other receptors. When tested for their ability to up-regulate reporter genes like NF-κB or CREB, both US28Δ317 (▪) and US28Δ300 (•) were able to constitutivel"
https://openalex.org/W2032900985,"Recently we showed that three different isoforms of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GST), including GSTA4-4, are also localized in the mitochondrial compartment. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of mouse GSTA4-4 targeting to mitochondria, using a combination of in vitro mitochondrial import assay and in vivo targeting in COS cells transfected with cDNA. Our results show that the mitochondrial GSTA4-4 is more heavily phosphorylated compared with its cytosolic counterpart. Protein kinase activators (cAMP, forskolin, or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) markedly increased GSTA4-4 targeting to mitochondria, whereas kinase inhibitors caused its retention in the cytosol. Immunoinhibition and immunodepletion studies showed that the Hsp70 chaperone is required for the efficient translation of GSTA4-4 as well as its translocation to mitochondria. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that kinase inhibitors attenuate the affinity of GSTA4-4 for cytoplasmic Hsp70 suggesting the importance of phosphorylation for binding to the chaperone. Mutational analysis show that the putative mitochondrial targeting signal resides within the C-terminal 20 amino acid residues of the protein and that the targeting signal requires activation by phosphorylation at the C-terminal-most protein kinase A (PKA) site at Ser-189 or protein kinase C (PKC) site at Thr-193. We demonstrate for the first time that PKA and PKC modulate the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial pools of GSTA4-4.

The compounds detoxified by GSTs include an array of carcinogens, anticancer drugs, and environmental chemicals (1Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Some GSTs also catalyze the reduction of cellular peroxides and aldehydes generated endogenously during lipid peroxidation (2Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). These aldehydes, such as HNE, are known to cause various cell and tissue degenerations and associated pathologies (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5888) Google Scholar). HNE is produced in large amounts (10 μm to 5 mm) in response to oxidative insults, and it exhibits wide range of biological activities, including oxidation and alkylation of cellular proteins and DNA (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5888) Google Scholar, 4Uchida K. Shiraishi M. Naito Y. Torii Y. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). As a result, HNE has been implicated in a number of diseases, including cancer (5Eckl P.M. Ortner A. Esterbauer H. Mutat. Res. 1993; 290: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and hepatic (6Mottaran E. Stewart S.F. Rolla R. Vay D. Cipriani V. Moretti M. Vidali M. Sartori M. Rigamonti C. Day C.P. Albano E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), neuronal (7Sayre L.M. Perry G.

Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) diseases. GSTA4-4 catalyzes the detoxification of HNE and related lipid peroxides by conjugation to GSH (9Hartley D.P. Ruth J.A. Petersen D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This enzyme also exhibits GSH peroxidase activity for the metabolic inactivation of phospholipid hydroperoxides (10Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a crucial role in maintaining the metabolic homeostasis and are important regulators of cell death (11Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial electron transport chain accounts for nearly 90% of the molecular O2 consumed by cells and tissues. ROS are generated as undesirable side products of the energy yielding oxidative metabolism, leading to mitochondrial and cellular damages (11Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Detoxification of intracellular ROS is catalyzed by antioxidant molecules such as vitamin E and GSH as well as a number of enzyme systems, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH peroxidase, and GST. Recently, it has been shown that transfection with GSTA4-4 cDNA protects cells against oxidative stress and HNE-induced apoptosis (12Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Sharma A. Saini M. Yang Y. Awasthi S. Zimniak P. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although mitochondria have enzyme systems to regulate ROS produced in the electron transfer chain (13Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), induced ROS production under various pathophysiological conditions can be overwhelming, leading to mitochondrial DNA and membrane damages. Regulation of ROS by intramitochondrial GSH and GSH-metabolizing enzymes would therefore be critical for maintaining the antioxidant potential and structural/functional integrity of the mitochondrial membrane. A majority of GSTs in mammalian cells are localized in the cytosol, where they exist as homodimers or heterodimers of subunits with molecular masses from 24 to 29 kDa (14Mannervik B. Alin P.

Various subcellular locations of GSTs are consistent with their role in protecting cell components against chemical and oxidative damage. Recently, we showed the presence of three different forms of GSTs belonging to the alpha and mu family, namely, GSTA1-1, A4-4 and M1-1 in mouse liver mitochondria (22Raza H. Robin M.-A. Fang J.-K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also provided evidence that the mitochondrial GSTA4-4 level markedly increases in COS cells under oxidative stress conditions, suggesting its critical role in maintaining the GSH homeostasis under conditions of chemical and oxidative stress (21Bhagwat S.V. Vijayasarathy C. Raza H. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Raza H. Robin M.-A. Fang J.-K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of targeting of recombinant mouse GSTA4-4 to mitochondria. Using in vivo and in vitro systems, we show that the mitochondrial targeting is highly dependent on the intact C-terminal end as well as the phosphorylation status of the protein. Translocation of GSTA4-4 is vastly increased under increased intracellular PKA and PKC activities. Results suggest that phosphorylation increases the affinity of the protein for binding to cytoplasmic chaperone, Hsp70, as a possible basis for its enhanced mitochondrial targeting. Materials—cAMP analog Bt2cAMP; PKA; 2,4-dinitrophenol; CCCP; purified Hsp70 protein; monoclonal antibodies to Hsp70, to phosphoserine, and to phosphothreonine; and polyclonal antibody to β-actin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO). PKA-specific inhibitor myristoylated peptide, H89, PKC, PKC-inhibitor GF109203X, H7, forskolin, and PMA were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). H89 is a PKA-specific inhibitor, and H7 is a wide spectrum kinase inhibitor that inhibits both PKA and PKC at the level of 6 μm (23Jarvis W.D. Turner A.J Povirk L.F. Traylor R.S. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1707-1714PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated peptide inhibitor is a highly specific PKA inhibitor targeted to its active site (24Rimon G. Rubin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against β-actin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-GSTA4-4 and anti-TIM44 antibodies were provided by B. Mannervik (University of Uppsala, Sweden) and D. Pain (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ), respectively. Construction of Wild Type and Mutant cDNA Constructs and Fusions with DHFR—Full-length mouse GSTA4-4 cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-based PCR, using RNA extracted from mouse liver (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar). N- and C-terminal deletions containing a start codon preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence were constructed essentially as described before (26Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutant GSTA4-4 cDNA constructs with substitutions at the phosphorylation site and C-terminal-positively charged residues were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit supplied by Stratagene. These included T113A (Mut 113), T130A (Mut 130), S189A/T193A (Mut 189/193), and mutations at the C-terminal signal domain R217A/K221A (Mut RK/AA). The 172–222 sequence of GSTA4-4 was fused to the C terminus of mouse DHFR by in-frame ligation of DNA through an EcoRI linker as described before (27Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Pandak W. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24014-24022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were engineered to contain 5′ XbaI and 3′ Hind III restriction sites and cloned in pCMV4 and pGEM7zf (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) vectors, for cell transfection and in vitro translation studies, respectively. In Vitro Translation and Phosphorylation of GSTA4-4 —In vitro translation of mouse GSTA4-4 cDNA was performed in WGL or RRL systems (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) in the presence of added [35S]Met (40 μCi/50-μl reaction, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) as described before (26Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In some experiments, GSTA4-4 translation product was phosphorylated either by PKA or PKC. PKA-dependent phosphorylation was performed for 45 min at 30 °C in Mg(CH3COO)2 acetate buffer (pH 6.5) by adding 10 units of PKA and 100 μm ATP to the translation mix as described (28Koch J.A. Waxman D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PKC-dependent phosphorylation of GSTA4-4 was carried out for 45 min at 30 °C in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6) containing 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 units of PKC, and 100 μm ATP as recommended by the manufacturer (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). In some cases, translation products were generated in the WGL in the absence of [35S]Met, and phosphorylation was carried out in the presence of [32P]ATP. In Vitro Import of GSTA4-4 into Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver and used for in vitro import using a system described before (26Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The import assays (containing 80,000 cpm of 35S-labeled GSTA4-4) were carried out in a 200-μl final volume and treated with 0–300 μg/ml trypsin for 20 min on ice, as described before (26Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Trypsin-treated samples were mixed with a 10-times excess of trypsin inhibitor, and mitochondria were recovered by sedimentation through 1 m sucrose. Untreated samples were diluted with mitochondrial isolation buffer and similarly banded through sucrose 1 m sucrose. Resulting mitochondrial pellets were washed twice with mitochondrial isolation buffer, and mitochondrial proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 75 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) and fluorography. Expression of GSTA4-4 cDNA in COS Cells and Isolation of Subcellular Fractions—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to 50% confluency and GSTA4-4 cDNA cloned in pCMV4 vector was transfected using FuGENE, a non-liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) as described before (30Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, cells from six to eight plates (100 mm) were homogenized in sucrose-mannitol buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture with a Teflon-fitted glass homogenizer (about 25 strokes). Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation and sucrose density banding as described before (26Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The post-mitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the cytosolic fraction was recovered in the supernatant. Immunoprecipitation—Mitochondria and cytosol (100 μg each) from GSTA4-4-transfected COS cells were solubilized in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The 15,000 × g supernatant fraction was incubated with rabbit polyclonal GSTA4-4 antibody (5 μg of IgG) overnight at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads was added to the sample and shaken for 3 h at room temperature. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-agarose beads by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer without added β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by immunoblot using phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and GSTA4-4 antibodies. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis as described previously (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed with a chemiluminescence Super Signal Ultra kit (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Imaging and quantitation were performed using a Fluor-S imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). GST Activity—GST activity in the COS cell mitochondrial and cytosolic extracts was assayed using CDNB and HNE as substrates following the procedures of Habig et al. (32Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Alin et al. (33Alin P. Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), respectively. Depletion of Hsp70 from WGL—GSTA4-4 was translated in the WGL as described above, and 25 μl of the translation mix was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 25 μl of 8 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. The mixture was dialyzed for 12 h against two changes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Monoclonal Hsp70 antibody (10 μg of IgG) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with protein A-agarose beads under agitation, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was tested for Hsp70 content and used as a GSTA4-4 translation product devoid of Hsp70. Co-immunoprecipitation of Hsp70 with GSTA4-4 —GSTA4-4 protein was synthesized in the WGL in the absence or the presence of PKC inhibitors (6 μm H7 or 50 nm GF109203X) or PKA inhibitors (50 nm H89 or 50 nm MPI). Interaction of GSTA4-4 with Hsp70 from the WGL under these conditions was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. Reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to GSTA4-4 as described above and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by fluorography and immunoblot analysis using mouse monoclonal antibody for Hsp70. Mitochondrial Translocation of GSTA4-4 —A recent study from our laboratory showed that the mitochondrial GSTA4-4 exhibits size and sequence properties similar to the cytosolic counterpart (22Raza H. Robin M.-A. Fang J.-K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we first investigated the mitochondrial transport of GSTA4-4 using an in vitro mitochondrial import system in which resistance to limited protease digestion is used as a criterion for mitochondrial import (26Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the in vitro import of 35S-labeled GSTA4-4 into isolated rat liver mitochondria. For comparison, in vitro translation was carried out either in RRL or in the WGL system. The in vitro translated GSTA4-4 protein showed two very closely migrating bands indicating alternate translation at immediately adjacent AUG codons. In both RRL and WGL systems, we obtained comparable translation efficiency (lanes 1 and 4), although the RRL products showed a surprisingly low (less than 2%) mitochondrial binding as well as import (lanes 2 and 3). The in vitro product from the WGL system, on the other hand, showed high level of binding (about 75% of the input counts, lane 5) and a high level of import (15% of input, lane 6). The reason for the poor import of translation products programmed in RRL remains unclear, although it is likely due to either a lack of essential protein factors for mitochondrial import of GSTA4-4 or rapid folding of the nascent polypeptide. For all the remaining experiments, therefore, we have used the WGL system. Fig. 1A also shows that the imported protein became sensitive to trypsin when mitochondrial membrane was disrupted by adding Triton X-100 (lane 8). Furthermore, the import of GSTA4-4 protein was dependent on transmembrane potential, because 2,4-dinitrophenol and CCCP, which disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the transport to 0.5% (lane 10) and 2% (lane 12) of input protein, respectively. The transport was also dependent on externally added ATP, because omission of energy mix (ATP-generating system) reduced the transport (lane 14). The in vivo targeting of GSTA4-4 to mitochondria was investigated using COS cells transfected with GSTA4-4 cDNA (Fig. 1B). Mitochondria and cytosol were isolated from cells transfected with the vector alone (mock) or with GSTA4-4 cDNA. Results show that both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions from mock transfected cells contain endogenous, albeit low levels, of GSTA4-4, which co-migrates with purified GSTA4-4. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions from transfected cells, however, contain 6- to 10-fold higher levels of antibody-reactive protein. Quantification of blots and calculations based on a 3:1 ratio of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein recovery from cell homogenates showed that the mitochondrial GSTA4-4 pool in transfected cells represents about 20% of that detected in total homogenates. To further confirm the intramitochondrial location of GSTA4-4 protein, freshly isolated mitochondrial particles and cytoplasmic proteins were subjected to limited treatment with trypsin. Results (Fig. 1B) show that mitochondria-associated GSTA4-4 was resistant to trypsin treatment, whereas the cytoplasmic protein was completely degraded under this treatment condition. Control experiments with antibodies to specific marker proteins also showed that the mitochondrial fraction contained mitochondrial inner membrane translocase protein TIM44 but lacked the detectable cytosolic protein β-actin. The cytosolic fraction, on the other hand, lacked significant TIM44 protein but contained β-actin, suggesting the purity of subcellular fractions used. Further proof for mitochondrial targeting of GSTA4-4 in transfected COS cells was sought by assaying the rates of CDNB and HNE conjugation to GSH (Fig. 1C). Cytosolic fractions from mock transfected cells yielded relatively higher activity (400 nmol/mg of protein/min) with CDNB, which is a broad range substrate for GSTs belonging to different subfamilies, and a low activity of about 30 nmol/min/mg of protein with HNE. The corresponding activities representing endogenous GST levels from the mitochondrial fraction were about one-half to one-third of those obtained with the cytosolic fraction. A nearly 2-fold higher activity with CDNB was observed in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of cells transfected with GSTA4-4 cDNA as compared with corresponding fractions of mock transfected cells. The activity with HNE in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of transfected cells was 6- to 8-fold of corresponding fractions from mock transfected cells. Consistent with the results of immunoblot analysis, the GST activity with HNE was generally higher with the cytosolic fraction than with the mitochondrial fraction. Mitochondrial GSTA4-4 Is Hyperphosphorylated—Recent studies in our laboratory showed that CYP enzymes belonging to family 2, which are predominantly microsomal, are also targeted to mitochondria and that the bimodal targeting of these proteins is modulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation (30Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Robin M.-A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G.

GSTA4-4 contains a number of consensus sites for both PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation (see the schematic at the top of Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, nascent GSTA4-4 translated in WGL was efficiently phosphorylated by adding PKA and PKC. Phosphorylation was apparent both in the presence of added PKC along with PKA inhibitor H89, or PKA along with PKC inhibitor GF109203X. PKA and PKC inhibitors together markedly reduced the level of phosphorylation. We also investigated the steady-state levels of Ser and Thr phosphorylation of cytosolic and mitochondrial GSTA4-4. As shown in Fig. 2B, GSTA4-4 was immunoprecipitated from both cell fractions, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies to Ser-phosphate and Thr-phosphate. Fig. 2B shows that nearly the same amounts of immunoprecipitated GSTA4-4 from mitochondria and cytosolic fractions (left-most panel) show vastly varying levels of phosphorylation. As seen from the middle and right-most panels, mitochondrial GSTA4-4 was more heavily phosphorylated both at the Ser and Thr residues as revealed by intense antibody-reactive bands. The cytosolic counterpart carries very low to negligible phosphorylation of Ser and Thr. These results clearly show that the mitochondrial GST is hyperphosphorylated. Role of Phosphorylation on Mitochondrial Targeting of GSTA4-4 —The role of phosphorylation on mitochondrial targeting of GSTA4-4 was studied using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In the first approach, GSTA4-4 translated in WGL in the presence or absence of added PKA and PKC and, with or without added kinase inhibitors, was used for import in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Although not shown, none of the protein kinase inhibitors affected the translational efficiency of GSTA4-4 at the concentrations used. Results of in vitro import in Fig. 3A (lanes 1 and 2) show that translation products formed in the absence of added kinases or inhibitors bind to mitochondria efficiently (about 70% of input protein), although they were imported at a very low level (∼6% of input cpm). Addition of PKA (10 units) during translation caused a marked increase of in vitro import to about 40% of input protein as indicated by resistance to trypsin treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Addition of PKC also caused a marked increase in import to about 60% of input (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Inhibitors of PKA, H89 (50 nm), and MPI (a myristoylated peptide inhibitor of PKA, 50 nm), both selectively abolished PKA-mediated increase of in vitro transport, without affecting PKC-mediated increase (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3–6). PKC-specific inhibitor, GF109203X (50 nm), on the other hand, selectively abolished the PKC-mediated increase of import without affecting the PKA-mediated increase (Fig. 3D, lanes 3–6). General protein kinase inhibitor H7 and a combination of GF109203X and MPI inhibited both PKC- and PKA-mediated mitochondrial import (Fig. 3, E and F, lanes 3–6). The PKA and PKC inhibitors as well as the general kinase inhibitor H7 inhibited both mitochondrial binding and import of GSTA4-4 synthesized in the control WGL system, suggesting that the low level of"

At present there are 19 reported vertebrate ADAMTS family members (27Cal S. Obaya A.J. Llamazares M. Garabaya C. Quesada V. Lopez-Otin C.

They resemble the ADAMs family of proteases in having pro-, adamalysin/reprolysin-like metalloprotease, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich protein domains but differ in that they lack epidermal growth factor-like domains, and unlike many ADAMs proteases, they lack transmembrane domains (26Kuno K.

There are indications that ADAMTS proteases play a broad range of roles in development, reproduction, disease, and homeostasis. Aside from the role of ADAMTS-2 in biosynthetic processing of procollagens I and II, the phenotype of Adamts2-null mice suggests a role in male fertility as well (31Li S.-W. Arita M. Fertala A.

ADAMTS-1, -4, and -5/11 appear to constitute a subset of highly homologous ADAMTS family members with aggrecanase activity, important to homeostasis of cartilage and etiology of the arthritides (32Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The phenotype of Adamts1-null mice also suggests roles for ADAMTS-1 in growth, organogenesis, and female fertility (35Shindo T. Kurihara H. Kuno K. Yokoyama H. Wada T. Kurihara Y. Imai T. Wang Y. Ogata M. Nishimatsu H. Moriyama N. Oh-hashi Y. Morita H. Ishikawa T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Matsushima K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas both ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-8 have been shown to have anti-angiogenic activity (36Vázquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.-A.

Roles for ADAMTS-like proteins in fertility and organogenesis in a broad spectrum of species are suggested by the finding that the gon-1 gene, which encodes an ADAMTS-like product, is essential for gonadal morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans (37Blelloch R. Kimble J. Nature. 1999; 399: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutations in the gene for ADAMTS-13 have been shown to be causal for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, perhaps due to its demonstrated ability to process von Willebrand factor, showing ADAMTS-13 to have an important role in human vascular homeostasis (38Levy G.G. Nichols W.C. Lian E.C. Foroud T. McClintick J.N. McGee B.M. Yang A.Y. Siemlenlak D.R. Stark K.R. Gruppo R. Sarode R. Shurin S.B. Chandrasekaran V. Stabler S.P. Sablo H. Bouhassira E.E. Upshaw Jr., J.D. Ginsburg D. Tsai H.-M. Nature. 2001; 413: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Despite the seeming importance of ADAMTS proteases in many biological processes, there has been little characterization of the regulation of their expression and activity. In a previous study of the regulation of procollagen C-proteinase activity and expression of BMP-1 and mTLD, by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), we noted elevation of both pCP and pNPI activities in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells treated with TGF-β1 (39Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that TGF-β1 induces expression of ADAMTS-2 mRNA, apparently at the transcriptional level, resulting in expression of fully processed and active 132-kDa ADAMTS-2 protein from MG-63 cells. Processing of the ADAMTS-2 pro-domain is shown to be via a two-step process involving sequential cleavage by furin-like proprotein convertases at two consensus sites. Surprisingly, purified ADAMTS-2 protein is shown to have pNP activity not only against procollagens I and II but against procollagen III as well, whereas processing of the procollagen III N-propeptide is shown to be decreased in EDSVIIC fibroblast cultures. These latter two findings indicate that the distinction that has been made between pNPI and pNPIII is a false one. Implications of the various data are discussed. RNA Analysis—To generate probes for analysis of human ADAMTS-2 RNA, ADAMTS-2 sequences were PCR-amplified from human dermal fibroblast cDNA (Clontech) using oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTTGGCCGAGACCTGCACCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGACAGGAGCATAGCCTTGCATGC-3′ (reverse), corresponding to nucleotides 346–367 and 1147 to 1124, respectively, of the published ADAMTS-2 sequence (GenBank™ accession number AJ003125, see Ref. 21Colige A. Sieron A.L. Li S.-W. Schwarze U. Petty E. Wertelecki W. Wilcox W. Krakow D. Cohn D.H. Reardon W. Byers P.H. Lapière C.M. Prockop D.J. Nusgens B.V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 308-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was used to screen a λgt10 human placenta cDNA library (Clontech), yielding one positive clone with a 1231-bp insert extending from nucleotides 400 to 1630 that was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). This insert was employed as a Northern blot probe. Restriction of the described construct with PstI, which cleaves after ADAMTS-2 nucleotide 786 and within the pBluescript polylinker, followed by religation of the plasmid, yielded a template that, upon linearization with EcoRI and transcription with T7 polymerase, yielded a 387-base riboprobe used for RNase protection assays. Poly(A+) RNA was prepared from cultured MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells as described previously (39Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted in the text, TGF-β1 treatment of cells harvested for RNA was at 2 ng/ml for 24 h. To test stability of ADAMTS-2 mRNA, just confluent MG-63 cells, untreated or treated with TGF-β1 as described above, were then treated with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D for varying times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing or lacking 2 ng/ml TGF-β. Stability was determined by RNase protection assays. RNase protection and Northern blot assays were performed as described by Lee et al. (39Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Protein—For expression of recombinant ADAMTS-2 in 293-EBNA cells, a human ADAMTS-2 cDNA insert extending from nts 112 to 3633 of the published sequence (21Colige A. Sieron A.L. Li S.-W. Schwarze U. Petty E. Wertelecki W. Wilcox W. Krakow D. Cohn D.H. Reardon W. Byers P.H. Lapière C.M. Prockop D.J. Nusgens B.V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 308-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), corresponding to the full-length protein minus signal peptide sequences and with PCR addition of sequences encoding DYKDDDDK-Stop to the 3′-end of the insert, was ligated between the NheI and BamHI sites of episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu/BM40s (40Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Coding was thus for full-length human ADAMTS-2 differing from the native protein only in replacement of the native signal peptide by BM40 signal peptide sequences, to enhance secretion, and by addition of a C-terminal FLAG tag. Experiments in Fig. 7 were performed with recombinant ADAMTS-2 from a clonal line of transfected 293 cells constitutively expressing ADAMTS-2 and prepared toward the end of the study. To prepare this clonal line, in-frame BM40s/ADAMTS-2/FLAG coding sequences were excised from pCEP-Pu with AflII and BamHI and inserted between corresponding sites of expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which was transfected into 293 cells. 293 cells were grown in growth medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine and 10% FBS, whereas 293-EBNA cells were grown in the same growth medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Transfection of both types of cells was at 90% confluence with 10 μg of expression vector per 100-mm culture dish, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 36 h, transfected 293-EBNA cells were selected, and surviving cells were allowed to grow to confluent mass cultures in growth medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 250 μg/ml G418. After 72 h, transfected 293 cells were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and surviving colonies of cells were ring cloned. Culture media of 36 clones were analyzed by immunoblot, and the clone expressing the highest levels of ADAMTS-2 was used for the studies of Fig. 7. To prepare purified recombinant ADAMTS-2, mass cultures of transfected 293-EBNA cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and switched to serum-free DMEM containing 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) with or without 5 μg/ml soluble heparin (Sigma). Conditioned media were harvested 24 h later, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Harvested media were centrifuged to remove debris, and supernatants were stored at -70 °C. FLAG-tagged ADAMTS-2 in media was bound to 1 ml of FLAG M2 matrix, and the matrix was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), using the supplier's protocols (Sigma). ADAMTS-2 was eluted with 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in binding buffer, and fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blot. Purified full-length recombinant human ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 were provided by Wyeth Research, Cambridge, MA. Preparation of Cell Lysate and ECM—For the experiments of Fig. 7, confluent cells were rinsed twice with PBS, detached in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. ECM remaining on dishes was rinsed twice with PBS and then scraped into 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Treatment of cells in serum-free growth media with 20 μm of furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem) was as described previously (41Unsöld C. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Induction of Secreted ADAMTS-2 by TGF-β—MG-63 cells at 70% confluence were trypsinized and replated in low salt, low cysteine, low sulfate DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS (Hyclone), 4 mm l-glutamine, and 30 mm sodium chlorate. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized again and replated in the same type of chlorate-containing media. The next day, cells were switched to serum-free, chlorate-containing DMEM with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) and 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and conditioned media were harvested 48 h later. Cell layers were then treated 2 h with 0.006 IU/ml heparitinase (Seikagaku America) in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. These media were removed and pooled with conditioned media from the previous step, and pooled media were incubated 20 h with heparin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged 1 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS, and protein was eluted by boiling beads for 5 min in 30 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoblots—Samples subjected to SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) as described (39Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked 1 h with 2% bovine serum albumin in T-PBS (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated overnight with primary antibody diluted 1:5000 in the same solution. Blots were washed with T-PBS and blocked again by 2% bovine serum albumin in T-PBS, followed by incubation with 1:5000 diluted secondary antibody. After washing 6 times in T-PBS, blots were incubated 4 min in SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce) and exposed to film. The blot in the right panel of Fig. 9B was washed overnight in T-PBS after transfer, blocked 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in T-PBS, incubated overnight with primary antibody diluted 1:2000 in the same solution and, the next day, washed as above. Antibodies 1429, 1435, 1374, and 1442, raised against peptides whose sequences are presented in Fig. 3, were prepared and affinity-purified using techniques described previously (39Lee S.

Peptide antibodies directed against sequences in the pro-α1(I) C-telopeptide (LF-67), pro-α1(III) C-propeptide (LF-69), and N-telopeptide (LF-71) have been described previously (42Bernstein E.F.

Although antibody LF-71 was raised against pro-α1(III) N-telopeptide sequences, it appears to recognize only forms that retain the N-propeptide (i.e. pro-α1(III) and pNα(III) chains) and does not recognize forms from which the N-propeptide has been removed (i.e. pCα1(III) and mature α1(III) chains), perhaps due to conformational changes affecting availability of epitopes 3L.

Vertical lines indicate sites corresponding to the N termini of ∼132 and ∼118-kDa forms of ADAMTS-2, as experimentally determined by automated Edman degradation. The cleavage site for production of the ∼132-kDa form was at the more C-terminal of the two furin sites (RARR259/260HAAD), whereas the cleavage sites for the two ∼118-kDa forms were at GFSS402/403AFVV and SYDC465/466LLDD, respectively.

The expression of ecto-calreticulin on purified human neutrophils did not result from contamination by soluble or intracellular calreticulin released during cell fractionation because it was expressed on circulating neutrophils, and the expression did not increase significantly with neutrophil isolation. All neutrophils expressed calreticulin with a unimodal distribution. Treatment of neutrophils with either a cholesterol-binding agent or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C dramatically decreased ecto-calreticulin expression indicating that the adaptor molecule(s) are located in lipid rafts and have a GPI-anchor. Analysis for the co-expression of specific GPI-anchored proteins and ecto-calreticulin in cells that were deficient in specific GPI-anchored proteins, indicated that ecto-calreticulin was best associated with CD59. Calreticulin reciprocally immunoprecipited with CD59, which provided direct evidence that CD59 is an adaptor for ecto-calreticulin. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy demonstrated that ecto-calreticulin co-localized with a fraction of CD59 at the cell surface. Cross-linking ecto-calreticulin with antibodies induced a Ca2+ flux, which suggests that ecto-calreticulin is capable of signaling following ligand binding. Ecto-calreticulin has been associated with diverse cellular functions. An appreciation that the adaptors for ecto-calreticulin are GPI-anchored will provide a framework for understanding any common features underlying ecto-calreticulin ligation.

All neutrophils expressed calreticulin with a unimodal distribution. Treatment of neutrophils with either a cholesterol-binding agent or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C dramatically decreased ecto-calreticulin expression indicating that the adaptor molecule(s) are located in lipid rafts and have a GPI-anchor. Analysis for the co-expression of specific GPI-anchored proteins and ecto-calreticulin in cells that were deficient in specific GPI-anchored proteins, indicated that ecto-calreticulin was best associated with CD59. Calreticulin reciprocally immunoprecipited with CD59, which provided direct evidence that CD59 is an adaptor for ecto-calreticulin. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy demonstrated that ecto-calreticulin co-localized with a fraction of CD59 at the cell surface. Cross-linking ecto-calreticulin with antibodies induced a Ca2+ flux, which suggests that ecto-calreticulin is capable of signaling following ligand binding. Ecto-calreticulin has been associated with diverse cellular functions. An appreciation that the adaptors for ecto-calreticulin are GPI-anchored will provide a framework for understanding any common features underlying ecto-calreticulin ligation.

The presence of CRT in the endoplasmic reticulum is due to the KDEL receptor, which interacts with the KDEL-containing C-terminal domain of CRT. In addition to its endoplasmic reticulum location, CRT has been found at other sites including its functional presence at the surface of a variety of cells. Most of these studies utilized cultured cells, such as mouse melanoma cells (1White T.K. Zhu Q. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol.

Because there is always a fraction of dead and dying cells within a population of cultured cells, it raises the question as to whether the ecto-calreticulin (eCRT) is derived from moribund cells and stuck to the surface of viable cells. However, eCRT has been identified on the surface of freshly isolated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) (7Eggleton P. Lieu T.S. Zappi E.G. Sastry K. Coburn J. Zaner K.S. Sontheimer R.D.

Nicholson-Weller A. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Engaging eCRT induces different effects in different cells, e.g. for macrophages, ligation of eCRT with either complement C1q-, mannan-binding lectin-, surfactant protein A-, or surfactant protein d-opsonized apoptotic cells, induces phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell by a macrophage CD91-dependent mechanism (10Ogden C.A. de Cathelineau A.

For fibroblasts, engaging eCRT by Bβ chain of fibrinogen induces mitosis (2Gray A.J. Park P.W. Broekelmann T.J. Laurent G.J. Reeves J.T. Stenmark K.R. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas engaging eCRT by the collagen domain of C1q induces a pro-apoptotic, anti-mitotic effect (12Bordin S. Whitfield D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CRT, which lacks a transmembrane domain, requires an adaptor molecule that is a resident of the plasma membrane to be expressed at the cell surface. The effect of eCRT engagement would then depend to a great extent on the identity of the adaptor molecule(s) of the plasma membrane. In this study, we report that CRT is present at the plasma membrane of circulating PMN. Normal 293 cells expressed eCRT, whereas GPI-anchor-deficient 293 cells were also eCRT deficient, consistent with the putative adaptor molecule(s) for eCRT being GPI-anchored. Using immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, we have identified CD59 as a major adaptor protein for eCRT in PMN. Finally, cross-linking eCRT with primary and secondary antibodies induced a calcium flux in PMN, demonstrating that eCRT ligation with a natural ligand has the potential to initiate intracellular signaling.

Cells—Leukocytes were derived from finger prick blood (150 μl) that was mixed with 1 ml cold HBSS2-, 2 mm EDTA, the cells pelleted by centrifugation, and the erythrocytes lysed by ammonium chloride (8.1 g/l ammonium chloride, 1.0 g/l potassium bicarbonate, and 0.037 g/l EDTA) for 5 min. The leukocytes were then washed twice in HBSS. Dextran-sedimented leukocytes were isolated from 40 ml of ACD-anti-coagulated blood obtained by venopuncture, as described (18Ghiran I. Barbashov S.F. Klickstein L.B. Tas S.W. Jensenius J.C. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1797-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). PMN were further fractionated from the dextran-leukocyte preparation by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque at 3000 × g for 20 min. 293 fetal kidney epithelial cells were transfected with an SV40 large T antigen plasmid and exposed to ethylmethanesulfonate. Subsequently, a normal GPI-anchor expressing cell line (293Tag1.6) and a GPI-anchor-deficient expressing cell line (A293.2.2) were cloned by limiting dilution (19Klickstein L.B. York M.R. Luther E.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1478-1481Google Scholar). PPC-1, prostate epithelial cells, were provided by S. Tomlinson (Medical University of South Carolina). Flow Cytometry—Cells, which were impermeable and alive unless otherwise noted, were incubated for 15 min with antibodies, as noted in each figure, in FACS buffer (HBSS + 5% BSA) at 4 °C, followed by two washes and incubation for 15 min with secondary antibody at a dilution recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were washed once and analyzed in a FACScan™ (BD Biosciences). In all the experiments at least 10,000 events were recorded, and the results were analyzed using CellQuest Pro 4.0.1. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—All the staining steps were performed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 4 °C for 10–15 min in HBSS + 0.5% BSA. Before adding primary and secondary antibodies cell were blocked by incubation with HBSS + 1.5% BSA for 10 min. The final concentration of primary antibodies was 10 μg/ml, and the dilutions of secondary antibody were as specified by the manufacturer. After incubation with secondary antibodies, PMN were washed twice and resuspended in HBSS + 1% BSA. For co-localization of eCRT and CD59 in spread cells, PMN were allowed to adhere to the slide for 5–7 min, fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde for 4 min, washed and mounted in PBS. Images were acquired with a Retiga EXi monochrome camera equipped on an Olympus Provis fluorescence microscope fitted with FITC and rhodamine filters. For all images a 40 × 1.00 UPlan Apo oil lens was used. Acquired images were further processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. For confocal analysis, cells were resuspended after the final wash directly in anti-fading media (Prolong, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mounted on slides. Fifty-two sequential Z-sections at 0.15 μm intervals were acquired at the resolution of 512 × 512 using a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal device fitted on a Nikon Eclipse E-800 microscope with a 100 × 1.4 Plan Apo oil lens. Images were further processed using AutoDeblur AutoVisualize 9.0 (AutoQuant Imaging, Troy, NY). The gain of the photo-detectors was set so that there was no detectable cross-signal from the second channel when slides with just one fluorochome were imaged. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Isolated PMN were washed twice in HBSS and lysed in lysing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P 2714) for 30 min on ice. The mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g, and the post-nuclear supernatant was pre-cleared for 12 h with protein A+G beads (Pierce) for another 4 h with beads-control mAb antibody by end-over-end rotation. The pre-cleared supernatant was then incubated for 4 h with protein A+G beads coupled with either anti-CRT mAb (SPA-601) or anti-CD59 (p282) or anti-CD16 (3G8). Beads were washed in lysing buffer (with Nonidet P-40 0.05%) four times (30 min total) and boiled in nonreducing loading buffer for 5 min. Samples were run on 10% NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred on nitrocellulose paper (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and blocked with nonfat dry milk 6% in Tris buffer with Tween 0.1% for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with anti-CRT mAb (SPA-601), anti-CD59 (YTH53.1), or anti-CD16 mAb (3G8) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody for an extra 30 min. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed extensively in Tris buffer with Tween 0.1% and developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed to XAR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Spectrofluorimetry—Freshly purified PMN were re-suspended in HBSS2- at a concentration of 107 cells/ml and loaded with Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) per the manufacturer's instructions for 30 min in HBSS2- at room temperature followed by two washes in cold HBSS2-. Cells were then re-suspended in HBSS + 1.5% BSA and incubated with either anti-CD59 (MEM 43/5) mAb or anti-CRT IgY and corresponding control antibodies for 15 min at 4 °C. Subsequently the cells were washed with cold buffer then warmed to 37 °C for 10 min prior to starting each experiment. The addition of secondary antibody was done while monitoring Ca2+ by measuring Fura-2 fluorescence at 505 nm, using 340/380 nm excitation in a FluoroView F-4500 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi Instruments, San Jose, CA) with constant stirring at 37 °C. The data were analyzed with F4500 Intracellular Cation Measurement software (Hitachi). Calreticulin Is Expressed on the Surface Circulating and Isolated PMN—During a typical isolation procedures the viability of PMN decreases from 100% to about 92–94% as assessed by propidium iodide/acridine orange staining. Dying cells release proteins normally found in the cytoplasm, which can potentially bind nonspecifically to the surface of surrounding cells. This process could explain the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein at the cell surface. To test this possibility, we purified PMN and checked them for CRT expression during all the steps. The expression of eCRT increased ∼10% during the isolation of the cells (Fig. 1), but importantly eCRT was expressed on native PMN derived from finger prick blood (Fig. 1a). CRT lacks a transmembrane domain and has no alternative splicing variants that would predict lipid modification to allow subsequent membrane attachment (20Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). 2Site to enable analysis: mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/gpi/gpi_server.html. Thus, eCRT requires an adaptor molecule for expression at the plasma membrane. If the interaction between eCRT and its adaptor molecule were specific, modulation of the adaptor expression might be followed by concordant changes in eCRT expression. eCRT Expression Is Not Modulated by fMLP—Because the up- or down-regulation of eCRT expression could provide insight as to adaptor protein for eCRT, we exposed PMN to fMLP concentrations ranging from 10-8m to 1.5 × 10-7m, and the eCRT expression was assessed by flow cytometry. The maximum dose of fMLP resulted in less than 10% loss of eCRT (Fig. 2a). Additionally, C5a (3 and 33 nm) also failed to significantly change eCRT expression as evidenced by decrease in mean fluorescent channel of 12 and 9%, respectively. CRT binds calcium and it has a lectin-like domain. To determine whether eCRT were bound to an adaptor in a calcium-dependent manner, we assessed the effect of exposing PMN to buffered EDTA (5 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C. EDTA treatment did not significantly affect eCRT expression (Fig. 2b). This result also effectively rules out integrin-mediated binding of CRT to the cell surface, consistent with the results from Fig. 1. We did note spontaneous shedding over a 3 h incubation in HBSS at room temperature, as noted previously (8Kishore U. Sontheimer R.D. Sastry K.N. Zaner K.S. Zappi E.G. Hughes G.R. Khamashta M.A. Strong P. Reid K.B. Eggleton P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Eggleton P. Ghebrehiwet B. Coburn J.P. Sastry K.N. Zaner K.S. Tauber A.I. Blood. 1994; 84: 1640-1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the shedding was enhanced by the additional exposure of PMN to 0.3 m KCl for 20 min (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the adaptor-eCRT interaction depends on ionic and not hydrophobic bonds. Lipid Raft-depleting Reagents and Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PIPLC) Decrease the Expression of eCRT—To continue a systematic search for the adaptor molecule(s) responsible for anchoring eCRT to the cell surface, we next evaluated if GPI-anchored proteins were involved. We pre-treated PMN with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) or control buffer and assessed the expression of eCRT. MBCD is a water-soluble cyclic oligomer of d-glucopyranose (6–8 units usually) with a hydrophilic surface, which explains its water solubility, and a central non-polar cavity, which binds cholesterol. Unlike other cholesterol-binding agents, MBCD does not interact directly with the plasma membrane, but rather acts from the surface of the cell membrane by extracting specifically cholesterol. MBCD treatment depletes the cell of cholesterol in a lipid raft-independent manner but partially solubilizes proteins from lipid rafts (22Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Compared with the buffer-treated control, MBCD treatment decreased the expression of eCRT on PMN by more than 60% (Fig. 3, a and b). Our results strongly suggested that the adaptor for eCRT resided in lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are heterogeneous in composition, but contain mainly GPI-anchored proteins and a few transmembrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). PIPLC is an enzyme that specifically cleaves GPI-anchored proteins at their lipid anchor, making possible the distinction between transmembrane and GPI-anchored proteins in lipid rafts. PMN were pre-incubated with PIPLC for 30 min, washed, and then incubated with chicken anti-CRT or mAb anti-CD16. CD16 is known to be a GPI-anchored protein on PMN (24Huizinga T.W. van der Schoot C.E. Jost C. Klaassen R. Kleijer M. von dem Borne A.E. Roos D. Tetteroo P.A. Nature. 1988; 333: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). PIPLC treatment of PMN decreased their expression of eCRT by over 50% (Fig. 3c). PIPLC is not 100% efficient in removing all the GPI-anchored proteins from cells (24Huizinga T.W. van der Schoot C.E. Jost C. Klaassen R. Kleijer M. von dem Borne A.E. Roos D. Tetteroo P.A. Nature. 1988; 333: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and as evidenced by the partial removal (50%) of CD16 in this experiment (Fig. 3d). GPI-anchored Protein-deficient Cells Are Devoid of eCRT— The removal of eCRT by PIPLC strongly suggested the possibility of a GPI-anchored adaptor for CRT. To test this hypothesis we utilized a sub-line of 293 cells that had been chemically mutated and negatively selected using antibodies against GPI-anchored proteins (19Klickstein L.B. York M.R. Luther E. Springer T.A. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F.A.M. Leucocyte Typing V. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1478-1481Google Scholar). CD59, a known GPI-anchored protein, had a normal expression on the wild type cells, and eCRT was also expressed (Fig. 4, a and c). The GPI-anchor-deficient cells failed to express CD59 and failed to express eCRT (Fig. 4, b and d). These results provided further evidence that eCRT expression was linked to the expression of GPI-anchored proteins, but it did not help identify the relevant GPI-anchored protein(s) because all GPI-anchored proteins were missing from the mutated cells. eCRT Expression Follows the Expression of CD59 and CD16 on the Affected PMN from Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)-like Patients—Leukocytes normally express several GPI-anchored proteins on their surface, including CD16, CD59, and CD87 (Fig. 5c), and express eCRT (Fig. 5d). Leukocytes from patients with PNH are characteristically deficient in the two complement regulatory proteins DAF (CD55) and CD59 and may be deficient in other GPI-anchored proteins as well. We compared eCRT expression in the PMN from a normal donor and two PNH-like patients. The first atypical PNH patient's PMN were DAF-(data not shown), CD87-, CD16+, CD59+, and eCRT was expressed normally (Fig. 5, a and b). These results were consistent with, but did not prove, the finding that either CD16 or CD59 might be the adaptor for eCRT. Subsequently, we assessed a more typical PNH patient whose PMN were DAF- (data not shown), CD16-, CD87-, and CD59low. In this case the PMN were eCRTlow, consistent with CD59 being the adaptor and eliminating CD16 as a major adaptor (Fig. 5, e and f). These patient data were confirmed using the prostate epithelial cell line PPC-1, which were CD59+, CD16-, and eCRT+ with net mean fluorescent channels of 188, 2.3, and 46.5, respectively. Reciprocal Immunoprecipitation of CRT and CD59 —The association of CRT with CD59 expression on the PMN from PMN patients and PPC-1 cells prompted us to see if there were any physical interactions between eCRT and CD59. We immunoprecipitated eCRT using rabbit anti-CRT Ab and probed the samples using either anti-CD59 mAb YTH 53.1 or anti-CD16 mAb. CD59 co-immunoprecipitated with e-CRT, whereas CD16 did not (Fig. 6, upper panels). Performing the reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-CD59 mAb, we detected eCRT by immunoblotting in a band of 66 k Mr (Fig. 6, lower panel), the same Mr as intracellular CRT (data not shown). Interestingly, only one anti-CD59 mAb (MEM 43/5) was effective in immunoprecipitating eCRT. The other anti-CD59 mAbs that failed to co-immunoprecipitate eCRT, including YTH 53.1 and BRIC229, which bind epitope 1, and p282, which binds epitope 3 (25Klickstein L.B. Springer T. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leucocyte Typing V. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1476-1477Google Scholar). These data suggest that e-CRT shields epitopes 1 and 3 of CD59, but not epitope 2. eCRT Co-localizes with a Fraction of CD59 at the Surface of the PMN—Using fluorescence microscopy it is possible to detect the presence of two or more proteins in the same location at the same time (co-localization) in a cell. We used this approach to investigate the distribution of eCRT and CD59 on human PMN. Freshly purified cells were incubated in HBSS + 1% BSA with either with rabbit anti-CRT Ab or with rat mAb anti-CD59 (YTH 53.1) for 10 min on ice followed by two washes and incubation by Cy-3 anti-rabbit and Cy-2 anti-rat secondary antibodies. The results demonstrate that eCRT is present at the surface of PMN (Fig. 7, b–d) and co-localizes with a fraction of CD59 (Fig. 7f). Similar results were obtained with three other anti-CD59 mAbs. As a negative control we used mAb CBR M1/5, which recognizes an activation-specific epitope of CD11b/CD18 (17Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7h). In migrating PMN, most of the cross-linked proteins (if not all) tend to accumulate at the rear of the cell producing the illusion of co-localization, as is demonstrated in Fig. 7h. In additional studies, to avoid any possible false results, cells were fixed while still round and imaged using confocal microscopy followed by deconvolution. A PMN is shown after three-dimensional reconstitution using both red (eCRT) and green (CD59) channels showing all the surface staining (Fig. 8a), and two sections through the middle of the cell, which show rings of staining and prove that the cell was not permeable at the time of labeling (Fig. 8, b and c). Most of the signals came from the same location at the cell surface (Fig. 8d), whereas others were either adjacent or separate (Fig. 8, e and f). All the cells examined had more CD59 on their surface than eCRT, but different donors had different levels of eCRT expression.Fig. 8Confocal images of PMN in suspension. PMN were stained as above and fixed in suspension with 3.8% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Cells were then washed and mounted in anti-fading media on slides. Serial sections were acquired using a confocal microscope and used to reconstitute the whole PMN (a). PMN displayd a strong surface staining for CD59 (green) and eCRT (red) with no detectable intracellular staining (b and c). There was significant co-localization detailed in d. In b and magnified in e CD59 and eCRT were in adjacent positions, whereas in c and magnified in f they were in separate locations at the plasma membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antibody Cross-linking of eCRT on PMN Induces a Calcium Flux Similar to that Induced by Anti-CD59 Cross-linking— Antibody-induced cross-linking of GPI-anchored proteins can stimulate intracellular signaling. The signaling pathway used when CD59 is cross-linked includes a Ca2+ flux and the activation of tyrosine kinases (26Morgan B.P. van den Berg C.W. Davies E.V. Hallett M.B. Horejsi V. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2841-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Murray E.W. Robbins S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25279-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test if cross-linking eCRT would induce a signal, cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM for 30 min, washed in cold HBSS2+, and mixed with either anti-CD59 mAb or anti-CRT IgY for 15 min at 4 °C. Subsequently the cells were washed with cold buffer then warmed to 37 °C for 10 min prior to addition of secondary antibody. As a negative control cells were treated with non-immune IgY, followed by secondary Ab, and no flux was seen (Fig. 9, bottom). Cross-linking eCRT induced a smaller Ca2+ flux (Fig. 9, middle) than cross-linking CD59 (Fig. 9, top), and one possible explanation is that there is less eCRT-CD59 for cross-linking than there is total CD59, i.e. (eCRT-CD59 + free CD59) for cross-linking, as noted in the confocal images (Figs. 8, a–c). In our systematic search for the adaptor molecule(s) responsible for attaching eCRT to the plasma membrane, we found no evidence that the chemotactic factors fMLP (Fig. 2a) and C5a significantly modified the expression of eCRT on PMN, arguing against CRT being stored in a mobilizable intracellular compartment. Experiments with MBCD and PIPLC supported the existence of GPI-anchored adaptor molecule(s) for eCRT (Fig. 3). Finding that the ethylmethanesulfonate-mutated A293.2.2 cells, which lack GPI-anchors, also lacked eCRT was further evidence that adaptor(s) for eCRT were GPI-anchored (Fig. 4). However, chemical mutagenesis can induce “silent” mutations, and therefore the additional evidence p"

An N-terminal hexapeptide cleavage product of a dodecapeptide substrate identified as a weak competitive inhibitor of the NS3 protease activity was optimized to a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the enzyme. The effect of this potent NS3 protease inhibitor was evaluated on replication of subgenomic HCV RNA and compared with interferon-α (IFN-α), which is currently used in the treatment of HCV-infected patients. Treatment of replicon-containing cells with the NS3 protease inhibitor or IFN-α showed a dose-dependent decrease in subgenomic HCV RNA that reached undetectable levels following a 14-day treatment. Kinetic studies in the presence of either NS3 protease inhibitor or IFN-α also revealed similar profiles in HCV RNA decay with half-lives of 11 and 14 h, respectively. The finding that an antiviral specifically targeting the NS3 protease activity inhibits HCV RNA replication further validates the NS3 enzyme as a prime target for drug discovery and supports the development of NS3 protease inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach for HCV infection.

Science. 1989; 244: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). An estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with HCV, and end stage liver disease associated with this virus is now the leading cause of liver transplantation in the western world (3Di Bisceglie A.M. Lancet. 1998; 351: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Many patients treated with IFN-α alone or with a combination of IFN-α plus ribavirin fail to show a sustained virologic response and currently have no other treatment option. Given the high prevalence of the infection, HCV has become the focus of intensive research. Originally cloned in 1989 (1Choo Q.L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6207) Google Scholar), the viral RNA genome is now well characterized. The ∼9600-nucleotide genome is of positive polarity that encodes a ∼3000-amino acid polyprotein, which is the precursor of at least 10 mature viral proteins: C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B. C is the nucleocapsid protein that binds and encapsulates the viral RNA genome (4Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E1 and E2 are the virion glycoproteins, and p7 is of unknown function (5Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NS2 to NS5B proteins inclusively are thought to comprise nonstructural proteins involved in replication and polyprotein processing (6Houghton M. Weiner A. Han J. Kuo G. Choo Q.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The individual proteins are processed from the polyprotein by a combination of host and viral proteases. Host signal peptidases are responsible for the cleavages between C, E1, E2, p7, and NS2. The cleavage between NS2 and NS3 is performed in an autoproteolytic manner by the metal-dependent protease NS2/3 (7Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka K. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Tanji Y. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2731-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic release of NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B is catalyzed by the multifunctional NS3 enzyme, which in conjunction with the mature NS4A cofactor mediates efficient processing (for a review, see Ref. 9De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The large polyprotein open reading frame is flanked at the 5′-end by an untranslated region, which functions as an internal ribosome entry site, and at the 3′-end by a highly conserved sequence that is essential for genome replication (10Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J.

Despite increasing knowledge of the genome structure and the function of individual viral proteins, studies on HCV replication and development of specific HCV antiviral agents have been hampered by the lack of an efficient virus culture system. However, an HCV RNA episomal cell system that preserves the 5′- and 3′-untranslated extremities and expresses the nonstructural region of HCV reconstitutes efficient replication of a subgenomic HCV RNA in the human liver Huh-7 cell line (13Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar).The activity of the chymotrypsin-like serine protease that is encoded within the amino-terminal 180 amino acids of NS3 is indispensable for HCV infectivity in the chimpanzee model (43Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Based on expression, purification, and in vitro enzymatic reconstitution, the NS3 protease is perhaps the most thoroughly characterized HCV enzyme. Efficient processing requires the NS3 protease in combination with the NS4A cofactor and a structural zinc molecule (9De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of the NS3 protease crystal structure, with or without an NS4A segment, shows that the presence of NS4A reorients the position of the catalytic triad within the serine protease (17Yao N.

A variety of such substrate-based NS3 protease inhibitors that harbor unique modifications and functionalities such as α-ketoamides, boronic acids, phosphonates, hydrazinourea, α-ketoacids, and pyrrolidine-5,5-trans-lactams have been disclosed (44Dymock B.W.

In an alternative approach, other groups have generated RNA aptamers that specifically target the NS3 protease, which may provide potential lead inhibitors or expose other sites on the enzyme suitable for drug intervention (48Fukuda K.

Submicromolar NS3 protease inhibitory activities have been reported using in vitro enzymatic assays, but, thus far, no reports have emerged to demonstrate inhibitory efficacy of this class of compounds in cells, and to demonstrate that such a mode of inhibition would ultimately manifest in decreased HCV RNA replication.In this report, results of in vitro studies with a potent and specific peptide-based inhibitor of the NS3 protease (compound A) are presented. Protease inhibition leading to reduction of HCV RNA levels and blockage of NS3-mediated polyprotein maturation is described using the subgenomic HCV replicon cell culture system. The effect on HCV RNA replication of the specific anti-HCV agent, compound A, is compared with the treatment with IFN-α. In view of the cell-based efficacy of this compound at reducing intracellular HCV RNA to undetectable levels through a confirmed mechanism of action, this class of peptidomimetic inhibitors may be considered as a promising series of HCV replication inhibitors. These findings provide additional support for targeting the NS3 protease and the continued development of potent and specific HCV inhibitors with therapeutic potential for the treatment of HCV infection.MATERIALS AND METHODSDescription of NS3 Protease Inhibitor—The details of the synthesis of hexapeptide-like compound A have been described (25Llinas-Brunet, M., Bailey, M. D., Halmos, T., Poupart, M. A., and Tsantrizos, Y. (August 10, 1998) U. S. Patent 6,143,715.Google Scholar) and will be published elsewhere. The compound was purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column using a gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in water. Satisfactory mass spectrometry, high resolution mass spectrometry, 1H NMR spectra, and homogeneity data (97% by HPLC) were obtained. IFN-α (Sigma) from human leukocytes was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA.Production and Characterization of NS3-NS4A Heterodimer Full-length Protein—The NS2-NS5B-3′-noncoding region was cloned by RT-PCR into the pCR®3 vector (Invitrogen) using RNA extracted from the serum of an HCV genotype 1b-infected individual (provided by Dr. Bernard Willems, Hôpital St-Luc, Montréal, Canada). The NS3-NS4A region (NS3-NS4AFL) was then subcloned by PCR into the pFastBac” HTa baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). The vector sequence includes a region encoding a 28-residue N-terminal sequence that contains a hexahistidine tag and a TEV protease cleavage site, resulting in the fusion protein His-NS3-NS4AFL. The Bac-to-Bac” baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to produce the recombinant baculovirus. His-NS3-NS4AFL was expressed by infecting 106 Sf21 cells/ml with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–0.2 at 27 °C. The infected culture was harvested 48–64 h later by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellet was homogenized in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol (w/v), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. His-NS3-NS4AFL was then extracted from the cell lysate with 1.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, and a DNase treatment. After ultracentrifugation, the soluble extract was diluted 4-fold in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 m NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 ng/ml leupeptin, and 200 ng/ml antipain and bound to an Amersham Biosciences Hi-Trap Ni2+-chelating column. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was eluted using a 50–500 mm imidazole gradient. After concentration, the hexahistidine can be removed using the recombinant TEV protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The protein obtained was then diluted in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol (w/v), 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 ng/ml leupeptin, and 200 ng/ml antipain and applied to a poly(U)-Sepharose affinity column. The enzyme was eluted in the same buffer using a 0.2–2 m NaCl gradient. Finally, after concentration on Centriprep-10, the protein was submitted to a gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200. The purified enzyme (>90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE) was stored at -80 °C. It was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.Enzymatic Studies—Enzymatic assays and kinetics were performed using a fluorogenic substrate and purified enzyme. Kinetic parameters and inhibition studies were determined with the His-NS3-NS4AFL and the recombinant TEV protease-treated NS3-NS4AFL that removed the histidine tag portion. The inhibition constant (Ki) was determined by a steady-state velocity method (26Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Mol. Cell. Biophys. 1985; 2: 347-368Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the fluorescence change associated with the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Asp(EDANS)-Glu-Glu-Abu[C(O)-O]-Ala-Ser-Lys(DABCYL)-NH2 (27Taliani M. Bianchi E. Narjes F. Fossatelli M. Urbani A. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. Pessi A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorometer (excitation at 340 nm and emission at 485 nm). Reactions were performed at 23 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 1 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide) containing 1.5 nm enzyme and 4 μm substrate. The onset of inhibition was determined by varying the inhibitor concentration from 0.5 to 6 nm. The reaction was initiated by enzyme addition. The steady-state velocity was estimated by fitting the data to the integrated rate equation describing competitive binding. Then, the apparent Ki (Ki(app)) was obtained by fitting steady-state velocity and inhibitor concentrations to the quadratic equation describing tight binding inhibition (28Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) using SAS software (Statistical Software System, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Ki was obtained by the equation Ki(app) = Ki(1 + (S)/Km) for a competitive mode of inhibition. Under similar assay conditions, the kinetic parameters were determined. Calculations were performed by nonlinear regression analysis of initial rates as a function of substrate concentration (0.25–6.0 μm) using the GraFit software (version 3.0; Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom).Selectivity Serine Protease Assays—Bovine pancreatic α-chymotrypsin and human leukocyte elastase (HLE) were obtained from Roche Applied Science and Calbiochem and assayed as described previously (29Ogilvie W. Bailey M. Poupart M.A. Abraham A. Bhavsar A. Bonneau P. Bordeleau J. Bousquet Y. Chabot C. Duceppe J.S Fazal G. Goulet S. Grand-Maitre C. Guse I. Halmos T. Lavallee P. Leach M. Malenfant E.

Chem. 1997; 40: 4113-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Description of Subgenomic HCV 1b RNA Replicon—The distinguishing details of this construct, selection of neomycin-resistant cell lines, and characterization of adaptive mutants have been described (30Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). 2G. Kukolj and A. Pause (2002) U. S. Patent application WO 02/052015 A2. Briefly, a subgenomic HCV 1b replicon was assembled on the basis of the nonstructural sequence described in clone I377/NS2–3′wt (13Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). A cDNA obtained from Operon Technologies Inc. was synthesized using a PCR-based protocol. The full-length bicistronic HCV RNA run-off transcript was synthesized using a T7 Ribomax kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was purified using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and DNA was removed using an RNase-free DNase kit (Qiagen). 20 μg of RNA was electroporated into 8 × 106 Huh-7 cells, and colonies were selected with 1 mg/ml of the selective agent G418 as described (13Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Resistant cell lines were maintained in 0.5 mg/ml G418. HCV RNA positive and negative strands were verified by strand-specific Northern blot analysis. HCV NS3 and NS5B proteins were detected by Western blot analysis.Determination of HCV RNA Levels and Cellular GAPDH mRNA Levels—Huh-7 cells (1 × 104) harboring a bicistronic subgenomic HCV replicon were plated into wells of a 96-well plate and incubated with serial dilutions of inhibitor 24 h after plating. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy-96 (Qiagen) cartridge at various times after the compound addition. HCV-specific RNA copy number was quantified (31Martell M. Gomez J. Esteban J.I. Sauleda S. Quer J. Cabot B. Esteban R. Guardia J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 327-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by quantitative real time RT-PCR with the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system and normalized to the total cellular RNA recovered as quantified with RiboGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Moreover, as a further control for RNA recovery and cell fitness in each assay well, the copy number of cellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was also quantified by real time RT-PCR with specific primers and probe. In the presence of inhibitors, the percentage of inhibition was determined by reduction in HCV RNA levels, which is expressed as genome equivalents per μg of total cellular RNA recovered relative to an Me2SO control. The percentage of inhibition was then plotted against the compound concentration, and a nonlinear curve was fitted (Hill model) to the percentage of inhibition-concentration data. The calculated percentage of inhibition values were then used to determine the median effective concentration EC50, slope factor (n), and maximum inhibition (Imax) by the nonlinear regression routine procedure of SAS using the following equation.Percentage of inhibition=Imax×[inhibitor]n[inhibitor]n+EC50n(Eq. 1) Cytotoxicity Assay—The 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide metabolic assay (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45530) Google Scholar) was used to determine the cytotoxicity in Huh-7 replicon-containing cells. CC50 corresponds to the concentration of inhibitor that decreased the percentage of formazan production by 50% of that produced by untreated cells after 3 days of incubation. Briefly, 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was added, and cells were incubated for 3 h. The formazan product was solubilized with 10% Triton X-100 in 0.01 n HCl and quantitated by measuring the optical density at 570 nm.Inhibition of NS3 Protease-mediated Polyprotein Processing—For Western blot analysis, HCV replicon-containing cells were grown logarithmically in the presence of increasing amounts of inhibitor for 72 h. Cells were lysed with Laemmli buffer, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot using an NS3 polyclonal antibody (33Thibeault D. Maurice R. Pilote L. Lamarre D. Pause A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46678-46684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells in a 6-cm diameter dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 and incubated with inhibitor for 20 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 1 h with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then incubated with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml) for 1 h. The inhibitor was present during all incubations. After the labeling period, cells were washed three times with PBS and were lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and processed for immunoprecipitation as described (34Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L. Mous J. Jacobsen H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5045-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation was performed with a rabbit antiserum (K137) specific to NS3 protease and incubated with protein A-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal) for 1 h at 4 °C. Products were resuspended in 3× Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography followed by phosphorimaging using a Storm system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInhibition of NS3 Protease by Compound A and Activity against Other Serine Proteases—The NS3-NS4AFL was expressed using recombinant baculovirus in Sf21 insect cells. Purification of the NS3-NS4AFL with and without an N-terminal histidine tag resulted in a greater than 90% pure protein as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The protocol yielded about 1.0 mg of purified protein per 108 insect cells. Proteolysis at the NS3-NS4A junction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the NS4A obtained from purified enzyme (data not shown). Kinetic analysis of the cleavage reaction using the internally quenched fluorogenic substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Asp(EDANS)-Glu-Glu-Abu[C(O)-O]-Ala-Ser-Lys(DABCYL)-NH2 revealed similar kinetic parameters for the NS3-NS4AFL and the His-NS3-NS4AFL proteases: mean Km = 1.2 and 1.0 μm; mean kcat = 35 and 35 min-1, respectively (see Table I). Therefore, the presence of an N-terminal histidine tag followed by a recombinant TEV protease cleavage site did not affect the NS3 serine protease activity and is consistent with previously published results (35Gallinari P. Paolini C. Brennan D. Nardi C. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R.

The Ki of compound A was determined with the NS3-NS4AFL genotype 1b protease using a steady-state velocity method and by fitting the data to the integrated rate equation describing competitive binding (28Morrison J.F.

Compound A is a slow, tightly binding inhibitor of the NS3-NS4AFL genotype 1b as shown by the slow onset of inhibition upon enzyme addition (Fig. 2B) with a mean Ki of 74 pm (Fig. 2C). The specificity of compound A was also assessed by evaluating its ability to inhibit a variety of serine proteases. Compound A was highly selective for the HCV NS3 protease and inactive (IC50 > 30 μm) against representative serine proteases such as HLE and bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2NS3-NS4AFL inhibition.A, chemical structure of compound A, a hexapeptide-like inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease.

Paradoxically, Rb also inhibits apoptosis, which would seem to oppose its tumor suppressor function. Further, most human cancer cells inactivate Rb by hyperphosphorylation and demonstrate increased proliferative capacity but not high levels of apoptosis. As a potential explanation for these findings, we show here that the tumor suppressor and antiapoptotic functions of Rb are regulated by distinct phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation of sites in the C terminus occurs efficiently every cell cycle and regulates proliferation. Phosphorylation of Ser567 is inefficient and does not occur during the normal cell cycle. However, high cyclin-dependent kinase activity promotes phosphorylation of Ser567 by inducing an intramolecular interaction that leads to release of E2F, degradation of Rb, and susceptibility to apoptosis. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser567 may limit excessive proliferation by triggering cell death under hyperproliferative conditions. These findings suggest that the antiproliferative and antiapoptotic activities of Rb may represent complementary functions that work in concert to maintain the proliferation rate of cells within certain limits. As a survival strategy, some cancer cells may exploit this dual role of Rb by phosphorylating sites that regulate tumor suppression but avoiding phosphorylation of Ser567 and consequent apoptotic stimulus.

As a survival strategy, some cancer cells may exploit this dual role of Rb by phosphorylating sites that regulate tumor suppression but avoiding phosphorylation of Ser567 and consequent apoptotic stimulus. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) is involved in regulating a variety of cellular functions, including cell division, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis (1Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2545-2562Crossref Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Rb in turn is regulated by phosphorylation; it is active when hypophosphorylated and inactive when hyperphosphorylated (2Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Rb is phosphorylated by cyclin D- then cyclin E-associated kinases as cells progress from early G1 into S phase, and this sequential phosphorylation is necessary for complete hyperphosphorylation of Rb (3Lundberg A.S.

Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Some sites appear to regulate distinct biochemical activities. For example, Ser807 and Ser811 regulate binding of Rb to c-Abl (7Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), whereas Thr821 and Thr826 regulate binding to LXCXE proteins (7Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Binding to E2F is more complex and appears to be regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites (8Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 9Brown V.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of sites in the C terminus triggers a conformational change that allows phosphorylation of Ser567, which then leads to disruption of the A-B pocket and release of E2F (5Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Sante A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, it remains unclear whether specific phosphorylation sites govern distinct physiologic functions (such as cell proliferation and apoptosis) and whether specific sites are preferentially phosphorylated in cancer cells.The Rb pathway is thought to be disrupted in virtually all cancers (10Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar), and the tumor suppressor activity of Rb derives at least in part from its ability to inhibit cell transit from G1 into S phase (11Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, Rb also inhibits apoptosis, which would seem to oppose its tumor suppressor activity. The distinct phenotypes of Rb(+) cancer cells versus Rb(-) cancer cells may provide insight into this apparent paradox of Rb function. Rb(+) cancers in which the Rb protein is inhibited by hyperphosphorylation (including most adult solid tumors) are generally slow growing, resistant to apoptosis, and insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation (12Shackney S.E. Shankey T.V. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rb(-) cancers in which Rb is genetically disrupted (such as retinoblastoma and small cell lung cancer) usually have a high rate of both proliferation and apoptosis and are generally sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation (12Shackney S.E. Shankey T.V. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, in cultured cells and mouse models, genetic inactivation of Rb leads to increased cell proliferation and apoptosis (13Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y. Bradley A. Li W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Berry D.E. Lu Y. Schmidt B. Fallon P.G. O'Connell C. Hu S.X. Xu H.J. Blanck G.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 351-354PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of Rb (e.g. as a result of p16ink4a inactivation) generally does not have this effect (21Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Lee K.H. Carrasco D. Castrillon D.H. Aguirre A.J. Wu E.A. Horner J.W. DePinho R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for these findings is that the tumor suppressor functions of Rb (such as cell cycle inhibition) may be regulated by different phosphorylation events than is the antiapoptotic activity. In Rb(-) cancers, both proliferation and apoptosis may proceed unchecked, whereas in Rb(+) cancers, the tumor suppressor activity may be inhibited while keeping the antiapoptotic function intact.To test this hypothesis, we analyzed Rb phosphorylation in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. These Rb(+) cells are deficient for p16ink4a, which leads to deregulation of cyclin d-CDK4 and constitutive phosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous Rb (3Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 22Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11362-11370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further, reintroduction of p16ink4a into these cells leads to accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb and G1 arrest. This model allowed Rb phosphorylation sites to be studied in vivo without overexpressing cyclins or CDKs. We found that cell cycle regulation by Rb was controlled by multiple phosphorylation sites in the C terminus in a cumulative manner. In contrast, a distinct phosphorylation site (Ser567) that regulates binding to E2F was not phosphorylated every cell cycle but was only phosphorylated in the presence of high CDK2 activity. Phosphorylation of Ser567 led to inactivation and degradation of Rb and release of E2F. An Rb mutant that prevented phosphorylation of Ser567 had no effect on cell cycle progression or senescence in U2OS cells, but it inhibited proliferation and apoptosis in cells with high E2F1 levels and high CDK2 activity. These results suggest that the tumor suppressor and antiapoptotic functions of Rb may be regulated by distinct mechanisms and that Ser567 may be a sentinel for hyperproliferative conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Expression vectors for most Rb constructs were previously described (5Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Sante A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

RbΔ10 is a hemagglutinin-tagged full-length Rb mutant with the substitution of 10 phosphorylation sites (gift from J. Bartek) (24Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Santoni-Rugiu E. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RbΔ9 is a full-length Rb mutant with the substitution of nine phosphorylation sites (gift of E. Knudsen) (8Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).G-RbΔ780 is a Ser-to-Ala substitution at Ser780 generated from the corresponding wild type construct by site-directed mutagenesis using the Mutagene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). G-AΔ567 and G-AΔ568 were generated by digesting G-RbΔ567 and G-RbΔ568, respectively, with BamHI and BglII, and the domain A fragments were cloned into pM2 at the BamHI site. G-BC was created by digesting G-Rb-LP with BamHI and BglII and cloning the fragment corresponding to domain B and the C terminus (amino acids 612–928) into pM2 at the BamHI site. Similarly, G-BCΔ4 and G-BC7 were generated from G-RbLPΔ4 and PSM-7LP. Constructs were generated for co-expression of GFP by digesting the Rb fragments from their pM2 vector with EcoRI and XbaI and inserting the fragment into the pCMS-EGFP vector (Clontech). GST-A was generated by digesting G-Rb with BamHI and BglII and cloning the fragment into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Similarly, GST-AΔ567 and GST-AΔ568 were generated from G-RbΔ567 and G-RbΔ568. Plasmids were checked for correct DNA sequence.Cell Culture—U2OS cells, Rat2/E2F1-DP1-inducible cells (gift from W. Lee), and murine embryo fibroblasts lacking all three pocket proteins (gift from T. Jacks) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For Rat2/E2F1-DP1 cells, G418 (250 μg/ml) and tetracyclin (1 μg/ml) were added to the media. E2F and DP1 were induced by the removal of tetracycline for 2 days. Apoptosis was enhanced by reducing the fetal bovine serum to 0.5%.Western Blot and Immunoprecipitations—Western blots were performed as previously described (5Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Sante A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) using the indicated primary antibodies: anti-Rb (sc102; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Rb-phospho-Ser780 and anti-Rb-phospho-Ser807/Ser811 (Cell Signaling), and anti-Gal4 and anti-LexA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An antibody that recognizes Rb phosphorylated at Ser567 was created for our laboratory by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. by immunizing rabbits with a peptide derived from the Rb sequence spanning Ser567 (CAWLSD-SPLFDL) with or without phosphorylation at Ser567. Phosphospecific antibodies were purified using an affinity column containing the unphosphorylated peptide. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed high affinity antibody against the phosphorylated peptide (dilution titer 1:56,870 versus 1:100). Secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) were applied, and immunoreactivity was detected by ECL chemiluminescence reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (5Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Sante A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in C33A cells using the indicated expression vectors (10 μg for Rb vectors and 3 μg for cyclin E). 10% of the lysate was used for direct Western blot, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated with agarose beads conjugated to monoclonal anti-Gal4 or anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot as above using anti-LexA or anti-Gal4 primary antibodies.Transcriptional Repression Assays—U2OS cells (106) were transfected with 4 μg of DNA, including the indicated expression vectors and a cyclin E promoter-luciferase reporter construct (gift from R. Weinberg). Empty expression vectors were included in control assays. Lysates were collected after 48 h in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100), and the protein concentrations were normalized. A reaction mixture was generated containing a final concentration of 10 mm Mg(Oac)2, 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8, 2 mm ATP. Luciferin (100 μl of 1 mm) was added, and the luciferase activity was measured by the luminometer.BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—U20S cells (105) were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated pCMV-GFP expression vectors on coverslips. At the indicated time points, the cells were labeled with BrdUrd (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:1000 dilution. After 11 h, cells were rinsed with 1× PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and then probed with an anti-BrdUrd antibody (PharMingen) at a 1:200 dilution in immunofluorescence buffer (PBS, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 μg/ml DNase) for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. After washing the coverslips twice with 1 ml/well PBS, the cells were incubated with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. Cells were stained with Hoechst reagent and mounted onto slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.Flow Cytometry—U2OS cells (2× 106) were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated expression vectors. GFP was co-expressed by using the pCMV-EGFP construct or by co-transfecting expression vectors for GFP and the target protein at a 1:5 ratio. At the indicated time points, cells were collected and fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h, and then stained with a propidium iodide solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA pH 7.4, 0.05 mg/ml RNase A, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS, pH 7.4). Flow cytometry was performed on GFP-positive cells using the FACSCalibur machine, and data analysis was performed with Cell Quest software. Experiments with Rat2/E2F1-DP1 cells were performed in a similar fashion, except that the expression vectors were co-transfected with a puromycin resistance plasmid and selected for 3 days in media containing puromycin (0.8 μg/ml). To trigger apoptosis in some cells, tetracycline was removed from the media to induce expression of E2F1 and DP1, and serum was reduced to 0.5%. Cells were collected 48 h later, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry.Colony Formation and Flat Cell Assays—U2OS cells (2× 106) were grown on 100-mm plates and transfected with the indicated expression vectors (10–16 μg of target DNA, 1–2 μg of puromycin resistance plasmid and carrier DNA). Puromycin (0.8 μg/ml) was added after 24 h, and medium was changed every 3 days until colonies grew out (usually within 2–3 weeks). Cells were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol and stained with 0.4% crystal violet and 20% ethanol, and colonies were counted in a blinded fashion. Flat cell assays were performed in the same manner, except that flat cells (defined as at least 10 times greater diameter than a normal U2OS cell) were counted in 10–20 fields by a masked examiner under a 10× objective using the inverted microscope. To analyze senescence-associated β-galactosidase, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 3–5 min, washed with PBS, placed in solution containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mm magnesium chloride in 40 mm citric/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and incubated overnight at 37 °C without CO2. Positive cells demonstrated blue staining.In Vitro Phosphorylation—In vitro phosphorylation experiments were performed as previously described (5Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Sante A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). GST-tagged cyclin E-CDK2 was obtained from baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells. In vitro phosphorylation reactions were performed at room temperature for the indicated time periods in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 150 μm ATP, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 500 ng of the indicated Rb fragments. Phosphorylation products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, detected by autoradiography, and quantitated by densitometry. Phosphorylation of Ser567 was also analyzed by expressing the indicated Rb fragments in BL21 cells (Stratagene). Proteins were purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences), phosphorylated using recombinant cyclin E-CDK2 as above, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot using the anti-Rb-phospho-Ser567 antibody (1:500 dilution).Viability Assays—Viability assays were performed essentially as previously described (25Harbour J.W. Worley L. Ma D. Cohen M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2002; 120: 1341-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) except that Rat2/E2F1-DP1 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors along with a puromycin resistance plasmid, selected for 72 h in media containing puromycin, trypsinized, and plated into 96-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, tetracyclin was removed from the media, and serum was reduced to 0.5% in some cells for 48 h to induce E2F/DP1 expression and promote apoptosis. A methanethiosulfonate assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Briefly, 20 μl of methanethiosulfonate and phenazine methosulfate solution was added to each well, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 h, and absorbance was measured at 496 nm using a plate reader.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—U2OS cells (5 × 104) were plated on coverslips and transfected with 1 μg each of expression vectors for cyclin D and cyclin E, as indicated. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in methanol for 5 min at -20 °C, and then treated with 2% fish gelatin for 1 h. Anti-Rb-phospho-Ser567, anti-Rb-phospho-Ser780, or anti-Rb-phospho-Ser807/Ser811 (1:50 dilution) was applied for 1 h. As a control, some cells were analyzed with anti-Rb-phospho-Ser567 pretreated with the Rb Ser567 peptide described above (1 μg of antibody to 3 μg of peptide). Cells were then washed with PBS, treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h, and then washed with PBS.

Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 23Ashizawa S. Nishizawa H. Yamada M. Higashi H. Kondo T. Ozawa H. Kakita A. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11362-11370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we found that ectopic Rb was hyperphosphorylated when expressed in U2OS cells (Fig. 1A). Since Rb represses expression of cyclin E and other genes involved in S phase entry (26Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the ability of ectopic Rb to repress a cyclin E promoter linked to a luciferase reporter. Expression of p16ink4a, which causes an accumulation of hypophosphorylated endogenous Rb, resulted in strong repression of the cyclin E promoter (Fig. 1B). In contrast, ectopic Rb demonstrated minimal repressor activity. By flow cytometry, expression of p16ink4a caused cells to accumulate with 2N DNA content, consistent with G1 arrest, whereas the DNA content of cells expressing Rb did not differ from untransfected cells or cells expressing an inactive fragment of Rb (Fig. 2A). BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed to further analyze the ability of ectopic Rb to prevent S phase entry. By 72 h after transfection, only 21% of cells expressing p16ink4a had incorporated BrdUrd, compared with 72% of cells expressing ectopic Rb (Fig. 2B). In colony formation assays, expression of p16ink4a reduced the number of colonies by about 90%, whereas Rb reduced colonies by only about 35% (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that ectopic Rb is phosphorylated sufficiently in U2OS cells to block its tumor suppressor activity. Hence, we were able to use these cells to analyze the physiologic role of individual CDK phosphorylation sites by expression of Rb phosphorylation site mutants without overexpressing a cyclin (Fig. 1C).Fig. 2Tumor suppressor activity of Rb is regulated by C-terminal phosphorylation sites.A, flow cytometry experiments in U2OS cells expressing the indicated constructs at 24, 48, and 60 h after transfection. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed for DNA content. B, BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed in U2OS cells expressing the indicated constructs at 24, 48, or 72 h after transfection. For clarity, the Rb mutants with substitution of up to four C-terminal phosphorylation sites are shown separately in the right panel. C, colony formation assays were performed in U2OS cells expressing the indicated constructs. Cells were selected in 0.8 μg/ml puromycin, and colonies were counted after 2–3 weeks. D, flat cell assays were performed in U2OS cells expressing the indicated constructs. Flat cells were counted with an inverted microscope. Inset, flat cells (large arrow) were at least 10 times larger in diameter than regular U2OS cells (small arrow) and stained for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (blue). Control cells were transfected with an inactive fragment of Rb containing domain A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In colony formation assays (Fig. 2C), BrdUrd incorporation assays, and flow cytometry (data not shown), the large pocket fragment of Rb (amino acids 379–928) demonstrated no greater activity than full-length Rb. Thus, the six potential phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region did not appear to be required for regulation of Rb activity. Other investigators have also found that the N terminus was not essential for Rb regulation (8Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Chow K.N. Starostik P. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation sites in the C terminus (amino acids 792–928) have been strongly implicated in regulating Rb activity. Ser807 and Ser811 regulate binding to c-Abl, Thr821 and Thr826 regulate binding to LXCXE proteins such as HDAC, and all four of these sites cooperate to regulate active transcriptional repression by Rb (5Harbour J.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Ser780 is a cyclin d-specific site that also has been implicated in regulating Rb activity early in G1 (8Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki T.I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y.

Thus, we initially focused our attention on these C-terminal phosphorylation sites.CDK Sites in the Rb Large Pocket Cooperate to Regulate Cell Cycle Inhibition—Phosphorylation sites were first examined for their role in cell cycle regulation. Flow cytometry was performed at 24, 48, and 60 h after transfection of the phosphorylation site mutants (Fig. 2A). As mentioned above, expression of wild-type Rb did not alter the cell profile compared with controls. RbΔ780 and RbΔ2S (containing mutations at Ser807 and Ser811) had no significant effect on cell cycle profile at 24 h, but by 48 h, these mutants caused an increase in cells with 4N DNA content, consistent with a delay in G2/M phase. The effect was stronger with the double site mutant RbΔ2S than the single site mutant RbΔ780, suggesting a possible cumulative effect. RbΔ9 and RbΔ10, which contain mutations of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites as well as additional sites within the large pocket (e.g. Ser608 and Ser12 in the spacer region) (8Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 24Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Santoni-Rugiu E. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), both induced an accumulation of cells with 2N DNA content through 48 h, consistent with G1 arrest. Cells expressing these constructs later began to enter S phase, which was previously shown to be caused by persistent CDK2 activity in the absence of p16ink4a (24Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Santoni-Rugiu E. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Folate-dependent enzymes are found in the mitochondria as well as the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Isozymes of certain folate-dependent enzymes are present in both compartments, and a number of observations demonstrated that the folate-dependent pathways in mitochondria contribute to total cellular folate metabolism. For example, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, encoded by two different nuclear genes, is located in each compartment where it catalyzes the interconversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) 1The abbreviations used are: THF, tetrahydrofolate; DC, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase; DCS, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase-synthetase;1The abbreviations used are: THF, tetrahydrofolate; DC, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase; DCS, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase-synthetase; with glycine and methylenetetrahydrofolate. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line that is missing mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (glyA) was shown to be a glycine auxotroph despite the fact that it retains the cytoplasmic isoform of the enzyme (1Chasin L.A. Feldman A. Konstam M. Urlaub G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A similar phenotype was seen in the auxB1 mutant cell line that lacks the ability to make folate polyglutamates. Replacing the missing folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase in the cytoplasm of this cell line reverses the requirement for thymidine and purines, but the enzyme must be targeted to mitochondria to overcome its requirement for glycine (2Garrow T.A.

The formate is then recaptured as an important source of active one-carbon units by the activities of the cytoplasmic DCS (7Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R.

This bifunctional enzyme was shown to have Mg2+ and inorganic phosphate-dependent methyleneTHF dehydrogenase activity (11Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9509-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its kinetic properties, NMDMC was proposed to have derived from an NADP+-dependent precursor (17Yang X-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Pawelek P.D. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). More recent evidence comparing the nucleotide sequence of the synthetase domain of the cytoplasmic DCS with the sequence of the 3′-untranslated region of the NMDMC cDNA supported the conclusion that its putative precursor was in fact an NADP+-dependent DCS (19Patel H. Christensen K.E. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 403: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The metabolic advantage for the mitochondrial NMDMC enzyme to lose its synthetase activity is not obvious. This feature raises the question as to whether mammalian cells expressing the NMDMC enzyme export formate from their mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and if so, what is the mechanism for the generation of formate?Although the metabolic role of the NMDMC is not well understood, deletion of the gene in mice has been shown to be embryonic lethal beyond E13.5 (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At E12.5, the embryos appear smaller and pale when compared with their wild type littermates. They also demonstrate a failure of the liver to develop and to take over hematopoiesis from the yolk sac, despite the presence of hematopoietic precursor cells (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It was suggested earlier that the role of the enzyme was to provide formylTHF for the production of formylmethionyl-tRNA used in mitochondrial protein synthesis or to produce one-carbon units for purine synthesis (15Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1988; 155: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gene deletion studies indicated that the role of formylTHF in protein synthesis is not essential in yeast (21Li Y. Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2886-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and examination of an NMDMC null mouse cell line indicated that mitochondrial protein synthesis is also not impaired when compared with a wild type control (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this report, we establish and characterize immortalized cell lines and examine their nutritional requirements to further characterize the metabolic consequences caused by inactivation of the nmdmc gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEmbryonic Fibroblast Cell Lines—The targeted inactivation of NMDMC in ES cells and the generation of NMDMC knockout mice were described previously (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice were generated from two independently targeted ES cells lines. To obtain primary embryonic fibroblast cell lines, E9.5 and E11.5 embryos were isolated from matings of heterozygous mice. Embryos were minced and trypsinized for 10–30 min. at 37 °C, and single cell suspensions were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10–15% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with 1× non-essential amino acids, 1× glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), as well as 50 μg/ml uridine (Sigma). This complete medium was supplemented with 100 μm sodium formate obtained from Sigma in all studies where formate was not a variable. Spontaneously immortalized cells (SF) were obtained by continuous passage in culture. Transformed cells (IF) were derived by infection of primary cultures with a recombinant retrovirus expressing the SV40 large T antigen for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Following infection, medium containing serum was added to the cells to obtain a final concentration of 15% fetal bovine serum. DNA was isolated from embryonic fibroblast cell lines using the Qiagen genomic DNA purification kit. Genotypes of embryos and cell lines were determined by Southern blot analysis as described previously (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The presence of the sequence encoding SV40 large T antigen in transformed cells was confirmed by PCR. Genomic DNA from fibroblasts (100 ng) was used with PCR primers TAgL, 5′-AAGTTCAGCCTGTCCAAG-3′, and TAgR, 5′-GTTTGCCACCTGGGTTAAG-3′, to amplify a 638-bp fragment of the SV40 large T antigen coding region. PCR conditions were as follows: 200 nm each of 5′- and 3′-primers, 250 μm dNTPS, 1× Qiagen Taq buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Qiagen HotStar Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 μl with 1 cycle at 95 °C for 15 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.Rho 0 Cell Line—The ρ0 cell and the 143B parent cell line from which it was derived were generous gifts from Dr. Eric Shoubridge. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1× glutamine, and 50 μg/ml uridine.Mitochondrial Staining with Mitotracker Mitochondrion-selective Probes—Medium containing Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) in a range of 10–500 nm was added to cells grown on tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 – 45 min. After incubation, the medium containing the Mitotracker dye was replaced with fresh medium, and the stained cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy.Cell Growth Studies—The various cell lines used in these experiments were grown in defined medium that resembled Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium except that glycine, serine, and methionine were added separately so that one or more of these amino acids could be omitted to determine the nutritional requirements of cell lines. Our standard medium also contained 1× glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μg/ml uridine, 100 μm sodium formate, and 1× ITS-S (insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite, and ethanolamine) from Invitrogen. Formate was omitted when required. Another component of the medium, dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), was further dialyzed (50 ml against 2 liters of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2) for 16 h with a change of buffer halfway during the dialysis. The cells were adapted to the redialyzed fetal bovine serum in a four-step process. Cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates, and 24 h later, the medium was replaced with medium lacking glycine, serine, methionine, or formate. The cells were counted by the trypan blue exclusion method at 24-h intervals.Precursor Incorporation into DNA—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown for 24 h in defined medium but with glycine, serine, or formate at 10% of the normal concentration. The growth medium was changed with the addition of 300 μl of medium with 2 × 106 cpm of [1-14C]glycine (97 μm, 32 mCi/mmol); [2-14C]glycine, (90 μm, 31mCi/mmol); [3-14C]serine (100 μm, 32 mCi/mmol); or [14C]formate (67 μm, 47.5 mCi/mmol) per well. As a control for DNA synthesis, the cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (40 μm, 25 Ci/mmol). In all cases, experiments are compared where the difference in uptake of thymidine was ≤10% to ensure equal rates of cell growth. The cells were allowed to grow for 24 h in the presence of each radiolabeled precursor (Amersham Biosciences and Moravek Biochemicals) and were washed twice with 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. They were lysed directly in the 24-well plates upon addition of a proteinase K solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K) for 1 h with moderate shaking at 37 °C. The lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and extracted twice with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The super-natants were precipitated with one volume of isopropanol followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0. The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane using a Bio-Rad slot-blot apparatus and washed three times with 200 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0. Each individual sample was cut out from the membrane with a sterile blade and placed into a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of Scintisafe (Fisher). This experiment was done in triplicate per cell line per condition, and the values for the amount of radioactivity incorporated into DNA, determined by liquid scintillation counting, were averaged.Precursor Incorporation into Bases—Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, grown, and DNA isolated as described for the precursor incorporation into DNA. The cells were labeled in the presence of 2 ml of medium containing 4 × 106 cpm of the respective [1-14C]glycine (58 μm, 17 mCi/mmol); [2-14C]glycine (58 μm, 17 mCi/mmol); [3-14C]serine (58.5 μm, 17 mCi/mmol); or [14C]formate (27.5 μm, 36 mCi/mmol). The DNA pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and transferred to 200-μl PCR tubes containing 30 μg of single-stranded salmon sperm DNA. Perchloric acid (2 μl of 7.5N) was added to each sample, and the DNA was subjected to hydrolysis at 105 °C for 40 min. The hydrolyzed DNA samples were separated into their individual bases by ascending paper chromatography, using a solvent consisting of isopropanol:HCl:H2O (130:33:37). An equimolar mixture of the four bases of DNA was included in each chromatogram to serve as markers. The chromatograms were dried in a fume hood and examined under short wave UV light, and each spot (representing the individual bases) was marked with a pencil. The spots were carefully cut out and placed in a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of Scintisafe. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into each base was determined by liquid scintillation counting. This experiment was done in duplicate per cell line per condition, and the values were averaged.Supplementation of Mouse Diet with Glycine—A custom research diet TD 02123 (Harlan Teklad) was formulated that added 6% glycine (60 g/kg) to the standard rodent diet 2018 that contains 0.8% glycine (Harlan Teklad). Both female and male heterozygous mice were started on the custom research diet 1 week before the first attempt at mating. Supplementation was continued until pregnant females were sacrificed. Embryos were isolated from females, phenotypes were recorded, and yolk sacs were collected for genotypic analysis. As a control, embryos from matings of heterozygous mice fed on the standard rodent diet (2018) were also analyzed. Genotypes of embryos were determined as described previously (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Injection of Pregnant Females with Sodium Formate—Pregnant dams on the standard mouse diet were injected daily with 100 μg/g of body weight of sodium formate in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, from day E4.5 through day E6.5 with the dose increased to 200 μg/g of body weight from E7.5 through E13.5. Mice were euthanized, embryos were isolated, phenotypes were recorded, and yolk sacs were collected for genotypic analysis as described previously (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L.

Primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from E9.5 and E11.5 embryos isolated from the matings of nmdmc(+/-) mice were spontaneously immortalized (SF cells) or transformed with the SV40 Large T Antigen (IF cells), and genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis using the E2/161 probe as described previously (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the probe hybridizes to a single 5-kb DNA fragment in BamH1 digests of DNA from wild type embryonic fibroblasts and to an 11-kb fragment in digests from null mutant embryonic fibroblasts. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B) confirmed the absence of NMDMC mRNA in null mutant cells. Null mutant fibroblasts characterized in earlier experiments were found to contain no detectable NMDMC enzyme activity (20Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Analysis of Mitochondria—We previously showed that mitochondria of nmdmc(-/-) fibroblasts are structurally intact by staining with the mitochondrion-selective dye, Mitotracker Green FM, which is taken up by mitochondria independent of a membrane potential. As a further measure of mitochondrial function, we stained fibroblasts with Mitotracker Red CMXRos, which requires a mitochondrial membrane potential for uptake. There are no differences in the staining between wild type and null mutant fibroblasts even at the very low (10 nm) concentrations of dye used (Fig. 2). Because of the location of the NMDMC enzyme in mitochondria and the possibility that the nmdmc(-/-) cells would show a mitochondrial defect, we wanted to have a mitochondrially impaired cell line as a comparison for nutritional studies involving serine and glycine. We used ρ0 cells that lack mitochondrial DNA (22King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and thus cannot produce the proteins of the respiratory chain but retain a small mitochondrial membrane potential (23Buchet K Godinot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22983-22989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mitochondria of these cells stain with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (24Minamikawa T. Sriratana A. Williams D.A. Bowser D.N. Hill J.S. Nagley P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2419-2430PubMed Google Scholar), which we also observed in this study (not shown).Fig. 2Embryonic fibroblasts stained with Mitotracker Red CMXRos to detect mitochondria with an intact membrane potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nutritional Requirements for NMDMC Null Mutant Fibroblasts—A series of growth experiments were performed on the NMDMC null mutant and wild type immortalized fibroblasts to evaluate their requirement for one-carbon precursors and products of folate-dependent metabolism. These fibroblasts, adapted for growth in dialyzed serum and defined medium, showed methionine dependence in that cell growth was much reduced by the replacement of methionine by homocysteine (not shown). This is not unexpected since many tumor and immortalized mammalian cells show a reduced or absent ability to replace methionine with homocysteine in the growth medium (25Hoffman R.M. In Vitro. 1982; 18: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Tang B. Li Y.N. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5543-5547PubMed Google Scholar). The nmdmc(-/-) cells are able to grow well in the absence of serine (not shown) but are absolute glycine auxotrophs (Fig. 3, A and B). Growth in glycine-free medium was not stimulated by the addition of δ-aminolevulinic acid, which might partially spare the requirement for glycine used in heme synthesis (Fig. 3B). All nmdmc(-/-) cell lines obtained from mice derived from two independently targeted ES cells required glycine for growth (Table I), which could not be reversed with added hypoxanthine or formate (Fig. 3B). However, in complete medium containing redialyzed serum, formate and hypoxanthine stimulate the growth of nmdmc(-/-) but not wild type cells, although neither is absolutely essential (Fig. 3, C and D). Addition of thymidine had no effect on cell growth.Fig. 3Growth of fibroblasts in defined medium containing 10% redialyzed fetal bovine serum.

This cell line, as well as its parent cell line, are methionine-dependent as expected, and the replacement of methionine with homocysteine did not support the growth of either. However, despite the fact that ρ0 cells lack mitochondrial DNA and thus contain non-respiring mitochondria, they grow equally well on complete and glycine-minus media (not shown).One-carbon Donor Incorporation into the DNA of Fibroblasts—As a preliminary approach to understanding the folate metabolism of these cells, we performed a series of radiolabeling experiments that measured the incorporation of [14C]-labeled glycine, serine, and formate into the total DNA of exponentially growing nmdmc(-/-) cells, using wild type cells under identical conditions for comparison. Thymidine incorporation was measured in parallel and was equivalent in null and wild type cells. The incorporation of [1-14C]glycine and [2-14C]glycine into DNA was identical for both wild type and null mutant cells (Fig. 4). A major difference is seen in the incorporation of [14C]formate when compared with [3-14C]serine into total DNA of wild type and mutant cell lines. Under the conditions used in these experiments, more radiolabel is incorporated from serine than from formate in the wild type cells, and the mutant cell line incorporates much higher amounts of label from formate than from serine (Fig. 4). This difference, shown as a ratio of radioactivity (formate/serine) in Table I, is consistent with all the wild type and mutant cell lines examined. As shown in Table II, the incorporation of label from serine into adenine and guanine bases in a similar experiment is much higher for the wild type cell than for the mutant, whereas the incorporation of formate is significantly less in the wild type than in the mutant cells (Table II). The radiolabeling of ρ0 cells under the same conditions does not show this difference, suggesting that its folate-dependent pathways are not affected.Fig. 4Incorporation of radiolabeled one-carbon donors into total DNA of wild type and mutant fibroblasts.Vertical bars, from the left, represent cpm ± S.D. incorporated into DNA of wild type and null mutant fibroblasts from [1-14C]glycine, [2-14C]glycine, [3-14C]serine, and [14C]formate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIIncorporation of radiolabeled precursors into the bases of DNA Following a 24-h incubation of cells with the one-carbon donors [3-14C] serine and [14C] formate, radioactivity was measured in thymidine, adenine, and guanine of isolated DNA.

Table III shows that out of a total of 73 embryos, dietary glycine supplementation does not reduce the numbers of resorbed fetuses or increase the viability of (-/-) embryos at E16.5 or even at E14.5.

In this study, we report for the first time a phospholipase complex composed of PLC-γ1 and phospholipase D2 (PLD2). PLC-γ1 is co-immunoprecipitated with PLD2 in COS-7 cells. The results of in vitro binding analysis and co-immunoprecipitation analysis in COS-7 cells show that the Src homology (SH) 3 domain of PLC-γ1 binds to the proline-rich motif within the Phox homology (PX) domain of PLD2. The interaction between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 is EGF stimulation-dependent and potentiates EGF-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation and Ca2+increase. Mutating Pro-145 and Pro-148 within the PX domain of PLD2 to leucines disrupts the interaction between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 and fails to potentiate EGF-induced IP3 formation and Ca2+ increase. However, neither PLD2 wild type nor PLD2 mutant affects the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1.

PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and one product of this hydrolysis, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), mobilizes Ca2+ from the intracellular stores, whereas the other product of the hydrolysis, 1,2-diacylglycerol, activates protein kinase C (PKC) (5Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). Until recently, 11 mammalian PLC isozymes have been identified and classified into four types (6Rhee S.G. Suh P.-G.

PLC-γ, unlike the other PLC isozymes, has Src homology (SH) domains: two SH2 and one SH3 domains (9Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 are important for binding to the EGF receptor and for phosphorylation by the receptor, which is required for activation (13Gergel J.R. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Zhu G.

However, little is known about how phosphorylated PLC-γ1 undergoes further processes such as targeting to its PIP2 substrate molecules in the membrane. Phospholipase D is a membrane-associated enzyme, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline (16Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

PA has been shown to be an intracellular lipid second messenger involved in many physiological events such as the promotion of mitogenesis, the secretory process, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization (17Jones D.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and PKC has been suggested to be a major mediator of PLD stimulation (22Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.-A.

Moreover, PLD requires PIP2 for its enzymatic activity (23Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Two types of mammalian PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, have been reported, which share 55% identity (24Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B.

It has been reported that the EGF receptor is highly enriched in the plasma membrane substructure, caveolae (27Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Bae S.S. Park M.H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PLD isozymes exist both in the caveolae, and the cellular distribution of PLD2, in particular, is largely restricted to caveolae (25Xu L. Shen Y. Joseph T. Bryant A. Luo J.-O. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Kim J.H. Han J.M. Lee S. Kim Y. Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3763-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PIP2, the substrate of PLC-γ1 and the activator of PLD, is also highly enriched in caveolae (31Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The communication between PLC-γ1 and PLD has been questioned. PKC, a downstream signaling molecule of PLC-γ1, is required for PLD activation (26Hornia A. Lu Z. Sukezane T. Zhong M. Joseph T. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell.

These reports suggest that the two phospholipases (PLC-γ1 and PLD2) may affect each other dynamically by changing the membrane phospholipids. Nevertheless, the direct relationship between these phospholipases in cells has not been studied. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time the direct association between two signaling phospholipases, PLC-γ1 and PLD2. We suggest that their interaction is important for the proper activation of PLC-γ1 after EGF stimulation.

It has been reported that the EGF receptor, PLD2, and PIP2 are enriched in the plasma membrane substructure, caveolae, to which PLC-γ1 translocates after EGF stimulation (25Xu L. Shen Y. Joseph T.

PIP2, the substrate of PLC-γ1, was reported to be a cofactor of PLD activation (16Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We checked the possibility of the existence of PIP2-utilizing phospholipases in a complex. The major isozyme of PLD in COS-7 cells is PLD2, and PLC-γ1 was co-immunoprecipitated with PLD2 from COS-7 cells growing in media containing 10% bovine calf serum (Fig.1A). However, because the amount of PLD2 in COS-7 cells is very small, the co-immunoprecipitation could be detected after a long time exposure to a film. By transfecting PLD2 into COS-7 cells, the co-immunoprecipitation of PLC-γ1 with PLD2 was more easily detected (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that two phospholipases exist in a complex. It could be deduced from previous reports that EGF stimulation recruits PLC-γ1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where PLD2 is enriched (25Xu L. Shen Y. Joseph T. Bryant A. Luo J.-O. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Jang I.-H. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Bae S.S. Park M.H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We observed that increasing the amount of PLD2 in COS-7 cells resulted in increasing EGF-induced PLC-γ1 activity, but PLD2 didn't affect PLC-γ1 activity without EGF stimulation or the time course of PLC-γ1 activity after EGF stimulation (Fig.2, A and B). We tested whether the interaction between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 is dependent on EGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2C, serum starvation abolishes the interaction of PLC-γ1 with PLD2, but as soon as cells were stimulated with EGF, PLC-γ1 binds to PLD2 and then dissociates from PLD2. The interaction time course correlates with the activity time course of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the interaction of PLC-γ1 with PLD2 may contribute to increasing EGF-induced PLC-γ1 activity. To test whether their interaction is direct or not,in vitro binding analysis was performed with purified PLC-γ1 and PLD2. Purified PLC-γ1, or PLC-β1 for comparison, was incubated with purified PLD2 and immunoprecipitated with an anti-PLD antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, PLC-γ1, but not PLC-β1, was precipitated by PLD2. These results indicate that PLC-γ1 binds directly to PLD2. The major differences between PLC-γ1 and PLC-β1 lie in the linker region between the X and Y domains. PLC-γ1 has two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain, but PLC-β1 has no SH domain (Fig. 3A). To identify which domain of PLC-γ1 is responsible for the interaction with PLD2,in vitro binding analysis was performed with purified PLD2 and the GST fusion SH domains of PLC-γ1. As shown in Fig.3C, PLD2 bound to GST-SH223 and GST-SH3 but not to GST-SH2N or GST-SH2C. This result indicates that the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 interacts with PLD2. For further confirmation, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed in cells growing in media containing 10% bovine calf serum. PLD2 was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with PLC-γ1 wild type or PLC-γ1 SH3 domain deletion mutant and immunoprecipitated with an anti-PLD antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, PLC-γ1 wild type co-immunoprecipitated with PLD2, whereas the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain deletion mutant did not. These results indicate that the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 is responsible for the interaction with PLD2. To identify the region of PLD2 responsible for the interaction with PLC-γ1, we constructed GST fusion PLD2 fragments as shown in Fig.4A (40Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.-J. Lee J.S. Ha S.H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 4Bshows the result of in vitro binding analysis with purified PLC-γ1 and GST fusion PLD2 fragments. PLC-γ1 was found to bind to the F1 fragment (residues 1–314) of PLD2. For further confirmation, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed. COS-7 cells were transfected with the empty vector, PLD2 wild type, or the PLD2 deletion mutant (Δ1–308), and immunoprecipitated with an anti-PLD antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, PLC-γ1 was co-immunoprecipitated with PLD2 wild type but not with the PLD2 deletion mutant (Δ1–308). These results indicate that the N-terminal 1–308 residues of PLD2 are important for interaction with PLC-γ1. To determine the binding region more precisely, we prepared four GST fusion C-terminally deleted constructs of the PLD2 F1 fragment (Fig. 4A). In vitro binding analysis with purified PLC-γ1 and each GST fusion construct showed that PLC-γ1 binds to f1, f1-1, and f1-2 but not to f1-3 or f1-4, indicating that the residues from 114 to 166 of PLD2 are responsible for the interaction (Fig. 4D). In the sequence from 114 to 166 of PLD2, there is a proline-rich motif (PSLP: residues 145–148) that can potentially interact with the SH3 domain. For confirmation, two proline residues in the PSLP motif were mutated to leucines, to produce PLD2 (P145L/P148L). This mutation did not change the expression level, the subcellular localization, or the catalytic properties of PLD2 in vitro (data not shown). COS-7 cells were transfected with the empty vector, PLD2 wild type, or PLD2 mutant. After immunoprecipitation with anti-PLD antibody and thorough washing, immune complexes were incubated with purified PLC-γ1. As shown in Fig. 4E, PLC-γ1 bound to PLD2 wild type but not to PLD2 mutant. These results strongly indicate that PLC-γ1 binds to PSLP motif within the PX domain of PLD2. It is generally known that the selectivity of the SH3 domains for their ligands is marginal (53Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the interaction between the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 and the PX domain of PLD2 was specific or not. First, we performed in vitrobinding analysis with purified PLD2 and GST fusion SH3 domain of PLC-γ1, Abl, and CrkI and found that PLD2 binds strongly to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 but not to that of Abl or CrkI (Fig.5A). Second, we performedin vitro binding analysis with purified PLC-γ1 and the GST fusion PX domain of PLD2, p40phox, and p47phox and found that PLC-γ1 binds to the PX domain of PLD2 but not to the PX domain of p40phox or p47phox (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the interaction between the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 and the PX domain of PLD2 is specific. To identify the role of their interaction in EGF signaling, EGF-induced IP3 formation and Ca2+increase were measured after transfecting PLD2 wild type or PLD2 mutant (P145L/P148L) into COS-7 cells. EGF-induced IP3 formation and [Ca2+]i increase were potentiated in PLD2 wild type-transfected cells but not in PLD2 mutant-transfected cells (Fig. 6, A and B). The basal activities of PLD2 wild type and PLD2 mutant show no difference, but the EGF-induced activity of PLD2 mutant decreasedversus PLD2 wild type, indicating that PLC-γ1 activation is crucial for PLD2 activation in these cells (Fig. 6C), and PLC-γ1 bound only to PLD2 wild type and not to mutant after EGF stimulation (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that the interaction between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 may be important for EGF-induced IP3 formation and [Ca2+]iincrease. There remained a possibility that PLD2 might affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 to potentiate IP3formation and [Ca2+]i increase. To test this possibility, we checked the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 after transfecting PLD2 wild type or PLD2 mutant (P145L/P148L) into COS-7 cells. PLD2 transfection was found to have no effect on the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (Fig.7). This result indicates that the potentiation of IP3 formation and Ca2+ increase is not due to the change of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. In this study, we report for the first time upon the phospholipase complex of PLC-γ1 and PLD2. The communication between PLC-γ1 and PLD has been questioned because EGF stimulation activates PLC-γ1 and PLD2 both and because in each signaling pathway there are common molecules such as PKC and PIP2 (22Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.-A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang I.-H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Sciorra V.A.

PIP2, the substrate of PLC-γ1, was reported to be a cofactor for PLD activation (16Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It was also reported that PLC-γ1 influenced PLD activity through PKC, suggesting that PLC-γ1 might be an upstream regulator of PLD (26Hornia A. Lu Z. Sukezane T. Zhong M. Joseph T. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hess J.A. Ji Q.-S. Carpenter G. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these were an indirect communications. In the present study, we found that PLC-γ1 binds directly to PLD2, which may provide a new perspective on the communication between PLC-γ1 and PLD. This interaction may increase the efficacy of their communication via other cellular components such as PIP2 and PKC, and the interaction itself may have an important role. In this report, we propose that PLD2 may function as an adaptor in the redistributing of PLC-γ1 to the membrane region. This is an as yet unidentified function of PLD2, and we suggest that PLD2 can function as an upstream regulator of PLC-γ1 in EGF signaling. Upon EGF stimulation, PLC-γ1 is recruited from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where EGF receptor is activated (29Jang I.-H. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Bae S.S. Park M.H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but how PLC-γ1 has access to PIP2 is not fully understood. In the recruitment of PLC-γ1, two SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 have reported to play critical roles (15Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Ji Q.-S. Mernaugh R. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26091-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After being phosphorylated at tyrosine residues, PLC-γ1 is redistributed to its substrate-enriched region. We suggest that the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 may contribute to the redistribution process. Little is known of the roles of the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain in EGF-induced PIP2 hydrolysis. Our findings suggest that the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 may increase its substrate accessibility by bringing PLC-γ1 into the vicinity of PIP2. It was also reported that a PLC-γ1 mutant lacking the SH3 domain showed reduced membrane association and activity (55Debell K.E. Stoica B.A. Veri M.-C. Baldassarre A.D. Miscia S. Graham L.J. Rellahan B.L. Ishiai M. Kurosaki T. Bonvini E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7388-7398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding partner of the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain in the membrane, however, has not been identified. We found that PLD2 binds to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1. PLD2 is a membrane protein and requires PIP2 for its activity, which means that PLD2 should be in the membrane region where PIP2 resides. Several reports show that PLD2 is mainly localized to the membrane substructure where PIP2 is enriched (25Xu L. Shen Y. Joseph T. Bryant A. Luo J.-O. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 56Czarny M. Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1439: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We suggest that PLD2 is the binding partner of the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain in its redistribution. Nevertheless, the SH3 domain may not be the only domain responsible for this redistribution, because the deletion of the SH3 domain did not result in the complete inhibition of PLC-γ1 activity (55Debell K.E. Stoica B.A. Veri M.-C. Baldassarre A.D. Miscia S. Graham L.J. Rellahan B.L. Ishiai M. Kurosaki T. Bonvini E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7388-7398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane association was also facilitated by the interaction between the C-SH2 or the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLC-γ1 and PIP3(58Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 59Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Prevention of PIP3 generation by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin or LY294002 resulted in an ∼40% decrease in PLC activity (60Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Considering our findings and those of previous studies, we suggest that the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1, together with the C-SH2 and the PH domain, play an important role in the redistribution of PLC-γ1 to increase its substrate accessibility. PLD2 has a region consisting of the PX and the PH domains whose exact roles have not been clarified. Our results demonstrate that PLC-γ1 binds directly to the PX domain of PLD2. This finding suggests that the PX domain of PLD2 serves as an adaptor for other proteins. In the 53-amino acid region responsible for PLC-γ1 binding (Fig.4D), there is a proline-rich, canonical SH3 domain binding motif. Mutating prolines in this motif to leucines abrogates interaction with PLC-γ1 (Fig. 4E). Although it cannot be said that this mutation has no effect on the conformation of PLD2 PX, it does not change the expression level, subcellular localization, or catalytic properties of PLD2 in vitro (data not shown). These results suggest that the effect of this mutation on the PLD2 structure, if any, is neither dramatic nor significant for the PLD2 function except for the PLC-γ1 interaction. Other proteins containing the SH3 domain may also use the PX domain of PLD2 as an adaptor, but it seems likely that the interaction is most specific to the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain (Fig. 5A). The specificity of the PX domains to bind PLC-γ1 has also been proven to be unique (Fig. 5B). Recently, it was reported that the PX domain of p47phox binds to its own C-terminal SH3 domain (69Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Karathanassis et al.(70Karathanassis D. Stahelin R. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C.M. Cho W. Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) suggested that p47phox-PX would have to undergo a conformational change to interact with its C-SH3 domain. However, this prediction may not fit with PLD2-PX because PLC-γ1 does not interact with the p47phox-PX (Fig. 5B). The PX domain structure of PLD2 may not be exactly the same as that of p47phox. It is also known that PX domains bind to phosphoinositides and play critical roles in the intracellular localization of a variety of cell-signaling proteins, including p47phox and p40phox (61Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because PLD binds to PIP2, requires PIP2 for enzymatic activity, and localizes in PIP2-enriched membranes (16Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 25Xu L. Shen Y. Joseph T. Bryant A. Luo J.-O. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the PX domain of PLD may exist in proximity to PIP2. Considering our findings and previous studies, we suggest that the PX domain of PLD2 contributes to increasing the substrate accessibility of PLC-γ1 by functioning as an adaptor for its SH3 domain. The mechanism of the interaction between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 is the issue at question. We found that the interaction between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 is dependent on EGF stimulation and is transient (Fig. 2C). In the COS-7 cells, it was estimated that ∼0.5% of the total PLC-γ1 translocates to the caveolae after EGF stimulation (data not shown). This increases to 1% after PLD2 transfection. The co-immunoprecipitated PLC-γ1 almost equals this percentage. Without EGF stimulation, PLC-γ1 showed no interaction with PLD2; however, after EGF stimulation, PLC-γ1 bound to PLD2, and this interaction disappeared 1 min after EGF stimulation. We observed that the activity of PLC-γ1 after EGF stimulation was highest at around the time when PLC-γ1 interacts with PLD2 (Fig. 2B). Because the overexpression of PLD2 in COS-7 cells potentiates the EGF-induced IP3 formation and [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 6, A and B), it is possible that PLD2 augments PLC-γ1 recruitment and its tyrosine phosphorylation. However, as shown in Fig. 7, PLD2 dose not affect PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels. PLD2 may contribute to bring PLC-γ1 to the proximity of PIP2, and PLC-γ1 may be redistributed to the membrane by binding with PLD2. Our findings show that the interaction between the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 and the PX domain of PLD2 is important for EGF-induced Ca2+ signaling. These results also suggest that the signaling pathways of PLC-γ1 and PLD2 may cooperatively propagate. Cell proliferation plays a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of organisms. EGF is known to influence cell proliferation, and the EGF receptor is the receptor most often found to be up-regulated in a wide variety of human tumors (62Mendelsohn J. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation, however, requires the triggering of numerous downstream signaling pathways. These pathways include those that involve PLC-γ1 and its downstream Ca2+- and PKC-mediated cascades and PLD. In many tumors there is no increase in the number of EGF receptors but, rather, its signaling is up-regulated (63Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of PLC-γ1 is required for EGF-induced cell cycle progression into the S phase (2Wang Z. Glück S. Zhang L. Morgan M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 590-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLC-γ1 signaling is regarded as a convergence point for a number of motility- and/or invasion-inducing pathways in cancers (64Kassis J. Lauffenburger D.A. Turner T. Wells A. Semin. Caner Biol. 2001; 11: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Evidence shows that PLC-γ1 and PLD2 are overexpressed in many cancers (65Noh D.Y. Lee Y.H. Kim S.S. Kim Y.I. Ryu S.H.

The possibility of the involvement of the coordination between PLC-γ1 and PLD2 in tumor cell mitogenesis or movement is an important issue for future studies."

These cascades involve sequential activation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases Lck/Fyn and the Syk family protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (1Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). TCR activation signals are transduced via signaling protein complexes, which assemble at the plasma membrane in close vicinity of TCR engagement and form a platform for the activation of signaling enzymes. Transmembrane protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is a central scaffold for these multimolecular signaling complexes. Phosphorylation of LAT tyrosines by ZAP-70 creates docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins (4Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). This leads to the formation of LAT-based protein assemblies, which contain the adaptor/scaffolding proteins Grb2, Gads, and SLP-76, as well as the signaling enzymes phospholipase C γ (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Vav (5Samelson S.E. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 6Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Weiss A. Immunol.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). PLCγ, when recruited into these complexes, becomes activated to catalyze hydrolysis of PI4,5P2 leading to Ca2+ mobilization, protein kinase C and Ras-activation (8Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A.

Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades are triggered via the Grb2/SOS/Ras GTPase cascade, and Vav activation triggers reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (5Samelson S.E. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Disruption of the LAT gene in mice causes a block in early T cell development, reflecting a severe inhibition of TCR-evoked signaling (10Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The Jurkat leukemic T-cell derivative JCaM2 lacks LAT expression and consequently is incapable of transducing TCR-evoked Ca2+ fluxes and Ras-dependent downstream signaling (7Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analysis of LAT identified tyrosine-based docking sites for PLCγ at Tyr-132 (Tyr-6) and for adaptor proteins Grb2 and Gads at Tyr-171 and -191 (Tyr-7 and -8) (11Lin J. Weiss A.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of LAT variants into LAT-deficient JCaM2 cells showed that these three tyrosines (Tyr- 6, -7, and -8) comprise a minimal set of docking sites for transducing Ca2+ fluxes and Ras-dependent downstream signaling (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tyr-110 and -226 (Tyr-4 and -9) reside in YXN Grb2-binding consensus motifs and are required to elicit a maximal level of NFAT-mediated transcription (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the binding sites of LAT for different signaling proteins and their role in TCR downstream signaling has been extensively characterized, it is not known how they contribute to the formation of multimolecular signaling complexes in plasma membrane subdomains. Previously, we developed a procedure to immunoisolate native plasma membrane fragments that strongly enrich TCR signaling complexes (14Harder T. Kuhn M. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/71/pl1)PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of these isolates led to the description of LAT-based signaling complexes, which accumulate in the vicinity of activated TCR (15Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, formation and disassembly of such TCR·LAT signaling assemblies over time have been followed using confocal microscopy (16Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 17Tanimura N. Nagafuku M. Minaki Y. Umeda Y. Hayashi F. Sakakura J. Kato A. Liddicoat D.R. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we studied in JCaM2 cells expressing LAT variants how different signaling protein docking sites affect the formation of LAT signaling complexes in T cell plasma membrane subdomains. We found that different docking sites on LAT synergize to mediate accumulation of LAT and LAT-associated signaling protein in TCR signaling domains, suggesting a cooperative assembly of LAT multimolecular signaling complexes. Cell Lines and Reagents—Jurkat derivative JCaM2 was maintained in RPMI medium, 7% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 mg/ml)/streptomycin (100 units/ml), 2 mm glutamax (Invitrogen). JCaM2 clones that stably express wt LAT, LAT All Y → F, LAT Y6F, LAT Y7F/Y8F, LAT Y6F/Y7F/Y8F, and LAT F6Y/F7Y/F8Y were described previously (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and were maintained in full medium, 1 mg/ml G418. We generated new JCaM2 cell lines stably expressing LAT Y7F/Y8F/Y9F and LAT F4Y/F6Y/F7Y/F8Y/F9Y as described below. All the JCaM2 lines used in this study were verified by Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to express the similar levels of LAT and CD3 (not shown). Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody TR66 was from Antonio Lanzavecchia (Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona, Switzerland). Antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following sources: monoclonal antibody against TCR ζ-chain were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Grb2, PLC-γ, and ZAP-70 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal serum against CD3-ϵ was obtained from Ed Palmer (University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland). Phycoerythrin-conjugated α-human CD3 antibodies were from BD PharMingen, and α-LAT rabbit antisera from Upstate Laboratories. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences. Expression Constructs—The expression construct of LAT F4Y/F6Y/F7Y/F8Y/F9Y in pcdef was described previously (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). LAT Y7F/Y8F/Y9F in pcdef was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis from wt LAT cDNA clone without introducing a Myc tag, cloned into pcdef, and verified by DNA sequencing. Wt LAT·EYFP and LAT All Y → F·EYFP fusion constructs were generated by PCR using the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics), introducing SalI and AgeI restriction sites replacing the stop codon of LAT. The restriction-digested PCR products were ligated in-frame into pEYFP N1 (Clontech). Sequences were verified by sequencing, and all plasmids were purified using Quiagen columns. Transfections and Fluorescence Microscopy—JCaM2 cell lines were transfected by electroporation in ice-cold cytomix electroporation buffers (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm NaCl, 10 mm K-PO4 buffer, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm ATP) at 960 μF, 280 mV in a 0.5-ml volume at a cell density of 1.5–2 × 107/ml in a Bio-Rad gene pulser. After 5 min on ice, cells were collected, transferred into full medium, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To select stable transfectants, cells were plated for selection in 2 mg/ml G418 at a density of 8000 and 4000 cells/well in 96-well plates. For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were incubated with one α-CD3-coated dynabead per cell at 37 °C for 7 min in RPMI-Hepes, 1% fetal calf serum. Subsequently the conjugates were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and 5 × 104 cells in 15 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were placed on a poly(l)lysine (Sigma)-coated microscope slide for 30 s on ice. Subsequently the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnologies). Immunofluorescence was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope, and digital images were obtained using a 12-bit Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Immunoisolation—M-450 goat α-mouse magnetic beads (Dynal) were coated with TR66 α-CD3 monoclonal antibody following the instructions of the manufacturers. 1–4 × 107 Jurkat cells per data point were pelleted at 2000 rpm, 10 s at 4 °C in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. Loose cell pellets were mixed with α-CD3 beads (1:2 ratio of beads: cells), incubated at 0 °C for 2 min, and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 0 min, 3 min, 7 min, respectively. Cell conjugates were washed once in H-buffer (10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate) and suspended in 1 ml of H-buffer containing CLAP protease inhibitors (100 μm each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin; Sigma) and 0.2 mm pervanadate. The cells were N2-cavitated using a nitrogen cavitation bomb (model 4639, Parr Instrument Company) equilibrated at 4 °C, 50 bar for 10 min. The homogenate was filled to 10 ml with H-buffer; beads were subsequently retrieved with a magnet (Dynal) and washed three times in 10 ml of H-buffer for 3 min each at 0 °C. Beads were analyzed by Western blotting using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments non-reducing SDS-PAGE was used. ECL-exposed x-ray films were scanned, and images were mounted using Photoshop” (Adobe) software. Pharmacological Treatments—For disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin, bead cell conjugates were formed at 37 °C for 7 min and subsequently treated with latrunculin (Calbiochem) at 12 μm concentration for 3 min. This treatment causes complete disappearance of phalloidin-actin staining in Jurkat cells (18Harder T. Simons K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and leads to rapid rounding of the cells. For depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, cells were incubated in RPMI, 1% fetal calf serum, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm BAPTA-AM (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously (19Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2001; 14: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cell/bead conjugates were formed in RPMI, 1% fetal calf serum, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm BAPTA-AM, and isolations were performed as described above. Detergent-insoluble Membrane Fractions—1 × 107 JCaM2 cells stably expressing either LAT All Y → F or wt LAT were lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold HNE (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA), homogenized by 1% Triton X-100 and passage through a 22-gauge needle, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The extract was adjusted to 40% Optiprep™ (Nycomed, Pharma), transferred to an SW55 centrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter), and overlaid with 1 ml of 35, 30, 25, and 0% Optiprep™ in HNE. The gradients were spun at 40,000 rpm for 3 h, and 600-μl fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by Western blotting. Two-dimensional Gel Analysis and Identification of Proteins by MALDI-MS—Immunoisolates of 4 × 108 Jurkat cells were prepared as described above except that prior to the homogenization, bead/cells conjugates were incubated with non-cell-permeable cross-linker bis(sulfo succinimdyl suberate) (Pierce), 1 mg/ml, in H buffer on ice for 10 min at 4 °C in order to increase the yields of the isolation and to cross-link the antibody chains to the beads. Two-dimensional gels of the isolates were run using Bio-Rad mini two-dimensional gel apparatus according to the instructions of the manufacturers, using carrier ampholine mixtures, pH ranges 5–7, 3.5–10 (Amersham Biosciences), and 5–7 (Serva) for the isoelectric focusing gels (20Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Celis A. Jensen N.A. Gromov P. Celis J.E. Cell Biology. 4. Academic Press, New York1998: 375-386Google Scholar). Proteins were stained using a colloidal Coomassie Blue staining kit (Novex). MALDI-MS analysis was performed as described (21Antelmann H. Bernhardt J. Schmid R. Mach H. Volker U. Hecker M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, spots were excised, destained with 30% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, and dried in a Speedvac evaporator. The dried gel pieces were reswollen with 5 μl of 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, (pH 8.8) containing 50 ng of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), centrifuged for 1 min, and left at room temperature for about 12 h. After digestion, 5 μl of water was added; 10 min later 10 μl of 75% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid was added, centrifuged for 1 min, and the content was vortexed for 20 min. For MALDI-MS 1.5 μl from the separated liquid was mixed with 1 μl of saturated α-cyano cinnamic acid in 50% acetonitril, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and applied to the MALDI target. The samples were analyzed in a time-of-flight Bruker mass spectrometer (Reflex III) equipped with a reflector and delayed extraction. An accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used. Des-Arg-1 Bradykinin (Sigma) and ACTH (18–38) (Sigma) were used as standard peptides. Calibration was internal to the samples. The peptide masses were matched with the theoretical peptide masses of all proteins from all species of the SWISS-Prot data base. For protein search, monoisotopic masses were used and a mass tolerance of 0.0075% was allowed. The protein search was performed with a software, developed by Roche (Basel, Switzerland), which is similar to the Peptident software on the ExPASy server (expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/peptident.html). LAT Lacking Tyrosine-based Protein Docking Sites Fails to Accumulate at the Site of TCR Engagement—Earlier work of our laboratory showed that TCR·LAT signaling assemblies (TLAs) form at the contact zone to α-CD3 antibody-coated TCR-activating beads (15Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To visualize LAT accumulation, JCaM2 cells were reconstituted with fluorescent LAT·EYFP and the cells were stimulated with α-CD3 dynabeads for 7 min. LAT distribution was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. In line with earlier reports using green fluorescence protein-tagged LAT, we observed a strong accumulation of wt LAT·EYFP in the plasma membrane contacting the TCR activating bead (Fig. 1A) (16Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 17Tanimura N. Nagafuku M. Minaki Y. Umeda Y. Hayashi F. Sakakura J. Kato A. Liddicoat D.R. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An EYFP fusion of a LAT mutant with all tyrosines replaced by phenylalanine (LAT All Y → F·EYFP) was efficiently targeted into the plasma membrane. In contrast to wt LAT·EYFP, we observed no enrichment of LAT All Y → F·EYFP at the contact region to TCR-activating beads. This showed that LAT accumulation at TCR activating beads depends on tyrosine-based docking sites for signaling proteins (Fig. 1B). PLCγ and Grb2 Binding Sites on LAT Contribute to TCR Signaling Complex Formation in Membrane Domains—Next, we studied which tyrosine-based protein docking motifs of LAT are required for the formation of TLAs in plasma membrane domains. We employed a biochemical analysis of TCR signaling domains that were immunoisolated by a previously established procedure (14Harder T. Kuhn M. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/71/pl1)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, α-CD3 antibody-coated magnetic beads are used to trigger TCR in Jurkat T cells. Subsequently, bead/cell conjugates are homogenized mechanically by nitrogen cavitation, and plasma membrane fragments attached to the beads are retrieved. By Western blot analysis of the α-CD3-isolated membranes we previously demonstrated signaling-dependent accumulation of LAT-based signaling protein assemblies at the site of TCR engagement (15Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, we assayed formation of TLAs mediated by LAT variants with specific mutations in tyrosine-based protein docking sites (Fig. 2A). We compared TCR signaling protein assemblies from JCaM2 cell lines stably reconstituted with wt LAT, which fully restores TCR signal transduction, and with LAT containing Tyr to Phe substitution of all tyrosines (LAT All Y → F), which does not transduce TCR signals (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Western blots showed that similar amounts of TCR ζ chain and ZAP-70 are recruited into the immunoisolated TCR signaling domains of all cell lines studied. LAT, Grb2, and PLCγ were enriched in immunoisolated TCR signaling complexes of wt LAT-reconstituted cells. In line with our fluorescence data, lower amounts of the LAT All Y → F mutant were recovered in α-CD3 immunoisolates (Fig. 2B). In all our experiments the amounts of LAT All Y → F in α-CD3 immunoisolated signaling domains were significantly reduced. Occasionally, the residual LAT All Y → F reached relatively high levels in the isolates, most likely because of higher plasma membrane recovery in the isolated membrane fragments. Non-complexed soluble Grb2 and PLCγ are not associated with signaling complexes and are thus barely detected in the isolates from LAT All Y → F-expressing cells. We compared α-CD3 isolates of wt LAT and LAT All Y → F-expressing JCaM2 cells with JCaM2 lines expressing a LAT variant carrying a Y7F/Y8F mutation deleting two Grb2/Gads binding sites. This mutant was previously shown to exhibit a mild reduction of the TCR signal transduction capabilities of LAT (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Here, this mutant showed no reduction of LAT and PLCγ accumulation in TCR signaling domains, whereas Grb2 appears to be slightly reduced (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the JCaM2 cells reconstituted with LAT mutant Y6F, which disrupts the PLCγ binding motif of LAT, showed no reduction of LAT accumulation and no significant change of Grb2 recruitment into the isolates. In line with immunoprecipitation data, we observed a strong reduction of PLCγ in the isolates from LAT Y6F-expressing cells (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Above-background levels of PLCγ were consistently observed in the isolates from LAT Y6F-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). Consequently, we studied α-CD3 isolates formed by the LAT Y6F/Y7F/Y8F variant, in which Tyr-7 and -8 Grb2/Gads docking sites and the Tyr-6-based PLCγ docking site are both disrupted. Interestingly, in JCaM2 cells expressing the LAT Y6F/Y7F/Y8F variant not only PLCγ but also Grb2 incorporation into immunoisolated LAT·TCR signaling complexes was strongly reduced. Moreover, LAT recruitment was diminished. Taken together, these data show that the Tyr-6 of LAT not only has an important role for PLCγ recruitment and activation of sustained Ca2+ fluxes but that it also cooperates with tyrosine 7 and 8-based Grb2/Gads binding sites to mediate LAT and Grb2 accumulation in immunoisolated TCR signaling domains. Next, we analyzed signaling complexes formed by LAT Y7F/Y8F/Y9F mutant, in which in addition to the Tyr-7 and -8 Grb2/Gads binding sites a Grb2 binding motif at Tyr-9 is disrupted (Fig. 2B). Grb2 was absent from the isolated TLAs formed by this LAT variant, whereas reduced amounts of PLCγ were recruited into the immunoisolates. These data show that the Grb2 binding site at Tyr-9 is involved in formation of LAT·TCR signaling complexes and comprises an important motif for Grb2 recruitment into TLAs. However, as seen in the strongly reduced Grb2 recruitment of LAT Y6F/Y7F/Y8F, Tyr-9 is by itself not sufficient to mediate Grb2 accumulation in TCR/LAT signaling domains. It is possible that the weak enrichment of LAT All Y → F in anti-CD3 immunoisolate reflects a failure of raft targeting of LAT All Y → F caused by defective LAT palmitoylation. Targeting of LAT into Triton X-100 detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) strictly depended on its palmitoylation (22Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Thus we tested the palmitoylation status of LAT All Y → F of TX-100 DRMs from JCaM2 expressing LAT All Y → F and wt LAT. Optiprep™ gradient centrifugation of the TX-100-extracted cells showed that the DRM fraction (fraction 2) of wt and All Y → F LAT contained very similar relative amounts of LAT (Fig. 2C). Our results show that LAT All Y → F as well as wt LAT are efficiently palmitoylated. The Tyrosine 6-, 7-, and 8-based Docking Sites of LAT Are Not Sufficient for Complete Signaling Complex Assembly—Our data show that tyrosines 6, 7, and 8 are essential for the formation of TCR·LAT signaling complexes. Moreover, these sites have previously been shown to comprise the minimal docking site requirement for LAT to be capable of transducing Ca2+ fluxes and Ras-dependent Erk kinase and NFAT activation (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether these tyrosines are sufficient to mediate the formation of TLAs. We employed different LAT Y-F mutants in which specific tyrosines of the LAT All Y → F variant have been restored. First, we monitored the accumulation of Grb2, tagged with an EYFP fluorophor, in TLA domains by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). We transiently transfected different JCaM2 cell lines expressing LAT variants with Grb2-EYFP. In line with our biochemical analysis (15Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and fluorescence imaging of TLAs (16Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), we observed an accumulation of Grb2-EYFP at the contact zone of JCaM2-wt LAT cells to α-CD3-coated beads. As expected, LAT All Y → F-expressing JCaM2 did not exhibit Grb2-EYFP accumulation at the bead/cell contact zone, because of the lack of Grb2 binding motifs in this LAT variant. LAT F6Y/F7Y/F8Y mediated no detectable accumulation of Grb2-YFP at the site of TCR activation, despite its two adjacent Tyr-7 and -8 Grb2/Gads binding sites. In JCaM2 lines expressing LAT F4Y/F6Y/F7Y/F8Y/F9Y, which additionally restores Grb2 binding motifs at Tyr-4 and -9, Grb2 accumulation at the TCR activating bead was significantly restored. These data were corroborated by our biochemical analysis of immunoisolated TCR signaling domains (Fig. 4). Accumulation of LAT F6Y/F7Y/F8Y in α-CD3 immunoisolates was clearly detectable when compared with signaling complexes from All Y → F LAT-expressing cells but significantly lower than in isolates from wt LAT cells. Moreover, Grb2 recovery in the isolated signaling domains from the LAT F6Y/F7Y/F8Y JCaM2 line was clearly reduced when compared with isolates from wt LAT-expressing JCaM2 cells. Immunoisolates from F4Y/F6Y/F7Y/F8Y/F9Y LAT cells accumulated LAT to wt LAT levels and to a large extent reconstituted Grb2 accumulation. Despite intense efforts it was not possible to resolve the individual contributions of LAT Tyr-4- and -9-based Grb2 binding sites to this enhancement, because the differences between signaling complexes formed by LAT variants carrying the Tyr-4, -6, -7, -8, Tyr-6, -7, -8, -9, and Tyr-4, -6, -7, -8, -9 docking sites were too subtle and variable to be unambiguously resolved. Taken together our data show that, albeit their important contribution to signaling protein assembly, the protein docking motifs of LAT comprising tyrosines 6, 7, and 8 are not sufficient to fully reconstitute LAT-TCR signaling domain formation and that additional Grb2 binding sites outside this motif contribute to the recruitment of Grb2 and LAT into TCR signaling domains. Multiple SH2/SH3 Cytoplasmic Adaptors Are Present in Immunoisolated TCR·LAT Signaling Assemblies—Multiple cytoplasmic adaptors can be resolved on two-dimensional gels of isolated Jurkat cell TLAs (Fig. 5). We identified SH2/SH3 adaptors Grb2, Gads, Grap, and Crk-1 by MALDI-MS on tryptic digests of excised protein spots. Moreover, spots for Gads and Grb2 were verified by Western blotting (data not shown). Importantly, Grb2 is a very abundant cytoplasmic adaptor, whereas Gads is relatively minor and Grap and Crk-1 are present in intermediate amounts, showing that cytoplasmic adaptors strongly differ in their relative abundance in TLAs. LAT was not resolved on our gels, possibly because of its highly acidic isoelectric point or because of the hydrophobic nature of its membrane anchor. Role of Ca2+Fluxes and Actin in LAT Signaling Complex Formation—The activation of PLCγ leads to inositol 1,4,5, PI3 release and triggers intracellular Ca2+ fluxes. To test whether intracellular Ca2+ fluxes influence the formation of TLAs we performed immunoisolation using wt LAT-expressing JCaM2 cells that were treated with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA as described previously (19Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2001; 14: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the respective immunoisolates from BAPTA-treated and control cells revealed no significant difference in the amount of LAT, PLCγ, and Grb2 (Fig. 6A). This suggests that the formation of the TLAs does not require the induction of Ca2+ fluxes. Moreover, we addressed the possibility that the formation of TLAs is because of their mutual anchoring in close vicinity by the actin cytoskeleton. We treated Jurkat cells with the drug latrunculin A, which rapidly and efficiently disrupts the actin cytoskeleton (23Schatten G. Schatten H. Spector I. Cline C. Paweletz N. Simerly C. Petzelt C. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was not possible to form conjugates of α-CD3 beads with Jurkat cells treated with latrunculin A. This is most likely because of the rounding of the cells following addition of the latrunculin. However, we succeeded in obtaining immunoisolates from Jurkat cells that were treated with latrunculin after conjugate formation and triggering for 7 min (Fig. 6B). We observed a clear reduction of TCR and ZAP-70 yields in the isolates from latrunculin-treated cells. By loading two times the equivalents of immunoisolated material from latrunculin-treated cells on the Western blot, we normalized the immunoisolates to essentially equal amounts of TCR ζ and ZAP-70. Under these conditions, the amounts of LAT, PLCγ, and Grb2 in the isolates are very similar to the non-treated cells. This showed that the ratio of TCR/ZAP-70 to LAT complexes is not affected by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, demonstrating that anchoring of LAT in the vicinity of TCR is not directly mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. However, the yields of signaling complexes were reduced upon latrunculin treatment, possibly because of the strong reduction of bead/cell contact area or reduced TLA anchoring in the plasma membrane domain TCR activating bead. Using imaging and biochemical analysis of TCR signaling membrane domains, we studied the role of the tyrosine-based protein docking sites of LAT in the accumulation of LAT and cytoplasmic signaling proteins in the vicinity of activated TCR. We analyzed signaling assemblies formed by LAT variants that carry different combinations of tyrosine-based signaling protein docking sites. Non-autonomous Signaling Protein Docking Sites on LAT: Structural Implication—Our study showed that different docking sites for the signaling proteins PLCγ and Grb2/Gads synergize in formation and/or stabilization of TCR·LAT signaling complexes. This synergy may be caused by cooperative stabilization of these assemblies by networks of intermolecular interactions between signaling proteins. A prototypic model for such multimolecular structures is the tetrameric complex formed by LAT, Gads, SLP-76, and PLCγ (6Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 584-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, Gads and SLP-76 are present in the isolated complexes in relatively low amounts (Fig. 5 and Ref. 15Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), possibly because of their early dissociation from the TCR·LAT signaling complexes (19Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2001; 14: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Therefore, other molecular interactions are also likely to play a role in complex assembly. Our two-dimensional gel analyses showed strong differences in the relative amounts of different SH2/SH3 adaptor in the immunoisolated signaling complexes. We identified the adaptors Crk-1, Grap, and, in particular, Gads as relatively minor components, whereas Grb2 is by far the most abundant member of the SH2/SH3 adaptor family (for review on cytoplasmic adaptors, see Ref. 25Leo A. Wienands J. Baier G. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Possibly, Grb2 has an important role, beyond SOS recruitment and Ras activation, by organizing the structure of LAT signaling complexes. This is corroborated by the important contribution of multiple Grb2 binding motifs of LAT to signaling complex formation and downstream NFAT and Erk activation. Moreover, our analysis showed that the PLCγ docking site Tyr-6 contributes to TLA assembly. It remains to be shown whether the enzymatic activity of PLCγ is required for this process. However, our experiments blocking Ca2+ fluxes and the efficient TLA formation mediated by the LAT F6Y, which inefficiently transduces Ca2+ fluxes, suggest that Ca2+ fluxes are not required for complex assembly. It remains to be tested whether diacylglycerol production by PLCγ plays a role in complex formation, for example by activating protein kinase C, and/or whether PLCγ plays a role in the structure of signaling assemblies. A role of Tyr-6 was also implicated by recent photobleaching experiments showing a stable anchoring of wt LAT-GFP in TCR signaling assemblies, whereas LAT F6Y-GFP and LAT F6Y/F7Y/F8Y/F9Y-GFP readily exchanged with their environment (17Tanimura N. Nagafuku M. Minaki Y. Umeda Y. Hayashi F. Sakakura J. Kato A. Liddicoat D.R. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that phosphorylation of different LAT tyrosines occurs in a non-autonomous fashion (13Zhu M. Janssen E. Zhang W. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In line with the issues discussed above, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking motifs may become stabilized by tight association of their specific binding partners upon complex assembly. Alternatively, phosphorylation and binding of signaling proteins may lead to conformational changes on LAT or the whole signaling assemblies, causing exposure and availability of tyrosines for further phosphorylation by kinases. Therefore, it is also possible that the phosphorylation events on LAT occur in an ordered fashion, explaining the interdependence of the different tyrosine-based docking sites in TLA formation. Further evidence for a structural basis of a cross-talk between signaling protein docking sites of LAT in the signaling response stems from the observation that different tyrosine protein docking sites had to reside on the same LAT molecule in order to restore signaling function in JCaM2 cells (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To resolve the mechanisms for the synergistic interactions of tyrosine-based docking sites of LAT, LAT signaling complex structure and temporal sequence of events leading to complex formation have to be resolved. Non-autonomous Signaling Protein Docking Sites on LAT: Functional Implications—Formation of the LAT·TCR signaling assemblies by respective LAT mutants correlated well with their capability to transduce different downstream signaling reactions. LAT tyrosines 6, 7, and 8 comprise a minimal set of docking motifs to enable transduction of Ca2+ fluxes, Erk and NFAT activation. However, the additional presence of the Grb2 docking sites tyrosines 4 and 9 was required to restore NFAT and Erk activation to the same levels as transduced by wt LAT (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This correlated well with the incomplete accumulation of LAT F6Y/F7Y/F8Y and Grb2 into α-CD3 immunoisolates, whereas LAT signaling assembly formation was almost completely reconstituted by LAT F4Y/F6Y/F7Y/F8Y/F9Y. Disruption of the Tyr-6 PLCγ binding motif of LAT has little effect on Grb2 and LAT recruitment into TLAs but impedes induction of Ca2+ fluxes and abolishes NFAT and Erk activation (12Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A residual amount of PLCγ is recovered in isolates of LAT Y6F-expressing cells, possibly caused by indirect association via Gads/SLP 76. This residual PLCγ may be sufficient for the induction of weak or aberrant Ca2+ fluxes, which have been described as JCaM2 cells expressing LAT Y6F (11Lin J. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because these experiments were performed in the JCaM2 leukemic T cell line, it will be very important to study the physiological roles of TLA assembly in T lymphocytes. Possibly the synergistic contribution of signaling protein docking to TLA formation reflects a mechanism to define a sequence and/or a threshold of tyrosine phosphorylation on LAT required to trigger specific downstream responses.

The crucial role of eukaryotic CSD proteins in major cellular events suggests that there is precise regulation of their expression. At present the post-transcriptional control of eukaryotic gene expression is to a large extent attributed to the presence of specific sequences within mRNA 5′- and 3′-untranslatable regions (UTRs), which serve as targets for binding of certain proteins and complementary RNAs (32Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,33Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Here, we studied this type of regulation during in vitro synthesis of rabbit p50, a member of the eukaryotic CSD protein family, which is the major protein of reticulocyte mRNPs and is virtually identical to the human Y-box binding protein YB-1. To determine a possible role of YB-1 mRNA UTRs in YB-1 post-transcriptional regulation, we examined effects of exogenous mRNA fragments containing different UTR parts on YB-1 mRNA translation and stability in a cell-free system from rabbit reticulocytes. We found that addition of the 3′ mRNA subfragment I, including the last 42 nucleotides of YB-1 mRNA coding region and the first 107 nucleotides of its 3′-UTR, shut off YB-1 synthesis mainly at the initiation stage without affecting mRNA stability. The inhibition by this subfragment was also observed in cell-free systems translating luciferase or endogenous globin mRNAs. In contrast, subfragment II containing the rest of YB-1 mRNA 3′-UTR or the 5′ fragment did not affect translation. Two proteins were found to specifically bind the inhibitory subfragment I, leading us to believe that they play an important role in mRNA translation. We have identified these proteins as poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (69 kDa) and YB-1 (50 kDa) and demonstrated that titrating out of PABP by poly(A) strongly and specifically inhibited YB-1 both cap+poly(A)−and cap+poly(A)+ mRNA translation in a cell-free system. Thus, PABP is capable of positively affecting YB-1 mRNA translation in a poly(A) tail-independent manner. pBluescript II SK YB-1 construct containing YB-1 cDNA, pSP36T-LucA50 construct containing 5′-UTR of β-globin mRNA fused with the luciferase coding sequence, and pSP64/CAT were described previously (34Evdokimova V.M.

The fragment containing 50-nucleotide-long poly(A) was cut from pSP36T-LucA50 construct by digesting with HindIII and PstI and ligated between the same sites of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene). The obtained construction was named pBluescript II SK A50. Then YB-1 gene was cut from pBluescript II SK YB-1 by digesting with HindIII andSmaI and ligated between HindIII andBglII of pBluescript II SK A50 (blunt ends afterBglII restriction were made using the Klenow fragment). pBluescript II SK 3′-UTR YB-1 construct was made as follows. The 3′-UTR fragment of YB-1 cDNA was digested with PvuII andBamHI from pBluescript II SK YB-1 and ligated between theEcoRV and BamHI sites of pBluescript II SK (Fig.1). pBluescript II SK subfragment II 3′-UTR YB-1 construct was made as follows. 5′-UTR, the coding sequence, and 3′-UTR subfragment I of YB-1 cDNA were removed from pBluescript II SK YB-1 construct by digesting with EcoRV and BspTI, followed by fill-in reaction with Klenow fragment and blunt end religation (Fig.1).

CAT mRNA was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase from pSP64/CAT linearized with BamHI. Transcription of YB-1 mRNA and its fragments was carried out by T7 RNA polymerase.

The transcription was performed as described previously (37Pokrovskaya I.D. Gurevich V.V. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Capped transcripts were obtained by a reaction where instead of 5 mm GTP a mixture of 0.2 mm GTP and 0.8 mm m7GpppG (Amersham Biosciences) was used. To generate32P-labeled fragments of YB-1 mRNA, [32P]UTP (2000 Ci/mm; Radioisotop) was added to the reaction, and the concentration of unlabeled UTP was reduced to 0.05 mm. Translation of endogenous or exogenous mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system was performed as described previously (38Pelham H.R. Jackson R.J. Eur. J.

The incubation mixture (15 μl) contained reticulocyte lysate (7.5 μl), 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.8 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm of each of 20 amino acids except for the labeled ones (Leu or Met), and 6 μCi of [14C]Leu (>300 mCi/mmol; Radioisotop) or 1 μCi of [35S]Met (>700 Ci/mmol; Radioisotop). In the case of micrococcal nuclease (MN)-treated lysate, the mixture was supplemented with appropriate mRNA as indicated in the figure legends. Translation was carried out at 30 °C for 2 h. The incorporation of [14C]Leu into the protein was measured in 5-μl aliquots as described previously (34Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A.

[35S]Met-incorporated proteins were analyzed by 10–22% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The relative amount of radioactivity in the bands was determined using a Packard Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard Instrument Co., Inc.). Cell-free translation mixtures (30 μl) with endogenous mRNA were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, cooled, and immediately layered onto 15–40% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Centrifugation was carried out at 45,000 rpm in an SW-60 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 50 min. All gradients were monitored for absorbance at 254 nm during their collection from the bottom. Total RNA was extracted from translation mixtures by the phenol/chloroform method. 7 μg of total RNA from each reaction (measured by A260) was separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and 1× MOPS buffer (40 mm MOPS, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.0). RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N,Amersham Biosciences) and cross-linked using transilluminator cross-linker (Vilber-Lourmat) at 0.15 J/cm2. Membrane-bound RNA was hybridized to a 1054-nt fragment of YB-1 cDNA probe or a 600-nt fragment of α-globin cDNA probe labeled with [32P]dATP (Multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences) in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5x Denhard's solution, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 12–16 h. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature, twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature, twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 °C, and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68 °C and analyzed by autoradiography. 0.5 μl of MN-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated with radiolabeled RNA (10,000 cpm) in a final volume of 10 μl (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 15 min. In the case of proteinase K treatment, 10 μg of proteinase K and SDS up to 0.1% were added and followed by incubation for 5 min. After incubation, the protein-RNA complexes were analyzed by 6% PAGE in 0.5× TBE buffer (1×: 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA), followed by autoradiography. 5 μl MN-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated with radiolabeled RNA (100,000 cpm) in a final volume of 18 μl (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl) at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were irradiated at 1.5 J/cm2 in a transilluminator cross-linker (Vilber-Lourmat), incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 0.05 unit/μl MN and 0.5 μg/μl RNase A, and analyzed by 10–22% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. UV cross-linking mixtures (20 μl) were preincubated with anti-YB-1 or preimmune antibodies (12 μg) in a final volume of 200 μl (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl) at 25 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 100 μl of buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 140 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20), and bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycin, pH 3.0, neutralized, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by 10–22% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For immunodepletion experiments, nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate (30 μl) was diluted 3-fold with buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl) and incubated with 20 μl of anti-YB-1 or preimmune antibodies fixed on protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Then the protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation. The efficiency of depletion of YB-1 was controlled by immunoblotting. Nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate (300 μl) was diluted 3-fold with buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl) and incubated with 200 μl of poly(A)-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 0 °C with gentle agitation. Then the poly(A)-agarose beads were removed by centrifugation. The efficiency of depletion of PABP was controlled by immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 20 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.05% Tween 20 in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl) and probed with appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. YB-1 and PABP from mRNPs of rabbit reticulocytes were obtained as described earlier (39Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol.

After dissociation of ribosomes using 33 mm EDTA polyribosomal mRNPs were adsorbed to the oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml heparin) at 4 °C and then the column was washed with the same buffer solution. mRNPs were eluted with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA) at 37 °C, pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 2 h in the type TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C and dissolved in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl). mRNP proteins dissociated from mRNA using 3 m LiCl, and the mRNA was precipitated overnight at −20 °C. The RNA precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins from the supernatant fraction were dialyzed against buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl) and separated from aggregates by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. About 500 μg of mRNP proteins were applied to a Superose 6 HR/10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl). Chromatography was done at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The fraction volume was 1.5 ml. As we mentioned above, in eukaryotes, 5′- and 3′-UTRs of mRNA are involved in regulation of activity, stability, and intracellular distribution of mRNA through interaction with specific regulatory proteins or RNAs (32Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol.

Here we studied the effect of exogenous 5′ and 3′ fragments of rabbit YB-1 mRNA (Fig. 1) on YB-1 synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system. If these mRNA fragments compete with YB-1 mRNA for binding to specific regulatory proteins or RNAs, we would expect to detect a change in YB-1 mRNA activity and/or stability. The addition of the 3′ fragment containing the 231-nt UTR and the last 42 nt of YB-1 coding sequence to the cell-free system translating YB-1 cap+poly(A)− mRNA strongly inhibited YB-1 synthesis (Fig. 2A,lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the 132-nt 5′ fragment containing 5′-UTR did not affect YB-1 mRNA translation (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). To better localize the inhibitory signal within the 3′ fragment, two its subfragments were tested in a cell-free translation system. The upstream 149-nt-long subfragment I caused strong inhibition of YB-1 synthesis (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 8), while the downstream 124-nt-long subfragment II did not (lanes 9–11). The addition of subfragment I also inhibited translation of luciferase cap+poly(A)− mRNA (Fig.3A) and natural globin mRNA (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that this inhibition is not specific for YB-1 mRNA translation. The stage of protein synthesis affected by subfragment I may be identified by studying its effect on the polysomal profile in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. Inhibition of translation at the stage of initiation is known to be accompanied by a decay of polysomes, whereas inhibition of elongation/termination results in larger polysomes. Subfragment I or II was added to the cell-free translation system with endogenous mRNA, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min and analyzed by centrifugation in sucrose gradient. The polysomal profiles are shown in Fig.4. The addition of subfragment I resulted in a complete decay of polysomes (cf. Fig. 4, Bwith A, presenting control with no subfragment), while with subfragment II added, the profile was similar to that of the control (cf. Fig. 4, C with A). The subfragment I-induced decay of polysomes may result from inhibition of translation at the initiation stage. However, it cannot be ruled out that subfragment I may stimulate mRNA degradation, which would also result in a decay of polysomes. To verify the latter suggestion, we studied the effect of subfragments I and II on YB-1 and α-globin mRNA stability in the translation reaction. The total RNA was isolated from cell-free translation systems described above after 5-min incubation, subjected to gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4F), and analyzed (along with control YB-1 or α-globin mRNA) by Northern blot hybridization to32P-labeled YB-1 (Fig. 4D) or α-globin cDNA (Fig. 4E). No notable difference in mRNA content and size was observed between experiment and control. This allowed concluding that polysome decay caused by subfragment I did not result from mRNA degradation but was caused by inhibition of translation itself mostly or exclusively at the stage of initiation. To ascertain the possible proteins interacting with the 3′ fragment and affecting mRNA activity, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift experiment using reticulocyte lysate and32P-labeled 3′ fragment. Addition of the lysate to this labeled fragment resulted in retardation of the labeled band in the gel (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). This retardation effect was avoided by proteinase K treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 3) and was sensitive to the amount of non-labeled 3′ fragment added (lanes 4–6), but not to addition of other RNAs (lanes 7–12), revealing specific binding of some lysate protein(s) to the labeled fragment. To characterize these proteins, we UV-irradiated the mixture containing reticulocyte lysate and the labeled 3′ fragment. Four proteins with molecular weights of about 69, 50, 46, and 44 kDa were found to cross-link to the labeled fragment (Fig. 5B,lane 2). The same proteins were cross-linked to the labeled 3′ fragment under conditions of an active translation system with exogenous or endogenous mRNA (2- and 15-min incubation). These proteins, with the exception for 50-kDa protein, are efficiently competed out by the non-labeled 3′ fragment (Fig. 5B,lanes 3–5). Other RNAs used in this experiment demonstrated less competition (Fig. 5B, lanes 6–14) revealing that these three proteins, 69, 46, and 44 kDa, bound the 3′ fragment specifically. The inability of the non-labeled 3′ fragment to efficiently substitute for the labeled fragment in retarded complexes (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–6) and in UV cross-linking to 50-kDa protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 3–5) indicated that there was an excess of 50 kDa protein in the lysate. For this reason we could not yet conclude that the interaction of the 3′ fragment of YB-1 mRNA with 50-kDa protein was specific. Next, we studied the binding specificity of 69-, 50-, 46-, and 44-kDa proteins to subfragments I and II of the 3′ fragment to determine which of these proteins may affect mRNA translational activity. Using UV cross-linking, we analyzed the binding of lysate proteins to the labeled 3′ fragment in the presence of increasing amounts of non-labeled competitors: 3′ fragment, subfragment I, and subfragment II. Similarly to what was shown above, the non-labeled 3′ fragment efficiently competed out 69-, 46-, and 44-kDa proteins from the complex containing the labeled fragment (Fig.6A, lanes 3–5). Moreover, we found that subfragment I competed with the labeled fragment only for 69-kDa protein (Fig. 6A, lanes 6–8), while subfragment II competed only for 46- and 44-kDa proteins (lanes 9–11). Then, the 3′ fragment and subfragments I and II were radioactively labeled and incubated with the lysate separately. Analysis of proteins UV cross-linked to each of these RNAs revealed that 69- and 50-kDa proteins specifically bound subfragment I (Fig. 6B,lane 5), while 46- and 44-kDa proteins bound subfragment II (lane 6). This result suggests that 50- and 69-kDa proteins may be involved in protein synthesis and promote translation, and their specific binding by exogenous subfragment I may cause inhibition of translation. However, we detected much higher amounts of 50-kDa protein compared with 69 kDa in reticulocyte lysate, which makes the latter a more likely candidate. Subfragment I of YB-1 mRNA was found to have the motif AACAUC in its UTR portion (Fig. 1). According to the literature, this motif specifically interacts with Xenopus FRGY2 that displays 64% homology to YB-1 (43Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This led us to believe that 50-kDa protein specifically cross-linked to subfragment I in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is YB-1. To verify this suggestion, YB-1 isolated from mRNPs of rabbit reticulocytes was cross-linked to32P-labeled subfragment I in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled subfragment I or II as a competitor. Subfragment I substituted for its labeled form in the complex with YB-1 (Fig.7A, lanes 4–6) much more efficiently than subfragment II (lanes 7–9), thereby showing YB-1 specificity for subfragment I. To demonstrate that 50-kDa protein specifically cross-linked to subfragment I in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is YB-1 as well,32P-labeled subfragment I was added to the lysate, UV cross-linked, treated with a nuclease mixture, incubated with anti-YB-1 antibodies, and adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose. The adsorbed32P-labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. As seen from Fig. 7B, lane 2, only the 50-kDa protein cross-linked to subfragment I precipitated with anti-YB-1 antibodies, whereas 69-kDa protein did not adsorb onto protein A-Sepharose beads (Fig. 7B, lane 3). None of them interacted with preimmune antibodies and adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose (Fig. 7B, lanes 4 and 5). In another experiment, MN-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated with anti-YB-1 antibodies, and YB-1 was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads. Preimmune antibodies were used as a control. After the precipitation, equal aliquots of all lysates were subjected to immunoblotting and UV cross-linking to 32P-labeled subfragment I (Fig. 7C). The 32P-band corresponding to 50-kDa protein was absent only from the YB-1-depleted lysate (Fig. 7C, lane 2). Hence, the 50-kDa protein specifically interacting with subfragment I in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is YB-1. The analysis of the subfragment I primary structure showed that it is A-rich (34%). Some A residues are assembled in 3–5-nt clusters (Fig. 1). Besides, the molecular mass of 69-kDa protein is close to that of PABP. To check whether 69-kDa protein specifically interacting with subfragment I has a preferential affinity for poly(A), we studied by UV cross-linking the effect of homoribopolynucleotides on 69-kDa protein binding to subfragment I (Fig.8A). As seen, pol"

Here we report a new gene, designated ATP22 (reading frame YDR350C on chromosome IV), that provides an essential function in the assembly of F0. ATP22 was cloned by transformation of C208/L2, a strain previously assigned to complementation group G99 of a collection of respiration-defective nuclear pet mutants.

This is supported by the sedimentation properties of the mutant ATPase and results of immunochemical analysis of F0 subunit polypeptides. Northern analysis of ATPase transcripts and in vivo pulse labeling of the mitochondrial translation products in the mutant indicate normal expression of subunits 6, 8, and 9, the three mitochondrial gene products of F0. Atp22p therefore functions at a post-translational stage in assembly of F0. Localization studies indicate Atp22p to be a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

The proton-translocating ATPase of mitochondria consists of two functionally distinct parts, F1 and F0. The F1-ATPase catalyzes the reversible synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. It consists of 5 distinct polypeptides with a stoichiometry of 3α:3β:γ:δ:[epsis ] (1Catterall W.A. Coby W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

The exceptions are photosynthetic bacteria that have an F0 with 4 subunits. The F0 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of 9 different polypeptides (5Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The most abundant constituent of F0 is a low molecular weight proteolipid (subunit 9 or subunit C) that forms the proton channel of the complex (8Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp.

Studies of respiration-deficient yeast mutants have disclosed the existence of at least two nuclear gene products necessary for the expression of the F1-ATPase. ATP11 and ATP12 code for chaperones that interact with the β and α subunits of F1, respectively, thereby minimizing their aggregation through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions (10Ackerman S.

Most ATPase-deficient mutants have an unstable mitochondrial genome causing them to accumulate ρ– and ρo mutants. 1The abbreviations used are: ρ– mutant, respiration-deficient mutant with a partially deleted mitochondrial genome; ρo mutant, respiration-deficient mutant lacking mitochondrial DNA; pet mutant, respiration-deficient mutant of yeast with a mutation in a nuclear gene. ATPase mutants also incur secondary losses of the bc1 and cytochrome oxidase complexes. Even though this phenotype is fairly widespread among pet mutants (e.g. leaky mitochondrial protein synthesis mutants), it nonetheless is a good starting point for identifying strains with lesions in the ATPase. In continuing efforts to catalogue nuclear gene products that contribute to the maintenance of respiration-competent mitochondria, we have screened the class of pleiotropic pet mutants (17Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for defects in ATPase. In this communication we report a new gene ATP22, which is required for the biogenesis of the ATPase. The encoded product, Atp22p, is a mitochondrial protein that provides an essential function in assembly of the F0 sector.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of Yeast Mitochondria and ATPase Assays—Mitochondria were prepared by the method of Faye et al. (21Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that Zymolyase 20,000 instead of Glusulase was used to convert cells to spheroplasts. ATPase activity was assayed by measuring release of inorganic phosphate from ATP at 37 °C in the presence and absence of oligomycin (22King E.J. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For localization of Atp22p, mitochondria were prepared by the method of Glick (23Glick B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 260: 224-231Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing of ATP22—ATP22 was cloned by transformation of the respiration-deficient mutant C208/L2 (MATα leu2-3,112 atp22-1) with a yeast genomic library consisting of partial Sau3A fragments of nuclear DNA from strain D273-10B/A1 cloned in YEp13 (24Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Transformation of 108 cells with 10 μg of library DNA yielded a single leucine-independent and respiration-competent clone (C208/L2/T1). The plasmid (pG99/T1) conferring respiratory competence to the mutant was amplified in Escherichia coli RR1 and used to subclone the gene. The insert of subclone pG99/ST4 was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 49-56Google Scholar) following single strand separation of 5′ endlabeled restriction fragments. All the restriction sites used for labeling were crossed from neighboring sites. The sequence of ATP22 is identical to reading frame YDR350C on chromosome IV. Disruption of ATP22—The following strategies were used to delete most of the ATP22 coding sequence. pG99/ST4 was digested with NdeI, removing a 1.7-kb fragment internal to the gene. The remaining sequence was blunt-ended with Klenow polymerase and ligated to a 12-nucleotide-long BglII linker. The religated plasmid was digested with BglII removing an additional 190 nucleotides of 5′ sequence and 70 nucleotides of coding sequence. The BglII-gapped plasmid was ligated to a 1-kb BamHI fragment containing the yeast HIS3 gene. The resultant plasmid pG99/ST11 was used to isolate a 1.4-kb linear fragment with the atp22::HIS3 null allele. The null allele was substituted for wild type ATP22 in the respiration-competent diploid strain W303 by the one-step gene replacement method (26Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). Histidine-independent transformants were sporulated and tetrads dissected to obtain the haploid atp22 null mutants W303ΔATP22 and aW303ΔATP22. A second deletion allele was made by first amplifying ATP22 with 153 nucleotides of upstream and 108 nucleotides of downstream sequences. Following cloning in pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), the plasmid was digested with MfeI and AvrII to remove 940 nucleotides of the gene. The gapped plasmid was ligated to an EcoRI-XbaI fragment containing HIS3. This construct was used to transform the respiration-competent haploid strain LL20. Construction of the ATP22-BIO Fusion Gene—The following PCR primers were used to amplify ATP22: 5′-TGAAGATCTATTCTGCGCG and 5′-GGCGGGATCCATTTAGACTTTTCAACGTC. The 2.1-kb product, containing 90 nucleotides of 5′ sequence followed by the entire coding sequence except for the termination codon, was digested with BglII and BamHI and ligated in-frame to the 270-nucleotide sequence coding for the biotinylation signal of bacterial transcarboxylase (27Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in the shuttle plasmid YEp352Bio6 (28Tzagoloff A. Yue J. Jang J. Paul M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26144-26151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion gene was transferred as an XmaI-HindIII fragment to the multicopy shuttle plasmid YEp351 (29Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) and the integrative plasmid YIp351 (29Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The latter construct (pG99/ST14) was linearized at the ClaI site of LEU2 in the plasmid and integrated at the homologous locus of the atp22 mutant C208/L2 (26Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). Construction of trpE-ATP22 Fusion Gene—The sequence of ATP22 coding for the 243 carboxyl-terminal amino acids was isolated as a 1.2-kb Sau3A-HindIII fragment and cloned in pATH20 linearized with BamHI and HindIII (30Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 477-490Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This plasmid expressed a 64-kDa fusion protein consisting of the amino-terminal half of the E. coli anthranilate synthase and the carboxyl-terminal 243 residues of Atp22p. The insoluble fusion protein was solubilized in SDS and partially purified by chromatography on a BioGel A 0.5 column (Bio-Rad) prior to immunization of rabbits. Miscellaneous Procedures—Standard methods were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE in the buffer system of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized Western blots with 125I-protein A (33Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar) or by a secondary antibody with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotype of atp22 Mutants—The atp22 mutants reported here are part of a collection of respiration-deficient pet mutants of S. cerevisiae (17Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation group G99 of this collection consists of 9 independent isolates all of which were complemented by a ρo tester strain indicating that the respiratory deficiency stems from recessive mutations in a nuclear gene. The mutants tend to degrade to secondary ρo or ρ– mutants as a result of deletion in their mtDNA. The frequency of ρo/ρ– mutants with deleted mitochondrial genomes ranged from 5 to 75% in the five strains tested (Table II). Increased instability of mitochondrial DNA is one of the characteristics of ATPase mutants (35Paul M.F. Velours J. Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Aigle M. Guerin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most stable mutant, N417/L2, grew slowly on glycerol/ethanol, probably because the mutation in this strain causes only a partial loss of function.Table IIRespiratory and ATPase activities of mitochondria from wild type and atp22 mutantsStrainρ+Specific activitiesNADH oxidaseSuccinate oxidaseATPase-Oligomycin+Oligomycin%μmol/min/mgD273-10B/A1>990.422 ± 0.0150.209 ± 0.0124.351.06N417/L2950.146 ± 0.0040.030 ± 0.0022.262.27C290702.942.87E44221.561.62E232201.501.54C326231.901.65 Open table in a new tab Assays of ATPase in isolated mitochondria indicated that the mutant enzyme is oligomycin-insensitive (Table II). This phenotype is associated with mutations that prevent the F1-ATPase from interacting with F0 and can be elicited by lesions in subunits of F0, proteins required for expression of one of the three mitochondrially encoded subunits of F0 (12Payne M.J. Schweizer E. Lukins H.B. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Ackerman S.H. Gatti D.L. Gellefors P. Douglas M.G. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and accessory factors that function in F0 assembly (36Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, because of the dependence of F0 assembly on the endogenously expressed subunits, loss of oligomycin sensitivity can also be a consequence of mutations that impair mitochondrial translation (17Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic petite mutants deficient in mitochondrial protein synthesis assemble catalytically active and oligomycin-insensitive F1-ATPase, which exists as a soluble matrix protein (38Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2192-2199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase defect of atp22 mutants is not due to the accumulation of large numbers of ρo/ρ– clones. For example, the ATPase activity measured in C290 and N417/L2 was insensitive to oligomycin, even though the percentage of ρo/ρ– cells in the cultures used to prepare mitochondria was only 30 and 5%, respectively (Table II). Like other ATPase mutants, atp22 mutants are partially deficient in cytochromes a, a3, and b and have reduced NADH and succinate oxidase activities (Fig. 1A, Table II) (13Ackerman S.H. Gatti D.L. Gellefors P. Douglas M.G. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Camougrand N. Pelissier P. Velours G. Guerin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A requirement of Atp22p for expression of the mitochondrial ATPase genes ATP6 (OLI2), ATP8 (AAP1) (44Macreadie I.G. Novitski C.E. Maxwell R.J. John U. Ooi B.G. McMullen G.L. Lukins H.B. Linnane A.W. Nagley P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4435-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and ATP9 (OLI1) was also excluded. Northern analysis of mitochondrial transcripts confirmed the presence of the fully processed ATP9 and the bistronic ATP6/ATP8 mRNAs (Fig. 1B). The two ATP6/ATP8 transcripts seen in yeast mitochondria result from processing at two different 5′ sites (43Beilharz M.W. Cobon G.S. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial ATPase-specific mRNAs were also studied in an atp22 null mutant constructed in strain LL20 which produces ∼50% ρo/ρ– mutants. In this background the ATP9 transcript normalized to the 21 S rRNA was 96% of wild type. The normalized longer ATP6/ATP8 transcript was 90% and the shorter transcript was 51% of wild type. The lack of requirement of Atp22p for expression of the mitochondrial ATPase genes is also supported by in vivo translation assays indicating that atp22 mutants synthesize subunits 6, 8, and 9 of F0 (Fig. 1C). Finally, the sequence of ATP22 does not correspond to any known subunit of F1 or F0 (see below). Based on these results, Atp22p is likely to play a role at a post-translational stage of F0 assembly. Cloning and Disruption of ATP22—The ATP22 gene was cloned by transformation of C208/L2 (MATα leu2-3,112 atp22-1), a derivative of C208, with a yeast genomic plasmid library. One of 4,000 leucine-independent transformants obtained was rescued for the growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources. The plasmid pG99/T1, responsible for restoration of respiration in the mutant, was amplified in E. coli and used to subclone the gene. Various regions of the nuclear DNA insert in pG99/T1 were transferred to YEp351 (29Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), and the resultant constructs were tested for their ability to confer respiratory competence to C208/L2. Based on the ability of the subclones to rescue the mutant phenotype, the gene was localized between a HindIII and a BglII site of pG99/ST1 (Fig. 2A). The sequence of this region revealed a single reading frame corresponding to open reading frame YDR350C/TCM10 on chromosome IV. Because TCM10, the previous three letter designation for this gene, is not based on any known function of the protein, we propose ATP22 as a more appropriate alternative designation based on earlier names of mitochondrial ATPase-related genes. A mutant allele of ATP22 was constructed by replacing most of the coding sequence with the yeast HIS3 gene (see “Materials and Methods”). A linear fragment of DNA containing the null allele was used to transform the respiration-competent diploid strain W303. Two independent His+ transformants were sporulated, tetrads dissected, and the meiotic products scored for their growth phenotype. Seven complete tetrads obtained from the two transformants (a/αW303ΔATP22) showed a 2:2 segregation of growth on non-fermentable substrates (glycerol/ethanol). In each instance the loss of respiratory competence co-segregated with the histidine prototrophy. The respiratory defect of the haploid segregants was complemented by a ρo mutant but not by atp22 testers, indicating close linkage of the point mutation to the atp22::HIS3 null allele. Two haploid atp22 segregants, W303ΔATP22 and aW303ΔATP22, were also checked for stability of their mtDNA. In both cases less than 1% of freshly grown cultures of either strain had wild type mtDNA (ρ+). A similar deletion in strain LL20, however, had a less severe effect on mtDNA. In this genetic background only 50% of vegetatively grown cells were ρo/–. Nonetheless, because of their high genome instability, atp22 null mutants were of limited usefulness for biochemical studies. Analysis of ATPase—The absence of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase in atp22 mutants was most consistent with a lesion in the F0 sector of the complex. This is supported by the sedimentation properties of the ATPase in the atp22 mutant. In agreement with previous studies (45Tzagoloff A. Meagher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7328-7336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ATPase extracted with Triton X-100 from wild type mitochondria sediments as the F1-F0 complex with an estimated mass of 500 kDa (Fig. 3A). The distribution of ATPase activity (48Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following centrifugation of a similar extract from the mutant mitochondria indicated a mass of ∼310 kDa, a value within experimental error of the mass of the yeast F1-ATPase determined by this method as reported previously (45Tzagoloff A. Meagher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7328-7336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A lesion in the F0 sector was also supported by the steady-state concentrations of ATPase subunits. Some components of F0, particularly subunit 6, are unstable in mutants that fail to assemble the F1-F0 complex (16Paul M.-F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Western analysis indicated that mitochondria of atp22 mutants had normal amounts of the α subunit of F1 but were almost totally depleted of subunit 6 of F0 (Fig. 3B). The atp13 (aep2) mutant N9-168, included as a control, also displays the absence of subunit 6, even though this gene targets subunit 9 (12Payne M.J. Schweizer E. Lukins H.B. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Ackerman S.H. Gatti D.L. Gellefors P. Douglas M.G. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The low level of subunit 6 detected in N417/L2 is consistent with the slow growth phenotype of this mutant. Because synthesis of subunit 6 is not affected in the mutants (Fig. 1C), its low steady-state level is most likely the result of increased protein turnover as a result of impaired F0 assembly. Localization of Atp22p—Atp22p is a 71-kDa basic protein with an overall hydrophilic character. There are, however, several hydrophobic stretches in the protein of sufficient length to qualify for transmembrane domains (not shown). No homologues of Atp22p, except for other species of Saccharomyces, were detected in the most recent protein data banks. Atp22p was localized in mitochondria immunochemically and by expressing it as a fusion protein containing a carboxyl-terminal 7-kDa polypeptide with a biotinylation signal (49Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody recognized a protein of ∼70 kDa in the mitochondrial fraction of a wild type strain but not the atp22 null mutant (Fig. 4A). The greatly increased signal seen in a mutant transformed with ATP22 on a multicopy plasmid further confirmed this band to be Atp22p. Atp22p was not detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction of wild type yeast or of the transformant (data not shown). A biotinylated protein of the expected size (∼7 kDa larger than the native Atp22p) was also detected in mitochondria of the atp22 mutant C208/L2 transformed with the ATP22-BIO fusion gene on a high copy plasmid or integrated in single copy at the LEU2 locus of chromosomal DNA (Fig. 4B). Both transformants were complemented for the respiratory defect indicating the presence of the carboxyl-terminal biotinylated peptide did not interfere with the activity of the protein. The presence of several hydrophobic domains in Atp22p suggested it might be a membrane protein. This was supported by its resistance to extraction with sodium carbonate and cofractionation with submitochondrial particles following sonic disruption of mitochondria (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the inter-membrane marker cytochrome b2, most of which was released after conversion of mitochondria to mitoplasts, all the Atp22p remained associated with the mitoplasts (Fig. 5B). Treatment of mitochondria and mitoplasts with proteinase K under conditions that cause loss of proteins that face the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane had no effect on Atp22p. The presence of Atp22p in a protease-protected compartment of mitoplasts together with its failure to be released from sonically disrupted mitochondria suggests that it is a membrane protein facing the matrix side of the inner membrane. Unlike most mitochondrial membrane proteins, Atp22p is not solubilized with deoxycholate. A titration indicated that even at a final concentration of 1% deoxycholate, none of the Atp22p was extracted (Fig. 6A). Under the same conditions, increasing concentrations of the detergent caused a progressive removal of the inner membrane protein Sco1p (40Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22185-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) from the membranes. The ineffectiveness of deoxycholate to solubilize Atp22p was also evident in its banding behavior on isopycnic gradients. Centrifugation of mitochondria or submitochondrial particles through a step sucrose gradient showed that Atp22p banded at densities similar to that of Cox5p, a subunit of the inner membrane marker cytochrome oxidase. When mitochondria were treated with 1% deoxycholate, Atp22p was concentrated at a denser region of the gradient, whereas most of the cytochrome oxidase was shifted to a region of lesser density. The increased density is probably due to extraction of the bulk phospholipids but not of Atp22p from the membrane by deoxycholate. Nuclear genes of S. cerevisiae reported previously (12Payne M.J.

Genet. 1995; 27: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to affect F0 assembly are involved in processing/translation of the mitochondrial ATPase-specific transcripts for subunits 6, 8, and 9. The exception is Atp10p, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that functions post-translationally as a chaperone of subunit 6 (16Paul M.-F. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29238-29243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP22 product reported here is the second example of a mitochondrial protein with a post-translational role essential for F0 assembly. This is supported by the presence in atp22 mutants of the fully processed ATP6, -8, and -9 mRNAs and their normal translation when cycloheximide-inhibited cells are pulse-labeled with a radioactive precursor. Furthermore, the presence in the mutants of catalytically active F1-ATPase excludes a role of Atp22p in assembly of this oligomeric protein. The nearly complete absence under steady-state conditions of subunit 6 in the mutants further argues for the importance of Atp22p for biogenesis of the F1-F0 complex. This evidence, however, does not necessarily mean that Atp22p is involved in biogenesis of subunit 6 because mutations that prevent formation of F0, independent of their specific functions, produce a similar phenotype. For example, the atp13 (aep2) mutant N9-168 is also grossly deficient in subunit 6 despite the fact that the product of this gene is involved in expression of subunit 9 (12Payne M.J. Schweizer E. Lukins H.B. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Ackerman S.H. Gatti D.L. Gellefors P. Douglas M.G. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of Atp22p is not clear at present, its localization and topology in the inner membrane of mitochondria is consistent with a role in assembly of the F0 sector. Unlike ATP10 for which homologues exist in plants, some fungi, but not animals, ATP22 appears to be present only in the genus Saccharomyces. Searches of current protein data banks have failed to reveal even distant relationships to proteins of other organisms. This suggests that the function of Atp22p is related to some unique feature of F0 in this yeast."

To understand more fully the role of Ski in TGF-β signaling, we searched for novel Ski-interacting proteins.

Consistent with this, the activity of promoter containing the Smad-binding sites was repressed by C184M, and the TGF-β-induced growth inhibition of mink lung Mv1Lu cells was attenuated by the ectopic expression of C184M.

Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). TGF-β acts as a potent growth inhibitor for most types of cells. Secreted TGF-β binds to the TGF-β type II receptor, which phosphorylates the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3. Phospho-Smad2 or phospho-Smad3 then forms a complex with Smad4, known as the co-mediator Smad (co-Smad), and migrates into the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of target genes. In addition to the Smad-mediated pathway, an alternative pathway involving TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK-1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) also mediates TGF-β signaling (2Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The TAB1-TAK1 pathway activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade including p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (4Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Because I-Smads do not contain phosphorylation sites for TGF-β receptor I, when recruited to the activated type I receptor they do not dissociate from it, which prevents the association of R-Smads with the type I receptor.

Smurf2 is a member of the HECT-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase family, and induces the ubiquitination of the TGF-β receptor, which leads to the degradation of the receptor via the proteasome- and lysosome-dependent pathways. The third mechanism is the negative regulation of the Smad-dependent transcriptional activation by co-repressors in the nucleus. The phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 in the nucleus bind to transcriptional corepressors such as TGIF (11Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J.

The co-repressors compete out p300/CBP, the co-activator of Smad2/4 and Smad3/4, and recruit histone deacetylases to the target genes, leading to the inhibition of the Smad2/4- or Smad3/4-induced transcriptional activation.The ski gene family was originally identified as oncogenes carried by the Sloan-Kettering virus (16Li Y.

In contrast, it is not clear whether the Ski protein is degraded upon TGF-β stimulation (24Sun Y. Liu X. Ng-Eaton E. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At least Ski protein degradation does not play any role in the negative feedback regulation of the TGF-β signaling.In the present study, we have identified a Ski-interacting protein, C184M. C184M induces the cytoplasmic accumulation of Ski, and the cytosolic C184M/Ski complex negatively regulates TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Smad2.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Screening and GST Pull-down Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screening using a mouse embryonic cDNA library and GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as described previously (20Nomura T.

K buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% skim milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ZnCl2, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) was used for binding between GST-C184M and in vitro translated Ski. For the binding between GST-Ski and in vitro translated C184M, SK-B buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.25 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) was used.Co-immunoprecipitation—By using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen), 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmids to express FLAG-C184M (N-FLAG-pact-C184M) (2.75 μg), Ski (pact-Ski) (2.75 μg), or SnoN (pact-SnoN) (2.75 μg) and the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal (0.5 μg). Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were suspended with TMLSLD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm NaF) and sonicated, and lysates were prepared. After measuring β-galactosidase activity, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-C184M antiserum or control serum. In some experiments, we used an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the beads with Harlow-150 buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl), the precipitated proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, and Western blotting was carried out with an anti-Ski or anti-Sno monoclonal antibody. For the experiments described in Fig. 5, 293T cells were transfected with mixture of plasmids to express FLAG-C184M (N-FLAG-pact-C184M) (1.8 μg), Ski (N-HA-pact-Ski) (1.6 μg), Smad2 (N-FLAG-pact-Smad2) (1.15 μg), Smad4 (N-FLAG-pact-Smad4) (0.65 μg), ALK5* (pCDNA3-ALK5*) (0.5 μg), and the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal (0.3 μg).Subcellular Localization of C184M, Ski, and Smads—For the experiments described in Fig. 4, N-FLAG-pact-C184M (1.5 μg) and pact-Ski (1.5 μg) were transfected into CV-1 cells by the CaPO4 method. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed on cover glasses with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 45 min at room temperature and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 12 min. After blocking with 3% skim milk/PBS, cells were immunostained with anti-Ski (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, N-20 or H-329), anti-Sno (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-317), and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa488 or TRITC, and analyzed with laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510). For the experiments described in Fig. 5, the monoclonal anti-Ski, anti-C184M, and anti-Smad2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology S-20) antibodies, and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa488, TRITC, or Cy5 were used. Cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258. Preparations were observed with BX60 microscope (Olympus), and captured images were deblurred by two-dimensional blind deconvolution with AutoDeblur software (Auto-Quant Imaging Inc.).Fig. 4Cytoplasmic co-localization of C184M with Ski.A–E, CV-1 cells were transfected with each of the plasmids to express the protein shown above, immunostained, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Ski and SnoN were visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. The FLAG-linked C184M proteins were stained with an anti-FLAG antibody and visualized with an Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody. WT, wild type. F–I, CV-1 cells were transfected with two plasmids to express the proteins shown above. Ski and SnoN were visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody, and FLAG-C184M was visualized with an Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody. The signals for both proteins are superimposed in the right-most panels. J, C184M increases the Ski protein levels. CV-1 cells were transfected with the HA-Ski or HA-SnoN expression vectors together with C184M expression vectors. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and then Western blotting was carried out with an anti-HA (upper panel) or anti-C184M antibody (lower panel). K, C184M increases the cytoplasmic Ski levels. CV-1 cells were transfected as described above, and the cell lysates were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, which were then used for Western blotting with an anti-Ski antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Growth Properties of Mv1Lu Cells Stably Expressing C184M—The C184M cDNA was inserted into the retrovirus vector pMSCV-IRES-neo (28Cosset F.L.

Mv1Lu cells were infected with this virus and maintained in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. G418-resistant cells were expanded in 96-well plates. To measure the growth rate of each cell line, cells (3 × 103/well in a 96-well plate) were incubated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 (Sigma) for 21 h, and BrdUrd incorporation was measured using the Cell Proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.Luciferase Reporter Assay—For the experiments described in Fig. 6C, a mixture of 3TP-Lux (50 ng) and the internal control phRL-TK(int-) (Promega; 10 ng) was transfected into the stable Mv1Lu cell lines, 1-2 (2 × 104/well in a 24-well plate), 2-8 (0.7 × 104), and 3-18 (2 × 104) using LipofectAMINE PLUS. Twenty four hours after transfection, TGF-β1 (final concentration 40 pm) was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 22–24 h. Firefly luciferase activity was measured together with Renilla luciferase activity (for an internal control) using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega).Fig. 6C184M negatively regulates TGF-β signaling.A, expression levels of C184M protein in stable cell lines. Mv1Lu cells were infected with retrovirus vector encoding wild-type C184M (2-8, 2-11, and 2-15), the ΔLR mutant (3-13 and 3-18) of C184M, or no proteins, and were cloned by G418 selection. Whole-cell lysates were used for Western blotting with anti-C184M proteins. The asterisk indicates endogenous C184M. WT, wild type. B, C184M blocks the TGF-β-induced growth inhibition. By using the Mv1Lu cell clones, BrdUrd incorporation was measured in the presence of various concentrations of TGF-β1. The average of three independent experiments is shown. C, C184M inhibits the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation. The Mv1Lu cell clones were transfected with the 3TP-Lux reporter, and luciferase assays were performed.

Cytoplasmic and nuclear extract were prepared as described previously (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3907) Google Scholar). Nuclear contamination of the cytoplasmic extracts was not significant since we could not detect the lamin A protein, a typical nuclear protein, in Western blotting using the cytoplasmic extract (data not shown).Histological Analysis—Deparaffinized sections of C57BL/6 mouse liver were stained with an anti-C184M polyclonal antibody (1:50) or a mixture of the anti-Ski monoclonal antibodies 1-1, 9-1, 11-1, and 16-1 (1:50) as described previously (31Shinagawa T. Nomura T. Colmenares C. Ohira M. Nakagawara A. Ishii S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8100-8108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of C184M Protein as a Ski-interacting Protein—To search for novel Ski-binding proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening as described previously (20Nomura T. Kahn M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using the full-length Ski as the bait and the mouse embryonic cDNA library. From this screen, we identified clones encoding the C184M protein. The c184m gene was originally identified as a gene whose expression is induced during mouse brain development (32Sakuma-Takagi M. Tohyama Y. Kasama-Yoshida H. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Kurihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The C184M protein is a small protein consisting of 189 amino acids and contains a hydrophobic amino acid-rich region with a putative leucine zipper motif (leucine-rich region (LR)) (Fig. 1A). A splicing variant of C184M has also been reported to be a putative receptor for the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (33Golovkina T.V. Dzuris J. van den Hoogen B. Jaffe A.B. Wright P.C. Cofer S.M. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3066-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this variant does not contain the LR (Fig. 1A and see “Discussion”). To examine the direct interaction between C184M and Ski, we carried out a GST pull-down assay. The in vitro translated C184M protein bound to a GST-Ski fusion protein (Fig. 1, B–D). To identify which region of C184M interacts with Ski, we used deletion mutants of C184M. A small fragment of C184M containing only the LR interacted with GST-Ski, but a ΔLR mutant that lacks the LR did not. Some mutants in which the leucines in the LR were mutated to prolines or alanines exhibited the impaired binding to GST-Ski (data not shown).Fig. 1The LR of C184M is required for binding to Ski.A, amino acid sequence of the C184M protein. Asterisks indicate the leucine residues that can form the leucine zipper motif. The dotted line above the sequence shows the hydrophobic (leucine-rich) region.

The results of the binding assays shown in D are indicated on the right. WT, wild type. C, analysis of the GST-Ski fusion protein containing full-length Ski. The GST-Ski fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. D, deletion mutants of in vitro translated 35S-C184M were mixed with the GST-Ski resin. The captured proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The relative binding activities of various forms of C184M are designated + and -, which indicate the relative binding efficiency to GST-Ski and GST is more than 20-fold and less than 5-fold, respectively. The amount of C184M protein in the input lane was 2.5% that used for the binding assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the specific region of the Ski protein that interacts with C184M, we performed similar GST pull-down assays using various forms of in vitro translated Ski and a GST-C184M fusion protein (Fig. 2). The full-length Ski protein binds to GST-C184M, and a C-terminal fragment containing the coiled-coil region (residues 556–728) also bound (Fig. 2C). A mutant lacking the C-terminal coiled-coil region (Δ493–728) did not bind to GST-C184M.Fig. 2The coiled-coil region of Ski interacts with C184M.A, schematic representation of the Ski protein used. The domain structure of Ski is shown in the top panel. The results of the binding assay shown in C are indicated on the right.

The expression vectors for both Ski and FLAG-linked C184M were transfected into 293T cells, and whole-cell lysates were prepared for co-immunoprecipitation. The full-length Ski protein was co-precipitated with wild-type C184M but not with the ΔLR mutant (Fig. 3A). The Δ493–728 mutant, which lacks the coiled-coil region of Ski, was not immunoprecipitated with wild-type C184M protein (Fig. 3A). When we used SnoN instead of Ski, SnoN was not efficiently co-precipitated with C184M, suggesting that C184M preferentially binds to Ski (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3In vivo association between C184M and Ski.A, co-immunoprecipitation assays. 293T cells were transfected with the Ski and FLAG-linked C184M expression vectors shown above. Whole-cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-C184M antibody or the control IgG. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-Ski or anti-FLAG antibody. In lanes 1,4, and 7, 20% of the lysates used for immunoprecipitation was directly used for Western blotting. WT, wild type. B, SnoN does not co-immunoprecipitate with C184M. Lysates were prepared from 293T cells that were transfected with the expression vectors shown above.

When we used full-length Ski, Δ493–728 Ski, or full-length SnoN alone, these proteins localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4, A–C). As reported previously (20Nomura T. Kahn M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), full-length Ski and SnoN tended to be condensed into a nuclear dot-like structure, but Δ493–728 Ski was not. In contrast, wild-type C184M alone localized mainly in the cytoplasm, although in some of the cells (about 10%), C184M localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 4D and data not shown). The ΔLR mutant of C184M alone localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in all cells (Fig. 4E). When wild-type Ski was co-expressed with wild-type C184M, the Ski signals were mainly seen in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4F1). The Ski signals partially co-localized with C184M signals (Fig. 4F1–3). We observed that the intensity of the Ski signals increased with co-expression of C184M, suggesting that C184M not only blocks the nuclear entry of Ski but also increases the levels of cytoplas"

The present work aims at the development of an IL-6 inhibitor for the use in anti-cytokine therapies. The IL-6 receptor is composed of two different subunits, an α-subunit (IL-6Rα) that binds IL-6 with low affinity and a औ-subunit (gp130) that binds the IL-6·IL-6Rα complex with high affinity and as a result triggers intracellular signaling. In its soluble form, gp130 is a natural antagonist that neutralizes IL-6·soluble IL-6Rα complexes. It was our strategy to appropriately fuse the two receptor subunit fragments involved in IL-6 receptor complex formation to bind IL-6 with high affinity and to antagonize its effects. The ligand-binding domains of gp130 (D1-D2-D3) and IL-6Rα (D2-D3) were connected using three different linkers. The resulting constructs were expressed in stably transfected insect cells and tested for their ability to inhibit IL-6 activity in several in vitro systems. All fusion proteins were strong inhibitors of IL-6 signaling and abrogated IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3, proliferation of transfected Ba/F3 cells, and induction of acute-phase protein synthesis.

Most effective has been the application of soluble cytokine receptors that consist solely of the ectodomain but lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. They bind the respective cytokine with high affinity and specificity as membrane-bound receptors do. In the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, the use of dimeric soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors for the neutralization of tumor necrosis factor has been a real breakthrough (1Goldenberg M.M.

It is the major mediator of the acute-phase response of the liver and is involved in the coordination of inflammatory and immune responses at the site of inflammation (2Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, in postmenopausal osteoporosis, but also in certain types of cancer, IL-6 levels are elevated and a causal role for IL-6 in disease progression has been suggested. In some cases inhibition of IL-6 activity by receptor antagonists or neutralizing antibodies has beneficial effects (3Wendling D. Racadot E. Wijdenes J. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 259-262PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bataille R. Barlogie B. Lu Z.Y. Rossi J.F. Lavabre-Bertrand T. Beck T. Wijdenes J. Brochier J. Klein B. Blood. 1995; 86: 685-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 belongs to the family of hematopoietic cytokines (5Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is a member of the subfamily of IL-6-type cytokines (6Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) comprising IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, cardiotrophin-1, and cardiotrophin-like cytokine. They all use the hematopoietic cytokine receptor gp130 as a common signal-transducing receptor subunit (7Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of receptor activation the transcription factor STAT3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus to induce target gene expression (8Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

Ihle J.N. Yancopoulus G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Expression of gp130 is not sufficient for cells to become responsive to IL-6. They additionally have to express the cytokine specific α-receptor subunit IL-6Rα. This α-receptor is not involved in the initiation of the cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades but is essential for cytokine binding. Thus, activation of the receptor by IL-6 requires two steps: (i) low affinity IL-6 binding to IL-6Rα and (ii) subsequent recruitment of the complex of IL-6 and IL-6Rα to two gp130 molecules leading to the formation of a high affinity ternary complex (10Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Cells lacking IL-6Rα can be stimulated with the combination of IL-6 and soluble IL-6Rα (sIL-6Rα) (10Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). In such a situation, IL-6 binds to sIL-6Rα in solution and the heterodimer of IL-6/sIL-6Rα activates membrane-bound gp130. Soluble gp130 (sgp130) alone acts as a relatively weak IL-6 antagonist (11Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Ohsugi Y. Fukui H. Koishihara Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the antagonizing activity of sgp130 is substantially increased by the presence of sIL-6Rα (12Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). Both sIL-6R (13Honda M. Yamamoto S. Cheng M. Yasukawa K. Suzuki H.

Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar) are found in high concentrations in human blood (about 50 and 300 ng/ml, respectively). This pair of soluble receptors might act as a natural IL-6 inhibitor to limit systemic IL-6 responses (12Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, IL-6 belongs to the family of the α-helix-bundle cytokines. IL-6Rα as well as gp130 belong to the family of class I cytokine receptors (5Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The extracellular regions of IL-6Rα and gp130 consist of three (D1–D3) (15Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) or six domains (D1–D6) (16Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), respectively. D2 and D3 of IL-6Rα are involved in IL-6 binding (17Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The complex of IL-6 and IL-6Rα is bound by D1–D3 of gp130 (18Horsten U. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Müllberg J. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). IL-6 contains three receptor-binding sites. Site I is occupied by D2-D3 of IL-6Rα, and sites II and III bind to D2-D3 and D1 of gp130, respectively (19Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Kurth I. Horsten U. Pflanz S. Dahmen H. Küster A. Grötzinger J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1480-1487PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pflanz S. Kurth I. Grötzinger J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on the mutagenesis data and the recently solved structure of D1–D3 of gp130 bound to viral IL-6, which binds gp130 in the absence of any α-receptor, a reliable model of the IL-6·IL-6Rα·gp130 ternary complex has been proposed (22Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Inhibition of IL-6 activity by the use of soluble receptors is challenging because of the bipartite nature of the IL-6 receptor. IL-6 alone does not bind to gp130. To be neutralized by sgp130, IL-6 must first bind to sIL-6Rα. A fusion protein of gp130 and sIL-6Rα would therefore guarantee that the agonistic complex of IL-6·sIL-6Rα is immediately neutralized. Only recently, due to the new structural data on the IL-6·receptor complex (22Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), a promising rational approach on how to design an IL-6-antagonist based on a fusion of sgp130 with sIL-6Rα became possible. In this study, we present a highly potent IL-6 antagonist consisting of the ligand-binding moieties of sgp130 and sIL-6Rα. A fragment corresponding to D2-D3 of IL-6Rα (Val110–Lys338) was amplified by PCR introducing a multiple cloning site (SmaI,NotI, MluI, NheI) with the sense primer and aApaI site, a stop codon instead of Met331, and aBamHI site with the antisense primer. The product was cut with SmaI (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) andBamHI (MBI Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and cloned into pSVL-gp130 (D1–D3) (Met1–Pro326) digested with the same enzymes. Then three different linkers were added after digestion of the obtained chimeric construct with MluI (Promega, Madison, WI) and NheI (MBI Fermentas GmbH). The first linker (stalk-49) corresponding to the short extracellular membrane proximal part of IL-6Rα (Ala323–Val362) was produced by PCR. Its amino acid sequence is GSAAATRAEN EVSTPMQALT TNKDDDNILF RDSANATSLP VQDSSSVAS. The two other linkers were constructed with hybridized oligonucleotides. The 41 amino acids of AGS-41 are GSAAATRGSA GSGGSATGSG SAAGSGDSVA AGSGGGSGSA S. AGS-33 consists of the sequence GSAAATRGSA GSGGSATGSG SAAGSGDSVR RAS. A FLAG tag was added to the C terminus of all fusion proteins using hybridization of an oligonucleotide pair containing ApaI,XbaI, and BamHI restriction sites and a stop codon. The fusion protein constructs were subcloned into the pIB/v5-his vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) cut withBamHI and HindIII (Roche Diagnostic GmbH) to express the protein in insect cells. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. High 5 (H5) cells cultured in Sf-900II medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) were stably transfected with the empty pIB/v5-his vector or vectors containing the fusion protein constructs, using the CellFECTIN method (Invitrogen). Cell supernatants were harvested every 3 days, cleared by centrifugation, and stored at −20 °C until use. The fusion proteins from cell supernatants were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with IL-6 covalently linked to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PALL, Dreieich, Germany), incubated with the antibodies as indicated in the figures, and processed for chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences AB). Antibodies used for protein detection were as follows: sIL-6Rα (Eurogentec, Philadelphia, PA), Tyr(P) STAT3 (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), and STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). 200–500 ml of H5 cell supernatants containing the respective fusion proteins were applied to an IL-6-Sepharose column (2 ml) at 4 °C. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were eluted with 6 ml of 2m MgCl2. The eluate was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline or cell culture medium, and subsequently the amounts of fusion proteins were measured by ELISA. An ELISA procedure was performed as described previously (12Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar), using 0.3 ॖg/well of FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for coating and 50 ng/well of biotinylated monoclonal antibody B-T2 (DIACLONE, Besançon, France) as secondary antibody. The standard curve was obtained by 2-fold serial dilutions of sgp130-FLAG expressed in COS-7 cells and calibrated by sgp130 ELISA (12Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R and Ba/F3-gp130-IL11R cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal calf serum, seeded on 96-well plates (20,000 cells/well), and stimulated with IL-6 (0.9 ng/ml) or trx-IL-11 (5 ng/ml) prepared as described previously (23Dahmen H. Horsten U. Küster A. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. Kerr I.M. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in the presence of purified fp stalk-49 (500 ng/ml first concentration) or purified mock-vector-transfected cell supernatant. After 60 h of incubation, metabolically active cells were quantified using a colorimetric assay based on the cell proliferation kit II XTT assay (Roche Diagnostic GmbH). α1-Anti-chymotrypsin synthesized by HepG2 cells was measured by immunoprecipitation of radioactively labeled protein as described previously (12Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein was designed to contain the minimal regions of IL-6Rα and gp130 required for high affinity IL-6 binding. Moreover, the N terminus of mature gp130 should not be affected by the fusion, since it is important for ligand binding (24Moritz R.L. Ward L.D. Tu G.F. Fabri L.J. Ji H. Yasukawa K. Simpson R.J. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the fusion protein consists of domains D1-D2-D3 of gp130 (including the signal sequence at the N terminus that directs its secretion) followed by a linker and domains D2 and D3 of IL-6Rα (Fig.1A, upper scheme). The two receptor fragments have to be connected by the linker in a way that allows the fusion protein to adopt the conformation required for efficient neutralization of IL-6. According to the ternary complex model based on the x-ray structure of viral IL-6 bound to D1–D3 of gp130 (22Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the C terminus of gp130-D3 and the N terminus of sIL-6Rα-D2 are separated by at least 8 nm. This distance can be bridged by a peptide linker of about 30–40 amino acids (Fig.1A, lower part). The linker should be of high conformational flexibility, of low immunogenicity, and resistant to protease degradation. Three fusion proteins containing different linkers were constructed. Two of them, AGS-33 and AGS-41, are made of flexible Ala-, Gly-, and Ser-rich peptides of 33 and 41 amino acids, respectively. In an extended conformation these linkers span from about 10 (AGS-33) to 12 nm (AGS-41). The third one (fp stalk-49) consists of a short flexible fragment of the extracellular membrane-proximal part of IL-6Rα (25Varghese J.N. Moritz R.L. Lou M.Z. Van Donkelaar A. Ji H. Ivancic N. Branson K.M. Hall N.E. Simpson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Besides its flexibility, this linker is expected to be of low immunogenicity, since it is derived from the endogenous IL-6Rα. For technical reasons, a FLAG tag epitope was added at the C termini of all constructs (Fig. 1A, upper scheme). For continuous production of the fusion proteins stably transfected H5 insect cell lines were generated. The fusion proteins were precipitated from cell supernatants with IL-6-Sepharose and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular masses of the fusion proteins are 83.5 kDa for fp stalk-49, 69.5 kDa for fp AGS-33, and 72 kDa for fp AGS-41. The substantially higher molecular mass of fp stalk-49 is most likely due to an additional N-glycosylation site (Asn-Ala-Thr) introduced with the linker. We took advantage of the affinity of the fusion proteins to IL-6 for their purification and concentration with IL-6-Sepharose. The insect cell supernatant, the flow-through and the eluate of IL-6 affinity chromatography were analyzed for the presence of fusion protein by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Compared with the supernatant (sn, left lane), the fusion protein is strongly enriched in the eluate. No fusion protein is detectable in the flow-through fractions. The concentrations of fusion protein in the fractions determined by a newly developed ELISA correlate well with the intensities of the bands in the Western blot (Fig. 1C). After dialysis, enriched fp stalk-49 was used for the following studies. Supernatants containing the other fusion proteins and supernatants of mock-transfected insect cells were treated the same way. The latter was used as negative control in the bioassays. To test the IL-6 antagonizing activity of the fusion proteins, supernatants of stably transfected insect cells were incubated with IL-6 for 30 min to allow the fusion protein to bind to IL-6. Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with gp130 and IL-6Rα (Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R) were stimulated with the IL-6-treated supernatants. After 30 min, cells were lysed, and STAT3 phosphorylation was analyzed. In the presence of supernatant from mock-transfected insect cells, stimulation of Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R cells with 0.5 ng/ml IL-6 is sufficient to induce prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig.2A, upper andlower panels, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R cells with IL-6 that was preincubated with supernatants from cells expressing the fusion proteins did not result in significant tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig.2A, upper panel, lanes 3–5). Thus, all three fusion proteins in the supernatants inhibit IL-6 signaling, since no STAT3 phosphorylation is observed in response to IL-6. A 2-fold higher IL-6 concentration (1 ng/ml) is neutralized only incompletely by the supernatant containing fp AGS-33 (Fig.2A, lower panel, lane 4). IL-6 is the major inducer of acute-phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes, but also in hepatoma cell lines such as HepG2. IL-6 stimulation (1 ng/ml) leads to a substantially increased α1-anti-chymotrypsin production by HepG2 cells as shown by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled protein (Fig.2B, lanes 1 and 2). Purified proteins of control supernatant do not affect α1-anti-chymotrypsin synthesis (Fig. 2B, lane 3). In the presence of the concentrated fusion proteins (30 ng/ml), α1-anti-chymotrypsin synthesis is reduced to the basal level (Fig. 2B,lanes 4–6). Thus, all three fusion proteins inhibit IL-6-induced acute-phase protein synthesis. To demonstrate the specificity of the inhibitory fusion proteins, we compared the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with gp130 and IL-6Rα or gp130 and IL-11Rα (Ba/F3-gp130-IL11R) in response to 0.9 ng/ml IL-6 or 5 ng/ml IL-11, required for 50 or 807 of maximal cell proliferation, respectively. Trx-IL-11 is a fusion protein of thioredoxin and IL-11 exhibiting IL-11 activity indistinguishable from IL-11 wild type (23Dahmen H. Horsten U. Küster A. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. Kerr I.M. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proliferation of Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R cells treated with a constant amount of IL-6 is inhibited by the fusion protein fp stalk-49 in a concentration-dependent manner. Purified control supernatant had no significant effect (Fig.3A, left diagram). At a fusion protein concentration of 250–500 ng/ml, cell proliferation is completely abrogated. Proliferation of Ba/F3-gp130-IL11R cells in response to trx-IL-11, however, is not significantly disturbed by fp stalk-49 (Fig. 3A, right diagram). Thus fp stalk-49 specifically inhibits IL-6, but not IL-11 responses. Similar observations were made for the remaining fusion proteins (data not shown). Next, we proved that the appropriate fusion of the ligand-binding domains of gp130 and IL-6Rα leads to a more potent inhibitor than sgp130 and sIL-6Rα separately expressed in insect cells. The inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R cells induced by 0.5 ng/ml IL-6 achieved with 1.5 ng/ml fp stalk-49 was compared with inhibition by the combination of sgp130 and sIL-6Rα (Fig. 3B). The approximately equimolar ratio of IL-6 and fp stalk-49 is sufficient for almost full suppression of IL-6 induced STAT3 activation (lanes 1–3). In contrast to this extremely high antagonistic potency of the fusion protein, a molar ratio of 1:100 of IL-6 and the combination of sIL-6Rα and sgp130 is required to achieve inhibitory activity (lanes 4–6). We conclude that the fusion proteins are of ∼100-fold increased inhibitory activity compared with the separate soluble receptor proteins. In this study we present a highly potent IL-6 inhibitor based on the ligand-binding domains of the IL-6 receptor subunits IL-6Rα and gp130. Many of the existing IL-6 receptor antagonists are IL-6 mutants of binding sites to gp130 (sites II and III). They block IL-6Rα by binding via the intact site I but do not recruit gp130 (26Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. deHon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Liu J. Wollmer A. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1744-1753PubMed Google Scholar,27Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Since the interaction of IL-6 with IL-6Rα is of low affinity, so called superantagonists were created by mutating the site I of these antagonists to strengthen α-receptor binding. Although the superantagonists perform better, they still have to be applied in a large excess to IL-6 (27Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, due to the many mutations the proteins are highly immunogenic (28Ciapponi L. Maione D. Scoumanne A. Costa P. Hansen M.B. Svenson M. Bendtzen K. Alonzi T. Paonessa G. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. Savino R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neutralizing IL-6 or IL-6Rα antibodies have also been used as IL-6 inhibitors. They were tested in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (3Wendling D. Racadot E. Wijdenes J. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 259-262PubMed Google Scholar) or AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (29Racadot E. Audhuy B. Duvernoy H. Thyss A. Lang J.M. Wijdenes J. Herve P. Cytokines Mol. Ther. 1995; 1: 133-138PubMed Google Scholar) but turned out to be of rather low efficiency. Very recently, potent low molecular mass IL-6 receptor antagonists were described for the first time (30Hayashi M. Rho M.C. Fukami A. Enomoto A. Nonaka S. Sekiguchi Y. Yanagisawa T. Yamashita A. Nogawa T. Kamano Y. Komiyama K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Hayashi M. Rho M.C. Enomoto A. Fukami A. Kim Y.P. Kikuchi Y. Sunazuka T. Hirose T. Komiyama K. Omura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14728-14733Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These antagonists have to be applied in the micromolar range to inhibit picomolar amounts of IL-6. A new generation of cytokine antagonists is based on soluble receptor fragments that bind the ligand with high affinity and specificity. In the case of IL-6, two receptor subunits are required for high affinity binding, IL-6Rα and gp130. Moreover, the complex of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα acts agonistically on cells expressing gp130 (10Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Conversely, sIL-6Rα supports neutralization of IL-6 by sgp130 due to formation of a soluble high affinity ternary complex (12Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). The new IL-6 receptor antagonist presented in this study stems from the idea that appropriate fusion of the ligand-binding domains of IL-6Rα and gp130 should result in a superior antagonist that neutralizes IL-6 with highest affinity and specificity. In the present study three different linkers were used to connect the ligand-binding domains of gp130 and IL-6Rα. It turned out that the fusion proteins exhibit similar inhibitory activities, indicating that the estimation of the required linker length has been correct and appropriate peptide linkers were chosen. All three fusion proteins bind IL-6 as shown by precipitation with IL-6-Sepharose. The fusion protein present in the insect cell supernatant is sufficient to completely antagonize the activity of 0.5 ng/ml (25 pm) IL-6 in the short term STAT3 phosphorylation assay using transfected Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 2A). Since the concentrations of the fusion proteins in the insect cell supernatants are in the range of 1–2 ng/ml (15–30 pm), this points to an inhibitory activity at a molar ratio between agonist and antagonist of 1:1. In a long term assay such as induction of acute-phase protein synthesis in HepG2 cells, the activity of 1 ng/ml (50 pm) IL-6 was totally blocked by the addition of inhibitory fusion protein at a nearly 10-fold molar excess (450 pm). In the Ba/F3 proliferation assay with fp stalk-49, we determined an IC50of 6 ng/ml (90 pm) for the inhibition of 0.9 ng/ml IL-6 (45 pm). Thus, in long term assays and therefore also for studies of the inhibitory activity of the fusion proteins in vivo, an about 10-fold molar excess of fusion protein over IL-6 should be applied. Besides their inhibitory activity the specificity of the fusion proteins is an important feature to assess their potential value for anti-cytokine therapies. IL-11 most closely resembles IL-6 because it also signals via gp130 homodimers but binds to a different α-receptor, namely IL-11Rα. In the Ba/F3-proliferation assay, amounts of fusion proteins that significantly inhibit IL-6 activity had no effect on IL-11 induced proliferation (data shown only for fp stalk-49). Therefore, at the concentrations used in our assays each of the three fusion proteins is a potent and specific inhibitor of IL-6 activity. The superior activity of the fused ligand-binding domains of gp130 and IL-6Rα compared with the separate soluble receptors sgp130 and sIL-6Rα is probably the most important issue left to be proven to confirm the value of our concept. IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells is inhibited by the presence of equimolar amounts of fusion protein. To achieve a similar inhibition an at least 100-fold molar excess of sgp130 and sIL-6Rα has to be applied. This intriguing result clearly demonstrates the extraordinary high inhibitory activity of the fusion protein. What is the explanation for this finding? In the above assay, a low amount of IL-6 that is in the range of pathophysiological IL-6 concentrations (500 pg/ml) was applied. When the separate soluble receptors were used, IL-6 first binds to the sIL-6Rα. This interaction is of low affinity, and therefore the complex of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα might dissociate before it encounters sgp130. In the fusion protein, the initial complex of IL-6 bound to domains D2 and D3 of IL-6Rα can be immediately trapped by the covalently linked ligand-binding domains of gp130 before dissociation occurs. Our inhibitor strategy is also applicable to other cytokines that signal via heteromeric receptor complexes. Indeed, in a recent publication Economides et al. (32Economides A.N. Carpenter L.R. Rudge J.S. Wong V. Koehler-Stec E.M. Hartnett C. Pyles E.A. Xu X. Daly T.J. Young M.R. Fandl J.P. Lee F. Carver S. McNay J. Bailey K. Ramakanth S. Hutabarat R. Huang T.T. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Stahl N. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) used a similar approach to create so called “cytokine traps” as highly potent inhibitors for IL-1, IL-4, and IL-6. In their study the complete ectodomains of the respective receptor subunits including the regions dispensable for ligand binding were fused to the Fc part of human IgG. This results in dimerization of the receptor chains by disulfide bond formation of the Fc parts. In the case of the IL-6 inhibitor, this leads, besides the desired sgp130-Fc/sIL-6Rα-Fc heterodimers, to the formation of gp130-Fc/gp130-Fc and sIL-6Rα-Fc/sIL-6Rα-Fc homodimers. As a consequence, before application, the heterodimer must be separated from the homodimers. On the XG-1 myeloma cells an IC50 of 50 pm sgp130-Fc/sIL-6Rα-Fc was determined for the neutralization of 2.5 pm (0.05 ng/ml) IL-6 (32Economides A.N. Carpenter L.R. Rudge J.S. Wong V. Koehler-Stec E.M. Hartnett C. Pyles E.A. Xu X. Daly T.J. Young M.R. Fandl J.P. Lee F. Carver S. McNay J. Bailey K. Ramakanth S. Hutabarat R. Huang T.T. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Stahl N. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). On our Ba/F3-gp130-IL6R cells treated with 45 pmIL-6, the IC50 of fp stalk-49 is 90 pm. If one takes into account the molar ratio between the IL-6 concentration in the two different proliferation assays and the IC50 of the respective inhibitor, it turns out that fp stalk-49 is about 10-fold more potent than sgp130-Fc/sIL-6Rα-Fc. These findings suggest that the more structure-based approach presented in our study confirms the validity of the basic concept and furthermore leads to optimized inhibitory fusion proteins. We conclude that appropriate fusion of the ligand-binding domains of soluble receptor proteins leads to cytokine inhibitors of extraordinary activity which might be of considerable therapeutical value for the development of new anti-cytokine therapies.

Absence of PS1 (PS1–/–) is associated with reduced amounts of maturely glycosylated nicastrin and redistribution of nicastrin to diffuse intracellular sites. Absence of PS2 (PS2–/–) in brain is associated with less profound reductions, predominantly in the levels of immature forms. Our data suggest that the interactions of PS2 and PS1 with nicastrin have different functional effects on normal maturation, trafficking, and subcellular distribution of nicastrin.

The PS1 overexpressing transgenic lines were crossed with PS2–/– or PS1–/– mice to generate mice overexpressing exogenous PS1 on a PS1–/– or PS2–/– background. The mice were sacrificed at 6 days or at 3 months of age. The brains were removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C. Granule Neurons—Granule neurons were isolated by trituration of enzymatically dissociated cerebella from 6-day-old mice. The neurons were maintained in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.6% glucose, 25 mm KCl, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes. To inhibit glial proliferation, 4 μm cytosine arabinfuranoside was added 18 h post-plating. The cells were used at 7 days in vitro. Immunostaining for neuron-specific enolase confirmed that cultures were ∼95% neuronal. Cerebellar Astrocytes—Cerebellar astrocytes were obtained from postnatal day 8 or 9 cerebella by a similar protocol. Glia were plated in minimum essential medium as above but in 5 mm KCl and without addition of cytosine arabinofuranoside. After 3 days in vitro, the glial plating medium was replaced with medium in which 15 mm sorbitol was substituted for glucose to eliminate remaining neuronal and microglial elements. The cultures were passaged by trypsinization upon reaching confluence and were typically seeded 1:4 at 3–6-day intervals. The cells from passages 3–5 were used for Western blotting, biotinylation, metabolic labeling, and immunocytochemical studies. All of the cells were immunopositive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Dermal Fibroblasts—Dermal fibroblasts were cultured from the ears, ventral skin, and tails of 2-day-old mice. The cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 2 mm glutamine and 20% fetal bovine serum. The cells were passaged 2–6 times before seeding onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips for immunocytochemical studies. Brain tissues and cell cultures were washed in cold PBS and homogenized with ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentration analysis was performed by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 50 μg of total protein from tissue or cell lysates were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated on Tris-Tricine gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (equal loadings were confirmed by Western blotting for actin). The target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) with antibodies to nicastrin (1: 1000 dilution anti-nicastrin C-terminal antibody; Affinity Bioreagents Inc.), to the PS1 N-terminal fragment (1:8000 dilution antibody 14; gift from Dr. S. E. Gandy), to the PS2 N-terminal fragment (1:800 NT14), and to actin (1:2500 anti-actin polyclonal antibody; Sigma). Where necessary, the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped for reuse. The intensities of bands on Western blots were measured by densitometry using NIH Image 1.62 software. Mouse brain tissue from PS1–/–, PS2–/–, or wild type mice was homogenized with ice-cold homogenization buffer (130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The postnuclear supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min and at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was layered on a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, and 2.5% (v/v) iodixanol (Accurate) in homogenization buffer. After centrifugation at 27,000 rpm (SW40 rotor, Beckman) for 32 min, 11 fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of nicastrin and protein markers of subcellular organelles by Western blotting. To assess the maturation of nicastrin glycosylation, pooled fractions 9–11 (containing ER markers) and pooled fractions 4–7 (containing Golgi markers) were treated with endoglycosidase H as previously described (10Yang D.S.

The Student's t test for independent groups was used to compare band density on autoradiographs of Western blots. To permit comparison across independent experiments, the band intensities of the mature and immature forms of nicastrin in PS1–/– or PS2–/– mice were normalized to those of control wild type mice in the same experiment. Thus, the normalized relative band intensities for control mice were 1.0. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of normalized band intensities. Immunocytochemistry was performed on primary glial cultures prepared from 8-day-old wild type and PS1–/– B6 × 129 mice. The cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. The cells were fixed by 30 min of incubation in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized by immersing coverslips in PBS with 0.02% Triton X-100 for 30 min and incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 5% normal goat serum pH 7.4). For cell surface staining of nicastrin and TrkB (as a positive control), the cells were directly incubated with primary antibody. The coverslips were exposed overnight at 4 °C to primary antibodies, which were diluted in blocking buffer to 1:200 (rabbit anti-nicastrin polyclonal) or 1:100 (mouse monoclonal TrkB, or organelle marker antibodies to GM130 or Bip). Following three washes in PBS, secondary labeling was done with Cy2-coupled anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratories; 1:800 dilution) and Cy3-coupled anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratories; 1:800 dilution) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Mouse glial cultures were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.5; 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 30 min on ice with 1 mg/ml EZ-link NHS-biotin (Pierce). The reaction was stopped by washing the cells once and then incubating for 10 min on ice with 50 mm glycine in PBS (pH 8.5; 1 mm MgCl2). The cells were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors; Sigma) and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were cleared by 21,000 × g centrifugation and assayed for protein content (BCA protein assay; Pierce). The lysate volumes were adjusted to equalize protein concentration, and 1300 μl of each sample was used for affinity purification with 50 μl of Sepharose beads conjugated to neutravidin (Pierce). Following overnight rocking at 4 °C, the beads were washed two times with 1 ml lysis buffer, and two times with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA). The bound proteins were solubilized by heating the beads for 10 min at 65 °C in 2× SDS Tris-glycine sample buffer (Invitrogen) and separated on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, they were probed with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-nicastrin (1:2500) and anti-pan-cadherin (1:2500; Sigma), mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-calnexin (1:2500; Transduction Laboratories), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:1000; Biodesign). After 6 days in culture, neurons and glia were preincubated for1hin methionine-free and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 300 μCi/ml Tran35S-labeling reagent (ICN) was added for 30 min. The media were replaced with unlabeled conditioned medium containing 1 mm methionine and 1 mm cysteine for 1–16 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and nicastrin was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-nicastrin CT antibody and analyzed by 10% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen).

In brain tissue from wild type mice and from PS1–/– mice, nicastrin was detected both as a poorly glycosylated, immature form (∼105 kDa) and as a highly glycosylated, mature form (∼125 kDa). However, when the levels of nicastrin expression in PS1–/– and wild type mouse brain were compared by normalizing to the level of expression in wild type mice (1.00 ± 0.03), nicastrin was expressed at much lower levels in PS1–/– brain (0.52 ± 0.06; p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). In contrast to the results reported in fibroblasts (which displayed either no change or a small increase in immature nicastrin) (11Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O.

In agreement with these prior studies, there was a much larger reduction in the level of the mature nicastrin in PS1–/– mouse brain (0.26 ± 0.07) relative to wild type brain (1.00 ± 0.08; p < 0.001). This reduction in nicastrin expression was not related to developmental age, because similar results were observed in 3-month-old mice (data not shown). The reduction was a specific consequence of the absence of PS1 because these changes were fully rescued when either exogenous wild type human PS1 (Fig. 1) or FAD mutant human PS1 (not shown) was introduced by cross-breeding the PS1–/– mice with mice bearing a human PS1 transgene. When nicastrin expression was examined in brain homogenates from PS2–/– mice, it was discovered that the overall levels of nicastrin (0.62 ± 0.04; n = 12) were also slightly reduced in comparison with those in wild type mice (1.00 ± 0.07; n = 10; p = 0.001) (Fig. 2). The reductions observed in PS2–/– mice were almost entirely due to the loss of immature forms of nicastrin (0.57 ± 0.07) (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). The amount of mature nicastrin was not significantly different between wild type (1.00 ± 0.17) and PS2–/– mice (0.80 ± 0.11, p > 0.05) (Fig. 2). Direct comparison of the effects of null mutations in PS1 and PS2 on nicastrin biology revealed a dramatic difference in their effects on the stabilization of mature nicastrin isoforms (PS1–/–:0.26 ± 0.07; PS2–/–:0.80 ± 0.11; p < 0.001) but equivalent effects on immature nicastrin isoforms, which were reduced to about half the level in wild type mice (PS1–/–, 0.59 ± 0.07; PS2–/–, 0.57 ± 0.07; p = not significant). We have shown previously that glycosylation and trafficking of nicastrin to the Golgi is essential for the functional activity of the presenilins (9Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T.

To investigate whether the absence of PS1 and/or PS2 might alter the processing and intracellular distribution of nicastrin, we used iodixanol gradient fractionation to separate Golgi and ER-derived membranes (Fig. 3) (9Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P. St George-Hyslop P. Nat.

Schmidt S.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Nixon R.A. Mathews P.M. Gandy S.E. Mount H.T. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol.

The distribution of mature and immature nicastrin species was similar in PS2–/– brain tissue, although the overall abundance of nicastrin was reduced in PS2–/– mouse brain (Fig. 3). In contrast, in PS1–/– mouse brain, both the abundance and the distribution of nicastrin isoforms were grossly disturbed. The higher molecular mass, endoglycosidase H glycosidase-resistant, mature forms of nicastrin were distributed broadly but at very low levels throughout the gradient (Fig. 3; note that the PS1–/– and PS2–/– blots are longer exposures than the wild type blot). These data imply that in PS1–/– cells, some nicastrin molecules do reach the cis-Golgi and are glycosylated. However, they are not stabilized and compartmentalized appropriately, resulting in the presence of small amounts of maturely glycosylated forms of nicastrin in aberrant locations, including the early secretory pathway. In PS2–/– cells, although the processing and stabilization of immature forms of nicastrin are inefficient, a portion does reach the Golgi, where it is presumably stabilized by PS1. To confirm these results, the subcellular distribution of nicastrin was also examined by confocal microscopy using both permeabilized and nonpermeabilized glia. In glia from wild type mice, nicastrin immunoreactivity appeared as distinct granular structures that were distributed from ER to Golgi (Fig. 4A, upper rows) and as a diffuse punctate pattern on the cell surface (Fig. 4A, lower rows; TrkB was used as a positive control). The intracellular anti-nicastrin staining colocalized mostly with the ER protein Bip (Fig. 4E, upper rows) but also overlapped with structures that contained markers for the Golgi (GM130; Fig. 4C, upper rows). In contrast, and in agreement with the biochemical studies described above, nicastrin immunofluorescence in glial cells obtained from PS1–/– mice was substantially reduced (Fig. 4B, upper rows). Furthermore, in agreement with the biochemical studies in PS1–/– glial cells (described below) and in PS1–/– fibroblasts described previously (11Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), nicastrin immunoreactivity at the cell surface was massively reduced or absent in PS1–/– cells (Fig. 4B, upper rows). The subcellular distribution of nicastrin immunoreactivity in PS2–/– cells showed no obvious change (Fig. 4B, lower rows, D, and F). The localization of nicastrin in subcellular domains that do not contain robust levels of presenilins even in wild type cells is concordant with previous biochemical fractionation studies showing that a significant portion of nicastrin exists in high molecular mass, membrane-bound fractions that contain little or no presenilin immunoreactivity (3Yu G.

These perturbations in cell surface labeling of nicastrin were independently corroborated by covalently labeling glial cell surface proteins with a membrane impermeant biotinylating reagent. In wild type cells, only maturely glycosylated nicastrin was affinity purified by neutravidin beads following biotinylation, and this fraction represented ∼3% of total cellular nicastrin (Fig. 5). In contrast, recovery of biotinylated nicastrin was substantially reduced in PS1–/– cells and consisted of both mature and immature forms of nicastrin. Cadherin, a positive control protein that reaches the cell surface, and calnexin, a negative control protein that is confined to ER membranes, were equivalently recovered in wild type and PS1–/– cells. This result is also in good agreement with the altered distribution of mature and immature forms of nicastin on biochemical subcellular fractionation (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the changes in subcellular distribution of nicastrin in PS1–/– cells are not due to nonspecific changes in protein trafficking. To examine the dynamic processing of nicastrin in presenilin-deficient cells, pulse-chase labeling studies were performed in both granule cells and glia purified from wild type, PS1–/–, or PS2–/– mouse brains (Fig. 6). In neurons from wild type mice, mature forms of nicastrin could be detected ∼2 h following metabolic labeling, although there was significant persistence of immature forms up to 16 h (in agreement with the Western blotting data from whole brain homogenates) (compare with Figs. 1 and 2). In PS2–/– granule cells, mature forms of nicastrin were also detectable at 2 h following labeling. However, in contrast to wild type neurons, the intensity of the immature band decayed slightly at ∼2 h, such that the relative intensities of the signals from immature and mature forms of nicastrin were approximately equal at 16 h after chase. This is in agreement with the static observations in whole brain lysates and suggests that, in the absence of PS2, immature nicastrin is slightly destabilized. In granule cells from PS1–/– brains, the amount of nicastrin was significantly reduced and could only be visualized after prolonged exposure (∼30 days). Not only were the levels reduced, but the appearance of mature forms of nicastrin was delayed until 4–8 h. Analysis of the pulse-chase data from cultured glia revealed a similar pattern of delayed and reduced maturation of nicastrin in PS1–/– cells and destabilization of immature nicastrin in PS2–/– cells. These studies suggest that, in both PS1-deficient neurons and glia, nicastrin fails to undergo appropriate glycosylation maturation. In contrast, in PS2-deficient neurons and glia, the maturation of nicastrin is much less affected, with the principal changes being a subtle reduction in the signal intensity for immature isoforms of nicastrin in PS2–/– cells at 4 and 8 h compared with wild type cells. When considered together with other data, our experiments reveal that PS1 and PS2 are required for the correct stabilization, glycosylation, and trafficking of nicastrin. These results are in good agreement with the conclusion that both nicastrin and the presenilins are required to form stable, high molecular mass complexes (11Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D.

Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, close inspection of our results also reveals that PS1 and PS2 do not have equivalent roles in the maturation of nicastrin. In PS1-deficient mice, there was a much greater reduction in the levels of all forms of nicastrin, and there was an especially marked reduction in the maturely glycosylated forms. In contrast, in PS2-deficient mouse brains, there was a less pronounced reduction in overall nicastrin levels, and this reduction was predominantly in the immaturely glycosylated forms. Furthermore, the magnitude of the reductions in immature nicastrin was similar in PS1–/– and PS2–/– murine brain. These results suggest that the stabilization of the high molecular mass, terminally glycosylated forms of nicastrin in brain is primarily dependent on PS1. The roles of PS1 and PS2 in the stabilization of the immaturely glycosylated forms of nicastrin are more complex and may depend on other factors, such as APH-1, which we have shown to bind to immature forms of nicastrin and the presenilins (16Gu Y. Chen F. Sanjo N. Kawarai T. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Li W. Ruan X. Luthra A. Mount H.T. Tandon A. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7374-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Indeed, the factors stabilizing immature nicastrin may be cell type-dependent in view of these differences in the metabolic fates of immature isoforms of nicastrin in glia and neurons (Fig. 6). Although both PS1 and PS2 are likely to be involved in the initial maturation and trafficking of immature nicastrin, their activities are not fully redundant. Thus, in the absence of PS2, PS1 is still able to capture sufficient immature nicastrin to generate normal levels of mature nicastrin. In contrast, PS2 by itself is unable to fully support the complete maturation of nicastrin. The differential effects of PS1 and PS2 deficiency on nicastrin processing parallel the different effects of PS1 and PS2 deficiency on APP and Notch processing. In PS1–/– cells, there are significant reductions in the amounts of mature glycosylated nicastrin (this study), and these reductions are accompanied by significant parallel reductions in the activities of both γ-secretase (5De Strooper B.

In contrast, in PS2–/– cells, the reductions in mature nicastrin levels (this study) and in γ-secretase/S3-secretase activity are both relatively minor (17Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D.

This raises the possibility that these events are mechanistically linked in one of two ways. First, it is conceivable that the presenilins play the same role in the proteolytic processing of nicastrin, APP, and Notch. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no evidence that nicastrin undergoes proteolytic cleavage (in contrast to APP (5De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar), Notch (4De Strooper B. Annert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S.

Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar)). The alternate possibility is that the activities of the presenilins could be mediated through their overlapping but nonidentical effects on nicastrin processing. The precise details of the interaction between each of the presenilins and nicastrin remain to be fully worked out. It is tempting to speculate that both PS1 and PS2 facilitate the entry of immature nicastrin into compartments for glycosylation, after which nicastrin enters the mature, functionally active presenilin complexes. PS1 might also be necessary for the stabilization of these mature glycosylated forms of nicastrin and for their correct translocation to the subcellular sites of γ/ϵ-secretase and S3 site cleavage of APP and Notch. Although our results are compatible with a role for the presenilins in regulating intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins, our data do not prove that this stabilization/trafficking activity is an authentic functional property of the presenilins (which have also been postulated to have catalytic activity). Nevertheless, previous experiments in invertebrates have suggested that PS1 may be involved in intracellular trafficking of nicastrin (11Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O.

Indeed, another presenilin homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans called spe4 is involved in the intracellular compartmentalization of the major sperm protein (24L'Hernault S.W.L. Arduengo P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, an important corollary of our results is that the absence of any component of the nicastrin-presenilin complex has effects on the other components of the complex. This necessarily makes the assignment of specific functional properties to any given member of the complex problematic. We thank Karen Duff and Sarah Lincoln for the PS2–/– mouse line."

Several genes encoding potential telomere-binding proteins have recently been identified in higher plants, but nothing is known about their function or regulation during cell division.

The predicted protein sequence of NgTRF1 (Mr = 75,000) contains a single Myb-like domain with significant homology to a corresponding motif in human TRF1/Pin2 and TRF2. Gel retardation assays revealed that bacterially expressed full-length NgTRF1 was able to form a specific complex only with probes containing three or more contiguous telomeric TTTAGGG repeats. The Myb-like domain of NgTRF1 is essential, but not sufficient, to bind the telomeric repeat sequence. The glutamine-rich extreme C-terminal region, which does not exist in animal proteins, was additionally required to form a specific telomere-protein complex.

Expression analysis showed that NgTRF1 gene activity was inversely correlated with the cell division capacity of tobacco root cells and during the 9-day culture period of BY-2 suspension cells, while telomerase activity was positively correlated with cell division. In synchronized BY-2 cells, NgTRF1 was selectively expressed in G1 phase, whereas telomerase activity peaked in S phase.

The possible physiological functions of NgTRF1 in tobacco cells are also discussed. Telomeres are specialized nuclear protein complexes located at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. They are essential and functional components for preserving chromosome integrity and for protection from exonucleolytic degradation and end-to-end fusion with other chromosomes (1Blackburn E.H.

Telomeres are also crucial for chromosome organization in the nucleus, especially during cell division. The DNA sequence of telomeres is highly conserved in most eukaryotes and consists of tandem repeats of short, G-rich sequence elements, such as TTAGGG in vertebrates (3Moyzis R.K Buckingham J.M.

Telomeres are synthesized and maintained by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that contains a specialized reverse transcriptase activity that uses its own RNA subunit as a template (5Zakian V.A.

In mammalian cells, telomerase activity is tightly associated with cell proliferation, de-differentiation, senescence, and immortalization. For example, in humans, telomerase is highly expressed in tumor cells and germ-line and embryonic cells, but is not detected in most normal somatic tissues (10Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2911-2915Google Scholar). Lack of telomerase activity in human somatic cells results in telomere shortening during differentiation and aging, while stable maintenance of telomere length occurs in germ-line and tumor cells, which have unlimited cell division capacity (10Kim N.W.

These observations suggest that telomerase activity and telomerase-mediated stabilization of telomere length are intimately tied to the proliferative abilities of cells (12Allsopp R.C. Vaziri H.

Studies of telomere chromatin structure have suggested that telomeres are packaged into specialized nucleoprotein complexes (14Price C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Protein components of the telomere complex have been identified and characterized in several organisms, including ciliates, yeast, and humans. The telomere-binding proteins can be divided into two distinct groups. Members of the first group bind specifically to the single-stranded 3′-extension at the extreme termini of telomeres, which are necessary for chromosome capping and telomerase regulation (17Cardenas M.E. Bianchi A. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Froelich-Ammon S.J. Dickinson B.A. Bevilacqua J.M. Schultz S.C. Cech T.R.

The other group of proteins interacts with the double-stranded telomeric repeats. For example, Rap1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae specifically binds to yeast duplex telomeric DNA and plays a role in the regulation of telomere length maintenance (20Lustig A.J. Kurtz S. Shore D.

Taz1p was identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe in a one-hybrid screen using double-stranded telomeric DNA as a target and found to be involved in telomere length regulation, repression of telomere adjacent genes, and the interactions between telomeres and the spindle pole body during meiotic prophase (22Cooper J.P.

TRF1 is a suppressor of telomere elongation and involved in the negative feedback mechanism that stabilizes telomere length by inhibiting telomerase at the ends of individual telomeres (28van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative allele of TRF2 induced end-to-end chromosome fusions in metaphase and anaphase cells, indicating that TRF2 plays a key role in the protective activity of telomeres in human cells (29van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that TRF2, along with TRF1, acts as a negative regulator of telomere length (30Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Another telomeric protein, Pin2, was identified in HeLa cells (31Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pin2 is identical in sequence to TRF1, except for an internal deletion of 20 amino acids, suggesting that these two proteins may be derived from the same gene, PIN2/TRF1 (31Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Most recently, the Pin2-interacting protein PinX1 was shown to bind the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT and potently inhibit its activity (32Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).In contrast to the extensive knowledge of yeast and mammalian telomeres, the understanding of plant telomeres is rudimentary. Recent studies have shown that telomere structure in higher plants is very similar to that in other eukaryotes (33Shippen D.E. McKnight T.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 126-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34McKnight T.D. Riha K. Shippen D.E. Plant Mol.

Gel mobility shift assays have detected double-stranded telomeric DNA-binding proteins in maize and Arabidopsis crude extracts (35Regad F. Lebas M. Lescure B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Zentgraf U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas proteins that bind to the G-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA have been characterized in nuclear protein extracts of both monocot and dicot plants, including Arabidopsis, rice, and mung bean (37Kim J.H. Kim W.T. Chung I.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Zentgraf U. Hinderhofer K. Kolb D. Plant Mol.

Interestingly, these studies indicate that the expression of plant telomere-binding proteins is developmentally regulated. For example, the Arabidopsis telomeric protein ATBP2 is transiently expressed during the onset of leaf senescence (38Zentgraf U. Hinderhofer K. Kolb D. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Three kinds of telomere-protein complexes (A, B, and C) have been observed in mung bean seedlings; complex C was specifically found in very young radicles, while a faster-migrating complex A was detected only in the hypocotyl and root tissues (39Lee J.H. Kim J.H. Kim W.T. Chung I.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 542-557Google Scholar). Recently, cDNAs encoding potential telomeric DNA-binding proteins have been isolated from rice and Arabidopsis (40Yu E.Y. Kim S.E. Kim J.H. Ko J.H. Cho M.H. Chung I.K. J. Biol.

FEBS Letters. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Like human TRF1/Pin2 and TRF2, the predicted protein sequences of rice RTBP1 and Arabidopsis AtTRP1 and AtTBP1 contain a single Myb domain at their C termini, and they exhibit sequence similarity to Myb-related double-stranded telomeric DNA-binding proteins from other organisms. Gel retardation assays showed that the Myb domain of both the rice and Arabidopsis proteins was able to bind to double-stranded, but not single-stranded, plant telomeric DNA (40Yu E.Y. Kim S.E.

FEBS Letters. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mRNAs for rice RTBP1 and Arabidopsis AtTBP1 were ubiquitously present in all tissues examined (40Yu E.Y. Kim S.E.

FEBS Letters. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not provide any information about the physiological roles and developmental regulation patterns of these telomere-related genes. In addition, there is no evidence that the encoded telomeric proteins are localized to telomeres in planta.We are interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of genes for telomeric DNA-binding proteins in higher plants. As nothing is known about the regulation and physiological function of these genes in relation to the cell division, the particular aim of the present study was to identify the possible relationship between cell division and telomere-binding protein gene activity in tobacco BY-2 suspension cells. For this purpose, we isolated a full-length tobacco cDNA clone, pNgTRF1, which encodes a protein that shares significant sequence identity with previously identified double-stranded telomeric repeat binding factors in mammalian cells. We found that NgTRF1 was able to interact specifically with the double-stranded plant telomeric repeat sequence (TTTAGGG)4. Expression analysis showed that the NgTRF1 transcript is present in tissues with negligible cell division activity. During the 9-day culture period for BY-2 suspension cells, the NgTRF1 gene was highly activated only in stationary phase cells that had no capacity for proliferation. Our results further showed that in synchronized BY-2 cells, NgTRF1 mRNA was selectively expressed in G1 phase, which contradicts the idea that telomerases are usually active during S phase. These results indicate that the degree of NgTRF1 expression in tobacco is inversely correlated with the capacity for cell division. Since telomerase activity is usually associated with the cell division program, the present results suggest that an opposite regulatory mechanism exists for the control of telomerase activity and the expression of NgTRF1 during the cell cycle in tobacco plants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPolymerase Chain Reaction—The first strand cDNA, synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mature leaves of 10-week-old Nicotiana glutinosa L., which are diploid tobacco plants, was PCR-amplified using mixed oligonucleotide primers (CTGAATTCAA(G/A)AA(G/A)GT(G/A/T/C)(C/A)G(G/A/T/C)GA(T/C)GA and CTGGATTCGT(T/C)TTCCA(T/C)TT(G/A)TC(T/C)TT). These primer sequences corresponded to the amino acid sequences KKVRDD and KDKWKT, respectively, which are highly conserved in previously identified putative plant telomeric proteins (40Yu E.Y.

FEBS Letters. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). EcoRI and BamHI sites were included at the 5′-ends of the sense and antisense primers, respectively, to facilitate subcloning of PCR products. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of the first strand cDNA reaction products, 1 μm primers, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 200 μm deoxynucleotides, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI). Thirty-five cycles were carried out, each consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 48 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C in an automatic thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR products were separated on an agarose gel, and an ∼500-bp band was eluted and reamplified by PCR to increase the amount of DNA used for subsequent subcloning.Screening of a λ Zap II Tobacco Leaf cDNA Library—Construction of the diploid tobacco N. glutinosa leaf cDNA library was described earlier (43Choi D. Park J.-A. Seo Y.S. Chun Y.J. Kim W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 10-week-old mature leaf tissues. Poly(A)+ RNA was then prepared from total RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The preparation of double-stranded DNA complementary to poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg) and its ligation to λ Uni-Zap arms were performed according to the protocol of Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The cDNA library was screened using the 500-bp PCR products described above as probes under low stringency hybridization and washing conditions (43Choi D. Park J.-A. Seo Y.S. Chun Y.J. Kim W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Cloning and Expression of Full-length and Various Deletion Mutants of NgTRF1—The plasmid pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the expression of GST-NgTRF1 fusion proteins. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strains containing the plasmids were grown at 37 °Cin100 ml of 2× LB medium (10 g of trypton, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter) supplemented with 1% glycerol as an additional carbon source and 70 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown for a further 4 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD600 of 0.6–1.0. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was sonicated on ice with Vibracell sonicator (Sonics and Materials Inc., Danbury, CT), and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Various fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B from GST purification modules (Amersham Biosciences), and the GST tags were cleaved off by thrombin.Gel Retardation Assay and Calculation of Dissociation Constants— DNA probes and competitors for gel retardation assays are described in Table I. To reduce nonspecific DNA-protein binding, purified NgTRF1 protein (0.5–1.0 μg) was preincubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 μg of nonspecific DNA oligonucleotide in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) for 10 min on ice. End-labeled DNA probe (0.25 ng) was then added to the reaction mixtures. After incubating for 10 min on ice, the mixtures were loaded on an 8% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel. Before loading, gels were prerun at 10 V/cm for 30 min, and electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× TBE (54 mm Tris borate pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) for 2.5 h. For the competition experiments, varying amounts of cold competitor molecules were preincubated with NgTRF1 before the addition of radiolabeled probe. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Binding activity was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Fuji).Table ITelomeric DNA probe and competitorsProbe nameSequenceNgTR-15′ TTTAGGG3′ AAATCCCNgTR-25′ TTTAGGGTTTAGGG3′ AAATCCCAAATCCCNgTR-35′ TTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGG3′ AAATCCCAAATCCCAAATCCCNgTR-45′ TTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGG3′ AAATCCCAAATCCCAAATCCCAAATCCCHTR-45′ TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG3′ AATCCCAATCCCAATCCCAATCCCCTR-45′ TTTAGGCTTTAGGCTTTAGGCTTTAGGC3′ AAATCCGAAATCCGAAATCCGAAATCCGNS-4aNS, nonspecific DNA.5′ AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG3′ TCTCTAACGGACTGCAGTCTCTCGATCa NS, nonspecific DNA. Open table in a new tab Determination of the dissociation constants (Kd) was carried out by incubating a fixed amount of 12 kDa protein (2.0 × 10–8m) with increasing amounts of probes (NgTR-2, M4, and M11) under the standard binding conditions. Probes were used at concentrations between 0.8 × 10–8 and 4.5 × 10–8m depending on the protein-probe combination. After gel electrophoresis, bound and free probes were quantified with a scintillation counter (Beckman) and PhosphorImager. Two quantified results were compared with a calibration curve with known DNA concentrations. Dissociation constants were determined based on the equations established by Riggs et al. (44Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeoss S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). For the reversible binding reaction of a 12-kDa NgTRF1 polypeptide (the Myb motif and the C-terminal glutamine-rich domain) to the two-telomeric repeat DNA site is Kd = [Pf][Df]/[DP], where [DP] is the concentration of DNA-protein complex, [Pf] that of unbound protein in the solution and [Df] that of unbound DNA. The corresponding equilibrium dissociation constants were estimated from the slope of a Scatchard plot of the results.Subcellular Localization of NgTRF1—The termination codon of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA was removed using PCR. The resulting fragment was then fused in-frame to the full-length pNgTRF1 coding region or to truncated pNgTRF1 mutants. Transient expression of GFP fusion constructs was performed by introducing the DNAs into onion epidermal cells using the particle bombardment method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Fluorescence photographs of onion cells were taken using a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) Axiophot fluorescence microscope fitted with fluorescein isothiocyanate filters (excitation filter, 450–490 nm; emission filter, 520 nm; dichroic mirror, 510 nm) and Fuji 400 color film. The optimal exposure time was 1 s.Isolation of Genomic DNA and Southern Blot Analysis—N. glutinosa leaf genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (43Choi D. Park J.-A. Seo Y.S. Chun Y.J. Kim W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with modifications. Each gram of N. glutinosa leaf pulverized under liquid nitrogen was suspended in 2.5 ml of extraction buffer (8.0 m urea, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 350 mm NaCl, 2% sarkosyl, 5% phenol, and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After successive extractions with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v), the aqueous phase was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA, adjusted to a density of 1.5 g ml–1 by the addition of saturated CsCl, and the DNA was banded overnight in a vertical rotor at 200,000 × g. The DNA band was collected, extracted with 1-butyl alcohol, and dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The N. glutinosa genomic DNA (10 μg/lane) was digested with appropriate enzymes, separated by electrophoresis in a 0.7% agarose gel, and blotted to a nylon membrane filter (Bio-Rad). The filter was hybridized to the 32P-labeled EcoRI/BamHI fragment of pNgTRF1 as described previously (43Choi D. Park J.-A. Seo Y.S. Chun Y.J. Kim W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were obtained from various tissues of N. glutinosa plants and BY-2 suspension culture cells as described previously (43Choi D. Park J.-A. Seo Y.S. Chun Y.J. Kim W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was precipitated overnight at 4 °C by the addition of 0.3 volumes of 10 m LiCl, and then precipitated in ethanol. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). To ensure equal loading of RNA, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis. To confirm complete transfer of RNA to the membrane filter, both gel and membrane were viewed under UV light at the end of transferring. The filter was hybridized to the 32P-labeled EcoRI/BamHI fragment of pNgTRF1 under high stringency hybridization and washing conditions. The blots were washed as described previously (43Choi D. Park J.-A. Seo Y.S. Chun Y.J. Kim W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography at –80 °C using Kodak XAR-5 film and an intensifying screen.Tobacco Suspension Cell Culture and Synchronization—The tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. bright yellow-2) suspension cell line was maintained in Murashige-Skoog salt medium (Sigma) on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 27 °C in the dark. Every week, 10 ml of stationary phase cells were added to 40 ml of fresh medium and cultured. To synchronize the tobacco cells in S phase, 10 ml of 7-day-old suspension cells were transferred to 40 ml of fresh Murashige-Skoog medium containing 10 mm hydroxurea and cultured. After 24 h, the cells were washed extensively with 600 ml of 3% (w/v) sucrose solution and then resuspended in 50 ml of fresh medium. Samples were taken at 2-h intervals for various analyses. To arrest the cell cycle progression at G1/S phase, actively dividing 3-day-old suspension culture cells were incubated with or without 10 μm indomethacin, after which samples were taken at 4-h intervals for Northern analysis.Preparation of Tobacco Cell Extracts—A portion (0.5 g) of synchronized cells at various phases in the cell cycle was ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen and suspended in 2 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer W (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, 1.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 10% glycerol). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10%, mixed for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer W and centrifuge"

Production of this fusion protein inBacillus subtilis and Pichia pastoris was examined. The Kringle domain in the fusion protein produced fromB. subtilis was improperly folded because of its complicated disulfide-bond profile, whereas the staphylokinase domain produced from P. pastoris was only partially active because of an N-linked glycosylation. A change of the glycosylation residue, Thr-30, to alanine resulted in a non-glycosylated biologically active fusion. The resulting mutein, designated SAKM3-L-K1, was overproduced in P. pastoris. Each domain in SAKM3-L-K1 was functional, and this fusion showed fibrin binding ability by binding directly to plasmin-digested clots. In vitro fibrin clot lysis in a static environment and plasma clot lysis in a flow-cell system demonstrated that the engineered fusion outperformed the non-fused staphylokinase. The time required for 50% clot lysis was reduced by 20 to 500% under different conditions. Faster clot lysis can potentially reduce the degree of damage to occluded heart tissues.

Blood clot-dissolving agents currently approved for thrombolytic therapy include tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),1 urokinase, streptokinase, and their derivatives (3Tsikouris J.P. Tsikouris A.P.

Although the treatment can reduce mortality, several large scale clinical trials indicate that these blood clot-dissolving agents are far from ideal (4Sinnaeve P. van de W.F. Thromb.

Med. 1998; 4: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Notably, SAK mediates the lysis of platelet-rich and retracted clots efficiently (12Suehiro A. Tsujioka H. Yoshimoto H. Ueda M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9811-9816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties can help minimize reocclusion and bleeding complications. Much has been studied on the action of SAK in vivo. To function as the plasminogen activator, SAK first forms a complex with plasmin(ogen) (16Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Complex formation is followed by SAK processing in which the N-terminal peptide containing the first 10 amino acids from SAK is removed by cleaving at a twin lysine site between residues 10 and 11 (Fig. 1A). This processing step is essential for attaining an active form of SAK (17Gase A. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Rocker A. Collen D. Behnke D. Schlott B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SAK-plasminogen complex then forms a ternary complex with another molecule of plasminogen and converts this plasminogen to plasmin. When the SAK-plasmin complex is not fibrin-bound, it can be inhibited by the natural plasmin inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin, present in plasma. In contrast, the fibrin-bound plasminogen activator complex is much more resistant to α2-antiplasmin-mediated inhibition (15Silence K. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9811-9816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The result is a preferential plasminogen activation by SAK at the fibrin surface that contributes to the fibrin specificity of SAK in a plasma milieu. This fibrin specificity is made even stronger by the preferential binding of SAK to plasmin(ogen) that is fibrin-bound (14Sakharov D.V. Lijnen H.R. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27912-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fibrin-specific property of SAK underlies an interesting observation in clinical trials. The fibrinogen levels in patients treated with SAK remain close to 100%, whereas patients treated with tPA have 32% of fibrinogen cleaved and degraded in their plasma (9Vanderschueren S. Barrios L. Kerdsinchai P. Van den Heuvel P. Hermans L. Vrolix M. De Man F. Benit E. Muyldermans L. Collen D. Van de Werf F. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2044-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Vanderschueren S. Dens J. Kerdsinchai P. Desmet W. Vrolix M. De Man F. Van den Heuvel P. Hermans L. Collen D. Van de Werf F. Am. Heart J. 1997; 134: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although SAK is a fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent, it has no fibrin binding ability by itself. It binds to fibrin clots only indirectly through the interaction with any clot-bound plasmin(ogen). It would be of interest to determine whether the clot lysis efficacy of SAK can be improved by engineering it with direct fibrin binding ability. Faster clot lysis will restore blood flow in a more timely manner and reduce damage to heart tissues. Furthermore, if less SAK is required to achieve the same degree of clot lysis, the risk for side effects can be minimized. Plasminogen binds to fibrin clots via its Kringle domains at the N-terminal regions (20Castellino F.J. McCance S.G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 46-60PubMed Google Scholar). These Kringle domains are ∼80 amino acids long; some of them possess the lysine binding capability (21Hoover G.J. Menhart N. Martin A. Warder S. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10936-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Wu T.P. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Blood Coagul.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, plasminogen binds abundantly to fibrin clots during clot lysis since more C-terminal lysine residues are generated through the action of plasmin, a trypsin-like protease that cuts after lysine and arginine residues. Among the characterized Kringles from human plasminogen (24Lerch P.G. Rickli E.E. Lergier W. Gillessen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Menhart N.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Kringle-1 from human plasminogen has the highest lysine binding affinity. Therefore, Kringle-1 was selected as the fibrin targeting domain and fused to the C-terminal end of SAK (Fig.1). To ensure that each domain within the fusion can fold independently and that each has sufficient space to interact with its target, a 20-amino acid linker is inserted between these domains. The resulting fusion (designated SAK-L-K1) and its three site-specific muteins (SAKM1-L-K1, SAKM2-L-K1, and SAKM3-L-K1) were produced via secretion from Bacillus subtilis and Pichia pastoris. Biochemical properties, clot targeting ability, and clot lysis activity of the purified SAK-L-K1 and its derivatives were determined. In comparison with SAK, the engineered SAKM3-L-K1 consistently mediated faster lysis of both fibrin and plasma clots in vitro. pSAKLK1 is a pUB18-based B. subtilisplasmid (30Wong S.-L. Gene. 1989; 83: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) for secretory production of SAK-L-K1 under control of theB. subtilis P43 promoter for transcription and the levansucrase signal sequence (SacB SP) for secretion. To introduce the linker sequence between SAK and the Kringle-1 domain from human plasminogen, the nucleotide sequence of the expression cassette (P43-SacBSP-SAK-L-K1) was split into two portions. The first portion covered from the P43 promoter to the middle half of the linker sequence. The sequence was generated by PCR using pSAKP (31Ye R. Kim J.H. Kim B.G. Szarka S. Sihota S. Wong S.-L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The primers used for this amplification were P43F (5′-GGGAATTCGAGCTCAGCATTATTG-3′) and SAKLB (5′-CTTGTCGACCCACCAGAAGTACTTCCTTTCTTTTCTATAACAACCTTTG-3′). The resulting product was an 895-bp EcoRI-SalI fragment. After digestion with both EcoRI andSalI, the fragment was inserted into pUB18 (30Wong S.-L. Gene. 1989; 83: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) at the corresponding sites located in the polylinker region of the vector to generate pUB18-SAKLF. The second half of the expression cassette carried a sequence encoding the C-terminal half of the linker and the Kringle-1 domain. This sequence was generated by PCR using a cDNA clone of human plasminogen as template. This cDNA clone was kindly provided by Dr. Ross T. A. MacGillivray at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia. The forward primer LK1F (5′-GGGTCGACAAGTGGTGGATCTACTAGTGGCTCTGGATCCGGAATTTGCAAGACTGGGAATGG-3′) encoded the sequence for both the C-terminal half of the linker and the beginning of the Kringle-1 domain. The backward primer LK1B (5′-CTTCTAGATTATGATCAACACTCAAGAATGTCGCAGTAG-3′) introduced a translation termination codon (TGA) at the end of the Kringle-1 sequence and an XbaI site at the 3′ end of the fragment. The resulting 310-bp SalI-XbaI PCR product was digested with SalI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding sites in the polylinker region of the pUB18-SAKLF to generate pSAKLK1. To eliminate the N-linked glycosylation site in SAK-L-K1, Asn-28 was changed to Asp and Ala to generate SAKM1-L-K1 and SAKM2-L-K1, respectively. The change of Thr-30 to Ala resulted in the generation of SAKM3-L-K1. These mutations were generated by inverse PCR (32Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) using the primer pairs shown in Table I with pSAKLK1 as the template. The entire plasmid was amplified, and the PCR product was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, self-ligated, and transformed toB. subtilis WB600 (33Wu X.-C. Lee W. Tran L. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The resulting clones were screened for the appropriate mutation by direct sequencing of the expression cassette (P43-SacBSP-SAK-L-K1). Each of the mutated cassettes was then inserted as an EcoRI-XbaI fragment into pUB18 to generate pSAKM1LK1, pSAKM2LK1, and pSAKM3LK1. These vectors allowed the rapid examination of the effects of mutation on SAK activity in B. subtilis.Table IGlycosylation-site mutants of SAK-L-K1SAK-L-K1Glycosylation sitePrimer sequenceWild typeAsn-28-Val-Thr-30SAKM1-L-K1Asp-28-Val-Thr-30Forward primer: SAKN28F, 5′-GTTATTTTGAACCAACAGGCCCGTATTTGATGGTAG (A/C)TGTGACTGGAGT-3′Backward primer: SAKN28B, 5′-GGGCCTGTTGGTTCAAAATAAC-3′SAKM2-L-K1Ala-28-Val-Thr-30Forward primer: SAKN28FBackward primer: SAKN28BSAKM3-L-K1Asn-28-Val-Ala-30Forward primer: SAKTHRALAF, 5′-GTATTTGATGGTAAATGTGGCTGGAGTTGATGG-3′Backward primer: SAKN28BThe amino acids in bold letters designate the mutation in the glycosylation site.

The degenerate mutagenic primer SAKN28F leads to the generation of mutants with Asn-28 changed to Asp or Ala. Specific nucleotides in mutagenic primers that lead to mutations are shown in bold. Two primers (AFACSAKF and SAKK1CPICB) were designed to facilitate cloning of these structural genes immediately downstream of the α-factor signal sequence in the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen). pSAKLK1 was used as the template for PCR amplification with AFACSAKF (5′-GACTCGAGAAGAGATCGAGCTCATTCGACAAAGG-3′) as the forward primer and SAKK1CPICB (5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTAACACTCAAGAATGTCGGAGTAG-3′) as the backward primer. A 730-bp PCR product was generated withXhoI at the 5′ end and NotI at the 3′ end. The amplified sequence was digested with XhoI andNotI and ligated to the similarly digested pPICZαA to generate pPICSAKLK1. pPICSAKLK1 was transformed to E. coliTOP10F′ and selected for resistance to zeocin (25 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). pPICSAKM2LK1 and pPICSAKM3LK1 were also generated using the same approach with pSAKM2LK1 and pSAKM3LK1 as the PCR template, respectively. pPICSAKM2LK1 or pPICSAKM3LK1 was linearized with PmeI and transformed toP. pastoris X-33 (a wild-type strain, Invitrogen) using EasyComp method according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transformants were selected on zeocin (600 and 1000 μg/ml) and screened for secretory production of SAKM2-L-K1 or SAKM3-L-K1. X-33 cells with pPICZαA and pPICSAKLK1 integrated were similarly prepared to serve as the negative and wild-type controls, respectively. For protein purification, a Pichia transformant showing the highest expression level of SAKM3-L-K1 was cultured for 16–18 h at 28–30 °C in buffered glycerol-complex medium (34Rosenfeld S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted at 3,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended to 100 Klett units using a Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter (Klett Mfg. Co.) in buffered methanol-complex medium (34Rosenfeld S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Growth continued at 28–30 °C in a shake flask. Production of SAKM3-L-K1 was induced by methanol (0.5% final concentration) administered every 12 h during the entire culture period. After 28–30 h of culture, the culture supernatant was collected by centrifuging the cells at 3,000 × g for 5 min and applied to a lysine-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated with column binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). After washing the column with 3–5 bed volumes of the binding buffer, SAKM3-L-K1 was eluted with 0.15 mε-amino-N-caproic acid (EACA) (Sigma). Eluants were analyzed to determine yield and purity of SAKM3-L-K1 by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The fractions selected were pooled, dialyzed against the binding buffer, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore Corp.). Purified SAKM3-L-K1 was quantified spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 35,350 m−1 cm−1 (35Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Purified SAKM3-L-K1 in deionized water was mixed with the matrix solution of sinapinic acid and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer calibrated with trypsinogen (m/z 23,981). The instrument operated in the linear mode with an acquisition range 10,000–35,000 Da. This analysis was performed at the Alberta Peptide Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Purified SAKM3-L-K1 was extensively dialyzed against 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and quantified spectrophotometrically at 280 nm as previously described. Titrations were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter at 25 °C in 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, following the manufacturer's guidelines and using Microcal Origin for data analysis. EACA (Sigma) was used as the ligand. The incremental heat change accompanying binding was corrected for the corresponding heat of dilution of EACA into buffer that was obtained in a separate experiment by titrating EACA into the sample cell containing buffer only. An ELISA method was used to assess the fibrin binding ability of SAKM3-L-K1 and SAK. Cross-linked fibrin was formed on the wells of a Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp module (Nalge Nunc International Corp.) using the procedure described by Wu et al. (36Wu S.-C. Yeung J.C. Duan Y. Ye R. Szarka S.J. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3261-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Formation of cross-linked fibrin was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (36Wu S.-C. Yeung J.C. Duan Y. Ye R. Szarka S.J. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3261-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The fibrin was digested with plasmin (Roche Applied Science) at 4 milliunits/well (∼1 pmol/well) at room temperature. At different time points, the unbound plasmin was removed immediately by washing 4 times with PBST (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 7.2, 0.1% Tween 20). Purified SAKM3-L-K1 or SAK in PBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin was added to the wells at a final concentration of 200 nm (20 pmol/well). After 2 h at room temperature, unbound materials were removed by washing. SAKM3-L-K1 or SAK retained on the well was probed with polyclonal antibodies against SAK (31Ye R. Kim J.H. Kim B.G. Szarka S. Sihota S. Wong S.-L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. The amount of horseradish peroxidase retained was assessed using 1-Step Turbo TMB (Pierce) as the horseradish peroxidase substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Color development at end point was determined at 450 nm using a microplate reader (CERES 900, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). The experiment was repeated three times. Fibrin clots were formed by adding human thrombin (to 0.6 NIH units/ml) (1NIH unit = 0.324 ± 0.073 μg thrombin) and CaCl2 (to 20 mm) to human fibrinogen (1 mg/ml, final concentration) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 0.01 m HEPES, 0.13 m NaCl, pH 7.4). Both thrombin and fibrinogen were highly purified materials from Sigma. Immediately after mixing, 100-μl aliquots of the polymerizing fibrin solution were pipetted to the wells of a microtiter plate (Falcon 3912 flat-bottom polyvinyl chloride plate, BD Biosciences). Clot formation was allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature. The surface of the clots was washed with HBS, and excess fluid was carefully removed. A 100-μl solution containing freshly mixed human plasminogen (1.5 μm, Sigma) and varied concentrations of purified SAKM3-L-K1 or SAK in HBS was layered on each clot. The changes in clot turbidity with time were monitored by measuring changes in the absorbance at 405 nm at 25 °C using the CERES 900 microtiter plate reader operated in the kinetic mode. After 30 min the surface of each clot was gently washed with HBS three times to remove any unbound SAKM3-L-K1 or SAK. 100-μl aliquots of plasminogen (1.5 μm) in HBS were layered on the clots, and measurement was immediately resumed until all readings reached the low plateau, which was taken as completion of clot lysis. Duplicate wells were prepared for each concentration of SAKM3-L-K1 or SAK in each experiment, and the experiment was repeated three times. As a control, some clots were layered only with HBS but treated otherwise the same. Blood was drawn by venipuncture from healthy adult donors (who had taken no aspirin in the preceding 2 weeks) into 1/10 volume of buffered sodium citrate (129 mm). Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared from the pooled citrated blood by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 15 min and frozen immediately at −20 °C in aliquots. All plasma clot experiments were performed within 1 week of blood collection. Clot perfusion using an optical flow cell was based on the model described by Hantgan et al. (37Hantgan R.R. Jerome W.G. Hursting M.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 2064-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clotting was initiated by adding human thrombin (to 1.0 NIH units/ml) and CaCl2 (to 30 mm) to freshly thawed PPP. 200 μl of the polymerizing plasma was transferred to the flow cell (Hellma Cells, model 178.710-QS) to fill up the optical chamber (80 μl) and the inlet and outlet ports. Clotting was allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature. The clot was then perfused with PPP for 20 min at 20 μl/min, followed by perfusion with SAKM3-L-K1 or SAK (200 nm in PPP, 20 μl/min) with the flow rate controlled by a Bio-Rad peristaltic pump. The change in absorbance at 600 nm at 37 °C was continuously monitored using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments) operated with a Kinetics Soft-Pac module. The experiment was performed three times for both SAKM3-L-K1 and SAK. Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) was used for all DNA amplification reactions. The sequence of all PCR products was confirmed to be free of PCR errors by nucleotide sequencing performed at the University Core DNA and Protein Services, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Purification of SAK and specific activity determination of SAK and SAKM3-L-K1 followed the procedure described by Szarka et al. (19Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasminogen activation assay with the radial caseinolysis method was performed as described by Wong (38Wong S.-L. Ye R. Nathoo S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SAK-L-K1 (Fig.1B) was produced as a secretory protein in the culture supernatant using B. subtilis WB800, an eight extracellular protease deficient strain (36Wu S.-C. Yeung J.C. Duan Y. Ye R. Szarka S.J. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3261-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), as the host. Radial caseinolysis study showed that SAK-L-K1 and SAK had similar activities for plasminogen activation. However, more than 95% of SAK-L-K1 was found in the flow-through fractions with a lysine-agarose column even though the sample had been extensively dialyzed to ensure that the Kringle domain in the fusion protein was not saturated with free lysine molecules present in the culture medium (data not shown). The observation suggested a defective Kringle-1 domain in the fusion protein. This result is not unexpected since the Kringle-1 domain contains three pairs of disulfide bonds arranged in a 1–6, 2–4, 3–5 pattern (i.e. cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds are not arranged in a sequential manner, Fig.1B). Inability to form disulfide bonds or mis-pairing of cysteine residues can result in the formation of defective Kringle-1 domains (39Trexler M. Patthy L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because functional human plasminogen Kringle-1 domain has been shown to be produced efficiently from P. pastoris (40Zajicek J. Chang Y. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it would be a logical approach to produce SAK-L-K1 in P. pastoris. However, using P. pastoris as the production host of the SAK-L-K1 fusion protein has another concern. P. pastoris has been shown to produce SAK only in a partially active form because of an N-linked glycosylation at Asn-28 of the mature SAK (41Miele R.G. Prorok M. Costa V.A. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To eliminate glycosylation of SAK-L-K1 in P. pastoris, two key residues (Table I, shown in bold) that constitute part of the consensusN-linked glycosylation site (Asn-28–Val-29–Thr-30, numbering according to the mature SAK sequence) were changed (Table I). The first two muteins, SAKM1-L-K1 and SAKM2-L-K1, have Asn-28 changed to Asp and Ala, respectively, whereas the third mutein SAKM3-L-K1 has Thr-30 changed to Ala. To quickly examine the effects of these mutations on SAK activity, the muteins were first produced in B. subtilis via secretion. Although the production yields of these muteins and the wild-type control, SAK-L-K1, from B. subtilis were comparable, radial caseinolysis study indicated that SAKM1-L-K1, SAKM2-L-K1, and SAKM3-L-K1 retained 1 (or less), 40, and 90% of the wild type SAK activity, respectively (data not shown). Structural genes encoding SAKM2-L-K1 and SAKM3-L-K1 were then transferred to the P. pastoris expression vector for further characterization. Secretory production of"
https://openalex.org/W2075058348,"In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, proper establishment and maintenance of cell polarity require Orb6p, a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating both cell morphogenesis and cell cycle control. Orb6p localizes to the cell tips during interphase and to the cell septum during mitosis. To investigate the mechanisms involved in Orb6p function, we conducted a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with Orb6p. Using this approach, we identified Skb1p, a highly conserved protein methyltransferase that has been implicated previously in cell cycle control, in the coordination of cell cycle progression with morphological changes, and in hyperosmotic stress response. We found that Skb1p associates with Orb6p in S. pombe cells and that the two proteins interact directly in vitro. Loss of Skb1p exacerbates the phenotype of orb6 mutants, suggesting that Skb1p and Orb6p functionally interact in S. pombe cells. Our results suggest that Skb1p affects the intracellular localization of Orb6p and that loss of Skb1p leads to a redistribution of the Orb6p kinase away from the cell tips. Furthermore, we found that Orb6p kinase activity is strongly increased following exposure to salt shock, suggesting that Orb6p has a role in cell response to hyperosmotic stress. Previous studies have shown that Skb1p interacts with the fission yeast p21-activated kinase homologue Pak1p/Shk1p to regulate cell polarity and cell cycle progression. Our findings identify Orb6p as an additional target for Skb1p and suggest a novel function for Skb1p in the control of cell polarity by regulating the subcellular localization of Orb6p. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, proper establishment and maintenance of cell polarity require Orb6p, a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating both cell morphogenesis and cell cycle control. Orb6p localizes to the cell tips during interphase and to the cell septum during mitosis. To investigate the mechanisms involved in Orb6p function, we conducted a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with Orb6p. Using this approach, we identified Skb1p, a highly conserved protein methyltransferase that has been implicated previously in cell cycle control, in the coordination of cell cycle progression with morphological changes, and in hyperosmotic stress response. We found that Skb1p associates with Orb6p in S. pombe cells and that the two proteins interact directly in vitro. Loss of Skb1p exacerbates the phenotype of orb6 mutants, suggesting that Skb1p and Orb6p functionally interact in S. pombe cells. Our results suggest that Skb1p affects the intracellular localization of Orb6p and that loss of Skb1p leads to a redistribution of the Orb6p kinase away from the cell tips. Furthermore, we found that Orb6p kinase activity is strongly increased following exposure to salt shock, suggesting that Orb6p has a role in cell response to hyperosmotic stress. Previous studies have shown that Skb1p interacts with the fission yeast p21-activated kinase homologue Pak1p/Shk1p to regulate cell polarity and cell cycle progression. Our findings identify Orb6p as an additional target for Skb1p and suggest a novel function for Skb1p in the control of cell polarity by regulating the subcellular localization of Orb6p. The establishment of cell polarity and the control of cell shape are fundamental to cell growth and function and are essential for intracellular transport, cell differentiation, and cell locomotion. Cell shape and cell polarity change at specific stages of the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals and during tumorigenesis (1Drubin D. Cell Polarity. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar, 2Drubin D. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Google Scholar). However, mechanisms responsible for regulating cell morphogenesis and integrating polarized cell growth with the cell cycle remain poorly understood. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an attractive model organism for studies of cell morphogenesis because it grows in a polarized fashion with a well-defined cylindrical shape. Polarized cell growth in S. pombe is regulated strictly during the cell cycle. Cells grow from only one tip (the older end) following mitosis, and when a minimal cell length has been achieved, the cells activate growth from the second end in a process referred to as New End Take-Off (3Streiblova E. Wolf A. Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 1972; 12: 673-684Google Scholar, 4Nurse P. Nature. 1975; 256: 547-551Google Scholar, 5Mitchison J.M. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 357-376Google Scholar). We have previously identified 19 genes in fission yeast that have roles in various aspects of cell polarity control (6Verde F. Mata J. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1529-1538Google Scholar). One of these genes is orb6, which encodes an essential serine/threonine kinase required for maintenance of cell polarity during interphase as well as proper negative regulation of mitosis (7Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Google Scholar). Orb6p belongs to a conserved family of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Members of this family include Neurospora crassa Cot1 (8Yarden O. Plamann M. Ebbole D.J. Yanofsky C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2159-2166Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cbk1p (9Racki W.J. Becam A.M.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3177-3190Google Scholar), Drosophila WARTS (13Justice R.W. Zilian O. Woods D.F. Noll M. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 534-546Google Scholar), and human NDR kinase (14Millward T.C.P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Google Scholar). These kinases are related to the human myotonic dystrophy kinase (15Brook J.D. McCurrach M.E. Harley H.G. Buckler A.J. Church D. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Stanton V.P. Thirion J.P. Hudson T. et al.Cell. 1992; 68: 799-808Google Scholar) and to Rho kinase (16Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Google Scholar); however, they lack Rho binding motifs. Orb6p, Cot1, Cbk1p, and WARTS have a role in the regulation of cell morphology (7Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Google Scholar, 8Yarden O. Plamann M. Ebbole D.J. Yanofsky C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2159-2166Google Scholar, 9Racki W.J. Becam A.M. Nasr F. Herbert C.J.

Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 534-546Google Scholar). Similarly, C. elegans SAX-1 has a role in regulating neuronal cell shape and neurite initiation (12Zallen J.A. Peckol E.L. Tobin D.M. Bargmann C.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3177-3190Google Scholar). To explore further the molecular mechanisms involved in Orb6p function, we conducted a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with Orb6p. One of the proteins identified from this screen is the highly conserved protein methyltransferase Skb1p (19Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Google Scholar). Skb1p originally was identified as a protein that interacts with the essential fission yeast p21-activated kinase homologue Pak1p/Shk1p (19Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Google Scholar). Like Orb6p, Pak1p/Shk1p is required for proper establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in fission yeast (7Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Google Scholar, 20Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Google Scholar, 21Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Google Scholar). However, unlike Orb6p and Pak1p/Shk1p, Skb1p is not essential for cell viability or polarity under normal growth conditions (19Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the absence of Skb1p, S. pombe cells are unable to maintain cell polarity following hyperosmotic shock (22Bao S. Yang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R. Verde F. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14549-14552Google Scholar), suggesting that Skb1p functions as a mediator of hyperosmotic stress response. Skb1p also has been shown to act as a dosage-dependent mitotic inhibitor in fission yeast, and this function requires both Pak1p/Shk1p as well as the Cdc2p inhibitory kinase Wee1p (23Gilbreth M. Peirong Y. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R. Kansra S. Gadiraju R. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14781-14786Google Scholar). Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Skb1p, Hsl7p, has been implicated in a morphological checkpoint that delays the cell cycle in response to polarity and bud formation defects (24Shulewitz M.J. Inouye C.J. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7123-7137Google Scholar, 25Longtine M.S. Theesfeld C.L. McMillan J.N. Weaver E. Pringle J.R. Lew D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 11: 4049-4061Google Scholar). Hsl7p localizes to the septin ring and mediates the interaction of the Wee1p homologue, Swe1p, with the protein Hsl1p. This interaction is thought to promote Swe1p phosphorylation and its degradation at the G2/M phase transition, thus promoting entry into mitosis (24Shulewitz M.J. Inouye C.J. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7123-7137Google Scholar, 25Longtine M.S. Theesfeld C.L. McMillan J.N. Weaver E. Pringle J.R. Lew D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 11: 4049-4061Google Scholar). Thus, both Skb1p and Hls7p have a role in cell cycle control, although the molecular details of these controls may be different. In this report, we characterize the interaction between Skb1p and Orb6p at the genetic and molecular level. Our results indicate that Skb1p interacts with Orb6p to regulate cell polarity in fission yeast by positively regulating Orb6p localization to the cell tips. We also report that Orb6p kinase activity is increased during hyperosmotic stress, suggesting that Orb6p may play an important role in hyperosmotic stress response. Our findings identify a novel function for Skb1p and suggest a wider role for this protein in regulating the spatial localization of protein kinases involved in the control of cell morphology in fission yeast. Strains and Cell Culture—S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains are isogenic to the original strain h– 972.

Strain Y187 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 met–URA3::GAL-lacZ) was used for mating experiments (27Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in YAPD ((per liter) 10.0 g of Difco yeast extract, 20.0 g of Difco peptone, 20.0 g of glucose, 100 mg of adenine hemisulphate) or selective SC ((per liter) 6.7 g of Difco yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids), 20 g of glucose, pH 5.6, + appropriate amino acids (40 mg of adenine hemisulphate, 20 mg of l-arginine (HCl), 100 mg of l-aspartic acid, 100 mg of l-glutamic acid (monosodium salt), 20 mg of l-histidine, 60 mg of l-leucine, 30 mg of l-lysine (nono-HCl), 20 mg of l-methionine, 50 mg of l-phenylalanine, 375 mg of l-serine, 200 mg of l-threonine, 40 mg of l-tryptophan, 30 mg of l-tyrosine, 150 mg of l-valine, 20 mg of uracil) at 30 °C. 3-Aminotriazole was added to the plates when selecting for His prototrophy. Two-hybrid Screen for Identifying Proteins Interacting with Orb6p— The orb6 gene was fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4p (GBD) 1The abbreviations used are: GBD, DNA binding domain of Gal4p; GAD, activation domain of Gal4p; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in a plasmid carrying the trp1 marker (pAS1-orb6) and was used as the bait for a two-hybrid interaction screen. The S. pombe cDNA library was cloned into the pACT plasmid as cDNAs fused to the activation domain of Gal4p (GAD). These plasmids (pACT) carry the leu2 marker. The plasmids pAS1, pACT2, pAS1-p53, pSE1111, and pSE1112 as well as the S. pombe cDNA library prepared in phage λ vectors were kindly provided by Dr. S. Elledge. The histidine prototrophy assay and β-ga-lactosidase assay were performed as described previously (27Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Google Scholar). cDNAs were isolated from strains showing histidine prototrophy and positive β-galactosidase activity and then tested for self-activation and specificity against control baits. Cells were exposed to X-gal for 1 h at 30 °C. For histidine auxotrophy assay, cells were grown at 30 °C on SC –Leu, –Trp, –His, plus 100 mm 3-aminotriazole. The cDNAs that did not self-activate and had specificity for interaction with Orb6p were sequenced at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center (PDTC) using the pACT forward 5′ primer (CTATCTATTCGATGATGAAG) and/or the pACT reverse 3′ primer (ACAGTTGAAGTGAACTTGCG). Five Orb6p-interacting proteins were identified from a screen of ∼2 × 106 transformants. Purification of Orb6p and Skb1p—For copurification of Orb6p and Skb1p from fission yeast extracts, we cultured h–ade6–704 ura4-D18 leu1–32 cells coexpressing either hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Orb6p and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Skb1p (strain FV544) or HA-tagged Orb6p and GST alone as a control (strain FV545) for 15 h at 32 °C in the absence of thiamine. The orb6-HA construct was shown previously to rescue an orb6Δ strain when integrated in single copy (Ref. 7Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Google Scholar and this study). Cells then were resuspended in HB buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 15 mm MgCl2 15 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride + protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science))) and broken using a FastPrep FP120 bead beater (Savant). Extracts were spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min. GST-tagged Skb1p or GST alone was purified using glutathione beads (Molecular Probes) for the experiment in Fig. 3A. HA-tagged Orb6p was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-HA antibody-coupled resin (Covance). When copurification of Orb6p and Skb1p was performed following hyperosmotic shock, cells were grown in the absence of thiamine for 15 h at 32 °C, diluted in a medium containing 1.5 m KCl for 20 min, and then broken as described previously. To test the interaction of Orb6p and Skb1p in vitro, orb6 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) vector for expression of 35S-labeled Orb6p in the TnT T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST and GST-Skb1p were expressed in BL21 bacterial cells from a pET15b vector and then purified by binding to glutathione resin (Molecular Probes). The GST- and GST-Skb1p-bound resin was incubated for 30 min with the reticulocyte lysate expressing 35S-labeled Orb6p, washed, and then eluted by boiling the resin in SDS loading buffer. Immunoblot analysis then was performed using standard methodology. For Western blot analysis, monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance), monoclonal anti-tubulin (TAT1, a kind gift of Dr. K. Gull), and polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Molecular Probes) were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were employed as secondary antibodies (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Orb6p-HA under the Control of the Endogenous orb6 Promoter—We inserted one promoterless copy of the orb6+ gene, tagged at the C terminus with three copies of the HA epitope, in an integrative plasmid containing the sup3–5 marker. We then transformed h–ade6–704 leu1–32 ura4-D18 cells and selected for colonies capable of growth in the absence of adenine. We checked by PCR that the integration had occurred at the orb6 locus and that the HA-tagged orb6+ gene was positioned correctly after the endogenous orb6 promoter. Three strains were used to produce cell extracts and to test on Western blots for the expression of a protein corresponding to the size of Orb6p-HA. In all cases, a single band of the correct size was recognized by the HA antibody (Covance). The strains used in our experiments were FV542 and its derivatives FV543, -521, and -539 (Table I). Determination of Orb6p Kinase Activity—Orb6p expressed as a GST-tagged fusion protein from an skb1+ (Table I, FV540) and skb1– (FV541) strain was purified from fission yeast extracts using glutathione resin (Molecular Probes). GST-Orb6p could rescue an orb6Δ strain when integrated in single copy under the control of the nmt1 promoter (data not shown). The GST-Orb6p-bound glutathione resin was washed with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm MnCl2). The resin then was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and 20 μm ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated after 20 min at 30 °C and was analyzed on a gel. Orb6p-HA, expressed from its endogenous promoter (strains FV521 and FV539; see above), was immunoprecipitated as a complex with Mob2p from h+mob2–13myc::kanMX6 orb6-HA::sup3–5 ura4-D18 leu1–32 ade6– and h+skb1::ura4+mob2–13myc::kanMX6 orb6-HA::sup3–5 ura4-D18 leu1–32 ade6– using an anti-Myc antibody (Covance) and a G-protein-coupled resin (Sigma) (28Hou M. Wiley D. Verde F. McCollum D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 125-135Google Scholar). The resin then was processed as described above. To test Orb6p kinase activity following hyperosmotic shock, GST-Orb6p or Orb6p-HA was purified from cells grown in the absence of salt shock (time, 0 min) and after 15 or 30 min of exposure to 1.5 m KCl. Following purification, Orb6p kinase activity was tested as described above. Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells for immunofluorescence were grown exponentially in liquid for at least eight generations at densities below 107 cells/ml before the start of the experiment. Standard immunofluorescence protocols were followed (26Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Google Scholar) after the cells were fixed in methanol. The primary antibodies utilized in this paper for staining the cells were monoclonal anti-HA antibody and monoclonal anti-actin antibody (N350, Amersham Biosciences). The secondary antibody was Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). Cells were mounted on coverslips using phosphate-buffered saline containing Slowfade Antifade (Molecular Probes) and photographed using either a Zeiss Axiophot microscope or a Leica DMRA microscope equipped with Metamorph 1.7.4 software (Universal Images). To quantify Orb6p localization at the cell tips, the strains h–cdc25-22 leu1–32 ura4-D18 pJK orb6-HA (FV536) and h–cdc25-22 skb1::ura4+leu1–32 ura4-D18 pJK orb6-HA (FV537) were grown exponentially at 25 °C for at least eight generations while keeping cell density below 107 cells/ml. The temperature then was raised to 36 °C for 4 h to arrest the cells at the G2/M boundary. The temperature was lowered back to 25 °C to release the synchronized cells from their G2/M arrest, and cell samples were collected every 20 min after the first 30 min for methanol fixation, which was followed by immunofluorescence. The fluorescent signal of Orb6p-HA was quantified with NIH Image 1.6.2 software. The extent of Orb6p-HA localization to the tips was expressed as a ratio between the signal at the cell ends and an equivalent area at the center of the cell. To determine the effect that salt shock has on the localization of Orb6p to the cell tips, skb1+ and skb1Δ strains were arrested at the G2/M boundary and then exposed to 1.5 m KCl for 20 min. Salt then was removed while cells were maintained at 36 °C. Samples were collected at 0, 15, 60, and 90 min. The cells were methanol-fixed and analyzed as described previously using a Zeiss Axiophot scope equipped with Open Lab 3.0.2 software (Improvision), and NIH Image 1.6.2 software. A Two-hybrid Interaction Screen Identifies Skb1p as a Protein Interacting with Orb6p—To gain insights into how Orb6p regulates cell polarity and mitotic progression, we conducted a two-hybrid screen to identify cDNAs that encode proteins interacting with Orb6p. One of the proteins identified from this screen is the conserved protein methyltransferase Skb1p (19Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Google Scholar, 22Bao S. Yang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R. Verde F. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14549-14552Google Scholar). Orb6p, fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4p, was able to activate lacZ under the control of GAL4 promoters when coexpressed with Skb1p fused to the Gal4p activation domain (Fig. 1A). The positive control coexpressing Snf1p and Snf4p is shown in Fig. 1A. Orb6p was not able to activate lacZ when coexpressed with the Gal4p activation domain alone or with the Gal4p activation domain fused to Snf4p (Fig. 1A) or Pak1p/Shk1p (data not shown). Skb1p fused to the GAD was unable to support activation of lacZ when coexpressed with the GBD fused to Sds23p (Fig. 1A), Snf1p, Cdc23p, Cdt1p, or p53 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between Orb6p and Skb1p is specific. Consistent with the lacZ data, Orb6p (fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4p) activated HIS3 under the control of GAL4 promoter when coexpressed with Skb1p fused to the Gal4p activation domain (Fig. 1B, top). The positive control coexpressing Snf1p and Snf4p is shown in Fig. 1B, bottom. Orb6p was not able to activate HIS3 expression when coexpressed either with the Gal4p activation domain alone (data not shown) or with the Gal4p activation domain fused to Snf4p (data not shown) or Pak1p/Shk1p (Fig. 1B, right). Skb1p fused to the Gal4p activation domain did not activate the HIS3 GAL4 promoter when coexpressed with the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused to p53, Cdt1p, Snf1p (data not shown), or Cdc23p (Fig. 1B, left). Orb6p Interacts with Skb1p in S. pombe Cells and in Vitro—To corroborate the two-hybrid interaction between Orb6p and Skb1p, we tested whether the two proteins interact in fission yeast cells. Orb6p was expressed as a HA epitope-tagged protein (Orb6p-HA), whereas Skb1p was fused to the GST protein (GST-Skb1p). As a negative control, Orb6p-HA was coexpressed with GST alone. Lysates were prepared from cells expressing Orb6p-HA with GST-Skb1p or GST (control). GST-Skb1p or GST then were purified using glutathione-agarose beads. Orb6p-HA copurified with GST-Skb1p (Fig. 2A, lane 2) but not with GST alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In a separate experiment we immunoprecipitated Orb6p-HA using an anti-HA antibody-coupled resin. GST-Skb1p coimmunoprecipitated with Orb6p-HA (Fig. 2B, lane 2), whereas GST alone did not (Fig. 2B, lane 1). These results, taken together with previously published observations that both proteins localize similarly to cell ends and septa in vivo (7Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Google Scholar, 22Bao S. Yang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R. Verde F. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14549-14552Google Scholar), provide strong evidence that Skb1p and Orb6p physically associate in fission yeast cells. To test whether Orb6p and Skb1p can interact directly, we expressed 35S-labeled Orb6p in a rabbit reticulocyte system (Fig. 3A). Reticulocyte lysates containing 35S-Orb6p were incubated with GST-Skb1p expressed bacterially or GST alone, and then the GST complexes were precipitated using glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 3B). We found that Orb6p coprecipitated with GST-Skb1p (Fig. 3A, lane 2) but not with GST (Fig. 3A, lane 1), suggesting that the interaction between Skb1p and Orb6p is direct. Loss of Skb1p Exacerbates the Phenotypic Defects of orb6 Mutants—To determine the role of Skb1p in the control of Orb6p function, we tested if temperature-sensitive mutations in the orb6 gene displayed a synthetic phenotype with deletion mutants of skb1. Wild type 972 (Fig. 4a), single mutant orb6-25 (Fig. 4b) (6Verde F. Mata J. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1529-1538Google Scholar, 7Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Google Scholar), single mutant skb1Δ (Fig. 4c), and double mutant orb6-25 skb1Δ (Fig. 4d) cells were allowed to grow exponentially for eight generations at the permissive temperature of 25 °C in YE medium and then were switched to the semipermissive temperature of 33 °C. The percentage of spherical cells is shown in Fig. 4e. After 5 h at 33 °C, 91% of orb6-25 skb1Δ double mutant cells exhibited a spheroidal morphology as compared with only 18% of orb6-25 mutants (Fig. 4, d and b, respectively). This is a notable difference, considering that single mutant skb1Δ cells are virtually indistinguishable from wild type cells under normal growth conditions (Fig. 4, a and c). Thus, the loss of Skb1p exacerbates the morphological defect resulting from partial loss of Orb6p (Fig. 4e). Orb6p Kinase Activity Is Not Affected by Loss of Skb1p Function—To determine whether Skb1p affects Orb6p kinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation, we purified GST-Orb6p from wild type and skb1Δ cells and performed in vitro kinase assays. The level of GST-Orb6p autophosphorylation was the same for proteins isolated from wild type and skb1Δ cells, suggesting that Skb1p does not regulate Orb6p kinase activity in vivo (Fig. 5A). We also performed the same experiment using a strain expressing Orb6p-HA at the endogenous level. Because we found that Orb6p-HA kinase activity is inhibited when the anti-HA antibody is bound directly to it (data not shown), we immunoprecipitated the Orb6p protein using antibodies to Myc-tagged Mob2p, expressed from its endogenous promoter. As demonstrated previously (28Hou M. Wiley D. Verde F. McCollum D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 125-135Google Scholar), Orb6p-HA readily coimmunoprecipitates with Mob2p-13Myc (Fig. 5D). When we performed the kinase assay, we found that the phosphorylated band shifts when Orb6p is untagged, consistent with the band being Orb6p (Fig. 5D, bottom membrane). Similar to the results obtained with the GST-Orb6p fusion, we found no difference in the Orb6p kinase activity associated with the Mob2p complex in the presence or absence of Skb1p (Fig. 5B). Skb1p Is Required for Proper Localization of Orb6p to the Tips of S. pombe Cells—Like Orb6p, Skb1p is localized to"

We tested whether secretin activates transcription of the major vesicular core protein chromogranin A (CgA). Secretin stimulated both endogenous CgA gene transcription (∼4–6-fold) as well as transfected CgA promoter activity (∼8–10-fold; EC50, ∼7 nm) in PC12 cells. Studies on CgA promoter 5′-deletion mutant/luciferase reporter constructs, point mutations of the CgA cAMP response element (CRE), and their transfer to a heterologous promoter implicated CRE in cis as both necessary and sufficient for secretin-stimulated CgA gene transcription. Secretin-induced CgA gene transcription was inhibited/abolished by cytosolic Ca2+ chelation, chemical blockade of phospholipase C, protein kinase A (PKA), or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and the expression of dominant negative mutants of ERK1/2, CRE binding protein (CREB) kinase RSK2, or CREB. Secretin also augmented (∼4-fold) phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Trans-activation (∼21-fold) of GAL4-CREB fusion protein by secretin indicates involvement of CREB in secretin signaling to gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays also identified CREB as the mediator of secretin-induced CgA gene transcription, and pCREB supershifts indicated Ser-133 as the active CREB moiety in vitro. This conclusion was reinforced in vivo by results of chromatin pCREB immunoprecipitation assays. We conclude that secretin signals to CgA gene transcription through the CRE domain in cis and through cAMP, Ca2+, PKA, MAP kinase, and the transcription factor CREB in trans. Thus, multiple signal transduction pathways seem to subserve the function of stimulus-transcription coupling after this peptidergic stimulus to chromaffin cells.

Chow B.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides stimulation of pancreatic and biliary secretion, secretin also increases cardiac output, cardiac muscle adenylate cyclase activity (6Chatelain P. Robberecht P. De Neef P. Camus J.C. Heuse D.

In the central nervous system, secretin affects turnover and accumulation of dopamine and increases tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis) activity in the hypothalamus, superior cervical ganglion, and sympathetic nerve endings (12Ip N.Y. Baldwin C. Zigmond R.E. Peptides. 1984; 5: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Ip N.Y. Zigmond R.E. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, secretin has also been shown to facilitate γ-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) transmission in the rat cerebellum (5Yung W.H. Leung P.S. Ng S.S. Zhang J. Chan S.C. Chow B.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because of the expression of secretin receptors in organs outside the gastrointestinal system (2Sherwood N.M. Krueckl S.L. McRory J.E. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 619-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 14Nozaki S. Nakata R. Mizuma H. Nishimura N. Watanabe Y. Kohashi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Roskoski Jr., R. White L. Knowlton R. Roskoski L.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), we looked for effects of secretin on catecholamine secretion and found that it induces up to 26% of cell total catecholamine release from PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (16Mahata M. Mahapatra N.R. O'Connor D.T. Mahata S.K. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 508Google Scholar). Because chromogranin A (CgA) is co-stored and co-released with catecholamines (17Takiyyuddin M.A. Cervenka J.H. Sullivan P.A. Pandian M.R. Parmer R.J. Barbosa J.A. O'Connor D.T. Circulation. 1990; 81: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we reasoned that secretin would activate transcription of the CgA gene to replenish the just-secreted CgA protein.Several physiological implications have, to date, been attributed to CgA. The plasma concentration of CgA is elevated in established human essential hypertension (18Takiyyuddin M.A. Parmer R.J. Kailasam M.T. Cervenka J.H. Kennedy B. Ziegler M.G. Lin M.C. Li J. Grim C.E. Wright F.A. O'Connor D.T. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This protein complexes with catecholamines and calcium within secretory vesicles (19Videen J.S. Mezger M.S. Chang Y.M. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and plays a fundamental role in steering secretory proteins into the regulated pathway (20Parmer R.J. Xi X.P. Wu H.J. Helman L.J. Petz L.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, CgA is now established to be a crucial on/off switch for creation of the regulated secretory pathway in catecholaminergic cells; the subtraction of CgA (by antisense CgA mRNA) deletes the regulated pathway (both functionally and morphologically) from chromaffin cells, whereas re-expression of CgA rescues this phenotype (21Kim T. Tao-Cheng J. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In addition, CgA is proteolytically cleaved to form biologically active peptides such as vasostatin (human CgA1–76), which relaxes vascular smooth muscle (22Aardal S. Helle K.B. Regul. Pept. 1992; 41: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), catestatin (bovine CgA344–364) that inhibits catecholamine release (23Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H.

Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Therefore, transcriptional regulation of CgA by secretin may modulate various physiological events.We found that secretin stimulated both endogenous CgA gene transcription as well as transfected CgA promoter activity (EC50, ∼7 nm) in PC12 cells. The present communication describes the cis and trans signaling determinants of CgA gene transcription in response to secretin.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Early passage (passage 8–12) rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (26Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar) were used in this study. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 6% CO2, in 10-cm or 12-well plates.Northern Blots for CgA mRNA—PC12 cells were treated with secretin (1 μm) versus mock for 1–24 h. Total RNA was isolated by guanidinium thiocyanate extraction (RNAzolB; TelTest, Friendswood, TX). RNAs (10–20 μg) were size-fractionated on denaturing 1% agaroseformaldehyde gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and fixed with ultraviolet irradiation (StrataLinker; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The integrity of the RNA was judged by the appearance of 28 and 18 S rRNA bands on the ethidium bromide-stained gel. The blots were pre-hybridized, hybridized, and washed as described (27Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 405-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Random primer-labeled cDNA probes were a 1.6-kbp rat CgA cDNA (28Parmer R.J. Koop A.H. Handa M.T. O'Connor D.T. Hypertension. 1989; 14: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and a 381-bp mouse cyclophilin cDNA (29Hasel K.W. Sutcliffe J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) used as a normalizing probe for a “housekeeping” (constitutively expressed) mRNA. Expression of mRNAs was quantified using the NIH image (version 1.62) software and normalized to cyclophilin gene expression.CgA Promoter-Reporter Constructs and Expression Plasmids—Progressive 5′-deletion mutant constructs of CgA are numbered relative to the transcription initiation (cap) site as +1. For example, pXP1133 contains 1133 bp of the mouse CgA promoter fused to a luciferase reporter in the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pXP1. Generation of deletion as well as site-directed mutant constructs of CgA was described previously (30Wu H. Rozansky D.J. Webster N.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 118-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wu H. Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Webster N.J. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin.

Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Richard A. Maurer (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) kindly supplied these plasmids. We obtained the following plasmids: a dominant negative point mutant of human ERK1 (K71R), subcloned into the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven pCMV5 expression vector (33Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Cobb M.H. Hibi M. Karin M. Brenner D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6030-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) from J. K. Westwick (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC); a dominant negative point mutant of a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged murine RSK2 (HA-RSK2; K100R), subcloned into the adenovirus major late promoter-driven pMT2 expression vector (34Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), from Michael E. Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA); and a dominant negative point mutant (KCREB; R287L) of the human cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) subcloned into the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter-driven pRC expression vector (35Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar), from Richard H. Goodman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR).Transient Transfection/Co-transfection—Supercoiled plasmid DNA was used in transient transfection/co-transfection studies. Plasmids were purified on columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and transfected using the polycationic method (Superfect; Qiagen Inc.) as described previously (27Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 405-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Livsey C.V. Gerdes H.-H. Huttner W.B. O'Connor D.T.

PathDetect® CREB trans-reporting system plasmids, i.e. pFR-Luc (reporter plasmid), pFA2-CREB (fusion trans-activator plasmid), pFC2-dbd (negative control plasmid), and pFC-PKA (positive control plasmid), were obtained from Stratagene. In case of co-transfections when the reporter or trans-activator plasmid did not total the requisite amount of DNA, the balance was composed of supercoiled pBluescript (Stratagene) (27Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 405-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Four to five hours after transfections, PC12 cells were treated with human secretin (1 μm) either alone or in combination with chemical inhibitors for 16–18 h before harvesting for luciferase assay as described previously (27Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 405-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To control for transfection efficiency, in some experiments we co-transfected with the neutral promoter/reporter plasmid pRSV-CAT, as described previously (27Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 405-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this plasmid, the RSV long terminal repeat drives the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter. CAT activity was measured by transfer of [14C]acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to chloramphenicol, as described previously (27Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 405-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Quantitative Determination of pERK1/2—To test whether secretin induces MAP kinase (ERK1/2) activity, we quantitatively determined pERK1/2 in the PC12 cell lysate in response to secretin (1 μm) versus mock using the pERK1/2 TiterZyme® enzyme immunometric assay (EIA) kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). In brief, PC12 cells in 12-well tissue culture plates were treated with secretin (1 μm) for 5–160 min followed by washing once with ice-cold PBS and lysis in 300 μlof10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 70 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. The cell lysates were diluted 1:100 in the assay buffer, and 100 μl of the diluted lysates were applied to the microtiter plate coated with a monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated ERK and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h with shaking. Then, the microtiter plate was washed four times with wash buffer and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to pERK (that binds to the captured pERK on the plate) at RT for 1 h with shaking. After the excess antibody was washed out, the plate was incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (that binds to the rabbit polyclonal antibody) for 30 min with shaking followed by washing out the excess conjugate and incubation with the substrate solution containing 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1n HCl and the optical densities (OD) of the samples were measured at 450 nm. The OD values were converted to pg/ml of pERK by comparing with those for the recombinant pERK standards.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—PC12 cells grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes were treated with secretin (1 μm) versus mock for 10 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared by the procedure of Andrews and Faller (38Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS, scraped off the dishes, collected in 2 ml of ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 500 rpm and 4 °C for 3 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (4 °C) for 5 min. The pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in 200 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept on ice for 30 min. The nuclear extracts were then separated from the debris by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (4 °C) for 10 min and stored at -70 °C in aliquots until use. Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.Synthesis and Labeling of Oligonucleotides—Single-stranded mouse CgA CRE (5′-TCCTATGACGTAATTTCC-3′; CRE sequence in bold) and mutated CgA CRE (5′-TCCTATGA-GTAATTTCC-3′; deletion of C from the CRE sequence is shown by a hyphen) oligomers and their complementary strands were synthesized and PAGE-purified by Genset (San Diego, CA) at the concentrations of 80 pmol/μl. Oligomers and their complementary strands (2 μl each) were mixed with 60 μl of water and 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol and annealed by heating at 90 °C for 5 min, followed by cooling down to RT such that the final concentration of the oligomer was 2 pmol/μl.Double-stranded oligomers (2 μl each) were end-labeled with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a 10-μl reaction mixture. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The radiolabeled oligomers were purified by Nuc Trap probe purification columns (Stratagene) in 100–150 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For EMSAs, 2 μg of nuclear protein extract were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol) for 10 min at RT. The mixtures were then incubated with 20 fmol of radiolabeled oligos for 20 min at RT before being applied to 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels that were run at 150 V in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer at 4 °C. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS films with Kodak Biomax Transcreen HE intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) at -70 °C. For competition experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 10-, 30-, or 90-fold molar excess of the cold (unlabeled) oligomers having identical or different sequences than the radiolabeled oligomer for 10 min at RT in the binding buffer prior to addition of the labeled oligo.The following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) were used in the supershift assays: anti-CREB-1 (24H4B) (mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically reacts with CREB-1 p43); anti-pCREB-1 (affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody that recognizes serine-133 phosphorylated CREB-1, CREM-1 and ATF-1); and anti-AP2α (affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody). Supershift studies were carried out by the addition of the radiolabeled oligomers, followed by the addition of 1 μl of an antibody with the nuclear extract and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed as mentioned above.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Immunoprecipitation of transcriptionally active chromatin was performed using the ChIP assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). In brief, PC12 cells treated with 1 μm secretin (versus mock) for 30 min were then incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link proteins to chromatin in vivo. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340; 10 μl/ml) and then lysed in buffer (0.1% TritonX-100, 10 mm KCl, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8); the lysate was passed through a 30-gauge needle four to five times, and chromatin was fragmented between nucleosomes by the 4-base (5′-GATC-3′) cutter Sau3AI (0.2 units/μl at 37 °C for 20 min) and then centrifuged at ∼15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was pre-cleared with a salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% slurry to reduce nonspecific background. Immunoprecipitation was carried out on the supernatant using immunoaffinity-purified rabbit anti-phospho-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology), affinity-purified rabbit antibody to CREB-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal rabbit (pre-immune) IgG as a negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for reaction overnight at 4 °C. Fresh salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose 50% slurry was added, and, after incubation (1 h at 4 °C), the immunocomplex was pelleted, washed 4 times, eluted by 1% SDS/0.1 m NaHCO3, and subjected to reversal of cross-linking by heating in 0.2 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h, followed by proteinase K digestion at 45 °C for 1 h. The DNA was subsequently extracted with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 20-μg glycogen carriers. The DNA pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of sterile water.The immunoprecipitated DNA samples were analyzed by PCR using the primers 5′-ACGGAAGGGATGTGAGGCTC-3′ (forward primer at -274/-255 bp), and 5′-TGGTGGCAGTGGCGGTGATG-3′ (backward primer at +38/-19 bp) which encompass the CRE region (at -69/-62bp) of the rat chromogranin A promoter. As a control for nonspecific binding with the antibodies, the immunoprecipitated DNA was also subjected to PCR using primers outside the CRE region, i.e. 5′-GGAAACCAACCAGGAAGCAAG-3′ (forward primer at -795/-775 bp), and 5′-AAGTAAGGCAGGTAGCAGTGGGAG-3′ (backward primer at -613/-636 bp). The extracted DNA from the chromatin fragments before antibody precipitation was used as a positive control (“input DNA”). To ensure that the PCR amplification was in the linear range, reactions with different amounts of input DNA samples (both mock- and secretin-treated) were carried out for various (typically 10–40) cycles; a linear range of amplification occurred at ∼25 cycles. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel, which was stained by ethidium bromide, photographed, and quantified by scanning transmission densitometry (results expressed as (arbitrary) densitometric units) using the NIH-Image (version 1.62) software.Peptides and Chemicals—Human secretin (HSDGTFTSELSRLREGARLQRLLQGLV) was purified to >97% homogeneity by reverse phase, high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and obtained either from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA) or Calbiochem. H89, ω-conotoxin GVIA, ω-agatoxin, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, bepridil, chelerythrine, Gö6983, BAPTA-AM, U-73122, PD98059, and 5-Iodotubercidin were obtained from Calbiochem, and nifedipine was obtained from Sigma.Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis—Secretin potency on transcription was estimated as the EC50 value (concentration required to give half-maximal effect), using the program KaleidaGraph 228 (Synergy/Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA). Transfection experiments were repeated at least three times with three wells per condition in each experiment. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed with the program InStat (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Student's t tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests were used, as appropriate. Significance was determined at the p ≤ 0.05 levels.RESULTSActivation of Endogenous CgA Gene Transcription in Response to Secretin—We have already established secretin as an effective chromaffin cell secretagogue (16Mahata M. Mahapatra N.R. O'Connor D.T. Mahata S.K. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 508Google Scholar). Because CgA is co-stored and co-released with catecholamines in response to secretagogues, we tested whether secretin activates transcription of the endogenous CgA gene. Northern blot results revealed that secretin significantly stimulated steady-state CgA mRNA level by ∼1.8-fold in 1 h, reaching ∼6.2-fold stimulation after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1).Transactivation of a Transfected CgA Promoter by Secretin— PC12 cells were transfected with the CgA promoter/luciferase reporter construct pXP1133, which contains 1133 bp of the mouse CgA promoter upstream of the cap (transcriptional start) site, driving a luciferase reporter. Cells were treated with logarithmically ascending doses of secretin (0.0001–1 μma), starting 5 h after transfection, and harvested for luciferase assay 16–18 h after treatment. Secretin dose-dependently increased CgA promoter activity (up to a maximum of 10-fold), with an EC50 of ∼7 nm (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Transactivation of a transfected CgA promoter by secretin. PC12 cells were transfected either with a CgA promoter/luciferase reporter construct (pXP1133) or a series of progressive 5′-deletion mutant constructs treated with secretin (0.0001–1 μm) 5 h after transfections. Cells were harvested 16–18 h after treatment for luciferase assay. A, dose-response study. RLU, relative light unit. B, identification of secretin-responsive domain(s) within the CgA promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1991691293,"We have previously reported that prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) activates p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) through protein kinase C (PKC) in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis induced by PGF2α and the effect of incadronate on the VEGF synthesis in these cells. PGF2α significantly stimulated the VEGF synthesis in a dose-dependent manner between 1 pm and 10 μm. Cycloheximide reduced the PGF2α effect. PGF2α increased the levels of mRNA for VEGF. Cloprostenol, a PGF2α-sensitive receptor agonist, potently induced the VEGF synthesis. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, significantly reduced the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis. Bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of PKC, reduced the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis. The VEGF synthesis induced by PGF2α was significantly attenuated in the PKC down-regulated cells. PGF2α elicited the translocation of PKCβI from cytosol to membrane fraction. PD98059 or U0126, inhibitors of MEK, suppressed the VEGF synthesis induced by PGF2α. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor failed to affect the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis. Incadronate enhanced the synthesis of VEGF induced by PGF2α. NaF-induced VEGF synthesis was also amplified by incadronate. PD98059 suppressed the enhancement by incadronate of PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis. Incadronate markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and p44/p42 MAPK induced by PGF2α or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a PKC activator. Incadronate significantly enhanced the cloprostenol-increased level of VEGF concentration in mouse plasma in vivo. These results strongly suggest that PGF2α stimulates VEGF synthesis through the PKC-dependent activation of p44/p42 MAPK in osteoblasts and that the incadronate enhances the VEGF synthesis at the point between PKC and Raf-1.

Bone metabolism is mainly regulated by two functional cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts; the former is responsible for bone formation, and the latter for bone resorption (1Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Feyen J.H.M. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 855-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that bone-resorptive agents such as parathyroid hormone and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 up-regulate RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB) expression through their specific receptors on osteoblasts, suggesting that osteoblasts play pivotal roles in the regulation of bone resorption (2Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bone remodeling results from the coupling bone resorption by activated osteoclasts with subsequent deposition of new matrix by osteoblasts. During the process, capillary endothelial cells provide the microvasculature, and osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells, which proliferate locally and differentiate into osteoblasts, migrate into the resorption lacuna. Thus, it is currently recognized that the activities of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and capillary endothelial cells are closely coordinated via humoral factors as well as by direct cell-to-cell contact and that these cells cooperatively regulate bone metabolism (3Erlebacher A.

Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). It is well recognized that VEGF is produced and secreted from a variety of cell types (4Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). It has been reported that inactivation of VEGF causes impaired trabecular bone formation and expansion of the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone in mouse tibial epiphyseal growth plate associated with the complete suppression of vascular invasion (5Gerber H.-P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence is accumulating that osteoblasts produce VEGF and secrete it in response to various humoral factors (4Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 6Harada S. Nagy J.A. Sullivan K.A. Thomas K.A. Endo N. Rodan G.A. J. Clin.

We have recently reported that basic fibroblast growth factor and prostaglandin (PG) E1 stimulate VEGF synthesis through the activation of p44/p42 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38 MAPK, respectively, in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells (10Tokuda H. Kozawa O. Uematsu T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2371-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Tokuda H. Kozawa O. Miwa M. Uematsu T. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism behind VEGF synthesis in osteoblasts has not yet been fully clarified. Bisphosphonates, stable analogues of pyrophosphate, have been developed as potent inhibitors of bone resorption and effective tools for the treatment of various metabolic bone diseases associated with increased osteoclastic bone resorption such as Paget's disease, tumoral bone disease, and osteoporosis (12Fleisch H. Reszka A. Rodan G.A. Rogers M. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd. Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 1361-1385Google Scholar). Inhibition of osteoclast recruitment, osteoclastic adhesion to bone surface, and osteoclast activity is known to be the main mechanism of the anti-bone-resorptive actions of bisphosphonates (12Fleisch H. Reszka A. Rodan G.A. Rogers M. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd. Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 1361-1385Google Scholar). On the other hand, at least some of the effects of bisphosphonates on osteoclast development and function are proposed to be mediated through the actions to osteoblasts (12Fleisch H. Reszka A. Rodan G.A. Rogers M. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd. Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 1361-1385Google Scholar). It has been reported that ibandronate and alendronate induce the synthesis of an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption in osteoblastic cell line CRP 10/30 (13Vitte C. Fleisch H. Guenther H.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 136: 2324-2333Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Etidronate, alendronate, pamidronate, and olpadronate reportedly prevent apoptosis of murine primary cultured osteoblasts through the activation of p44/p42 MAPK (14Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Pamidronate and zoledronate have recently been shown to enhance the differentiation and bone-forming activities of primary cultured human fetal osteoblasts (15Reinholz G.C. Getz B. Pederson L. Sanders E.S. Subramaniam M. Ingle J.N. Spelsberg T.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6001-6007PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that pamidronate and clodronate increase the expression of mRNA for osteopontin and RANKL in UMR 106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells (16Mackie P.S. Fisher J.L. Zhou H. Choong P.F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it is currently speculated that the effects of bisphosphonates on bone metabolism are exerted through not only osteoclasts but also osteoblasts. PGs are well known to act as autocrine/paracrine modulators of osteoblasts (1Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Feyen J.H.M. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 855-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 17Pilbeam C.C. Harrison J.R. Raisz L.G. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 715-728Google Scholar). Among them, PGF2α is recognized to be a potent bone-resorbing agent (17Pilbeam C.C. Harrison J.R. Raisz L.G. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 715-728Google Scholar) and stimulates the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of osteoblasts (17Pilbeam C.C. Harrison J.R. Raisz L.G. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 715-728Google Scholar). In previous studies (18Miwa M. Tokuda H. Tsushita K. Kotoyori J. Takahashi Y. Ozaki N. Kozawa O. Oiso Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Kozawa O. Suzuki A. Kotoyori J. Tokuda H. Watanabe Y. Ito Y. Oiso Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that PGF2α stimulates both phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PIPLC) and phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PC-PLD), recognized to be two major pathways of physiological protein kinase C (PKC) activation (20Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 21Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. We have also reported that PGF2α activates p44/p42 MAPK through PKC in these cells (22Tokuda H. Kozawa O. Harada A. Uematsu T. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether PGF2α stimulates VEGF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells, and if so, the mechanism of VEGF synthesis and the effect of incadronate on the VEGF synthesis. Our results strongly suggest that incadronate enhances the PGF2α-stimulated VEGF synthesis in osteoblasts and that the effect is exerted at the point between PKC and Raf-1. Materials—PGF2α, cycloheximide, PGE2, PGD2, indomethacin, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).

(Beverly, MA). A mouse VEGF ELISA kit and a mouse VEGF mRNA quantitation kit were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). An ECL Western blotting detection system and a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. PGF2α, cycloheximide, cloprostenol, PGE2, PGD2, and indomethacin were dissolved in ethanol. PD98059 and U0126 were dissolved in Me2SO. FTase inhibitor III was dissolved in acetic acid. The maximum concentration of ethanol, Me2SO, or acetic acid was 0.1%, which did not affect the assay for VEGF or the analysis of Western blot. Cell Culture—Cloned osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells derived from newborn mouse calvaria (23Sudo M. Kodama H. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar) were maintained as previously described (24Kozawa O. Tokuda H. Miwa M. Kotoyori J. Oiso Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. The cells were seeded into 35-mm (5 × 104) or 90-mm (5 × 105) diameter dishes in α-MEM containing 10% FCS. After 5 days, the medium was exchanged for α-MEM containing 0.3% FCS. The cells were used for experiments after 48 h. When indicated, the cells were pretreated with 0.1 μm TPA for 24 h, as previously reported (25Kozawa O. Suzuki A. Tokuda H. Uematsu T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 272: E208-E211Google Scholar). Assay for VEGF—The cells were stimulated by PGF2α, cloprostenol, PGE2, PGD2, or NaF in 1 ml of α-MEM containing 0.3% FCS for the indicated periods. In some experiments, the pretreatment with cycloheximide or indomethacin was performed for 30 min prior to the stimulation, and the pretreatment with bisindolylmaleimide, PD98059, or U0126 was performed for 60 min. The cells were pretreated with FTase inhibitor III for 4 h. The reaction was terminated by collecting the medium, and VEGF in the medium was measured by using a VEGF ELISA kit. When indicated, the cells were pretreated with incadronate, etidronate, tiludronate, or alendronate for 8 h. Isolation of RNA and Quantification of mRNA for VEGF—The cultured cells were stimulated by PGF2α or PGE2 in 1 ml of α-MEN containing 0.3% FCS for 2 h. Total RNA was isolated with a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit. Total RNA (3 μg) from each sample was subjected to the quantification of mRNA for VEGF using a mouse VEGF mRNA quantitation kit. Analysis of PKCβI, p44/p42 MAPK, MEK1/2, or Raf-1—The cultured cells were stimulated by PGF2α or TPA in 4 ml of α-MEM containing 0.3% FCS for the indicated periods. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed, homogenized, and sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The analysis of PKCβI translocation to the plasma membrane was performed as previously described (26Miao L. Dai Y. Zhang J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H983-H989PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h to generate membrane and cytosolic fractions, and the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer. For the analysis of p44/p42 MAPK, MEK1/2, or Raf-1, the cytosolic fraction was collected as a supernatant after centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) in 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (28Kato K. Goto S. Hasegawa K. Inaguma Y. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by using PKCβI antibodies, phospho-specific p44/p42 MAPK antibodies, p44/p42 MAPK antibodies, phospho-specific MEK1/2 antibodies, MEK1/2 antibodies, or phospho-specific Raf-1 antibodies, with peroxidaselabeled antibodies raised in goat against rabbit IgG being used as second antibodies. Peroxidase activity on the nitrocellulose sheet was visualized on x-ray film by means of the ECL Western blotting detection system. When indicated, the cells were pretreated with incadronate or vehicle for 8 h. Assay for VEGF in Mouse Plasma in Vivo—C57B mice, obtained from SLC (Sizuoka, Japan), were divided into four groups, a control group (n = 3), a group treated with incadronate (n = 3), a group treated with cloprostenol (n = 3), and a group treated with both compounds (n = 6). Mice were placed in a supine position under anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital at a dose of 44 mg/kg. Catheters (Natume Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were connected to the left jugular vein for the infusion of either incadronate or buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl) and to the right jugular artery for monitoring blood pressure and pulse rate using a pressure transducer (AP601G Nihon Koden, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Incadronate at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (0.25 ml) was intravenously injected as a bolus (10% of total volume) and continuously infused for 2 h using an infusion pump via a right jugular vein. Cloprostenol at a dose of 0.2 μg per day was administered once a day by subcutaneous injection. In a group of combined treatments, the first administration of cloprostenol was performed at the end of infusion of incadronate, and the daily administration was continued for the indicated periods. Blood samples (0.3 ml) were collected via the jugular vein on sodium citrate (3.15%) under anesthesia with ether at the indicated time point. The plasma concentration of VEGF was measured by using a VEGF ELISA kit. The experiment was performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines. Determination—The absorbance of ELISA samples was measured at 450 nm with an EL 340 Bio Kinetic Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The densitometric analysis was performed using Molecular Analyst/Macintosh (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons between pairs, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. Each experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Effects of PGF2αon VEGF Synthesis and the Level of mRNA for VEGF in MC3T3-E1 Cells—PGF2α stimulated the VEGF synthesis time-dependently up to 48 h in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 1). The VEGF synthesis was significant after 3 h (Fig. 1). The stimulatory effect of PGF2α on VEGF synthesis was dose-dependent in the range between 1 pm and 10 μm (Fig. 2). The maximum effect of PGF2α was observed at 10 μm. Cycloheximide (10 μm), an inhibitor of protein synthesis (29Obrig T.G. Culp W.J. Mckeehan W.L. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which by itself had no effect on the VEGF level, markedly inhibited the PGF2α-increased VEGF level (17 ± 2 pg/ml for control; 16 ± 2 pg/ml for 10 μm cycloheximide; 1921 ± 153 pg/ml for 10 μm PGF2α alone; and 759 ± 62 (p < 0.05, compared with the value of PGF2α alone) pg/ml for 10 μm PGF2α with 10 μm cycloheximide pretreatment, as measured during the stimulation for 48 h). PGF2α also increased the level of mRNA for VEGF (Table I). To clarify whether FP receptor is required for the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis or not in MC3T3-E1 cells, we examined the effect of cloprostenol, an FP agonist (30Dukes M. Russell W. Walpole A.L. Nature. 1974; 250: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), on the VEGF synthesis. Cloprostenol significantly stimulated the VEGF synthesis (Table II). PGE2 is known to be abundantly produced by osteoblasts, including MC3T3-E1 cells, and act as a potent regulator of bone metabolism (17Pilbeam C.C. Harrison J.R. Raisz L.G. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 715-728Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of PGE2 on the VEGF level in these cells. PGE2 induced the VEGF synthesis (Table I) and increased the level of mRNA for VEGF (Table II). However, the effects were weaker than those of PGF2α. We have previously reported that PGE1 stimulates VEGF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells (11Tokuda H. Kozawa O. Miwa M. Uematsu T. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that PGD2 induced VEGF synthesis in these cells (data not shown).Fig. 2Dose-dependent effect of PGF2α on VEGF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Indomethacin on the PGF2α-induced VEGF Synthesis in MC3T3-E1 Cells—It is well known that PGs act as autocrine/paracrine modulators of osteoblasts (1Nijweide P.J.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 715-728Google Scholar). To clarify whether endogenous PG synthesis is involved in the VEGF synthesis induced by PGF2α, we investigated the effect of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (31Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), on the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. Indomethacin, which alone had little effect on the VEGF synthesis, reduced the VEGF synthesis stimulated by PGF2α in a dose-dependent manner in the range between 3 and 30 μm (Fig. 3). Effects of PKC Down-regulation or Bisindolylmaleimide on PGF2α-induced VEGF Synthesis in MC3T3-E1 Cells—We have previously reported that PGF2α activates both PI-PLC and PC-PLD, known as major pathways of PKC activation (20Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 21Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4015) Google Scholar), down-regulates PKC in these cells (33Sakai T. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. Oka N. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We also found that the binding capacity of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, a PKC-activating phorbol ester (32Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4015) Google Scholar), in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with TPA for 24 h is reduced to about 30% of the capacity in intact cells (25Kozawa O. Suzuki A. Tokuda H. Uematsu T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 272: E208-E211Google Scholar). To clarify the role of PKC in the PGF2α-stimulated VEGF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells, we examined the effect of TPA long term pretreatment on the VEGF. The effect of PGF2α on VEGF synthesis was significantly reduced in the PKC down-regulated cells compared with that in the cells without TPA pretreatment (Table III). In addition, we examined the effect of bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of PKC (34Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirlowsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on the VEGF synthesis induced by PGF2α in MC3T3-E1 cells. Bisindolylmaleimide, which by itself had little effect on the level of VEGF, significantly suppressed the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in the range between 1 and 10 μm (Fig. 4).Table IIIEffect of PKC down-regulation on the PGF2α-induced VEGF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cellsThe cultured cells were pretreated with 0.1 μM TPA or vehicle for 24 h and then stimulated by 10 μM PGF2α or vehicle for 48 h.

Okano Y. Nozawa Y. Oka N. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is well recognized that the translocation of PKC from cytosol to plasma membrane occurs when PKC is activated (32Nishizuka Y.

https://openalex.org/W2091700816,"The question remains open whether the signaling pathways shown to be important for growth and transformation in adherent cultures proceed similarly and play similar roles for cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected with the avian sarcoma virus UR2, encoding the oncogenic receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) v-Ros, or with two of its transformation-impaired mutants were grown in nonadherent conditions in methylcellulose (MC)-containing medium, and the signaling functions essential for Ros-induced anchorage-independent growth were analyzed. We found that the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in CEF transformed by v-Ros or by two oncogenic nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), v-Src and v-Yes, was dramatically reduced in nonadherent conditions compared with that in adherent conditions, indicating that cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix plays an important role in efficient substrate phosphorylation by these constitutively activated PTKs. The UR2 transformation-defective mutants were differentially impaired compared with UR2 in the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Stat3 in nonadherent conditions. Consistently, the constitutively activated mutants of PI 3-kinase and Stat3 rescued the ability of the UR2 mutants to promote anchorage-independent growth. Conversely, dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase and Stat3 inhibited UR2-induced anchorage-independent growth. UR2-infected CEF grown in nonadherent conditions displayed faster cell cycle progression than the control or the UR2 mutant-infected cells, and this appeared to correlate with a PI 3-kinase-dependent increase in cyclin A-associated Cdk2 activity. Treatment of UR2-infected cells with Cdk2 inhibitors led to the loss of the anchorage-independent growth-promoting activity of UR2. In conclusion, we have adopted an experimental system enabling us to study the signaling pathways in cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions and have identified matrix-independent activation of PI 3-kinase and Stat3 signaling functions, as well as the PI 3-kinase-dependent increase of cyclin A-associated Cdk2 kinase activity, to be critical for the Ros-PTK-induced anchorage-independent growth.

The v-ros oncogene of the avian sarcoma virus UR2 encodes a constitutively active 68-kDa RPTK, derived by the fusion of viral gag to the N-terminal truncated c-Ros, which is expressed as a transmembrane protein with the gag moiety protruding extracellularly (8Jong S.-M.J.

Balduzzi P.C. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 833-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the functional role of specific tyrosine residues of v-Ros, particularly with respect to their roles in mitogenic versus transforming ability, we had generated and analyzed a series of loss-of-function mutants (12Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The two mutants F419 and DI (Fig. 1A) displayed wild type kinase and mitogenic activities of CEF grown in monolayer but were attenuated in their ability to promote anchorage-independent growth. F419 contains a phenylalanine substitution for the third tyrosine (Y419F) in the triple tyrosine cluster within the Ros PTK domain. DI harbors a 6-amino acid deletion 3 amino acids downstream of the predicted catalytic loop of the Ros PTK. These mutants proved to be invaluable tools for the identification of signaling pathways essential for anchorage-independent growth. Employing CEF grown in monolayer, we found that both F419 and DI displayed a reduced ability to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of a series of cytoskeletal proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (12Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, F419 was impaired in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and in inducing IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity (12Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ability of cells to proliferate in the absence of adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or anchorage-independent growth is one of the hallmarks of transformed cells and is also the best in vitro correlate of tumorigenicity (13Freedman U.H. Shin S. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the molecular mechanisms facilitating anchorage-independent growth in vitro are also responsible for the aggressive growth properties of naturally occurring tumors. The signaling pathways activated by the binding of the cognate growth factors to RPTKs on the cell surface and by the integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) jointly regulate cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 14Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 15Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The cytoplasmic signaling pathways include protein-tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase cascades, small GTPases, inositol lipid pathways, and other phospholipid cascades (reviewed in Refs. 18Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar, 19Giancotti F.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E13-E14Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Giancotti F.G.

When cells are dissociated from the ECM, attenuating the activation of one or more of those pathways, fibroblasts typically undergo cell cycle arrest (22Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar), whereas epithelial (23Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar) and endothelial (24Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar) cells undergo anchorage-related apoptosis or “anoikis.” In transformed cells, alterations and activation of certain signaling functions including integrin-associated signaling may presumably abrogate the requirement for adhesion to the ECM, leading to increased cell cycle progression in fibroblasts or anoikis resistance in epithelial and endothelial cells, thereby facilitating their anchorage-independent growth. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is a lipid and protein kinase activated by RPTKs. Upon activation, PI 3-kinase phosphorylates inositol lipids at the D-3 position of the inositol ring to generate 3-phosphatidylinositol phosphates such as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. These phosphatidylinositol phosphates then function as second messengers serving as binding sites for proteins containing pleckstrin homology domains or FYVE fingers (25Leevers S.J Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase has key regulatory functions in many cellular processes such as cell proliferation (26Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

STATs have been found to be activated in a wide variety of tumors and oncogene-transformed cell lines (reviewed in Ref. 39Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6613-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Stat3 was shown to be constitutively activated in src-transformed NIH3T3 cells (40Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 41Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), and its activation was essential for src-induced cell transformation (42Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 43Turkson J. Bowman T Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We have also previously reported that Stat3 plays an important role in oncogenic Ros- and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, particularly in their anchorage-independent growth (44Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Anchorage may modulate cell cycle progression in fibroblasts by regulating various components of the G1 phase. The G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle is controlled by functionally distinct Cdks that are sequentially regulated by cyclins D1–3, E, and A. The D cyclins associate with Cdk4 and Cdk6, whereas cyclins E and A associate with Cdk2. In the absence of ECM adhesion, the transcription and translation of cyclin D1 are blocked in primary human fibroblasts and some fibroblast cell lines (45Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 46Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and the growth factor-dependent induction of cyclin E-associated Cdk2 activity fails to occur. The latter may be due to an increase in the steady state levels of the cip/kip family (p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1, and p57) of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, as well as redistribution of the total p21/p27 pool from the cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 to the cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes as a consequence of reduced adhesion-dependent expression of cyclin D1 (46Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Since cyclin D-Cdk4/6-mediated phosphorylation disrupts retinoblastoma (Rb)-E2F and p107-E2F complexes, ECM adhesion also controls the induction of E2F target genes such as cyclin E and A (45Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 46Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J.

E2F-independent mechanisms for the expression of cyclin A have also been described (47Kang J.S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 49Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Nonadherent v-Ras-infected ER-1–2 cells, which are transformation revertants, show mitogen-induced cyclin D1 expression, cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, and Rb phosphorylation, but not cyclin A expression, and the ectopic expression of cyclin A in these cells can rescue the block of S phase entry (47Kang J.S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The vast majority of the studies on signaling pathways involved in cell transformation, including our studies with UR2 and its mutants so far, have employed cells grown in adherent cultures. Only very recently has there been some information available about signaling in nonadherent conditions. Whereas these limited studies have contributed to our understanding of the role of ECM adhesion in cellular signal transduction, a great deal still needs to be learnt about the signaling pathways that enable transformed cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. We have used a system that permits the growth and colony formation of cells in nonadherent conditions and the subsequent recovery of the cells, such that the signal transduction pathways that are operative in the absence of adhesion and are required for anchorage-independent growth of the transformed cells can be characterized. In order to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying UR2-mediated anchorage-independent growth, the signaling pathways activated by UR2 and its mutants, F419 and DI, have been analyzed and compared in adherent and nonadherent conditions. In anchorage-independent conditions, UR2-expressing cells displayed a faster cell cycle progression than the control and the mutant-expressing CEF. UR2, but not its mutants, was able to induce the matrix-independent activation of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, and the increase of cyclin A-associated Cdk2 activity, and these signaling pathways were found to be critical for v-Ros-induced anchorageindependent growth. Cells and Viruses—Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared from 11-day embryos and maintained according to the published procedure (50Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CEF were maintained in F-10/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 5% calf serum and 1% chicken serum. Molecularly cloned avian sarcoma virus UR2 and its helper virus UR2AV have been described (10Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 879-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids of UR2 and its mutants F419 and DI have been described (12Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Virus stocks were obtained 10 days after DNA transfection with the respective viral DNA plasmids (see below) by collecting the overnight culture supernatants from the transfected cells. Plasmids—The dnp85 construct was obtained from Dr. Julian Downward (Signal Transduction Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). The BD110 construct was obtained from Dr. Yasuhisa Fukui (University of Tokyo). Dominant negative (dn) Stat3–2 and constitutively activated (ca) Stat3-C were obtained from Dr. James Darnell (Rockefeller University). Us9-GFP was obtained from Dr. Andrew J. Beavis (Princeton University). DNA Transfections—1 × 106 CEF were plated per 60-mm dish 1 day before transfection. 20 μg of the UR2 or the F419/DI mutant plasmid and 2 μg of SacI-digested pUR2AV helper viral DNA were mixed and added to cells along with 30 μg/ml polybrene. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5–6 h, shocked with medium containing 25% Me2SO, washed, and replaced with regular growth medium. Transfections of dn and ca plasmids were performed using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 5 × 106 CEF/100-mm dish were transfected with 25 μg of the empty vector or mutant-expressing vector along with one-tenth molar amount of the Us9-GFP plasmid. GFP-expressing cells were isolated by cell sorting using a MoFlo Cell Sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Biological Assays—Cell transformation was monitored by morphological changes and anchorage-independent growth as described previously (51Jiang Y. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 160-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 52Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Zong C.S. Poon B. Chen J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6453-6462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soft agar colony formation assays were carried out for 7–14 days, following which the colonies were stained with p-iodonitrotetrazonium (0.25 mg/ml) in normal growth medium for 2 days and counted. For colony formation in methylcellulose, medium containing 1.3% methylcellulose was used for the top layer instead of the 0.41% soft agar medium on the same platform of bottom layer agar. Culture and Recovery of Adherent and Nonadherent CEF—Preparative methylcellulose culture conditions and recovery of cells from such cultures were according to the published procedures (54Assoian R.K. Boardman L.A. Drosinos S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 1771: 95-99Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Upon transformation, the transfected cells were amplified and either plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish or seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells/75 ml of 1.3% methylcellulose-containing medium in 250-ml centrifuge tubes (Corning). After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were treated with 200 μm Na3VO4 for 4 h. The methylcellulose cultures were diluted by the addition of 3 volumes of ice-cold Tris-Glu buffer to reduce the viscosity of the methylcellulose, and the cells were recovered by gentle centrifugation at 4 °C. The cells were further washed twice with the Tris-Glu buffer and recovered. Protein Analysis—Protein extraction, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting have been described (8Jong S.-M.J. Wang L.-H. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 7-21PubMed Google Scholar, 52Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro assays of PTK, MAP kinase, and PI 3-kinase have also been previously described (53Zong C.S. Poon B. Chen J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6453-6462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 914-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1-associated Cdk4/6 kinase assay and cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated Cdk2 assays followed the published procedures (56Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 57Saudan P. Vlach J. Beard P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4351-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Inhibitors—Anti-Ros and anti-IRS-1 antibodies were prepared in our laboratory and have been previously described (8Jong S.-M.J. Wang L.-H. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 7-21PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang L.-H. Hanafusa H. Notter F.D. Balduzzi P.C. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 833-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other antibodies were purchased from the following companies: PLCγ, p85, and FAK (for immmunoprecipitation) antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; Shc, FAK (for Western blotting), paxillin, p130cas, Crk, β-catenin, γ-catenin, phosphotyrosine-horseradish peroxidase (RC20-HRP), mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibodies from Transduction Laboratories; Erk2, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, p21, and p27 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG Ab from Sigma; anti-retinoblastoma (Rb) Ab from Pharmingen; anti-pRb Ab from Cell Signaling; and anti-Myc Ab from the Mount Sinai Hybridoma Core Facility. All antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's recommended dilutions. LY294002 and roscovitine were purchased from Calbiochem. Olomoucine was purchased from Sigma. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells plated in monolayer or cultured in methylcellulose medium were recovered after 48 h and fixed at 4 °C with 70% ethanol for 2 h. After the cells were washed with PBS, they were gently resuspended in 1 ml of DNA staining solution (PBS, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml RNase A, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide). The cells were stored in the dark at 4 °C prior to flow cytometry analysis at the Mount Sinai Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Analysis was performed using Cell Quest software. Anchorage-independent Growth in Methylcellulose—CEF infected with UR2 or its transformation-impaired mutants, F419 and DI, were grown under adherent (or anchorage-dependent) conditions in monolayer cultures or under nonadherent (anchorage-independent) conditions in methylcellulose cultures. In monolayer, UR2-infected CEF are highly transformed, displaying a characteristic elongated, fusiform, and refractile morphology (12Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The colony forming ability of UR2-expressing CEF in methylcellulose essentially emulated that in soft agar; a large number of colonies were visible within 7–10 days (Fig. 1B). The F419 and DI mutant-expressing CEF showed dramatically reduced transforming abilities as reflected in the morphology, which resembled control cells (not shown), and in their diminished ability to form colonies in methylcellulose cultures (Fig. 1B). UR2-expressing CEF and UR2 mutant-expressing CEF were recovered from methylcellulose cultures at 2 and 4 days after seeding and counted to determine their growth rates (Fig. 1C). On day 2, the number of UR2-expressing CEF was more than double that of control CEF. The F419- and DI-expressing cells were differentially impaired in anchorage-independent growth compared with the UR2-expressing cells. By day 4, the reduced anchorage-independent growth of the control and the mutant-expressing CEF became even more apparent. In order to determine whether UR2 was promoting anchorage-independent growth by preventing cell death or by promoting cell cycle progression in nonadherent conditions, we performed a trypan blue exclusion test and cell cycle analysis. The trypan blue exclusion test revealed that the rate of cell death of the control CEF as well as the UR2- and mutant-expressing CEF was comparable, up to 10% in 2 days and up to 20% in 4 days of culturing the cells in MC medium (data not shown). Thus, cell death was not the reason for the differentially impaired growth of the control and mutant-expressing CEF in nonadherent conditions compared with the UR2-transformed cells. The CEF grown in anchorage-independent conditions in MC medium for 48 h were subjected to cell cycle analysis following staining with propidium iodide. The UR2-expressing cells showed a faster cell cycle progression than the control and mutant-expressing CEF (Table I). Whereas the control, F419-expressing, and DI-expressing CEF had ∼71, 72, and 74% of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, respectively, the UR2-expressing cells had only 63.5% of cells in G1. The UR2-expressing cells displayed a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Whereas the control, F419-expressing, and DI-expressing CEF each had ∼23% of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, the UR2-expressing cells had 32% of cells in S and G2/M.Table IPercentages of cells in different stages of the cell cycleCellsG1SG2/M%%%CEF71.29 ± 5.19.17 ± 1.313.46 ± 5.2F41971.89 ± 8.58.61 ± 2.914.86 ± 7.1DI74.02 ± 6.89.11 ± 2.713.58 ± 5.0UR263.52 ± 7.912.13 ± 6.519.81 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab PTK Activities of UR2 and I"
