https://openalex.org/W2098527861,"Bands That Separate In organic photovoltaic devices, the charge carriers that form at the interface between donor and acceptor layers—the electrons and holes—form bound states called excitons. Efficient current generation requires some mechanism for their separation and for the movement of free carriers to the electrodes. Bakulin et al. (p. 1340 , published online 23 February) studied a process in which the excitons created with an optical pulse were also subjected to infrared pulses. In polymer-blend devices, a three-step process was observed: The boundstate excitons diffused toward the donor-acceptor interface, formed a charge-transfer state, and then dissociated into free carriers."

Pocock et al. (p. 973 ) have linked seven different types of ecological networks to form a network of networks. They found that although networks varied in their robustness to species loss, they did not strongly co-vary; that is, what happens to one network is unrelated to what happens to another. The networks studied were identified from an agroecosystem in the southwestern UK, a habitat in which biodiversity has suffered substantially. This study succeeded in revealing which species are potential targets for restoration of ecological function in this and other systems."

Molecular dynamic simulations have observed sharp transitions, with barrier crossing times of less than a microsecond, a fraction of the total folding time; however, this time range has been inaccessible to single-molecule experiments. Chung et al. (p. 981 ) described single-molecule fluorescence experiments that allowed measurement of the transition-path time for a fast-folding protein and to reduce the upper bound for a slow-folding protein. Although the folding rates differed by a factor of 10,000, the transition-path times differ by less than a factor of 5, pointing to energy landscape theory for the explanation."

https://openalex.org/W1992637754,"Autophagy and apoptosis are two evolutionarily conserved processes that regulate cell fate in response to cytotoxic stress. However, the functional relationship between these two processes remains far from clear. Here, we demonstrate an autophagy-dependent mechanism of caspase-8 activation and initiation of the apoptotic cascade in response to SKI-I, a pan-sphingosine kinase inhibitor, and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. Autophagy is induced concomitantly with caspase-8 activation, which is responsible for initiation of the caspase cascade and the mitochondrial amplification loop that is required for full execution of apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagosome formation by depletion of Atg5 or Atg3 results in a marked suppression of caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. Although caspase-8 self-association depends on p62/SQSTM1, its self-processing requires the autophagosomal membrane. Caspase-8 forms a complex with Atg5 and colocalizes with LC3 and p62. Moreover, FADD, an adaptor protein for caspase-8 activation, associates with Atg5 on Atg16L- and LC3-positive autophagosomal membranes and loss of FADD suppresses cell death. Taken together, these results indicate that the autophagosomal membrane serves as a platform for an intracellular death-inducing signaling complex (iDISC) that recruits self-associated caspase-8 to initiate the caspase-8/-3 cascade."

Palmer et al. (p. 989 ) used a combination of optogenetic, calcium-imaging, and electrophysiological methods to investigate the cellular mechanism of interhemispheric inhibition of the firing frequency of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rats in vivo and in vitro. They discovered that this form of inhibition involved interneurons in the top layers of the cortex that suppressed active dendritic currents synergistically recruited by back-propagating action potentials. This mechanism depended upon a γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor–mediated mechanism acting on specific ion channels in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2091354788,"How Dry They Were How much rainfall failure contributed to the disintegration of classical Maya civilization? Medina-Elizalde and Rohling (p. 956 ) analyzed records from three lakes and a stalagmite from the Yucatán Peninsula to quantify the change in precipitation that the region experienced between 800 to 1000 years A.D. Precipitation decreased episodically for up to a decade at a time and in total by as much as 40% during the 200 years of the civilization's fall, probably as a result of a reduction in summer tropical storm rainfall. This finding highlights the sensitivity of this region to modest reductions of rainfall that are projected by some climate model."
https://openalex.org/W2088418478,"Remembering Stressful Events Situations surrounding emotional events are better remembered than others that accompany neutral events. However, in severe pathological states such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), exposure to threatening situations can also result in memory impairment. In this case, a hypermnesia for a salient trauma-related cue is associated with loss of memory for important aspects of the traumatic event. The memory for the core traumatic event is enhanced, but the capacity to place it in the right place and in response to the right cues is reduced. Kaouane et al. (p. 1510 , published online 23 February) associated a high-intensity threat with the infusion of corticosterone in the hippocampus to induce PTSD-like memory impairments in mice. The animals became unable to identify the threat context as the right predictor of the threat, and they showed a fear response for discrete salient cues normally identified as safe. The neural activation patterns in the amygdala and hippocampal regions of these mice were similar to those observed in human PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2097346411,"Warming and Shrinking In most mammals, individual body sizes tend to be smaller in warmer regions and larger in cooler regions. Secord et al. (p. 959 ; see the Perspective by Smith ) examined a high-resolution 175,000-year record of equid fossils deposited over a past climate shift—the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum—for changes in body size. Using oxygen isotopes collected from the teeth of co-occurring mammal species to track prevailing environmental temperature, a clear decrease in equid body size was seen during 130,000 years of warming, followed by a distinct increase as the climate cooled at the end of the period. These results indicate that temperature directly influenced body size in the past and may continue to have an influence as our current climate changes."

In the acidic intestine, ingested BoNTs are protected within a progenitor toxin complex. The toxins are released on absorption into the neutral bloodstream. Gu et al. (p. 977 ; see the Perspective by Adler ) present the structure of a minimally functional progenitor toxin complex—BoNT in complex with a nontoxic, nonhemagglutinin protein at 2.7 angstrom resolution. The structure, together with biochemical studies, showed how complex assembly is regulated by pH and may be useful in guiding the development of delivery vehicles for oral administration of biologics and in the design of inhibitors for oral BoNT poisoning."

Treacy and Borisenko (p. 950 ; see the Perspective by Gibson ) used fluctuation electron microscopy to explain that models including regions of crystalline order are needed to fit the observed local variations in structure. Thus, on the 1- to 2-nanometer-length scale, this material should be thought of as having a paracrystalline structure containing localized crystalline regions."
https://openalex.org/W2000918346,"The sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein-1 (SAMHD1) inhibits infection of myeloid cells by human and related primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV). This potent inhibition is counteracted by the Vpx accessory virulence factor of HIV-2/SIVsm viruses, which targets SAMHD1 for proteasome-dependent degradation, by reprogramming cellular CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, the precise mechanism of Vpx-dependent recruitment of human SAMHD1 onto the ligase, and the molecular interfaces on the respective molecules have not been defined. Here, we show that human SAMHD1 is recruited to the CRL4(DCAF1-Vpx) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex by interacting with the DCAF1 substrate receptor subunit in a Vpx-dependent manner. No stable association is detectable with DCAF1 alone. The SAMHD1 determinant for the interaction is a short peptide located distal to the SAMHD1 catalytic domain and requires the presence of Vpx for stable engagement. This peptide is sufficient to confer Vpx-dependent recruitment to CRL4(DCAF1) and ubiquitination when fused to heterologous proteins. The precise amino acid sequence of the peptide diverges among SAMHD1 proteins from different vertebrate species, explaining selective down-regulation of human SAMHD1 levels by Vpx. Critical amino acid residues of SAMHD1 and Vpx involved in the DCAF1-Vpx-SAMDH1 interaction were identified by mutagenesis. Our findings show that the N terminus of Vpx, bound to DCAF1, recruits SAMHD1 via its C terminus to CRL4, in a species-specific manner for proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2016218780,"Female rodents are known to terminate pregnancies after exposure to unfamiliar males (""Bruce effect""). Although laboratory support abounds, direct evidence for a Bruce effect under natural conditions is lacking. Here, we report a strong Bruce effect in a wild primate, the gelada (Theropithecus gelada). Female geladas terminate 80% of pregnancies in the weeks after a dominant male is replaced. Further, data on interbirth intervals suggest that pregnancy termination offers fitness benefits for females whose offspring would otherwise be susceptible to infanticide. Taken together, data support the hypothesis that the Bruce effect can be an adaptive strategy for females."

https://openalex.org/W2161340566,"Thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) expression increases dramatically in hypertrophic and failing hearts in rodent models and in humans. The aim of this study was to address the function of TSP-4 in the heart. TSP-4-knockout (Thbs4–/–) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to increase left ventricle load. After 2 wk, Thbs4–/–mice had a significantly higher heart weight/body weight ratio than WT mice. The additional increase in the heart weight in TAC Thbs4–/– mice was due to increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The levels of interstitial collagens were higher in the knockout mice, but the size of cardiomyocytes and apoptosis in the myocardium was unaffected by TSP-4 deficiency, suggesting that increased reactive fibrosis was the primary cause of the higher heart weight. The increased ECM deposition in Thbs4–/–mice was accompanied by changes in functional parameters of the heart and decreased vessel density. The expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes known to be influential in myocardial remodeling changed as a result of TSP-4 deficiency in vivo and as a result of incubation of cells with recombinant TSP-4 in vitro. Thus, TSP-4 is involved in regulating the adaptive responses of the heart to pressure overload, suggesting its important role in myocardial remodeling. Our study showed a direct influence of TSP-4 on heart function and to identify the mechanism of its effects on heart remodeling.—Frolova, E. G., Sopko, N., Blech, L., Popović, Z.

https://openalex.org/W1982089533,"We measured the effects of a diet in which D-β-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester [ketone ester (KE)] replaced equicaloric amounts of carbohydrate on 8-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice. Diets contained equal amounts of fat, protein, and micronutrients. The KE group was fed ad libitum, whereas the control (Ctrl) mice were pair-fed to the KE group. Blood d-β-hydroxybutyrate levels in the KE group were 3-5 times those reported with high-fat ketogenic diets. Voluntary food intake was reduced dose dependently with the KE diet. Feeding the KE diet for up to 1 mo increased the number of mitochondria and doubled the electron transport chain proteins, uncoupling protein 1, and mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating proteins in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). [(18)F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in IBAT of the KE group was twice that in IBAT of the Ctrl group. Plasma leptin levels of the KE group were more than 2-fold those of the Ctrl group and were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity to IBAT. The KE group exhibited 14% greater resting energy expenditure, but the total energy expenditure measured over a 24-h period or body weights was not different. The quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index was 73% higher in the KE group. These results identify KE as a potential antiobesity supplement."
https://openalex.org/W2068558169,"Standard economic theory suggests that one-time business grants can have at most temporary effects, and accordingly, policies to increase incomes of the self-employed in developing countries typically rely on sustained engagement. In contrast, we found long-lasting impacts from one-time grants given in a randomized experiment to subsistence firms. Five years after we gave $100 or $200 to 115 of 197 male and 100 of 190 female Sri Lankan microenterprise owners, we found 10-percentage-point-higher enterprise survival rates, and $8-to-$12-per-month-higher profits for male-owned businesses that received the grants. Female-owned businesses showed no long-term (or short-term) impacts. Our follow-up investigation interviewed 94% of the original sample and collected survivorship data from the remaining 6%, demonstrating that tracking long-term outcomes is both feasible and worthwhile. The results suggest that one-off grants may have lasting impacts on some types of subsistence firms, challenging the view that sustained engagement is always required."
https://openalex.org/W2061954662,"Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD represents a spectrum of liver disease ranging from reversible hepatic steatosis, to non alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. The potential role of glucocorticoids (GC) in the pathogenesis of NAFLD is highlighted in patients with GC excess, Cushing's syndrome, who develop central adiposity, insulin resistance and in 20% of cases, NAFLD. Although in most cases of NAFLD, circulating cortisol levels are normal, hepatic cortisol availability is controlled by enzymes that regenerate cortisol (F) from inactive cortisone (E) (11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, 11β-HSD1), or inactivate cortisol through A-ring metabolism (5α- and 5β-reductase, 5αR and 5βR).In vitro studies defined 11β-HSD1 expression in normal and NASH liver samples. We then characterised hepatic cortisol metabolism in 16 patients with histologically proven NAFLD compared to 32 obese controls using gas chromatographic analysis of 24 hour urine collection and plasma cortisol generation profile following oral cortisone.In patients with steatosis 5αR activity was increased, with a decrease in hepatic 11β-HSD1 activity. Total cortisol metabolites were increased in this group consistent with increased GC production rate. In contrast, in patients with NASH, 11β-HSD1 activity was increased both in comparison to patients with steatosis, and controls. Endorsing these findings, 11β-HSD1 mRNA and immunostaining was markedly increased in NASH patients in peri septal hepatocytes and within CD68 positive macrophages within inflamed cirrhotic septa.Patients with hepatic steatosis have increased clearance and decreased hepatic regeneration of cortisol and we propose that this may represent a protective mechanism to decrease local GC availability to preserve hepatic metabolic phenotype. With progression to NASH, increased 11β-HSD1 activity and consequent cortisol regeneration may serve to limit hepatic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2086717868,"Hepatic fat accumulation resulting from increased de novo fatty acid synthesis leads to hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance. We have shown previously that acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (Acc2(-/-)) mutant mice, when fed a high-fat (HF) or high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet, are protected against diet-induced obesity and maintained whole body and hepatic insulin sensitivity. To determine the effect of an ACC2 deletion on hepatic fat metabolism, we studied the regulation of the enzymes involved in the lipogenic pathway under Western HFHC dietary and de novo lipogenic conditions. After completing the HFHC regimen, Acc2(-/-) mutant mice were found to have lower body weight, smaller epididymal fat pads, lower blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids and triglycerides, and higher hepatic cholesterol than wild-type mice. Significant up-regulation of lipogenic enzymes and an elevation in hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) protein were found in Acc2(-/-) mutant mice under de novo lipogenic conditions. The increase in lipogenic enzyme levels was accompanied by up-regulation of the transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 and 2, and carbohydrate response element-binding protein. In contrast, hepatic levels of the PPAR-γ and PPAR-α proteins were significantly lower in the Acc2(-/-) mutant mice fed an HFHC diet. When compared with wild-type mice fed the same diet, Acc2(-/-) mutant mice exhibited a similar level of AKT but with a significant increase in pAKT. Hence, deleting ACC2 ameliorates the metabolic syndrome and protects against fatty liver despite increased de novo lipogenesis and dietary conditions known to induce obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2076534314,"Death is a vital developmental cell fate. In Caenorhabditis elegans, programmed death of the linker cell, which leads gonadal elongation, proceeds independently of caspases and apoptotic effectors. To identify genes promoting linker-cell death, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen. We show that linker-cell death requires the gene pqn-41, encoding an endogenous polyglutamine-repeat protein. pqn-41 functions cell-autonomously and is expressed at the onset of linker-cell death. pqn-41 expression is controlled by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase SEK-1, which functions in parallel to the zinc-finger protein LIN-29 to promote cellular demise. Linker-cell death is morphologically similar to cell death associated with normal vertebrate development and polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration. Our results may therefore provide molecular inroads to understanding nonapoptotic cell death in metazoan development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2071383138,"The genetic changes responsible for morphological differences between species are largely unidentified. Such changes can involve modifications of growth that are relevant to understanding evolution, development, and disease. We identified a gene that induces male-specific wing size and shape differences between Nasonia wasp species. Fine-scale mapping and in situ hybridization reveal that changes in at least three regions (two strictly in noncoding sequence) around the gene unpaired-like (upd-like) cause changes in spatial and temporal expression of upd-like in the developing wing and corresponding changes in wing width. Upd-like shows homology to the Drosophila unpaired gene, a well-studied signaling protein that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Our results indicate how multiple changes in the regulation of upd-like are involved in microevolution of morphological and sex-specific differences between species."
https://openalex.org/W2013872797,"A number of secreted precursor proteins of bacteria, archaea, and plant chloroplasts stand out by a conserved twin arginine-containing sequence motif in their signal peptides. Many of these precursor proteins are secreted in a completely folded conformation by specific twin arginine translocation (Tat) machineries. Tat machineries are high molecular mass complexes consisting of two types of membrane proteins, a hexahelical TatC protein, and usually one or two single-spanning membrane proteins, called TatA and TatB. TatC has previously been shown to be involved in the recognition of twin arginine signal peptides. We have performed an extensive site-specific cross-linking analysis of the Escherichia coli TatC protein under resting and translocating conditions. This strategy allowed us to map the recognition site for twin arginine signal peptides to the cytosolic N-terminal region and first cytosolic loop of TatC. In addition, discrete contact sites between TatC, TatB, and TatA were revealed. We discuss a tentative model of how a twin arginine signal sequence might be accommodated in the Tat translocase."
https://openalex.org/W2057282235,"Ferritin protein nanocages, self-assembled from four-α-helix bundle subunits, use Fe(2+) and oxygen to synthesize encapsulated, ferric oxide minerals. Ferritin minerals are iron concentrates stored for cell growth. Ferritins are also antioxidants, scavenging Fenton chemistry reactants. Channels for iron entry and exit consist of helical hairpin segments surrounding the 3-fold symmetry axes of the ferritin nanocages. We now report structural differences caused by amino acid substitutions in the Fe(2+) ion entry and exit channels and at the cytoplasmic pores, from high resolution (1.3-1.8 Å) protein crystal structures of the eukaryotic model ferritin, frog M. Mutations that eliminate conserved ionic or hydrophobic interactions between Arg-72 and Asp-122 and between Leu-110 and Leu-134 increase flexibility in the ion channels, cytoplasmic pores, and/or the N-terminal extensions of the helix bundles. Decreased ion binding in the channels and changes in ordered water are also observed. Protein structural changes coincide with increased Fe(2+) exit from dissolved, ferric minerals inside ferritin protein cages; Fe(2+) exit from ferritin cages depends on a complex, surface-limited process to reduce and dissolve the ferric mineral. High concentrations of bovine serum albumin or lysozyme (protein crowders) to mimic the cytoplasm restored Fe(2+) exit in the variants to wild type. The data suggest that fluctuations in pore structure control gating. The newly identified role of the ferritin subunit N-terminal extensions in gating Fe(2+) exit from the cytoplasmic pores strengthens the structural and functional analogies between ferritin ion channels in the water-soluble protein assembly and membrane protein ion channels gated by cytoplasmic N-terminal peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2109678074,"In the human systemic amyloidoses caused by mutant or wild-type transthyretin (TTR), deposition occurs at a distance from the site of synthesis. The TTR synthesized and secreted by the hepatocyte circulates in plasma, then deposits in target tissues far from the producing cell, a pattern reproduced in mice transgenic for multiple copies of the human wild-type TTR gene. By 2 yr of age, half of the transgenic males show cardiac deposition resembling human senile systemic amyloidosis. However, as early as 3 mo of age, when there are no deposits, cardiac gene transcription differs from that of nontransgenic littermates, primarily in the expression of a large number of genes associated with inflammation and the immune response. At 24 mo, the hearts with histologically proven TTR deposits show expression of stress response genes, exuberant mitochondrial gene transcription, and increased expression of genes associated with apoptosis, relative to the hearts without TTR deposition. These 24-mo-old hearts with TTR deposits also show a decrease in transcription of inflammatory genes relative to that in the younger transgenic mice. After 2 yr of expressing large amounts of human TTR, the livers of the transgenic mice without cardiac deposition display chaperone gene expression and evidence of an activated unfolded protein response, while the livers of animals with cardiac TTR deposition display neither, showing increased transcription of interferon-responsive inflammatory genes and those encoding an antioxidant response. With time, in animals with cardiac deposition, it appears that hepatic proteostatic capacity is diminished, exposing the heart to a greater load of misfolded TTR with subsequent extracellular deposition. Hence systemic (cardiac) TTR deposition may be the direct result of the diminution in the distant chaperoning capacity of the liver related to age or long-standing exposure to misfolded TTR, or both.— Buxbaum, J. N., Tagoe, C., Gallo, G., Walker, J. R., Kurian, S., Salomon, D. R. Why are some amyloidoses systemic?

https://openalex.org/W1971950117,"Background The Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) hypothesis has gained credibility within the cancer research community. According to this hypothesis, a small subpopulation of cells within cancerous tissues exhibits stem-cell-like characteristics and is responsible for the maintenance and proliferation of cancer. Methodologies/Principal Findings We present a simple compartmental pseudo-chemical mathematical model for tumor growth, based on the CSC hypothesis, and derived using a “chemical reaction” approach. We defined three cell subpopulations: CSCs, transit progenitor cells, and differentiated cells. Each event related to cell division, differentiation, or death is then modeled as a chemical reaction. The resulting set of ordinary differential equations was numerically integrated to describe the time evolution of each cell subpopulation and the overall tumor growth. The parameter space was explored to identify combinations of parameter values that produce biologically feasible and consistent scenarios. Conclusions/Significance Certain kinetic relationships apparently must be satisfied to sustain solid tumor growth and to maintain an approximate constant fraction of CSCs in the tumor lower than 0.01 (as experimentally observed): (a) the rate of symmetrical and asymmetrical CSC renewal must be in the same order of magnitude; (b) the intrinsic rate of renewal and differentiation of progenitor cells must be half an order of magnitude higher than the corresponding intrinsic rates for cancer stem cells; (c) the rates of apoptosis of the CSC, transit amplifying progenitor (P) cells, and terminally differentiated (D) cells must be progressively higher by approximately one order of magnitude. Simulation results were consistent with reports that have suggested that encouraging CSC differentiation could be an effective therapeutic strategy for fighting cancer in addition to selective killing or inhibition of symmetric division of CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2005913348,"Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is essential for efficient repair of chromosome breaks. However, the NHEJ ligation step is often obstructed by break-associated nucleotide damage, including base loss (abasic site or 5'-dRP/AP sites). Ku, a 5'-dRP/AP lyase, can excise such damage at ends in preparation for the ligation step. We show here that this activity is greatest if the abasic site is within a short 5' overhang, when this activity is necessary and sufficient to prepare such termini for ligation. In contrast, Ku is less active near 3' strand termini, where excision would leave a ligation-blocking α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The Ku AP lyase activity is also strongly suppressed by as little as two paired bases 5' of the abasic site. Importantly, in vitro end joining experiments show that abasic sites significantly embedded in double-stranded DNA do not block the NHEJ ligation step. Suppression of the excision activity of Ku in this context therefore is not essential for ligation and further helps NHEJ retain terminal sequence in junctions. We show that the DNA between the 5' terminus and the abasic site can also be retained in junctions formed by cellular NHEJ, indicating that these sites are at least partly resistant to other abasic site-cleaving activities as well. High levels of the 5'-dRP/AP lyase activity of Ku are thus restricted to substrates where excision of an abasic site is required for ligation, a degree of specificity that promotes more accurate joining."

AT-II is a major target in lung injury, and ineffective repair of damaged alveolar epithelia has been postulated to cause pulmonary fibrosis. Previous studies have shown that tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is expressed highly in the embryonic lung epithelial buds, and Shp2 activity is required for FGF-induced lung branching morphogenesis. To investigate in vivo function of pulmonary Shp2, we generated alveoli epithelia-specific Shp2-knockout (Shp2Δ/Δ) mice. Shp2Δ/Δ mice exhibit marked reduction in surfactant proteins, disorganized lamellar bodies, increased alveolar epithelial apoptosis, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis without preceding inflammation. Mechanistically, Shp2 acts to mediate expression of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3). Shp2 also plays a central role in mediating FGF/GAB/ERK activity, required for epithelial repair program.

The rate of 14C-labeled fatty acid oxidation was the same in both GWAT and IWAT from Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice. At basal level, Bhmt−/− GWAT had the same [14C]glucose oxidation as did the controls. When stimulated with insulin, Bhmt−/− GWAT oxidized 2.4-fold more glucose than did the controls. Compared with the controls, the rate of [14C]glucose oxidation was 2.4- and 1.8-fold higher, respectively, in Bhmt−/− IWAT without or with insulin stimulus. Our results show for the first time a role for BHMT in energy homeostasis.

Castro C.C. Koutmos M. Garrow T.A. Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase-2 is an S-methylmethionine-homocysteine methyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8939-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and it plays an essential role in regulating one-carbon metabolism. BHMT catalyzes the formation of the amino acid methionine from homocysteine using the choline metabolite betaine as the methyl donor. BHMT deficiency leads to elevated betaine and homocysteine concentrations and reduced choline concentration (2.Teng Y.W. Mehedint M.G. Garrow T.A. Zeisel S.H. Deletion of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase in mice perturbs choline and 1-carbon metabolism, resulting in fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinomas.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36258-36267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). BHMT also influences hepatic lipid accumulation via altering phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) concentration. BHMT exerts this effect through two mechanisms. First, choline, the precursor of betaine, can alternatively be used to make PtdCho via the Kennedy pathway. Second, methionine, the end product of BHMT, is the precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, which is required for the synthesis of PtdCho from phosphatidylethanolamine by the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase. BHMT overexpression increases PtdCho synthesis, leading to reduced hepatic lipid accumulation (3.Ji C. Shinohara M. Vance D. Than T.A. Ookhtens M. Chan C. Kaplowitz N.

Although the role of BHMT in hepatic lipid metabolism has been elucidated, there is no previous evidence that BHMT plays a role in whole body energy metabolism and adiposity. betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase phosphatidylcholine nonesterified fatty acid triacylglycerol acid-soluble metabolites gonadal white adipose tissue inguinal white adipose tissue brown adipose tissue respiratory exchange ratio fibroblast growth factor 21 thyroxine triiodothyronine white adipose tissue fatty acid body weight. We observed that Bhmt-deficient (Bhmt−/−) mice had a lower body weight from 5 to 9 weeks of age compared with wild type littermates (2.Teng Y.W. Mehedint M.G. Garrow T.A. Zeisel S.H. Deletion of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase in mice perturbs choline and 1-carbon metabolism, resulting in fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinomas.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36258-36267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis and dissection of adipose fat depots revealed that the reduced body weight observed in Bhmt−/− mice was due to reduced fat depots. These results suggested that Bhmt-deficient mice might have problems with energy metabolism. This study aims to examine the metabolic perturbations that lead to the reduced adiposity observed in Bhmt−/− mice. Homeostasis of energy stores is regulated by mechanisms, including modulation of metabolic rate and thermogenesis, control of metabolite fluxes among various organs, and modulation of fuel synthesis and use within tissues. We present evidence that Bhmt−/− mice have reduced adiposity due to increased whole body metabolic rate, impaired triglyceride synthesis, and enhanced glucose oxidation in white adipose tissue (WAT). The strategy used to generate Bhmt−/− mice was as described previously (2.Teng Y.W. Mehedint M.G. Garrow T.A. Zeisel S.H. Deletion of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase in mice perturbs choline and 1-carbon metabolism, resulting in fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinomas.J. Biol.

Bhmt−/− mice and their wild type littermates were of a C57Bl/6×sv129 genetic background and were continuously backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice. Generations F3 to F5 were used in this study. The animals were kept in a temperature-controlled environment at 24 °C and exposed to a 12-h light and dark cycle. All animals received AIN-76A pelleted diet with 1.1 g/kg choline chloride (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill approved all experimental protocols. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL). Tissues were harvested, snap-frozen, pulverized under liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used. Western blot analysis was performed in liver and adipose homogenates as described previously (4.Delgado-Reyes C.V. Wallig M.A. Garrow T.A. Immunohistochemical detection of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase in human, pig, and rat liver and kidney.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Body composition was determined in 7- and 14-week-old mice by MRI (EchoMRI-100, Echo Medical Systems, LLC, Houston). Core temperature was measured in 7-week-old mice using a rectal probe thermometer (Thermalert TH-5, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ). Food intake, oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide release (VCO2), and locomotor activity were measured every 27 min from individually housed mice (7-week-old) using indirect calorimetry (TSE Systems, Germany) with an airflow of 0.25 liter/min. Locomotor activity was measured using infrared technology as the counts of three-dimensional beam breaking (X total, Y total, and Z total). Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was calculated as VCO2/VO2. Mice were acclimated to the chambers for 24 h, and data were collected during the following 24 h. Stool samples were collected, and TAG was extracted using the Folch method (5.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipids from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measured colorimetrically (Sigma). For cold tolerance tests, 7-week-old mice were fasted for 4 h before being exposed to cold (4 °C) without food or bedding. Core temperature was measured at base line and every 15 min. Mice were removed from the cold room when body temperature dropped below 28 °C. An oral fat load test was performed by gavaging 7-week-old mice with 10 μl/g BW olive oil after an overnight fast. Blood was collected retroorbitally at base line, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, and plasma TAG was measured with a colorimetric assay (Sigma). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed by intraperitoneally injecting either glucose (2.5 g/kg BW) or human insulin (1 unit/kg BW, Novo Nordisk Inc., Princeton, NJ) to 7-week-old mice after a 6- or 4-h fast, respectively. Blood glucose was measured at base line, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min by tail nick using a calibrated glucometer (One Touch Ultra, LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Plasma insulin (Ultra-sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA kit, Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL), total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3) (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), and growth hormone (Millipore) levels were determined using commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturers' protocols. Plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc., Burlingame, CA) and glucagon (Millipore) were determined using RIA kits according to the manufacturers' protocols. Plasma creatine kinase was measured using an automatic chemical analyzer (Johnson and Johnson VT250, Rochester, NY) at the Animal Clinical Chemistry and Gene Expression Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Plasma TAG, glycerol (Sigma), and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) (Wako, Richmond, VA) were measured colorimetrically per the manufacturers' instructions. Plasma glucose was measured using a calibrated glucometer (One Touch Ultra). Hepatic free glucose and glycogen were measured using an adopted acid hydrolysis method (6.Passonneau J.V. Lauderdale V.R. A comparison of three methods of glycogen measurement in tissues.Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Liver was collected from mice after a 4-h fast. Briefly, 40 mg of pulverized liver was homogenized in 1 ml of 1 n HCl. Half of the homogenate was neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH (nonhydrolyzed group). The other half was incubated at 95 °C for 90 min before being neutralized with NaOH (hydrolyzed group). Glucosyl units released in both groups were measured using a colorimetrical glucose kit (Wako). The nonhydrolyzed group represented the free glucose measurement, while the difference between the hydrolyzed and the nonhydrolyzed groups represented the glycogen measurement. For bile acids and steroids, liver and gonadal fat pads were collected from 5-week-old mice after a 4-h fast. Tissues were sent to Metabolon (Research Triangle Park, NC), where the metabolites were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) platforms as described previously (7.Boudonck K.J.

Data were expressed as fold change relative to wild type controls. Total RNA was isolated from tissue using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA was synthesized using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was amplified by real time PCR using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) with primers specific to each gene of interest. Results were normalized to the housekeeping genes and calculated relative to the controls by the 2−ΔΔCT method. For in vivo lipolysis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipolytic stimuli (10 mg isoproterenol/1 kg BW or 1 mg CL316243/1 kg BW) (Sigma). Plasma was collected retroorbitally at base line and 1.5 h after injection. Plasma glycerol (Sigma) and NEFA (Wako) were measured colorimetrically, and glucose was measured using a glucometer (One Touch Ultra). Gonadal and inguinal adipose explants were used for ex vivo lipolysis measurement as described previously (11.Jaworski K. Ahmadian M. Duncan R.E. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Varady K.A. Hellerstein M.K. Lee H.Y.

Metab. 2006; 291: E1264-E1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, pieces of fat explants (20 mg) were incubated in 0.5 ml of Krebs Ringer Buffer (KRB) (12 mm HEPES, 121 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 0.33 mm CaCl2) supplemented with 3.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FFF-BSA) and 0.1% glucose with or without 10 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C. Twenty five μl of buffer was collected at various time points to measure the release of glycerol colorimetrically (Sigma). Mature adipocytes were isolated from gonadal or inguinal fat depots from 12–16 week-old mice and used for incorporation and oxidation studies (13.Viswanadha S. Londos C. Optimized conditions for measuring lipolysis in murine primary adipocytes.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1859-1864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, gonadal or inguinal fat depots were removed under sterile conditions, minced, and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 1 h in KRB supplemented with 1% FFF-BSA, 2.5 mm glucose, and 200 nm adenosine, containing 1 mg/ml collagenase I. The digested tissues were filtered through a sterile 250-μm mesh and washed three times with supplemented KRB. Adipocytes were diluted with supplemented KRB to reach 10% (by volume) adipocyte solution and were maintained for 30 min in a polypropylene tube before the start of the assay. Because of the small fat mass in Bhmt−/− mice, the same fat depots from two Bhmt−/− mice were pooled together to get enough adipocytes per sample. For fatty acid incorporation into TAG, 500 μl of 10% adipocyte solution were incubated with a 125-μl reaction mixture containing 15 μm [1-14C]oleate (50 μCi/500 μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 200 μm unlabeled oleate complexed to BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. [14C]TAG was extracted (14.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar), isolated by thin layer chromatography, and detected and quantified with a Bioscan AR2000 Image System (Bioscan Inc., Washington, D. C.). The chromatoplate was developed in chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (65:25:4; v/v/v) to 8 cm from the top. After the residual solvents evaporated, the plate was rerun in heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4; v/v/v) to the top of the plate. For oxidation, 250 μl of 10% adipocytes solution were incubated with a 125-μl reaction mixture containing either 15 μm [1-14C]oleate and 200 μm unlabeled oleate or 4 μm [14C]glucose (50 μCi/500 μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 4 mm unlabeled glucose (in KRB) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was incubated in a 13-ml polypropylene tube that contained a center well filled with folded filter paper. The tube was sealed with a rubber stopper. After 1.5 h of incubation, the reaction mixture was acidified with 150 μl of 70% perchloric acid, and 300 μl of 1 m NaOH was added to the center well. The sealed tubes were incubated at RT for an additional 45 min. The center well (containing [14C]CO2 trapped by base) was then collected and placed into scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe 30% Mixture, Fisher) and counted. The acidified reaction mixture (∼400 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 μl of 20% BSA. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 20 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was counted to determine 14C-labeled acid-soluble metabolites (ASM). [14C]CO2 represents complete fatty acid or glucose oxidation, and 14C-labeled ASM represents incomplete fatty acid oxidation. For some experiments, 0.01 unit of insulin (Novo Nordisk Inc., Princeton, NJ) was added. For hepatic FA oxidation experiments, fresh liver was excised, minced, and homogenated in a buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm ATP) to reach a 1:50 dilution. Forty μl of liver homogenate was used to measure FA oxidation as described above. Adipose tissues were collected from 7- and 12-week-old mice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 24 h. Tissues were processed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as described previously (15.Lillie R. Histopathologic Technic and Practical Histochemistry. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1965: 1-715Google Scholar). For adipocyte size analysis, three images (×200) per sample were taken, and the average adipocyte cell areas were analyzed using AxioVision 4.8 software (Zeiss). 7-Week-old Bhmt+/+ mice were fed either 0 or 5% betaine (Sigma)-supplemented water for 2 weeks. Livers were collected for the measurement of Fgf21 expression as described above. Statistical differences were determined using analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer HSD, and Student's t test (JMP Version 6.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and reported as means ± S.E. For the indirect calorimetry data analysis, the total area under the curve was calculated per measure per mouse using SAS. Statistical differences between the groups were determined using Student's t test (for mean comparison) and Mann-Whitney test (for median comparison). We previously reported that Bhmt−/− mice gained less body weight between 5 and 9 weeks of age than did their wild type littermates (p < 0.05) (2.Teng Y.W. Mehedint M.G. Garrow T.A. Zeisel S.H. Deletion of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase in mice perturbs choline and 1-carbon metabolism, resulting in fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinomas.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36258-36267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reduced weight gain of Bhmt−/− mice was associated with reduced fat or lean mass, we measured body composition of these mice using MRI scan analysis. Bhmt−/− mice had 20 and 30% less fat mass than did Bhmt+/+ mice at 7 and 14 weeks of age, respectively (p < 0.05), with no significant difference in lean mass (Fig. 1A). The difference in fat mass was confirmed by collecting the individual fat pads. The two major white adipose tissues (WAT), gonadal (GWAT) and inguinal (IWAT), of Bhmt−/− mice were significantly smaller than those of Bhmt+/+ mice at all ages (Fig. 1B). The disparity in fat mass was exacerbated as mice aged, such that by 48 weeks of age, Bhmt−/− mice had a fat mass that was 41% that of Bhmt+/+ mice. To determine whether the reduced fat mass in Bhmt−/− mice was due to fewer fat cells and/or smaller fat cells, the sizes of individual adipocytes in GWAT and IWAT of Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice were analyzed. Histological images showed that both GWAT and IWAT from Bhmt−/− mice contained a larger number of smaller adipocytes (Fig. 1C). We observed a 43% reduction in adipocyte size in GWAT in both 7- and 12-week-old Bhmt−/− mice compared with those of Bhmt+/+ mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). We observed a 69% (p < 0.05) and an 80% (p < 0.001) reduction in adipocyte size in IWAT in 7- and 12-week old Bhmt−/− mice, respectively, compared with those of Bhmt+/+ mice (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that Bhmt−/− mice likely had normal adipocyte differentiation and that the Bhmt−/− adipocytes either stored less and/or used more lipids than did Bhmt+/+ adipocytes. Bhmt is predominantly expressed in rodent liver. Western blotting confirmed that BHMT protein was specific to the liver and was absent in the adipose tissue from both Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the reduced fat mass in Bhmt−/− mice was due to an indirect effect of the lack of hepatic BHMT activity. Changes in adiposity are often associated with alterations in glucose and insulin homeostasis. Bhmt−/− mice had normal basal blood glucose levels (Fig. 1, F and G). Upon intraperitoneal injection of either glucose (Fig. 1F) or insulin (Fig. 1G), Bhmt−/− mice exhibited a faster glucose removal rate than did wild type controls. Bhmt−/− mice also had a basal plasma insulin concentration that was 50% that of the controls (p < 0.05) (Table 2). These data indicated that Bhmt−/− mice had enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.TABLE 2Metabolites and gene expression in Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− plasma and liverOrganMeasurementBhmt+/+Bhmt−/−PlasmaInsulin (ng/ml) (7–12 weeks old)0.806 ± 0.1200.405 ± 0.157ap < 0.05.FGF21 (ng/ml)1.49 ± 0.162.6 ± 0.3bp < 0.01, different from Bhmt+/+ by Students' t test.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the mechanisms that elicit the reduced fat mass in Bhmt−/− mice, elements of energy metabolism, including food intake, lipid uptake and absorption, body temperature, energy expenditure and activity, were determined. Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice consumed similar amounts of food per day (Fig. 2A). Fat load test (Fig. 2B) and fecal lipid content (Fig. 2C), tests for lipid uptake and absorption, respectively, displayed no differences between Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice. Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice had similar rectal temperatures (Fig. 2D). Compared with wild type controls, Bhmt−/− mice had increased O2 consumption (Fig. 2E and Table 1) and increased CO2 release (Fig. 2F) throughout the light and dark phases (Table 1), indicating increased energy expenditure. Locomotor activity was not increased in Bhmt−/− mice (Fig. 2H), suggesting that the increase in energy expenditure was independent of activity. The RER, an indicator of metabolic fuel preference, was not significantly different between Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice (Fig. 2G), although there was a trend of increasing RER during the light phase (p = 0.053) (Table 1).TABLE 1Indirect calorimetry data analysisBhmt+/+ AUCBhmt−/− AUCt-test p valueMW test p valueResultLight cycleVO2 BW2,336,800 ± 18,6202,677,403 ± 78,7710.0030.0002KO > WTVO2 LBM2,914,726 ± 48,9513,278,646 ± 99,6390.0060.007KO > WTVCO2 BW2,000,171 ± 24,4762,358,855 ± 67,5400.00080.0002KO > WTVCO2 LBM2,494,090 ± 38,5382,888,922 ± 87,2580.0020.0003KO > WTRER584 ± 6600 ± 40.0530.13Activity1,007,037 ± 86,7381,020,225 ± 173,6920.950.69Dark cycleVO2 BW2,789,262 ± 52,5933,207,252 ± 62,9120.00020.0002KO > WTVO2 LBM3,477,415 ± 66,5093,927,978 ± 86,5400.0010.0006KO > WTVCO2 BW2,880,493 ± 110,5883,418,057 ± 69,0890.0010.002KO > WTVCO2 LBM3,582,632 ± 103,2774,183,744 ± 83,2700.00050.001KO > WTRER720 ± 17746 ± 100.210.16Activity3,376,383 ± 421,5602,351,641 ± 235,1790.060.07 Open table in a new tab We next investigated whether the reduced adiposity observed in Bhmt−/− mice was due to increased thermogenesis. We predicted that Bhmt−/− mice would maintain a higher body temperature during a cold challenge if they had increased thermogenesis. After 6 h of cold exposure, the wild type controls dropped body temperature by 7.4% (from 38.18 ± 0.14 °C to 35.36 ± 0.07 °C), whereas Bhmt−/− mice dropped body temperature by 28.9% (from 37.92 ± 0.09 °C to 26.98 ± 2.15 °C) (Fig. 3A). Mice were removed from the cold room when body temperature was less than 28 °C. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a major site of nonshivering adaptive thermogenesis. We found no significant difference in the morphology or the weight of interscapular BAT between wild type and knock-out mice (data not shown). Real time PCR analysis revealed normal thermogenic gene responses in Bhmt−/− BAT tissue during cold exposure, with elevated Pgc1 (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator), Lpl (lipoprotein lipase), Ucp1 (uncoupling protein 1), and Mcpt1 (muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) expression levels similar to those of Bhmt+/+ mice (Fig. 3B), indicating that adrenergic signaling was intact and similar between genotypes. Bhmt+/+ and Bhmt−/− mice had similar BAT TAG concentration before and after cold exposure, suggesting similar fuel storage and usage (Fig. 3C). Mice were also able to maintain body temperature using exogenous fuels derived from organs, such as white adipose tissue and liver via lipolysis and gluconeogenesis, and through adaptive thermogenesis involving shivering in skeletal muscle to increase energy output. Upon cold exposure, Bhmt−/− mice had significantly lower plasma glucose (by 46%, p < 0.01), glycerol (by 46%, p < 0.05), and NEFA (by 17%, p < 0.05) concentrations compared with those of wild type controls (Fig. 3, D–F), suggesting a restricted supply of exogenous fuels to maintain a normal body temperature. Bhmt−/− mice also had a significantly elevated plasma creatine kinase ac"

In this study, we demonstrate that amotl2 knockdown in zebrafish wild-type embryos results in embryonic dorsalization, and this effect can be antagonized by co-knockdown of the dorsal inducer β-catenin2. Overexpression of amotl2 in masterblind (mbl) homozygous embryos, in which canonical Wnt signaling is up-regulated due to an axin1 mutation, transforms eyeless phenotype into smaller eyes, whereas co-knockdown of amot, amotl1, and amotl2 leads to development of smaller eyes in mbl heterozygotes. In cultured mammalian cells, Motin family members all possess the ability to attenuate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Focusing on Amotl2, we show that Amotl2 can associate with and trap β-catenin in the Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, and as a result, the amount of β-catenin in the cytosol and nucleus is reduced. Thus, our findings provide novel insights into functions of Motin family members and regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Canonical Wnt signaling, a pathway conserved in metazoan from hydra to human, is implicated in tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, stem cell renewal, and differentiation, cardiac hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and embryonic development (1Clevers H.

In the absence of Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated and degraded by the destruction complex consisting of APC, Axin, GSK3β, and CKI. After Wnt ligands bind to the receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6 on the membrane, β-catenin is stabilized by disassociating from the destruction complex and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to transcription factors TCF/LEF to initiate target gene transcription. Therefore, the regulation of β-catenin is the core event of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In zebrafish embryos, maternal and zygotic Wnt/β-catenin signaling functions differently (5Langdon Y.G. Mullins M.C. Maternal and zygotic control of zebrafish dorsoventral axial patterning.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2011; 45: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).

Angiomotin mbl morpholino days postfertilization hours postfertilization Wnt3a conditional medium. In this study, we demonstrate that knockdown of amotl2 in zebrafish embryos results in dorsalized phenotypes, and that amolt2 overexpression in mbl mutant embryos converts the eyeless phenotype into smaller eyes. In mammalian cells, transfection of Amotl2 or other Motin genes attenuates Wnt/β-catenin signaling whereas co-knockdown of three human Motin genes up-regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, Amotl2 interacts with and traps β-catenin in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, preventing its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Thus, our study uncovers a novel function of Amotl2 in controlling Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Wild-type and mbl mutant embryos of the Tuebingen strain were used. Embryos were incubated in Holtfreter's solution at 28.5 °C. Ethical approval was obtained from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tsinghua University. The plasmids Super TOPFlash, pXF2F-Flag and pLentiLox3.7 were gifts from Drs. Wei Wu, Xin-Hua Feng, and Qiang Wang, respectively.

Unless otherwise stated, Amotl2 was referred to as zebrafish Amotl2. Human AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2 coding sequences were individually amplified from the cDNAs derived from HEK293T cells and cloned into pXF2F-Flag. The shorter form of human AMOTL2 was amplified using the forward primer (5′-ATATAGCATATGGAGGCCGTGCTGAG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-ATATAGTCTAGATTAGATCAGTATCTCCACC-3′). The sequences of shRNA targeting human AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2 were previously described (21Wang W. Huang J. Chen J. Angiomotin-like proteins associate with and negatively regulate YAP1.J. Biol.

All of the mRNAs were injected into the yolk of zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage. Corresponding linearized plasmids were used for in vitro synthesizing antisense RNA in the presence of digoxingenin-UTP. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed following the standard procedure. Live embryos and stained embryos were mounted in 5% methylcellulose and glycerol, respectively, and photographed using a Leica MZ16 microscope with a Dage-MTI DC330 CCD camera. Immunohistochemical staining of β-catenin in embryos was carried out using anti-β-catenin antibody and DAB substrate. Embryos produced by crosses of mbl heterozygotes were collected at 2 days postfertilization (dpf) after injection and genomic DNA was individually extracted. A 120-bp sequence at the mbl/axin1 locus was amplified by PCR using the forward primer (5′-GGATACCAAAGGATATTCACGTTG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-ACCCTCTTGAGACGCTCCTCCAGC-3′) as described (13Heisenberg C.P.

The amplified products were subjected to BpmI restriction digestion and then separated on agarose gels. The digest derived from the wild-type allele consisted of 80-bp and 40-bp fragments, but digest derived from the mutant allele was 120-bp long. Statistical analyses were performed with Office Excel. The values were showed as means ± standard deviation for at least three independent experiments. Two-tailed t test was performed to show the significant differences.

However, as observed at 24 hpf, we consistently noted that amotl2 morphants exhibited dorsalized phenotypes. Based on the degrees of dorsalization, the morphants could be categorized into four classes (Fig. 1A). Class I embryos had a smaller tail; class II showed a smaller poster trunk with a curly tail and a shortened yolk extension; class III embryos had visible head structures, but curly trunk and tail; and class IV embryos had undistinguishable tissue structures sitting on the yolk ball. The ratio of severely dorsalized morphants (classes III and IV) increased as higher doses of amotl2MO1 were used (Fig. 1B). Injection with 400 pg of amotl2m mRNA alone or its co-injection with 5 ng of the control morpholino cMO1, did not cause obvious morphological changes at 24 hpf. However, its co-injection with 5 ng amotl2MO1 led to a marked decrease of the ratio of dorsalized embryos compared with 5 ng amotl2MO1 injection alone (Fig. 1B). We then looked into the expression of dorsal and ventral markers in morphants during early development. The dorsal marker chordin (chd), which is expressed on the dorsal side in wild-type embryos, was expanded into the whole germ ring in 81.8% (n = 110) of embryos injected with 3 ng of amotl2MO1 at the 60% epiboly stage (Fig. 1C), whereas the ventral marker eve1 was markedly reduced in 90.2% (n = 41) of similarly injected embryos at the 50% epiboly stage (Fig. 1D). These observations support the idea that amotl2 knockdown results in embryonic dorsalization. It has been found that β-catenin2-mediated maternal canonical Wnt signaling is essential for dorsal development of zebrafish embryos while maternal β-catenin1 has no effect (6Bellipanni G. Varga M. Maegawa S. Imai Y. Kelly C. Myers A.P. Chu F. Talbot W.S. Weinberg E.S. Essential and opposing roles of zebrafish β-catenins in the formation of dorsal axial structures and neurectoderm.Development. 2006; 133: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We asked whether embryonic dorsalization caused by amotl2 knockdown was related to up-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To address this issue, we examined the expression of bozozok (boz), a direct target gene of Wnt/β-catenin signals (39Leung T. Söll I. Arnold S.J. Kemler R. Driever W. Direct binding of Lef1 to sites in the boz promoter may mediate pre-midblastula-transition activation of boz expression.Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in amotl2 morphants. In cMO1-injected embryos at the high-oblong stages, boz expression was restricted to the dorsal blastodermal margin (Fig. 1E). In contrast, boz expression could be detected in the whole germ ring in 87.5% (n = 40) of amotl2 morphants (Fig. 1E). Immunostaining experiments revealed that more blastomeres of amotl2 morphants had more nuclear β-catenin compared with those in control embryos (Fig. 1F). In addition, only a small proportion of embryos co-injected with 5 ng of amotl2MO1 and 20 ng of β-catenin2MO1 exhibited dorsalized phenotypes compared with those co-injected with 5 ng of amotl2MO1 and 20 ng of β-catenin1MO1 (Fig. 1G), which was indicative of an antagonistic effect. These results together suggest that amotl2 knockdown up-regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and as a result causes embryonic dorsalization. To further confirm the involvement of amotl2 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we performed amolt2 overexpression or knockdown in mbl mutants, which carry a mutation in the axin1 locus resulting in up-regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling (13Heisenberg C.P. Houart C. Take-Uchi M. Rauch G.J. Young N. Coutinho P. Masai I. Caneparo L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Dale T.C. Wilson S.W. Stemple D.L. A mutation in the Gsk3-binding domain of zebrafish Masterblind/Axin1 leads to a fate transformation of telencephalon and eyes to diencephalon.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1427-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Among 145 embryos observed at 3 dpf, which were produced by crosses between mbl heterozygotes (Tubingen background), 37 (25.5%) did not have eyes (eyeless phenotype), 1 (0.7%) had smaller eyes, and 107 had eyes of normal size (Fig. 2, A and C), suggesting a Mendelian segregation of the eyeless phenotype. When amotl2 mRNA was injected into one-cell stage embryos of mbl intercrosses at a dose of 400 pg, only 2.5% (n = 121) of embryos at 3 dpf exhibited the eyeless phenotype and 17.4% had a pair of smaller eyes or one smaller eye with the other disappeared (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that the eyes of a large proportion of mbl mutants were partially recovered by amotl2 overexpression. Genotyping of a batch of injected embryos disclosed that all of 10 analyzed embryos with smaller eyes were mbl−/− mutants, two tested eyeless embryos were also homozygous mutants, while 10 embryos with normal eyes had either mbl+/+ (4/10) or mbl+/− (6/10) genotypes (Fig. 2D). Thus, we conclude that amotl2 overexpression can rescue the eyeless phenotype of mbl−/− mutants. Next, we asked whether amotl2 knockdown could enhance the abnormal eye phenotype of mbl mutants. To avoid early dorsoventral patterning defects caused by a high dose (5 ng) of amotl2MO1, we reduced the injection dose of amotl2MO1 to 2 ng, which did not produce obvious morphological defects when applied to wild-type embryos (20Wang Y. Li Z. Xu P. Huang L. Tong J. Huang H. Meng A. Angiomotin-like2 gene (amotl2) is required for migration and proliferation of endothelial cells during angiogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41095"

The standard susceptible-infected- recovered (SIR) framework, which includes seasonal migration and reproduction, but lacks environmental transmission, is unable to reproduce the multi-periodic patterns of avian influenza epidemics. In this paper, we argue that a fully stochastic theory based on environmental transmission provides a simple, plausible explanation for the phenomenon of multi-year periodic outbreaks of avian flu. Our theory predicts complex fluctuations with a dominant period of 2 to 8 years which essentially depends on the intensity of environmental transmission. A wavelet analysis of the observed data supports this prediction. Furthermore, using master equations and van Kampen system-size expansion techniques, we provide an analytical expression for the spectrum of stochastic fluctuations, revealing how the outbreak period varies with the environmental transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1967054201,"A physiological relationship between iron, oxidative injury, and fatty acid metabolism exists, but transduction mechanisms are unclear. We propose that the iron storage protein ferritin contains fatty acid binding sites whose occupancy modulates iron uptake and release. Using isothermal microcalorimetry, we found that arachidonic acid binds ferritin specifically and with 60 μM affinity. Arachidonate binding by ferritin enhanced iron mineralization, decreased iron release, and protected the fatty acid from oxidation. Cocrystals of arachidonic acid and horse spleen apoferritin diffracted to 2.18 Å and revealed specific binding to the 2-fold intersubunit pocket. This pocket shields most of the fatty acid and its double bonds from solvent but allows the arachidonate tail to project well into the ferrihydrite mineralization site on the ferritin L-subunit, a structural feature that we implicate in the effects on mineralization by demonstrating that the much shorter saturated fatty acid, caprylate, has no significant effects on mineralization. These combined effects of arachidonate binding by ferritin are expected to lower both intracellular free iron and free arachidonate, thereby providing a previously unrecognized mechanism for limiting lipid peroxidation, free radical damage, and proinflammatory cascades during times of cellular stress."
https://openalex.org/W2053052191,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental mechanism in tissue and cell homeostasis. It was long suggested that apoptosis regulates the cell number in diverse cell populations; however no clear mechanism was shown. Neutrophils are the short-lived, first-line defense of innate immunity, with an estimated t = 1/2 of 8 hours and a high turnover rate. Here we first show that spontaneous neutrophil constitutive PCD is regulated by cell concentrations. Using a proteomic approach, we identified the S100 A8/9 complex, which constitutes roughly 40% of cytosolic protein in neutrophils, as mediating this effect. We further demonstrate that it regulates cell survival via a signaling mechanism involving MEK-ERK via TLR4 and CD11B/CD18. This mechanism is suggested to have a fine-tuning role in regulating the neutrophil number in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and inflammatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1992954546,"Fixed heterosis resulting from favorable interactions between the genes on their homoeologous genomes in an allopolyploid is considered analogous to classical heterosis accruing from interactions between homologous chromosomes in heterozygous plants of a diploid species. It has been hypothesized that fixed heterosis may be one of the causes of low classical heterosis in allopolyploids. We used Indian mustard (Brassica juncea, 2n = 36; AABB) as a model system to analyze this hypothesis due to ease of its resynthesis from its diploid progenitors, B. rapa (2n = 20; AA) and B. nigra (2n = 16; BB). Both forms of heterosis were investigated in terms of ploidy level, gene action and genetic diversity. To facilitate this, eleven B. juncea genotypes were resynthesized by hybridizing ten near inbred lines of B. rapa and nine of B. nigra. Three half diallel combinations involving resynthesized B. juncea (11×11) and the corresponding progenitor genotypes of B. rapa (10×10) and B. nigra (9×9) were evaluated. Genetic diversity was estimated based on DNA polymorphism generated by SSR primers. Heterosis and genetic diversity in parental diploid species appeared not to predict heterosis and genetic diversity at alloploid level. There was also no association between combining ability, genetic diversity and heterosis across ploidy. Though a large proportion (0.47) of combinations showed positive values, the average fixed heterosis was low for seed yield but high for biomass yield. The genetic diversity was a significant contributor to fixed heterosis for biomass yield, due possibly to adaptive advantage it may confer on de novo alloploids during evolution. Good general/specific combiners at diploid level did not necessarily produce good general/specific combiners at amphiploid level. It was also concluded that polyploidy impacts classical heterosis indirectly due to the negative association between fixed heterosis and classical heterosis."

Farm data were collected by postal questionnaire. Data from respondents (70 cases and 51 controls) were analysed using simple logistic regression models with Bonferroni corrections. Limited multivariate analyses were also performed to check the robustness of the overall conclusions.Management factors associated with increased odds of pleurisy included no all-in all-out pig flow (OR 9.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3-29), rearing of pigs with an age difference of >1 month in the same airspace (OR 6.5 [2.8-17]) and repeated mixing (OR 2.2 [1.4-3.8]) or moving (OR 2.2 [1.5-3.4]) of pigs during the rearing phase. Those associated with decreased odds of pleurisy included filling wean-to-finish or grower-to-finish systems with piglets from ≤3 sources (OR 0.18 [0.07-0.41]) compared to farrow-to-finish systems, cleaning and disinfecting of grower (ORs 0.28 [0.13-0.61] and 0.29 [0.13-0.61]) and finisher (ORs 0.24 [0.11-0.51] and 0.2 [0.09-0.44]) accommodation between groups, and extended down time of grower and finisher accommodation (OR 0.84 [0.75-0.93] and 0.86 [0.77-0.94] respectively for each additional day of downtime). This study demonstrated the value of national-level abattoir pathology data collection systems for case control analyses and generated guidance for on-farm interventions to help reduce the prevalence of pleurisy in slaughter pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2153511217,"Mallory-Denk bodies (MDBs) are hepatocyte inclusions that are associated with poor liver disease prognosis. The intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) and its cross-linking by transglutaminase-2 (TG2) are essential for MDB formation. K8 hyperphosphorylation occurs in association with liver injury and MDB formation, but the link between keratin phosphorylation and MDB formation is unknown. We used a mutational approach to identify K8 Q70 as a residue that is important for K8 cross-linking to itself and other liver proteins. K8 cross-linking is markedly enhanced on treating cells with a phosphatase inhibitor and decreases dramatically on K8 S74A or Q70N mutation in the presence of phosphatase inhibition. K8 Q70 cross-linking, in the context of synthetic peptides or intact proteins transfected into cells, is promoted by phosphorylation at K8 S74 or by an S74D substitution and is inhibited by S74A mutation. Transgenic mice that express K8 S74A or a K8 G62C liver disease variant that inhibits K8 S74 phosphorylation have a markedly reduced ability to form MDBs. Our findings support a model in which the stress-triggered phosphorylation of K8 S74 induces K8 cross-linking by TG2, leading to MDB formation. These findings may extend to neuropathies and myopathies that are characterized by intermediate filament-containing inclusions.—Kwan, R., Hanada, S., Harada, M., Strnad, P., Li, D. H., Omary, M.B.

https://openalex.org/W2005078469,"Prion diseases are a group of rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorders associated with a conformational transformation of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into a self-replicating and proteinase K-resistant conformer, termed scrapie PrP (PrP(Sc)). Aggregates of PrP(Sc) deposited around neurons lead to neuropathological alterations. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these fatal illnesses; thus, the development of an effective therapy is a priority. PrP peptide-based ELISA assay methods were developed for detection and immunoaffinity chromatography capture was developed for purification of naturally occurring PrP peptide autoantibodies present in human CSF, individual donor serum, and commercial preparations of pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). The ratio of anti-PrP autoantibodies (PrP-AA) to total IgG was ∼1:1200. The binding epitope of purified PrP-AA was mapped to an N-terminal region comprising the PrP amino acid sequence KTNMK. Purified PrP-AA potently blocked fibril formation by a toxic 21-amino acid fragment of the PrP peptide containing the amino acid alanine to valine substitution corresponding to position 117 of the full-length peptide (A117V). Furthermore, PrP-AA attenuated the neurotoxicity of PrP(A117V) and wild-type peptides in rat cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) cultures. In contrast, IgG preparations depleted of PrP-AA had little effect on PrP fibril formation or PrP neurotoxicity. The specificity of PrP-AA was demonstrated by immunoprecipitating PrP protein in brain tissues of transgenic mice expressing the human PrP(A117V) epitope and Sc237 hamster. Based on these intriguing findings, it is suggested that human PrP-AA may be useful for interfering with the pathogenic effects of pathogenic prion proteins and, thereby has the potential to be an effective means for preventing or attenuating human prion disease progression."

The aim of this study was to investigate PGH, IGF-I and IGFBP3 in non-diabetic (ND) compared to Type 1 Diabetic (T1DM) pregnancies.This is a prospective study. Maternal samples were obtained from 25 ND and 25 T1DM mothers at 36 weeks gestation. Cord blood was obtained after delivery. PGH, IGF-I and IGFBP3 were measured using ELISA.There was no difference in delivery type, gender of infants or birth weight between groups. In T1DM, maternal PGH significantly correlated with ultrasound estimated fetal weight (r = 0.4, p = 0.02), birth weight (r = 0.51, p<0.05) and birth weight centile (r = 0.41, p = 0.03) PGH did not correlate with HbA1c. Maternal IGF-I was lower in T1DM (p = 0.03). Maternal and fetal serum IGFBP3 was higher in T1DM. Maternal third trimester T1DM serum had a significant band at 16 kD on western blot, which was not present in ND.Maternal T1DM PGH correlated with both antenatal fetal weight and birth weight, suggesting a significant role for PGH in growth in diabetic pregnancy. IGFBP3 is significantly increased in maternal and fetal serum in T1DM pregnancies compared to ND controls, which was explained by increased proteolysis in maternal but not fetal serum. These results suggest that the normal PGH-IGF-I-IGFBP3 axis in pregnancy is abnormal in T1DM pregnancies, which are at higher risk of macrosomia."
https://openalex.org/W1998768278,"When managing populations of threatened species, conservation managers seek to make the best conservation decisions to avoid extinction. Making the best decision is difficult because the true population size and the effects of management are uncertain. Managers must allocate limited resources between actively protecting the species and monitoring. Resources spent on monitoring reduce expenditure on management that could be used to directly improve species persistence. However monitoring may prevent sub-optimal management actions being taken as a result of observation error. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) can optimize management for populations with partial detectability, but the solution methods can only be applied when there are few discrete states. We use the Continuous U-Tree (CU-Tree) algorithm to discretely represent a continuous state space by using only the states that are necessary to maintain an optimal management policy. We exploit the compact discretization created by CU-Tree to solve a POMDP on the original continuous state space. We apply our method to a population of sea otters and explore the trade-off between allocating resources to management and monitoring. We show that accurately discovering the population size is less important than management for the long term survival of our otter population."
https://openalex.org/W2032313380,"Saturated fatty acids are known to activate macrophages and induce vascular inflammation. Although cytokines from activated macrophage influence other vascular cells, the influence of saturated fatty acids on the paracrine effect of macrophages is not fully understood yet. Here we examined the impact of palmitate on the effect of macrophages on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and their mediators. SMCs proliferation increased significantly after treatment with conditioned media from palmitate-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. SMC migration was found to be greater after treatment with palmitate-conditioned media. SM α-actin and SM22α were decreased in SMCs treated with palmitate-conditioned media. When stimulated with palmitate, RAW264.7 cells secreted more bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2 and BMP4 into the cell culture media. SMC proliferation, migration, and phenotypic changes were attenuated after treatment of neutralizing antibodies against BMPs or knockdown of BMPs with siRNA. The influences of these proteins were further confirmed by direct treatment of recombinant BMP2 and BMP4 on SMCs. Particularly, the effects of BMPs on SMC migration on phenotypic change were obvious, whereas their effect on SMC proliferation seemed not significant or modest. In conclusion, palmitate promoted macrophages' paracrine effects on SMC proliferation, migration, and phenotypic change. The effect of stimulated macrophages was mediated, at least in part, by BMP2 and BMP4. These results suggest a novel mechanism linking saturated fatty acids and the progression of vascular diseases that is possibly mediated by BMPs from macrophages."

Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are classified into A and B classes according to their sequence homology. There are nine EphA receptors encoded in the human genome that bind to five glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored class A ephrins (eAs) 5The abbreviations used are: eA1ephrinA1GBMglioblastoma multiformeCMconditioned mediaRUresponse units. and five EphB receptors that bind to three transmembrane-tethered ephrinB ligands (2Pasquale E.B.

Our laboratory has documented that the EphA2 receptor, but not its preferred ligand eA1, is prominently overexpressed in the highly aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Moreover, EphA2 overexpression in GBM has been significantly linked to malignancy grade (20Wykosky J. Debinski W. The EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors.

Thus, the EphA2 receptor represents an attractive molecular target for therapeutic and diagnostic/imaging applications for GBM. We have also shown that eA1-Fc, a recombinant soluble homodimer of eA1, induces EphA2 phosphorylation, internalization, and subsequent down-regulation that mediates the reversal of several of the malignant properties of GBM cells, i.e. invasion, migration, and anchorage-independent growth (20Wykosky J. Debinski W. The EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors. Function and therapeutic targeting.Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This effect was also observed when eA1 was ectopically expressed in GBM cells; however, in this case eA1 was being released into the extracellular environment as a soluble, monomeric protein capable of mediating its effects in a paracrine manner (28Wykosky J. Palma E. Gibo D.M. Ringler S. Turner C.P. Debinski W. Soluble monomeric EphrinA1 is released from tumor cells and is a functional ligand for the EphA2 receptor.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 7260-7273Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Importantly, this finding supports the development of a soluble, monomeric eA1-based ligand that may be used as a vector for targeted delivery of therapeutic or imaging agents to GBM tumors. With that in mind, we have recently conjugated a bacterial toxin to eA1-Fc and demonstrated remarkable EphA2-specificity and cytotoxic potency of this conjugate on GBM cells (29Wykosky J. Gibo D.M. Debinski W. A novel, potent, and specific ephrinA1-based cytotoxin against EphA2 receptor-expressing tumor cells.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 3208-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations prompted us to study the structure-function relationship of wild type (WT) eA1 by generating structural mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzing their effect on EphA2 down-regulation as a readily measured functional end point of their activity. In general, the structure of eA ligands is a variation of the Greek key β-barrel-fold with parallel and anti-parallel β-strands that are connected by several highly flexible loops (30Qin H. Lim L.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Of particular importance for receptor binding is the conserved G-H loop (Fig. 1A). This loop for eA1 packs within a surface pocket of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of EphA2 (Fig. 1B). In this work the G-H loop of eA1 (residues 108–123) was subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis in an effort to identify variants that alter cellular effects. Most variants had either no or deleterious consequences on EphA2 binding. At least three variants within the turn of the loop (P113A, T115A, and G117A) had increased activity when compared with eA1-WT. These improved variants should help in the design of more potent anti-tumor agents based on eA1. GBM cell lines U-251 MG, U-373, and SNB-19 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). U-251 MG cells were grown in DMEM + glutamine, 10% (v/v) FBS, 0.1 mmol/liter nonessential amino acids, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. eA1-mutant cell lines, which are derived from the U-251 MG parental cell line, were grown in the above medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin. U-373 cells were grown in MEM, 10% (v/v) FBS, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and SNB-19 cells were grown in RPMI, 10% (v/v) FBS, 0.1 mmol/liter nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. eA1 mutants were prepared using a transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) and an eA1-pcDNA3.1+ plasmid generated from full-length human ephrin mRNA obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cells using specific primers for the eA1 gene. Mutagenesis and selection primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. BMH71-18 mutS chemically competent Escherichia coli cells were then transformed with mutant ephrinA1 plasmids and cultured overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 280 rpm; plasmid DNA was subsequently isolated with a Qiaprep miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequence-verified eA1-mutant plasmids (Wake Forest University DNA Sequencing Laboratory) were then transfected into U-251 MG cells as described below. Mutant plasmids were transfected into U-251 MG glioma cells in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, Opti-MEM media was replaced with growth medium containing 20% FBS and then again, 24 h later, with 10% FBS growth medium. Forty-eight hours later cells were split into 100-mm2 dishes and selected with growth medium containing 800 μg/ml Geneticin. Individual clones were isolated with cloning rings, transferred into a 24-well plate, and maintained in growth medium with 200 μg/ml Geneticin. Mutant eA1 expression in the cell media of clones was verified by eA1 immunoblotting, and high-expressing clones were further cultured in growth medium without Geneticin for at least 48 h to obtain conditioned media for EphA2 down-regulation assays. U-251 MG cells were grown to 60% confluence in 60-mm dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and subsequently dosed with conditioned media containing equivalent amounts of wild type eA1 or mutant eA1 as evaluated by eA1 Western blotting and densitometry analysis. For determination of the effect of all the mutants together on EphA2 down-regulation and activation of AKT and ERK as well as in the migration/cell morphology assays, eA1 was measured by ELISA (see below). Negative controls for these experiments included fresh media and conditioned media from vector-transfected U-251 MG cells, whereas positive controls were recombinant homodimeric eA1-Fc at 1 μg/ml (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and wild type eA1-conditioned media. U-251 MG cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with the corresponding conditioned media or controls before obtaining cell lysates. eA1 in CM was determined using a sandwich ELISA assay. CMs were collected from subconfluent monolayers of U-251 MG parental and vector-, WT-, and mutant eA1-transfected cells. Media were centrifuged for 5 min ×1000 rpm to pellet any insoluble debris, and supernatant was collected. A 96-well plate was coated with 5 μg/ml polyclonal goat anti-mouse human eA1 (R&D Systems), blocked in 5% milk, and incubated with serial concentrations of eA1-Fc (R&D Systems) or CM. Detection was achieved using a primary antibody against human eA1 (clone V18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Detection was performed at 405 nm. Both primary and secondary antibodies were raised against epitopes outside of the eA1 GH-loop and thus enable detection of eA1 GH-loop mutants. A standard curve was constructed using the signals corresponding to the eA1-Fc serial dilutions, and mutant eA1 content in CM was calculated. Subconfluent cultures of U-251 MG cells were grown in 60-mm2 dishes. Cells were treated with conditioned media dilutions based on the results from the sandwich ELISA assay, recombinant mouse eA1/Fc chimera (R&D Systems), or conditioned growth media control for the indicated times. Cells were photographed by phase contrast microscopy with a 20× objective lens, and images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Cell lysates were collected and used for Western blotting. Cell lysates were prepared by washing treated U-251 MG cells with PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) Igepal in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline) containing mammalian protease inhibitor mixture and 0.5% v/v sodium vanadate (Sigma). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels (EphA2/actin immunoblotting) or 12% polyacrylamide gels (ephrinA1-immunoblotting for conditioned media) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce). Membranes were subsequently blocked (5% (w/v) milk in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma)) for at least 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 h with shaking with the appropriate primary antibodies including anti-EphA2 clone D7 at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin diluted at 1:50,000 (Sigma), anti-ephrinA1 clone V18 at 1:300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr-202/Tyr-204) XPTM, anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), anti-phospho-AKT (Se-r473) XPTM, anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti-α tubulin (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA). After three 5-min washes in 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG) at a dilution of 1:5000 in blotto for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Membranes were then again washed three times with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, and proteins were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were subsequently exposed to BioMax XAR autoradiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 10–20 s. Films were scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi using a HP ScanJet3979 and Adobe Photoshop 5.0 Software. Densitometry analysis was conducted using Image J Software (National Institutes of Health). Wounds were made in a confluent monolayer of U-251 MG cells with a sterile 200-μl tip, and growth media containing WT and mutant eA1 was added. Conditioned growth medium from untransfected cells was used as the negative control, whereas eA1-Fc (1 μg/ml) was added as a positive control. Phase contrast microscopy pictures were taken of the same field at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h. Distance of the wound in μm was measured in five places for each of three wounds for each treatment or cell type at each time point using ImagePro Plus software, and the percent wound closure over 24 h was calculated for graphical representation. Recombinant eA1-WT and its variants R110A, T115A, G117A, and F120A were produced using the baculovirus expression vector system from BD Biosciences. eA1 (19–175) WT, one of the forms of eA1 that we identified in the media of cancer cells (unpublished) and the four eA1 mutants were amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TATAGGATCCCATCACCATCACCATCACGATCGCCACACCGTC-3′ (BamHI restriction site and the coding sequence for the N terminus Histidine tag), and the reverse primer 5′-CACGAATTCCTATTATTAAACCCGCACCTCTGGGTCATC-3′ (EcoRI restriction site and stop codons). The amplified fragments were cloned into BamHI-EcoRI sites in the Baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67-B (BD Biosciences) and sequenced. This vector carries the gp67 Baculovirus-encoded secretion signal sequence upstream the MCS forcing the secretion of the recombinant proteins. The generated recombinant bacmids pBeA1, pBeA1-110, pBeA1-115, pBeA1-117, and pBEe1-120, respectively, were amplified in E. coli DH5α cells. Sf9 insect cells were co-transfected with pBEA1, pBeA1-110, pBEA1-115, pBEA1-117, and pBEA1-120 recombinant bacmids and the linearized BaculogoldTM Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) using the BaculogoldTM Transfection kit (BD Biosciences) following the instructions of the supplier. Infectious recombinant baculoviruses were amplified two times in BD BaculogoldTM MaX-XP Serum-free Insect Cell Medium (BD Biosciences) in Sf9 serum-free media-adapted cells at 27 °C for 5 days to obtain high titer virus stocks. Sf9 cells, serum-free media-adapted, were infected with high titer virus stocks and grown at 27 °C for 5 days to produce the recombinant proteins. Sf9-baculovirus infected media containing the recombinant proteins were collected, and floating cells were removed by centrifugation (at 3000 × g for 10 min). Supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter, 0.1 m urea was added, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. The His6-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with HisTrap HP affinity column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, and the recombinant proteins were eluted with a step gradient with buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Recombinant proteins were filtered (0.22 μm) and stored at −20 °C. Binding interactions between eA1 (wild type and mutants) and EphA2 were measured by surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore T100 instrument (33Hantgan R.R. Stahle M.C. Lord S.T.

Recombinant human EphA2 receptor (R&D Systems) was immobilized on the dextran matrix of a CM5 biosensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (29 μg/ml at pH 4) to achieve a sparse monolayer in the sample chamber (5991 ± 139 response units (RU), n = 3) and a blank immobilization in the reference chamber. Unreacted sites in both chambers were blocked with ethanolamine. All surface plasmon resonance procedures were carried out at 25.0 °C. Binding curves were obtained with eA1 monomer (0–3000 nm) and dimer (0–2400 nm) by delivering aliquots of each protein in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to both sample and reference chambers at 30 μl/min. RU versus time profiles were monitored for 700 s during the binding step; dissociation was then monitored for 1500 s as buffer was delivered. Bound ligands were removed by regeneration with 1 m NaCl followed by 0.1% SDS. Time-dependent changes obtained with buffer delivery were subtracted from each protein binding profile (sample − reference RU signals) to obtain double-corrected kinetic traces. U-251 MG cells (2 × 103) were plated in 6-well plates in growth medium plus 0.35% agar on a base layer of BactoTMAgar, BD Biosciences, growth medium plus 0.5% agar. Cells were supplemented with eA1-WT, eA1-R110A, eA1-T115A, eA1-G117A, and eA1-F120A at 1.0 and 0.1 μg/ml or vehicle alone. Fresh media-eA1 was added to the cells 3 days and 1 week after plating. Colonies were counted after 14 days. Clusters of colonies greater than 50 cells were counted in 10 random fields at low power. Each experimental condition was done in triplicate for every assay. Probability (p) values were calculated using the analysis of variance one-way test using MS Excel; p values ≤0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We demonstrated that EphA2 is differentially down-regulated in U-251 MG cells treated with an equimolar amount of CM obtained from U-251[eA1](+) and various U-251[G-H loop mutant eA1s](+) cells. First, we determined that there are three principal groups of alanine-mutated eA1 variants. In the first group a diminished EphA2 down-regulation was observed among CM from R110A, F111A, T112A, L116A, E119A, F120A, and G123A eA1 mutants when compared with eA1-WT CM (Fig. 2A). In the second group three substitution mutations, namely F108A, K118A, and K121A yielded activity similar to those obtained with U-251[eA1](+) CM (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, the third group of variants (Pro-113, Thr-115, Gly-117, and Glu-122) exhibited a 39, 67, 39, and 57% (Fig. 2B) enhanced down-regulation of EphA2, respectively. Q109A demonstrated a similar effect (not shown). It is noteworthy that T115A and E122A are two of few other residues that are unique to eA1 G-H loop. Further experiments revealed that non-conservative substitutions at position 115, such as T115R, T115D, and T115G, not only abolished the enhancing effect on EphA2 down-regulation that had been obtained with T115A CM, but they made the variants inactive (supplemental Fig. S2). One substitution, F114A, was the only mutant of eA1 found in small amounts in the cell lysate and not released into the media and, thus, of unknown activity (not shown).FIGURE 1The eA1 G-H loop and its interaction with EphA2.

https://openalex.org/W2035747967,"A major product of oxidative damage to DNA, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanine (8-oxoG), can lead to genomic mutations if it is bypassed unfaithfully by DNA polymerases in vivo. However, our pre-steady-state kinetic studies show that DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), a prototype Y-family enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus, can bypass 8-oxoG both efficiently and faithfully. For the first time, our stopped-flow FRET studies revealed that a DNA polymerase altered its synchronized global conformational dynamics in response to a DNA lesion. Relative to nucleotide incorporation into undamaged DNA, three of the four domains of Dpo4 undertook different conformational transitions during 8-oxoG bypass and the subsequent extension step. Moreover, the rapid translocation of Dpo4 along DNA induced by nucleotide binding was significantly hindered by the interactions between the embedded 8-oxoG and Dpo4 during the extension step. These results unprecedentedly demonstrate that a Y-family DNA polymerase employs different global conformational dynamics when replicating undamaged and damaged DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2044487515,"Background A recent genome-wide association study has identified a new susceptibility locus, kinesin family member 1B gene (KIF1B), strongly associated with progression from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) to hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese population, this study was carried out to explore the role of the genetic variants in KIF1B in the development of chronic hepatitis B. Methodology/Principal Findings Three KIF1B polymorphisms (rs8019, rs17401924, and rs17401966) were selected and genotyped in 473 CHB patients and 580 controls with no history of CHB. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression model. None of these three SNPs showed association with CHBs after adjusting for age and gender. Equivalence-based method analysis confirmed the absence of association. In the further haplotype analysis, three common haplotypes were observed in this study population, but no significant effect was also found for haplotypes in the progression to CHB. Conclusions/Significance This study showed the new locus identified for HCC, KIF1B, was not associated with progression to CHB, implying distinct genetic susceptibility factor contributes to the progression from hepatitis B virus infection to HCC. Nevertheless, further comprehensive analyses are warranted to dissect the mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1995630548,"Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic disease, with a characteristic hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation that is caused by biallelic mutations in A-T mutated (ATM), a gene encoding a protein kinase critical for the induction of cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly to DNA double strand breaks. A long known characteristic of A-T cells is their ability to synthesize DNA even in the presence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, a phenomenon termed radioresistant DNA synthesis. We previously reported that ATM kinase inhibition, but not ATM protein disruption, blocks sister chromatid exchange following DNA damage. We now show that ATM kinase inhibition, but not ATM protein disruption, also inhibits DNA synthesis. Investigating a potential physical interaction of ATM with the DNA replication machinery, we found that ATM co-precipitates with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from cellular extracts. Using bacterially purified ATM truncation mutants and in vitro translated PCNA, we showed that the interaction is direct and mediated by the C terminus of ATM. Indeed, a 20-amino acid region close to the kinase domain is sufficient for strong binding to PCNA. This binding is specific to ATM, because the homologous regions of other PIKK members, including the closely related kinase A-T and Rad3-related (ATR), did not bind PCNA. ATM was found to bind two regions in PCNA. To examine the functional significance of the interaction between ATM and PCNA, we tested the ability of ATM to stimulate DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase δ, which is implicated in both DNA replication and DNA repair processes. ATM was observed to stimulate DNA polymerase activity in a PCNA-dependent manner."

However, the lack of well-defined trophoblast-specific gene regulatory elements has hampered investigations regarding the role of specific genes in placental development and fetal growth.By random assembly of placental enhancers from two previously characterized genes, trophoblast specific protein α (Tpbpa) and adenosine deaminase (Ada), we identified a chimeric Tpbpa/Ada enhancer that when combined with the basal Ada promoter provided the highest luciferase activity in cultured human trophoblast cells, in comparison with non-trophoblast cell lines. We used this chimeric enhancer arrangement to drive the expression of a Cre recombinase transgene in the placentas of transgenic mice. Cre transgene expression occurred throughout the placenta but not in maternal organs examined or in the fetus.In conclusion, we have provided both in vitro and in vivo evidence for a novel genetic system to achieve placental transgene expression by the use of a chimeric Tpbpa/Ada enhancer driven transgene. The availability of this expression vector provides transgenic opportunities to direct the production of desired proteins to the placenta."

Emblems are semiotic gestures that use movements or hand postures to symbolically encode and communicate meaning, independently of language. They often require contextual information to be correctly understood. Until now, observation of symbolic gestures was studied against a blank background where the meaning and intentionality of the gesture was not fulfilled.Normal subjects were scanned while observing short videos of an individual performing symbolic gesture with or without the corresponding visual context and the context scenes without gestures. The comparison between gestures regardless of the context demonstrated increased activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior parietal cortex and the temporoparietal junction in the right hemisphere and the precuneus and posterior cingulate bilaterally, while the comparison between context and gestures alone did not recruit any of these regions.These areas seem to be crucial for the inference of intentions in symbolic gestures observed in their natural context and represent an interrelated network formed by components of the putative human neuron mirror system as well as the mentalizing system."

https://openalex.org/W2087768780,"Multimarker Transmission/Disequilibrium Tests (TDTs) are very robust association tests to population admixture and structure which may be used to identify susceptibility loci in genome-wide association studies. Multimarker TDTs using several markers may increase power by capturing high-degree associations. However, there is also a risk of spurious associations and power reduction due to the increase in degrees of freedom. In this study we show that associations found by tests built on simple null hypotheses are highly reproducible in a second independent data set regardless the number of markers. As a test exhibiting this feature to its maximum, we introduce the multimarker -Groups TDT (), a test which under the hypothesis of no linkage, asymptotically follows a distribution with degree of freedom regardless the number of markers. The statistic requires the division of parental haplotypes into two groups: disease susceptibility and disease protective haplotype groups. We assessed the test behavior by performing an extensive simulation study as well as a real-data study using several data sets of two complex diseases. We show that test is highly efficient and it achieves the highest power among all the tests used, even when the null hypothesis is tested in a second independent data set. Therefore, turns out to be a very promising multimarker TDT to perform genome-wide searches for disease susceptibility loci that may be used as a preprocessing step in the construction of more accurate genetic models to predict individual susceptibility to complex diseases."
