https://openalex.org/W1526944695,"A double-helical B-DNA dodecamer has been analyzed by single crystal x-ray diffraction methods and refined independently in four variants: sequence CGCGAATTCGCG at 20 degrees C and at 16 K, and CGCGAATTBrCGCG in 60% methylpentanediol at 20 and at 7 degrees C. The first three forms show a 14-19 degrees bend in overall helix axis, but the fourth is straight and unbent. Detailed comparisons of the various forms have led to a better understanding of helix geometry and bending. Structural principles can be understood best if organized under four headings: 1) intrinsic geometry of the sugar rings, 2) stacking and relative motion of base pairs, 3) geometry of the connecting phosphate backbone, and 4) mechanics of bending in B-DNA. The observed bending is neither completely localized nor smooth and continuous, but an intermediate compromise that can be termed annealed kinking."

Our findings supported this hypothesis and suggest that amphetamine and at least some stressors may be interchangeable in their ability to induce sensitization. The data raise the possibility that stress might be a common variable contributing to both amphetamine psychosis and some forms of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2056461989,"Titers of testosterone in plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay in male rat fetuses of stressed and control mothers on days 17, 18, 19, 21, and 23 (the day of birth) after conception. In fetuses of stressed mothers, testosterone concentrations were highest on day 17, declined on days 18 and 19, and then remained unchanged. In the control fetuses, testosterone increased from relatively low concentrations on day 17 to the highest amounts on days 18 and 19, and then declined. Thus, the persistence of feminine and impaired masculine sexual behavior in male offspring of stressed mothers could be due to the absence of a surge of circulating testosterone during days 18 and 19 after conception, a period postulated to be critical in the development of the central nervous system in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1596822567,"The major mammalian heat shock or proteins (molecular masses of 90,000, 72,000, and 73,000 daltons) have been purified from stressed HeLa cells. The 90,000-dalton protein co-purified with small amounts of a 100,000-dalton protein which was identified as one of the other stress proteins in these cells. The 72,000- and 73,000-dalton proteins co-purified throughout the fractionation scheme, apparently as a mixture of monomeric forms of the two proteins. From sedimentation velocity and gel filtration analysis, it was found that the 90,000/100,000-dalton protein mixture had a Stokes radius of 69A and a s20,w value of 5.8 while the 72,000/73,000-dalton protein mixture had a Stokes radius of 42.6A and a s20,w value of 4.3. The purified proteins migrated identically in two-dimensional gel electrophoretograms with their counterparts from total cell lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled stressed HeLa cells. Peptide mapping experiments indicated that the 72,000- and 73,000-dalton proteins contained common peptides while the 90,000- and 100,000-dalton proteins appeared to be distinct. Amino acid analysis of the 90,000- and a mixture of the 72,000/73,000-dalton proteins showed that both contained relatively high amounts of Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln."

https://openalex.org/W1590099198,"The various polyunsaturated fatty acids found in cellular lipids are transferred from their coenzyme A thiol esters to phospholipid acceptors with greatly different maximal velocities. The very low apparent Km values for the thiol esters in acylating 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphocholine could not be directly measured, but their values could be estimated relative to that for arachidonate. The competitive effectiveness of various polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs was estimated by measuring the equivalent concentrations which allow incorporations equal to arachidonyl-CoA. These values help predict the way in which various polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs may be selectively esterified to membrane lipids by the 1-acylglyceol 3-phosphocholine (1-acyl-GPC) acyltransferase system of liver microsomes. The acyl-CoA esters of saturated acids, as well as those for 22:1, 22:2, and 22:3, had negligible ability to compete for the active sites of the 1-acyl-GPC acyltransferase system. The acyl-CoA esters of arachidonate (20:4n-6), eicosatrienoate (20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoate (20:5n-3), and both isomers of linolenate (18:3n-6 and n-3) were handled preferentially by the 1-acyl-GPC acyltransferases. The system from liver has a high selectivity for unsaturated acids but does not appear to discriminate among the polyunsaturated acids of the n-6 and n-3 series that serve as precursors of prostaglandins and leukotrienes."
https://openalex.org/W1553214481,"The internal pH (pHi) of sperm of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the weak bases [14C]methylamine, [14C]diethylamine, or 9-aminoacridine under conditions where cellular respiration was activated or inhibited. When 9-aminoacridine fluorescence measurements are corrected for binding to intracellular components, the pHi estimates agree quantitatively with those obtained from [14C]amine distributions. The pHi of sperm decreased when the intracellular [K+] was elevated above the physiological value of 10 mM, or when the external pH was substantially decreased below the physiological 8.0, or when Na+ was absent from the seawater. At the decreased pHi values, sperm respiration and motility were inhibited; conversely, both respiration and motility increased when the pHi was elevated. Increased respiration occurred whether the pHi was increased by altering the external pH, [K+] or [Na+], or by the addition of NH4Cl to the medium. In all cases, the activation of respiration and motility were linked, suggesting a unitary control mechanism, some possibilities for which are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1525431775,"Human plasma fibronectin was enzymatically labeled with dansylcadaverine using plasma Factor XIIa. Fluorescence polarization studies of dansylcadaverine-labeled fibronectin indicate that fibronectin has a significant degree of chain flexibility in physiologic solution and that there is an increase in chain flexibility at high pH or ionic strength. Binding of a collagen peptide to dansylcadaverine-fibronectin results in a decrease in fluorescence polarization, suggesting that such binding causes a conformational change which also results in increased chain flexibility.l Quasielastic light scattering and intrinsic viscosity measurements of fibronectin were performed under physiologic conditions and at high pH and ionic strength. Shape calculations based on these data indicate that fibronectin is in an elongated configuration under physiologic conditions and further unfolds at high pH or ionic strength into a very flexible, strand-like configuration. Light scattering studies of fibronectin after binding of a collagen fragment indicate that such binding results in a decrease in the diffusion coefficient, suggesting that collagen binding also results in a partial unfolding of fibronectin. These results suggest that published electron micrographs of fibronectin showing a long, strand-like molecule do not reflect the conformation of plasma fibronectin under physiologic conditions; fibronectin, however, may assume an unfolded conformation upon binding to collagen in the tissue matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1558242213,"Apolipoprotein B obtained from each of the major density classes of human plasma lipoproteins was investigated immunochemically. Eleven different mouse hybridoma cell lines were generated and selected on the basis of their ability to secrete antibodies that were bound by either very low density or intermediate density lipoproteins. Two of these antibodies appeared to be specific for complex epitopes on apoprotein B, since they were bound by all apoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, but not by apoprotein B after it had been delipidated and electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The remaining nine hybridoma antibodies were capable of binding to apoprotein B; and appeared to be specific for relatively simple epitopes that were expressed by denatured apoprotein B. The ability of these nine hybridoma antibodies to bind to the denatured apoprotein B species of plasma chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, and low density lipoproteins was compared. The apoprotein B species were separated on the basis of their relative mobility in low percentage sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose paper for reaction with antibody. These binding studies suggest that plasma apoprotein B represents a complex family of immunochemically heterogeneous but related apoprotein species. A schematic summary of the apoprotein B species distribution of epitopes identified by these hybridoma antibodies is presented."

Bacteriol, 140, 911-916. In the present study, it is shown that one of these proteases cleaves specifically the peptide bonds on the NH2-terminal side of either aspartic acid or cysteic acid residues in oxidized ribonuclease. With myoglobin as the substrate, a similar specificity was observed except that only four out of the six aspartyl bonds present were hydrolyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1603142270,"Ribonuclease A was introduced into the cytoplasm of IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts by red cell-mediated microinjection. Early passage fibroblasts degraded ribonuclease A with a half-life of approximately 90 h in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and enhanced the degradative rate 1.6-fold upon serum withdrawal. Senescent cells degraded ribonuclease A more slowly with half-lives ranging between 125 and 250 h and had diminished capacities to enhance the catabolism of this protein during serum starvation. Decreased protein degradation in senescent cells was also evident for microinjected RNase S-protein, RNase B, aldolase, lysozyme, and the synthetic copolymer polyglutamate: tyrosine:alanine (1:1:1). These alterations in the mechanisms and regulation of intracellular protein degradation may contribute to several biochemical abnormalities characteristic of aging cells and organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2161980572,"Sheep antibodies raised against three isoenzymes of glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18), transferases B, C, and E, which were isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver, have been employed to localize these enzymes at the light microscopic level within livers of untreated rats. Using these antibodies in an unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining technique, each glutathione S-transferase was detected immunohistochemically within parenchymal cells throughout the liver lobule. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for transferases C and E, but not for transferase B, was observed within bile duct epithelium. While all parenchymal cells were stained with each glutathione S-transferase antibody, the patterns of immunohistochemical staining intensity observed across the liver lobule with the three anti-transferases were not uniform: parenchymal cells within the centrilobular region were more intensely stained for each lobular region were more intensely stained for each isoenzyme than were those within the midzonal and periportal regions of the lobule. The results of this immunohistochemical study thus demonstrate that glutathione S-transferases are not distributed uniformly throughout the liver lobule and that each transferase is present in the greatest concentration within the centrilobular region of the lobule."

https://openalex.org/W1533185061,"The low molecular weight, glutamine-rich storage protein isolated from the seeds of Ricinus communis (castor beans) has been shown to consist of two different polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bond(s). The small subunit is composed of 34 amino acids with a proline at its NH2 terminus, whereas the large subunit contains 61 amino acids with a cyclized glutamine as the NH2-terminal residue. The complete amino acid sequence of both subunits has been determined through characterization of the isolated subunits and selected peptides from trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and cyanogen bromide cleavage. The intact protein possesses a large number of glutaminyl and half-cystinyl residues and exhibits sequence heterogeneity as observed from peptide sequences. Comparison of the sequence of this protein and those of other seed proteins indicates some structural similarities between them. The amino acid sequences of the two polypeptide chains of castor bean storage protein are: (formula, see text)."
https://openalex.org/W2006575131,"Freshly ejaculated, noncapacitated boar sperm bind rapidly and in large numbers to pig egg zona pellucida in vitro. In the present study, the number of sperm bound decreased sharply when sperm motility was lowered by energy poisons or by reducing the temperature. Highly motile sperm from humans, guinea pigs, and rats, added at concentrations ten times higher than control sperm, did not bind to the porcine zona. At the same high concentration, a small number of hamster and bull sperm bound to the zona. Binding of boar sperm to the zona pellucida was blocked almost completely by diluted whole antiserum to sperm plasma membranes and by univalent (Fab) antibody to these membranes. When antibody to sperm plasma membrane was first absorbed with plasma membrane vesicles, sperm binding was not inhibited. These results provide direct evidence for the existence of sperm plasma membrane receptors for the zona pellucida of the pig."

https://openalex.org/W1576536837,"Rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase can be markedly activated by a variety of different procedures including those that lead to covalent modification of the enzyme, such as limited proteolysis by alpha-chymotrypsin and alkylation of sulfhydryl groups by N-ethylmaleimide, and those that lead to reversible changes, such as the interaction of the enzyme with lysolecithin and related compounds. These treatments not only lead to increased activity toward the normal substrate for the enzyme, phenylalanine, but they lead to even greater increases in activity toward normally poor substrates such as m-tyrosine. Activations of this type, therefore, in effect, appear to broaden the amino acid specificity of the enzyme. We have now found that the extent of the change in substrate specificity on activation of the enzyme is much greater than had been heretofore realized. Indeed, the lysolecithin-activated enzyme is able to act on nonaromatic amino acids such as methionine and norleucine, catalyzing their conversion to methionine sulfoxide and epsilon-hydroxynorleucine, respectively. These amino acids are also substrates for phenylalanine hydroxylase that has been activated by limited proteolysis with alpha-chymotrypsin and by reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. By contrast, the unactivated hydroxylase as little or no activity toward methionine and norleucine. Rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase can also be activated by its substrate, phenylalanine. We have now found that the novel substrates, methionine and norleucine, are also able to activate the enzyme. On a molar basis, however, they are not as active as phenylalanine. A model that can account for the broadened substrate specificity of the activated enzyme is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1600175486,"Eleven hybridoma antibodies specific for apoprotein B were used to examine the expression of apoprotein B epitopes on native plasma lipoproteins using fluid phase radioimmunoassays. Heterogeneity of apoprotein B in low density lipoprotein (LDL) of density 1.019-1.063 g/ml was indicated by maximum binding of radioiodinated LDL in the presence of excess antibody that ranged from 45 to 100%. Affinity constants for LDL ranged from 0.29-3.0 X 10(9) M-1. Each of the 11 antibodies recognized apoprotein B epitopes that were expressed by very low, intermediate, and low density lipoproteins, VLDL, IDL, and LDL, respectively, since at high concentrations, each could fully displace the binding of radioiodinated LDL. In contrast, these same apoprotein B epitopes were not present on high density lipoproteins. Logit transformation analysis of competitive inhibition titrations demonstrated at least three patterns of epitope expression. The first pattern, identified by five of the antibodies, was characterized by indistinguishable expression of each of the apoprotein B epitopes on VLDL, IDL, and LDL. The second pattern, identified by three antibodies, was characterized by identical expression of the apoprotein B epitopes on VLDL and IDL, but of differing affinities than the related epitope on LDL. Three antibodies identified a third pattern of epitope expression which was was characterized by identical expression on IDL and LDL, but with differing affinities for the antibodies than the same epitopes on VLDL. These observations suggest that the organization of apoprotein B in VLDL, IDL, and LDL is similar, but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1605180802,"Methotrexate-resistant (MTXR) human breast cancer cells have been obtained which are 1000-fold less sensitive to this drug than the wild type MCF-7 cells from which they were derived. The resistant cells contain approximately a 25-fold increase in the activity of the target enzyme dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase. Enzyme inhibition studies and methotrexate affinity studies fail to reveal any difference in the DHF reductase present in the MTXR cells compared to wild type MCF-7 cells. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrates the presence of elongated marker chromosomes in the resistant cells which are not found in the parental cell line. Analysis of the DNA from MTXR and wild type MCF-7 cells using Southern blot hybridization indicates that the MTXR MCF-7 cells contain more copies of DHF reductase gene sequences than do wild type MCF-7 cells. These experiments also suggest that the amplified DHF reductase gene sequences in MTXR cells may have undergone a uniform structural rearrangement involving the 5' flanking sequences during the process of amplification. MTXR MCF-7 cells respond to estradiol by increasing cell growth, and the level of DHF reductase in the MTXR cells is further induced following administration of estradiol. Radiolabeling studies demonstrate that estrogen stimulates the actual synthesis of DHF reductase in human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1566132289,"Abstract The synthesis and secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) subunits have been studied by pulse-chase techniques in JAR choriocarcinoma cells, which produce both the alpha and beta subunits of hCG eutopically, that is, as part of their expected repertoire of gene products, and in three cell lines that produce either alpha or beta subunit ectopically. JAR cells contain two intracellular forms of the alpha subunit (Mr = 15,000 and 18,000) and of the beta subunit (Mr = 18,000 and 24,000) but do not accumulate fully processed, alpha (Mr = 22,000) or beta (Mr = 34,000) subunits during chase of pulse-labeled cells. Mature subunits, however, are secreted into the culture medium during this time. Thus, secretion of mature subunits appears to occur rapidly after processing of the intracellular forms. Two cell lines that ectopically secrete alpha but not beta subunit, ChaGo bronchogenic carcinoma cells and HeLa S3 cervical carcinoma cells, also contain the Mr = 15,000 and 18,000 intracellular forms of alpha subunit and appear to accumulate mature alpha subunit intracellularly. The CBT cell line, derived from a glioblastoma multiforme, produces the Mr = 18,000 and 24,000 intracellular forms of beta subunit with no evidence for alpha subunit synthesis or secretion. These four cell lines should provide biologic reagents for the further study of alpha and beta subunit processing and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1543408256,"Human hepatic betaine:homocysteine S-methyltransferase has been purified to apparent homogeneity after a 250-fold separation. The isolation required the presence of homocysteine and a product of the reaction, dimethylglycine, in order to stabilize the protein. An apparent molecular weight of 270,000 was determined by calibrated gel filtration. A single peptide chain of Mr = 45,000 was found by calibrated sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the native protein is a hexamer of identical subunits. The enzyme is stable at pH values greater than 5.5. No effect of EDTA was observed on the activity of the enzyme. In the absence of thiol reagents, the hexameric protein appeared to polymerize to integral aggregates. Isovalerate and 3,3-dimethylbutyrate, analogs of dimethylglycine and betaine, respectively, are good inhibitors of the enzyme. The inhibitions are competitive with respect to betaine, indicating that a positive charge is not required for binding at the betaine/dimethylglycine site. These findings are similar to those reported for acetylcholine esterase where the neutral analogs of choline show good binding to that enzyme. The binding site for betaine/dimethylglycine may exist in two states, one permitting the binding of a positively charged group and the other a neutral group."
https://openalex.org/W1594851571,"The phenobarbital-induced isozyme of cytochrome P-450 was isolated from rabbit liver microsomes and subjected to chemical and proteolytic degradation. The resulting peptides were isolated exclusively by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Automated sequence analysis was employed to determine the linear arrangement of 385 residues and the order of all CNBr peptides. The NH2 terminus of the cytochrome P-450 consists of five hydrophobic segments 18 to 23 residues long, separated by polar regions of 8 to 15 residues. The COOH terminus contains a hydrophilic region 120 residues long as well as several hydrophobic segments. A tridecapeptide, previously found to be analogous to a tryptic peptide from a constitutive P-450 isozyme (Ozols, J., Heinemann, F. S., and Johnson, E. F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11405-11408) was positioned within the hydrophilic region of the COOH terminus. The amino acid sequence is interpreted in terms of a model for the topology of the cytochrome in the membrane which can be used as a basis for further experiments. Comparison of this sequence with the cytochrome P-450CAM sequence (Haniu, M., Armes, L. G., Tanaka, M., Yasunobo, K. T., Shastry, B. S., Wagner, G. C., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 105, 889-894) revealed a single homologous region which contains a cysteinyl residue. The amino acid sequence of his segment is as follows: P-450 microsomal/P-450CAM:Ile/Leu-Cys-Leu-Gly-Gln/Glu-Ser/Gly-Leu/Ile-Ala-Arg. The amino acid sequence data were also compared with the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 mRNA from rat liver (Kurijama-Fuji, Y., Mizukami, Y., Kawajiri, K., Sogawa, K., Muramatsu, M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2793-2797). This comparison suggests that the structure of the phenobarbital-induced isozyme is highly conserved among mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1549267680,"1. Purified and reconstituted nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria was investigated with respect to kinetic and regulatory properties in uncoupled and coupled liposomes. 2. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocities for the reduction of NAD+ by NADPH versus substrate concentrations were convergent and intersecting on or close to the abscissa, indicating a ternary complex mechanism. The effect of site-specific inhibitors indicates that the order of addition of the substrates to the enzyme is random. 3. Reconstituted transhydrogenase uncoupled by FCCP reveals kinetic properties that are indicative of energization, i.e. an increased and decreased affinity for NADP+ and NAD+, respectively, suggesting that reconstituted transhydrogenase is maintained in an activated conformation. An increased extent of coupling causes a progressively increasing change in the same direction. These results suggest that the uncoupler-dependent enhancement of the rate of reduction of NAD+ by NADPH is due to a decreased Km for NAD+. 4. Reconstituted transhydrogenase catalyzes a transhydrogenation between NADH and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) in the presence of NADPH. Reconstituted transhydrogenase also also catalyzes the reduction of thio-NADP+ by NADPH in the presence of NADH. Both reactions are concluded to occur indirectly through the generation of NADP+ and NAD+, respectively, and not directly through a reduced enzyme intermediate. 5. A proton pump mechanism is proposed for transhydrogenase which involves a dimeric form of the enzyme where the two subunits are alternating in proton pumping."

The transporter can be protected if other substrates are present during illumination. When [3H]4-azido,3-nitrophenyl-azo-(5-hydroxytryptamine) is used, preferential labeling of one polypeptide (Mr approximately 45,000) is observed in the light, provided no other substrates of the transporter are present during illumination.

https://openalex.org/W1598691209,"What we had seen previously as two Na+-dependent agencies of amino acid transport in the hepatoma cell line HTC, now also in the cultured rat hepatocyte, fetal and mature, in primary culture, turns out, on the basis of 1) their pH profiles for transport, 2) mutual competitive interaction between their substrates, 3) similarity in selectivity for amino acid chain length, and 4) stimulation of threonine exodus by the anionic cysteine sulfinate, to represent a single mediating system. We conclude that protonation of the mediating ASC system, possibly substrate-assisted, rather than od the free anionic amino acid, converts the system from function for various short chained amino acids to function for aspartate, cysteine sulfinate, and cysteate. Other systems for anionic amino acid transport have shown no such relation to ASC."

Inactivation of the branched chain complex and the concomitant incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the alpha-chain of the dehydrogenase subcomponent were observed in hearts perfused with glucose (10 mM) or pyruvate (10 mM). alpha-Ketoisocaproate infusion caused a 15-fold activation and dephosphorylation of the branched chain dehydrogenase, while pyruvate dehydrogenase remained inactive and phosphorylated under these conditions. Both dehydrogenase components were partially activated, and most of the [32P]phosphate was removed from their respective alpha-subunits during substrate-free perfusion. Both enzyme complexes were activated and dephosphorylated completely during infusion of dichloroacetate (1 mM) and glucose (10 mM)."
https://openalex.org/W1507719395,"Earlier findings in several laboratories have suggested that the various forms of cytochrome P-450 within a given species or from different species are not closely related. However, our present studies on the primary structure of the phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome from rabbit liver microsomes (P-450LM2) show that this protein is about 80% identical to the corresponding rat protein (P-450b), the sequence of which was recently deduced by others. For example, of the first 70 residues of the NH2-terminal sequences, 52 are identical, with most differences structurally conservative and attributable to point mutations. No evidence was found for heterogeneity in the region of the rabbit cytochrome corresponding to the variable region proposed for the rat cytochrome. A comparison of the known primary structure of P-450LM2 with that of P-450b and that of the bacterial camphor-hydroxylating cytochrome (P-450cam) as recently reported by others reveals only one highly conserved cysteine-containing peptide present in approximately the same position in each cytochrome. This peptide in the rabbit enzyme, -Arg-Ile-Gln-Glu-Glu-Ala-Arg-Cys147-Leu-Val-Glu-Glu-Leu-Arg-, and the corresponding peptides containing Cys152 in P-450b and Cys134 in P-450cam may serve an essential function such as providing the axial thiolate ligand to the heme iron atom."
https://openalex.org/W1534469347,"In the present study, transport by Systems A, ASC, and N was shown to be elevated in hepatocytes isolated from diabetic rats. After the cells were placed in primary culture, the System ASC activity declined rapidly, while the decay of Systems A and N was slower and dependent on protein synthesis. The elevated 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake was the result of an increase in the Vmax of a single, high affinity system, presumably System A. The stimulation of System A could not be accounted for by an increase in the affinity for Na+; in fact, the apparent Km for the ion was actually greater in the experimental cells. Release from trans-inhibition was also eliminated as a possible explanation. The data suggest that during the development of the diabetic state the liver is triggered to induce the activity of System A by synthesizing the necessary protein components. Treatment of the cultured hepatocytes with insulin could partially reverse the stimulation due to diabetes, indicating that the induction of System A may be the result of the hyperglucagonemia associated with the disease. In support of this hypothesis, the cells from the diabetic rats were resistant to further stimulation of System A by glucagon, yet they did respond to high levels of insulin or to amino acid starvation. Glucagon does not appear to be involved in the induction of System N in the diabetic animal because this system is not responsive to either glucagon or insulin when tested in vitro."

The cross-linking of substrate to enzyme is extremely sensitive to substrate binding site directed reagents, e.g. pyrophosphate and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and to o-phenanthroline, a zinc-directed chelator. The cross-linking reaction is competitively inhibited by all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, ATP, and GTP, but is resistant to sulfhydryl reagents. When primer is provided in the reaction mixture, cross-linking of both substrate and primer to 26K subunit of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase may be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1564657673,"We describe the isolation and characterization of tryptic peptides of human erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The digest was separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography into 30 peaks, 26 of which contained purified peptides. The four complex peaks were resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography with a different reverse-phase column. Each peptide predicted from the recently described amino acid sequence of human erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was isolated from this peptide map. Sequence analysis of the purified peptides identified two peptides, 14 and 14d, that differed by an Asn/Asp heterogeneity at the position corresponding to residue 106 of the intact protein. Additional studies indicate that this heterogeneity is due to deamidation of the protein in vivo. This post-translational modification appears to be responsible for some of the electrophoretic heterogeneity observed in the normal erythrocyte enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2094046279,"The chain oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.NADH by perhydroxyl radicals and propagated by molecular oxygen was studied by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system, 60Co gamma-ray, and pulse radiolysis. The chain length, amount of NADH oxidized per HO2 generated, increases with increasing acidity of the medium and reaches a value of 73 at pH 5.0. The rate constant for the oxidation of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.NADH complex by HO2 was estimated to be 2 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 at ambient temperatures (23-24 degrees C). Rate studies as a function of pH indicate that O2- is unreactive toward the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.NADH complex. Other dehydrogenases (malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and isocitric dehydrogenase) studied showed no catalytic activity in the oxidation of NADH by HO2/O2-."
https://openalex.org/W1591528245,"3-Deazaaristeromycin (100 microM) is cytostatic for the RAW264 mouse macrophage cell line. In cells incubated with 3-deazaaristeromycin, Cell replication is effectively stimulated by 0.5 microM homocysteine thiolactone and no further stimulation occurs at concentrations of homocysteine thiolactone greater than 50 microM. Cell replication occurs when homocysteine thiolactone is administered either simultaneously with, or 4 days after, the administration of 3-deazaaristeromycin. In the presence of 3-deazaaristeromycin, cell replication also occurs when either folate (10 to 100 microM) or hypoxanthine and thymidine are included in the medium. Incorporation of [14C]formate into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material is inhibited when cells are incubated with 3-deazaaristeromycin, and this inhibition is partially reversed by inclusion of either homocysteine thiolactone or folate in the medium. Experiments showed that adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is inhibited to the same extent after the cells have been incubated for 4 days with either 3-deazaaristeromycin or 3-deazaaristeromycin and homocysteine thiolactone. The findings suggest that in cells incubated with 3-deazaaristeromycin, the formation of homocysteine from S-adenosylhomocysteine is insufficient for the regeneration of tetrahydrofolate for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines."
https://openalex.org/W1484059593,"The transport of [14C]pyridoxal-P and [14C]pyridoxine into isolated rat mitochondria was studied by centrifugal filtration. The incubation medium contained 20 mM 2-oxoglutarate and 10 mM inorganic phosphate to inhibit metabolism of pyridoxal-P by the mitochondria. The ratio of [14C]pyridoxine space to [3H]H2O space rapidly attained unity independent of the [14C]pyridoxine concentration in the medium and remained unchanged for up to 90 min of incubation. These data suggest simple passive diffusion for the transport of pyridoxine into the mitochondria. By contrast, the ratio of [14C]pyridoxal-P space to [3H]H2O space rose rapidly to exceed 1 in the first 15 min and continued to rise at a slower rate for as long as it was measured. The accumulation of [14C]pyridoxal-P was not decreased by inhibitors and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Fractionation of the mitochondria with digitonin revealed that 19 and 340 pmol of [14C]pyridoxal-P/mg of protein were taken up by the mitochondria at 15 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. Most of the uptake in the first 15 min occurred in the intermembrane space, whereas the largest increase of [14C]pyridoxal-P between 15 and 60 min of incubation appeared in the matrix fraction. Significant binding of the [14C]pyridoxal-P to proteins in the two compartments was demonstrated by gel filtration. These data indicate that pyridoxal-P can rapidly enter the intermembrane space of isolated mitochondria, but its penetration into the matrix occurs at a slower and more sustained rate (i.e. 9-16 pmol/h/mg of protein). It is concluded that the transport of pyridoxal-P into isolated rat liver mitochondria is energy-independent and is most consistent with passive diffusion facilitated by protein binding once this coenzyme enters the different compartments of the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1499736606,"Canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles have been labeled by covalent cross-linking to membrane-bound 125I-calmodulin with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). Electrophoretic analysis in sodium dodecyl sulfate demonstrated a 125I-containing major product of Mr = 40,000, and a minor component of Mr = 120,000. This latter component probably represents a 1:1 complex between the 100,000-dalton Ca2+-ATPase protein and 125I-calmodulin. When cross-linked samples, solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate, were boiled for 2 min, the radioactivity associated with the 40,000-dalton component decreased while that associated with components of 26,000 and 28,000 daltons increased. When these boiled samples were stored at -70 degrees C for 1 week, the radioactivity associated with the 26,000- and 28,000-dalton components decreased whereas that associated with the 40,000-dalton component was increased. This suggests that the 40,000-dalton component represents a 1:1 cross-link between the 23,000-dalton form of phospholamban and 125I-calmodulin. The 26,000- and 28,000-dalton cross-linked components probably represent 1:1 cross-links between 125I-calmodulin and the 8,000- and 11,000-dalton subunits, respectively, of phospholamban. A 32P-containing, 40,000-dalton component was formed when dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was added to sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, phosphorylated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and 3 microM calmodulin. This confirms that the 40,000-dalton affinity-labeled component is a 1:1 cross-link between phospholamban and calmodulin. We propose that phospholamban is the endogenous receptor for calmodulin in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. However, it is unlikely that phospholamban is the endogenous calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in this membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1577005805,"The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase extracted from rat liver microsomes by 3-([3-cholamidopropyl] dimethylammoniol)-1-propane sulfonate detergent solution has been partially purified by chromatography on Ultrogel AcA-34 followed by carboxymethyl-Sepharose chromatography and pentapeptide affinity chromatography. The carboxylase appears to be composed of two proteins, the enzyme and endogenous substrate as judged by the incorporation of 14CO2 into trichloroacetic acid insoluble protein. The apparent Km for Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu as carboxylation substrate is approximately 3 mM. 2,3,5,6-Tetrachloro-4-pyridinol at 10 microM inhibits 90% of the enzyme activity, whereas maximal stimulation (1.7-fold) by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is obtained at 1 mM and by Mn2+ at 5 mM. The stimulation by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and by Mn2+ are not additive. The carboxylation of Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu at 20 degrees C is linear for 90 min. Vitamin K1 plus NADH do not replace vitamin K1 hydroquinone, indicating that vitamin K reductase is not part of this purified carboxylase-substrate complex. Vitamin K epoxidase activity co-elutes with the carboxylase complex. Some 400-fold purification from microsomes has been obtained to yield enzyme preparations with a specific activity of approximately 17,000 pmol of CO2 fixed into peptide/mg of enzyme protein, which is some 15-fold greater than any previously reported enzyme preparation from rat liver microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1564389006,"Radioactive tubulin subunit incorporation into porcine and dogfish shark brain microtubules which are at steady state has been found to result primarily from a diffusional reaction, in which subunits are incorporated although there are an equal number of tubulin subunit additions to and losses from each of the two microtubule ends in a unit of time. Treadmilling is very inefficient, and the Wegner s-values are equal to 0.0005-0.001. At steady state there are approximately 5000 (pig brain) or 2500 (dogfish brain) tubulin subunits lost from the two microtubule ends/s; an equivalent number of subunit addition reactions maintains a constant microtubule mass. The rate constants for subunit loss and addition with porcine brain microtubules, determined from analysis of the steady state rate for radioactive subunit incorporation, are much larger than those measured previously, when the rate constants were determined from the disassembly rate following perturbation of the steady state by dilution (Zeeberg, B., Reid, R., and Caplow, M. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9891-9899). To account for this discrepancy it is suggested that at steady state the microtubule is capped by a short finite length of tubulin-GTP subunits, which undergo extremely facile association and dissociation (2500-5000 subunits/microtubule/s). This cap would be rapidly lost following dilution so that the observed rate only measures the relatively slow loss of tubulin-GDP subunits (120 subunits/microtubule/s) which had been in the interior of the microtubule; this is not equal to the rate constant for subunit loss (and addition) from the ends at steady state. Because of this, previous estimates of the Wegner s-value for treadmilling which utilized dilution for determining the steady state molecular rate constants for subunit loss are believed to be too high."

https://openalex.org/W1544005233,"Equilibration of the phosphorus in radioactive phosphoric acid with the phosphorus in phosphorus oxychloride occurs if these compounds are refluxed together for approximately 24 h. This observation led us to develop a method for the preparation of radioactive phosphorus oxychloride on a small scale with high specific radioactivity. The labeled phosphorus oxychloride may be utilized directly in a one-pot reaction for the preparation of labeled phosphate esters or for the synthesis of more selective phosphorylating agents such as cyanoethyl phosphate. Since the method is very simple and capable of yielding highly labeled radioactive phosphate esters on a small scale, it is applicable to a number of different problems. The preparation of 32P-labeled dolichyl phosphate is described utilizing this procedure."

https://openalex.org/W1576633536,"The structure of the CoA affinity analog-oxidized CoA disulfide (o-CoAS2) (Collier, G. E., and Nishimura, J. S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4938-4939) has been deduced to be that of the thiosulfonate of CoA, i.e. coenzyme A disulfide-S,S-dioxide. This deduction is based on several considerations among which are: the cleavage of o-CoAS2 by dithiothreitol under anaerobic conditions to equimolar amounts of CoASH and CoASO2H; the alkali-catalyzed dismutation of 3 mol of o-CoAS2 to 4 mol of CoASO2H and 1 mol of CoA disulfide; and comparison of the 13C-NMR spectra of CoA disulfide and o-CoAS2. The results of studies with Clostridial phosphotransacetylase (EC 2.3.1.8) and pigeon muscle carnitine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7) were consistent with the action of o-CoAS2 as a CoA affinity analog on these enzymes. Inactivation was characterized by what appeared to be disulfide bonding between CoA and important sulfhydryl groups of the proteins."

Hypertonic preincubation also induces resistance to the inhibitory action of the drugs dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, but not to the action of NaF or the inhibitors of polypeptide chain elongation, emetine and cycloheximide. Induction is independent of the solute used to make the induction medium hypertonic and is not mediated by an elevated intracellular Na+ concentration. In a separate series of experiments, it was determined that the formation of functional methionyl-tRNAf.40 S ribosomal complexes is not impaired by exposure of uninduced cells to hypertonic growth medium. The combined results are evaluated with respect to the mechanism of action of hypertonic growth medium in the inhibition of polypeptide chain initiation and the adaptive mechanisms that animal cells have evolved to deal with alterations in their extracellular environments."
