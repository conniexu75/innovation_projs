https://openalex.org/W4206135665,"Abstract The recent emergence of B.1.1.529, the Omicron variant 1,2 , has raised concerns of escape from protection by vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. A key test for potential countermeasures against B.1.1.529 is their activity in preclinical rodent models of respiratory tract disease. Here, using the collaborative network of the SARS-CoV-2 Assessment of Viral Evolution (SAVE) programme of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), we evaluated the ability of several B.1.1.529 isolates to cause infection and disease in immunocompetent and human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing mice and hamsters. Despite modelling data indicating that B.1.1.529 spike can bind more avidly to mouse ACE2 (refs. 3,4 ), we observed less infection by B.1.1.529 in 129, C57BL/6, BALB/c and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice than by previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, with limited weight loss and lower viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. In wild-type and hACE2 transgenic hamsters, lung infection, clinical disease and pathology with B.1.1.529 were also milder than with historical isolates or other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Overall, experiments from the SAVE/NIAID network with several B.1.1.529 isolates demonstrate attenuated lung disease in rodents, which parallels preliminary human clinical data."
https://openalex.org/W4206997616,"The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in November 2021 and is rapidly spreading among the human population1. Although recent reports reveal that the Omicron variant robustly escapes vaccine-associated and therapeutic neutralization antibodies2–10, the pathogenicity of the virus remains unknown. Here we show that the replication of Omicron is substantially attenuated in human Calu3 and Caco2 cells. Further mechanistic investigations reveal that Omicron is inefficient in its use of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-001a) and previous variants, which may explain its reduced replication in Calu3 and Caco2 cells. The replication of Omicron is markedly attenuated in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of infected K18-hACE2 mice compared with that of the wild-type strain and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, resulting in its substantially ameliorated lung pathology. Compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (1.351) and Delta variants, infection by Omicron causes the lowest reduction in body weight and the lowest mortality rate. Overall, our study demonstrates that the replication and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in mice is attenuated compared with the wild-type strain and other variants. The replication and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is attenuated compared with the original strain and other variants."
https://openalex.org/W4226057452,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive lesion that is thought to be a precursor to invasive breast cancer (IBC). To understand the changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) accompanying transition to IBC, we used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) and a 37-plex antibody staining panel to interrogate 79 clinically annotated surgical resections using machine learning tools for cell segmentation, pixel-based clustering, and object morphometrics. Comparison of normal breast with patient-matched DCIS and IBC revealed coordinated transitions between four TME states that were delineated based on the location and function of myoepithelium, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Surprisingly, myoepithelial disruption was more advanced in DCIS patients that did not develop IBC, suggesting this process could be protective against recurrence. Taken together, this HTAN Breast PreCancer Atlas study offers insight into drivers of IBC relapse and emphasizes the importance of the TME in regulating these processes."

To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we combined an engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase (APEX) approach with quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) followed by proximity ligation assay (PLA) to characterize Tau interactomes modified by neuronal activity and mutations that cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We established interactions of Tau with presynaptic vesicle proteins during activity-dependent Tau secretion and mapped the Tau-binding sites to the cytosolic domains of integral synaptic vesicle proteins. We showed that FTD mutations impair bioenergetics and markedly diminished Tau's interaction with mitochondria proteins, which were downregulated in AD brains of multiple cohorts and correlated with disease severity. These multimodal and dynamic Tau interactomes with exquisite spatial resolution shed light on Tau's role in neuronal function and disease and highlight potential therapeutic targets to block Tau-mediated pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4206361954,"Brain metastasis (BrM) is the most common form of brain cancer, characterized by neurologic disability and an abysmal prognosis. Unfortunately, our understanding of the biology underlying human BrMs remains rudimentary. Here, we present an integrative analysis of >100,000 malignant and non-malignant cells from 15 human parenchymal BrMs, generated by single-cell transcriptomics, mass cytometry, and complemented with mouse model- and in silico approaches. We interrogated the composition of BrM niches, molecularly defined the blood-tumor interface, and revealed stromal immunosuppressive states enriched with infiltrated T cells and macrophages. Specific single-cell interrogation of metastatic tumor cells provides a framework of 8 functional cell programs that coexist or anticorrelate. Collectively, these programs delineate two functional BrM archetypes, one proliferative and the other inflammatory, that are evidently shaped through tumor-immune interactions. Our resource provides a foundation to understand the molecular basis of BrM in patients with tumor cell-intrinsic and host environmental traits."
https://openalex.org/W4205569118,"We present a whole-cell fully dynamical kinetic model (WCM) of JCVI-syn3A, a minimal cell with a reduced genome of 493 genes that has retained few regulatory proteins or small RNAs. Cryo-electron tomograms provide the cell geometry and ribosome distributions. Time-dependent behaviors of concentrations and reaction fluxes from stochastic-deterministic simulations over a cell cycle reveal how the cell balances demands of its metabolism, genetic information processes, and growth, and offer insight into the principles of life for this minimal cell. The energy economy of each process including active transport of amino acids, nucleosides, and ions is analyzed. WCM reveals how emergent imbalances lead to slowdowns in the rates of transcription and translation. Integration of experimental data is critical in building a kinetic model from which emerges a genome-wide distribution of mRNA half-lives, multiple DNA replication events that can be compared to qPCR results, and the experimentally observed doubling behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4220988819,"Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway essential for neuronal health and function. Autophagosome biogenesis occurs at synapses, is locally regulated, and increases in response to neuronal activity. The mechanisms that couple autophagosome biogenesis to synaptic activity remain unknown. In this study, we determine that trafficking of ATG-9, the only transmembrane protein in the core autophagy pathway, links the synaptic vesicle cycle with autophagy. ATG-9-positive vesicles in C. elegans are generated from the trans-Golgi network via AP-3-dependent budding and delivered to presynaptic sites. At presynaptic sites, ATG-9 undergoes exo-endocytosis in an activity-dependent manner. Mutations that disrupt endocytosis, including a lesion in synaptojanin 1 associated with Parkinson's disease, result in abnormal ATG-9 accumulation at clathrin-rich synaptic foci and defects in activity-induced presynaptic autophagy. Our findings uncover regulated key steps of ATG-9 trafficking at presynaptic sites and provide evidence that ATG-9 exo-endocytosis couples autophagosome biogenesis at presynaptic sites with the activity-dependent synaptic vesicle cycle."
https://openalex.org/W4207083621,"Sex hormones exert a profound influence on gendered behaviors. How individual sex hormone-responsive neuronal populations regulate diverse sex-typical behaviors is unclear. We performed orthogonal, genetically targeted sequencing of four estrogen receptor 1-expressing (Esr1+) populations and identified 1,415 genes expressed differentially between sexes or estrous states. Unique subsets of these genes were distributed across all 137 transcriptomically defined Esr1+ cell types, including estrous stage-specific ones, that comprise the four populations. We used differentially expressed genes labeling single Esr1+ cell types as entry points to functionally characterize two such cell types, BNSTprTac1/Esr1 and VMHvlCckar/Esr1. We observed that these two cell types, but not the other Esr1+ cell types in these populations, are essential for sex recognition in males and mating in females, respectively. Furthermore, VMHvlCckar/Esr1 cell type projections are distinct from those of other VMHvlEsr1 cell types. Together, projection and functional specialization of dimorphic cell types enables sex hormone-responsive populations to regulate diverse social behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4226308686,"The role of postnatal experience in sculpting cortical circuitry, while long appreciated, is poorly understood at the level of cell types. We explore this in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, visual deprivation, genetics, and functional imaging. We find that vision selectively drives the specification of glutamatergic cell types in upper layers (L) (L2/3/4), while deeper-layer glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types are established prior to eye opening. L2/3 cell types form an experience-dependent spatial continuum defined by the graded expression of ∼200 genes, including regulators of cell adhesion and synapse formation. One of these genes, Igsf9b, a vision-dependent gene encoding an inhibitory synaptic cell adhesion molecule, is required for the normal development of binocular responses in L2/3. In summary, vision preferentially regulates the development of upper-layer glutamatergic cell types through the regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression programs."
https://openalex.org/W4206907877,"Host microbiota crosstalk is essential for the production and functional modulation of blood-cell lineages. Whether, and if so how, the microbiota influences hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is unclear. Here, we show that the microbiota regulates HSC self-renewal and differentiation under stress conditions by modulating local iron availability in the bone marrow (BM). In microbiota-depleted mice, HSC self-renewal was enhanced during regeneration, while the commitment toward differentiation was dramatically compromised. Mechanistically, microbiota depletion selectively impaired the recycling of red blood cells (RBCs) by BM macrophages, resulting in reduced local iron levels without affecting systemic iron homeostasis. Limiting iron availability in food (in vivo) or in culture (ex vivo), or by CD169+ macrophage depletion, enhanced HSC self-renewal and expansion. These results reveal an intricate interplay between the microbiota, macrophages, and iron, and their essential roles in regulating critical HSC fate decisions under stress."
https://openalex.org/W4225443882,"The UK began delivering its COVID-19 vaccination programme on 8 December 2020, with health and social care workers (H&SCWs) given high priority for vaccination. Despite well-documented occupational exposure risks, however, there is evidence of lower uptake among some H&SCW groups.We used a mixed-methods approach-involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews-to gain insight into COVID-19 vaccination beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours amongst H&SCWs in the UK by socio-demographic and employment variables. 1917 people were surveyed- 1656 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 261 social care workers (SCWs). Twenty participants were interviewed.Workplace factors contributed to vaccination access and uptake. SCWs were more likely to not be offered COVID-19 vaccination than HCWs (OR:1.453, 95%CI: 1.244-1.696). SCWs specifically reported uncertainties around how to access COVID-19 vaccination. Participants who indicated stronger agreement with the statement 'I would recommend my organisation as a place to work' were more likely to have been offered COVID-19 vaccination (OR:1.285, 95%CI: 1.056-1.563). Those who agreed more strongly with the statement 'I feel/felt under pressure from my employer to get a COVID-19 vaccine' were more likely to have declined vaccination (OR:1.751, 95%CI: 1.271-2.413). Interviewees that experienced employer pressure to get vaccinated felt this exacerbated their vaccine concerns and increased distrust. In comparison to White British and White Irish participants, Black African and Mixed Black African participants were more likely to not be offered (OR:2.011, 95%CI: 1.026-3.943) and more likely to have declined COVID-19 vaccination (OR:5.550, 95%CI: 2.294-13.428). Reasons for declining vaccination among Black African participants included distrust in COVID-19 vaccination, healthcare providers, and policymakers.H&SCW employers are in a pivotal position to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination access, by ensuring staff are aware of how to get vaccinated and promoting a workplace environment in which vaccination decisions are informed and voluntary."
https://openalex.org/W4205298217,"When an animal faces a threatening situation while asleep, rapid arousal is the essential prerequisite for an adequate response. Here, we find that predator stimuli induce immediate arousal from REM sleep compared with NREM sleep. Using in vivo neural activity recording and cell-type-specific manipulations, we identify neurons in the medial subthalamic nucleus (mSTN) expressing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that mediate arousal and defensive responses to acute predator threats received through multiple sensory modalities across REM sleep and wakefulness. We observe involvement of the same neurons in the normal regulation of REM sleep and the adaptive increase in REM sleep induced by sustained predator stress. Projections to the lateral globus pallidus (LGP) are the effector pathway for the threat-coping responses and REM-sleep expression. Together, our findings suggest adaptive REM-sleep responses could be protective against threats and uncover a critical component of the neural circuitry at their basis."
https://openalex.org/W4206994067,"New strategies are needed to predict and overcome metastatic progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer. One potential clinical target is the stem cell transcription factor SOX2, which has a critical role in prostate development and cancer. We thus investigated the impact of SOX2 expression on patient outcomes and its function within prostate cancer cells. Analyses of SOX2 expression among a case-control cohort of 1028 annotated tumor specimens demonstrated that SOX2 expression confers a more rapid time to metastasis and decreased patient survival after biochemical recurrence. SOX2 ChIP-Seq analyses revealed SOX2-binding sites within prostate cancer cells which differ significantly from canonical embryonic SOX2 gene targets, and prostate-specific SOX2 gene targets are associated with multiple oncogenic pathways. Interestingly, phenotypic and gene expression analyses after CRISPR-mediated deletion of SOX2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, as well as ectopic SOX2 expression in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, demonstrated that SOX2 promotes changes in multiple metabolic pathways and metabolites. SOX2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines confers increased glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, as well as increased basal and maximal oxidative respiration and increased spare respiratory capacity. Further, SOX2 expression was associated with increased quantities of mitochondria, and metabolomic analyses revealed SOX2-associated changes in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, amino acids and sugars, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Analyses of SOX2 gene targets with central functions metabolism (CERK, ECHS1, HS6SDT1, LPCAT4, PFKP, SLC16A3, SLC46A1, and TST) document significant expression correlation with SOX2 among RNA-Seq datasets derived from patient tumors and metastases. These data support a key role for SOX2 in metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells and reveal new mechanisms to understand how SOX2 enables metastatic progression, lineage plasticity, and therapy resistance. Further, our data suggest clinical opportunities to exploit SOX2 as a biomarker for staging and imaging, as well as a potential pharmacologic target."
https://openalex.org/W4205231283,"A major barrier to successful pancreatic cancer (PC) treatment is the surrounding stroma, which secretes growth factors/cytokines that promote PC progression. Wnt and tenascin C (TnC) are key ligands secreted by stromal pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) that then act on PC cells in a paracrine manner to activate the oncogenic β-catenin and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways. Therefore, therapies targeting oncogenic Wnt/TnC cross talk between PC cells and PSCs constitute a promising new therapeutic approach for PC treatment. The metastasis suppressor N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1) inhibits tumor progression and metastasis in numerous cancers, including PC. We demonstrate herein that targeting NDRG1 using the clinically trialed anticancer agent di-2-pyridylketone-4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC) inhibited Wnt/TnC-mediated interactions between PC cells and the surrounding PSCs. Mechanistically, NDRG1 and DpC markedly inhibit secretion of Wnt3a and TnC by PSCs, while also attenuating Wnt/β-catenin and YAP/TAZ activation and downstream signaling in PC cells. This antioncogenic activity was mediated by direct inhibition of β-catenin and YAP/TAZ nuclear localization and by increasing the Wnt inhibitor, DKK1. Expression of NDRG1 also inhibited transforming growth factor (TGF)-β secretion by PC cells, a key mechanism by which PC cells activate PSCs. Using an in vivo orthotopic PC mouse model, we show DpC downregulated β-catenin, TnC, and YAP/TAZ, while potently increasing NDRG1 expression in PC tumors. We conclude that NDRG1 and DpC inhibit Wnt/TnC-mediated interactions between PC cells and PSCs. These results further illuminate the antioncogenic mechanism of NDRG1 and the potential of targeting this metastasis suppressor to overcome the oncogenic effects of the PC-PSC interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4205544482,"The present study is aimed at enhancing the solubility of rosuvastatin (RST) by designing betacyclodextrin/polyvinypyrrolidone-co-poly (2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulphonic acid) crosslinked hydrophilic nanogels in the presence of crosslinker methylene bisacrylamide through free-radical polymerization method. Various formulations were fabricated by blending different amounts of betacyclodextrin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulphonic acid, and methylene bisacrylamide. The developed chemically crosslinked nanogels were characterized by FTIR, SEM, PXRD, TGA, DSC, sol-gel analysis, zeta size, micromeritics properties, drug loading percentage, swelling, solubility, and release studies. The FTIR spectrum depicts the leading peaks of resultant functional groups of blended constituents while a fluffy and porous structure was observed through SEM images. Remarkable reduction in crystallinity of RST in developed nanogels revealed by PXRD. TGA and DSC demonstrate the good thermal stability of nanogels. The size analysis depicts the particle size of the developed nanogels in the range of 178.5 ±3.14 nm. Drug loading percentage, swelling, solubility, and release studies revealed high drug loading, solubilization, swelling, and drug release patterns at 6.8 pH paralleled to 1.2 pH. In vivo experiments on developed nanogels in comparison to marketed brands were examined and better results regarding pharmacokinetic parameters were observed. The compatibility and non-toxicity of fabricated nanogels to biological systems was supported by a toxicity study that was conducted on rabbits. Efficient fabrication, excellent physicochemical properties, improved dissolution, high solubilization, and nontoxic nanogels might be a capable approach for the oral administration of poorly water-soluble drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4206660061,"Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), a crucial enzyme in energy metabolism, captures the redox potential energy from NADH oxidation/ubiquinone reduction to create the proton motive force used to drive ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation. High-resolution single-particle electron cryo-EM analyses have provided detailed structural knowledge of the catalytic machinery of complex I, but not of the molecular principles of its energy transduction mechanism. Although ubiquinone is considered to bind in a long channel at the interface of the membrane-embedded and hydrophilic domains, with channel residues likely involved in coupling substrate reduction to proton translocation, no structures with the channel fully occupied have yet been described. Here, we report the structure (determined by cryo-EM) of mouse complex I with a tight-binding natural product acetogenin inhibitor, which resembles the native substrate, bound along the full length of the expected ubiquinone-binding channel. Our structure reveals the mode of acetogenin binding and the molecular basis for structure-activity relationships within the acetogenin family. It also shows that acetogenins are such potent inhibitors because they are highly hydrophobic molecules that contain two specific hydrophilic moieties spaced to lock into two hydrophilic regions of the otherwise hydrophobic channel. The central hydrophilic section of the channel does not favor binding of the isoprenoid chain when the native substrate is fully bound but stabilizes the ubiquinone/ubiquinol headgroup as it transits to/from the active site. Therefore, the amphipathic nature of the channel supports both tight binding of the amphipathic inhibitor and rapid exchange of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol substrate and product."
https://openalex.org/W4205515994,"Locomotion is a complex behavior required for animal survival. Vertebrate locomotion depends on spinal interneurons termed the central pattern generator (CPG), which generates activity responsible for the alternation of flexor and extensor muscles and the left and right side of the body. It is unknown whether multiple or a single neuronal type is responsible for the control of mammalian locomotion. Here, we show that ventral spinocerebellar tract neurons (VSCTs) drive generation and maintenance of locomotor behavior in neonatal and adult mice. Using mouse genetics, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VSCTs exhibit rhythmogenic properties and neuronal circuit connectivity consistent with their essential role in the locomotor CPG. Importantly, optogenetic activation and chemogenetic silencing reveals that VSCTs are necessary and sufficient for locomotion. These findings identify VSCTs as critical components for mammalian locomotion and provide a paradigm shift in our understanding of neural control of complex behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4205264786,"Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is an innate sensor of influenza A virus (IAV) that participates in IAV-induced programmed cell death. Nevertheless, little is known about the upstream signaling pathways regulating ZBP1. We found that a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, TRIM34, interacted with ZBP1 to promote its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Using a series of genetic approaches, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence indicating that IAV triggered cell death and inflammatory responses via dependent on TRIM34/ZBP1 interaction. TRIM34 and ZBP1 expression and interaction protected mice from death during IAV infection owing to reduced inflammatory responses and epithelial damage. Additionally, analysis of clinical samples revealed that TRIM34 associates with ZBP1 and mediates ZBP1 polyubiquitination in vivo. Higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines correlated with higher levels of ZBP1 in IAV-infected patients. Taken together, we conclude that TRIM34 serves as a critical regulator of IAV-induced programmed cell death by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination of ZBP1."
https://openalex.org/W4206595592,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic trait that can cause hemolytic anemia. To date, over 150 nonsynonymous mutations have been identified in G6PD, with pathogenic mutations clustering near the dimer and/or tetramer interface and the allosteric NADP+-binding site. Recently, our lab identified a small molecule that activates G6PD variants by stabilizing the allosteric NADP+ and dimer complex, suggesting therapeutics that target these regions may improve structural defects. Here, we elucidated the connection between allosteric NADP+ binding, oligomerization, and pathogenicity to determine whether oligomer stabilization can be used as a therapeutic strategy for G6PD deficiency (G6PDdef). We first solved the crystal structure for G6PDK403Q, a mutant that mimics the physiological acetylation of wild-type G6PD in erythrocytes and demonstrated that loss of allosteric NADP+ binding induces conformational changes in the dimer. These structural changes prevent tetramerization, are unique to Class I variants (the most severe form of G6PDdef), and cause the deactivation and destabilization of G6PD. We also introduced nonnative cysteines at the oligomer interfaces and found that the tetramer complex is more catalytically active and stable than the dimer. Furthermore, stabilizing the dimer and tetramer improved protein stability in clinical variants, regardless of clinical classification, with tetramerization also improving the activity of G6PDK403Q and Class I variants. These findings were validated using enzyme activity and thermostability assays, analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and SEC coupled with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS).

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a housekeeping enzyme that generates NADPH. The NADPH produced by G6PD provides the cell with reductive power and is essential for the regeneration of oxidized glutathione—reduced NADPH levels cause redox imbalance (1Stanton R.C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADPH, and cell survival.IUBMB Life. 2012; 64: 362-369Google Scholar). Due to G6PDs essential role in cell metabolism, other enzymes can compensate for loss of G6PD function. However, G6PD is the primary source of NADPH in erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBCs). Consequently, loss of G6PD function renders erythrocytes vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and can cause hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency (G6PDdef) is a genetic trait present in ∼400 million people worldwide (2Nkhoma E.T. Poole C. Vannappagari V. Hall S.A. Beutler E. The global prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: A systematic review and meta-analysis.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2009; 42: 267-278Google Scholar). To date, over 150 unique nonsynonymous mutations have been identified in the G6PD gene (3Beutler E. Vulliamy T.J. Hematologically important mutations: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2002; 28: 93-103Google Scholar). Because each mutation is unique, they can have different effects on G6PD function and can cause varying severities of hemolytic anemia, and the World Health Organization (WHO) established a classification system for G6PDdef. Classifications are based on clinical outcome and residual G6PD activity in RBCs: Class I < 10% G6PD activity with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, Class II < 10% G6PD activity with intermittent hemolytic anemia, Class III 10 to 60% G6PD activity with hemolytic anemia after exposure to oxidative stress, and Class IV > 60% G6PD activity and are asymptomatic (4WHO Working GroupGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.Bull.

Tech. Rep. Ser. 1967; 366: 1-53Google Scholar). Although Class I variants are the most severe, they are relatively rare and are often reported in single clinical case studies. Their low allele frequency is likely the result of G6PDs essential role in development; knockdown of G6PD in mice is embryonic lethal (6Longo L. Vanegas O.C. Patel M. Rosti V. Li H. Waka J. Merghoub T. Pandolfi P.P. Notaro R. Manova K. Luzzatto L. Maternally transmitted severe glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an embryonic lethal.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4229-4239Google Scholar). In contrast, Class II and III variants are more common; however, they are generally asymptomatic when following strict dietary and drug restrictions (7Howes R.E. Piel F.B. Patil A.P. Nyangiri O.A.

Currently, blood transfusions remain the only treatment for an acute hemolytic event, and there are no therapeutics for the treatment of G6PDdef (8Garcia A.A. Koperniku A. Ferreira J.C.B.

G6PD exists as a monomer, homodimer, and homotetramer, with each monomer having three binding sites: one for catalytic glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), one for an NADP+ cofactor, and an allosteric NADP+-binding site. The latter allosteric NADP+-binding site, also known as the structural NADP+-binding site, is important for maintaining long-term protein stability and for promoting oligomer assembly (9Bonsignore A.

Regulation of G6PD acetylation by SIRT2 and KAT9 modulates NADPH homeostasis and cell survival during oxidative stress.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 1304-1320Google Scholar). Oligomerization is central to G6PD function as it controls the activity of G6PD; the monomer is inactive with both the dimer and tetramer being the active forms. These properties are essential for normal G6PD function and loss of structural NADP+ binding and oligomerization cause pathogenicity: Class I variants cluster at the dimer interface and the structural NADP+-binding site, and Class II variants cluster at the tetramer interface (13Cunningham A.

Structural analysis of clinically relevant pathogenic G6PD variants reveals the importance of tetramerization for G6PD activity.Matters. 2017; 3e201705000008Google Scholar). Despite oligomerization being critical for G6PD activity, it has remained unclear if there are catalytic differences between dimeric and tetrameric G6PD since activity assays utilize NADP+ and G6P, both of which alter the oligomeric state of G6PD (15Cohen P. Rosemeyer M.A. Subunit interactions of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 8-15Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that there are catalytic differences between the dimer and tetramer, as locking G6PD in the tetrameric state allowed for the first direct biochemical comparison; tetrameric G6PD had improved catalytic efficiency over dimeric G6PD (16Ranzani A.T. Cordeiro A.T. Mutations in the tetramer interface of human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reveals kinetic differences between oligomeric states.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591: 1278-1284Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the oligomeric state is rarely assessed in patient samples. The only known study to do so was by Mizukawa et al. (17Mizukawa B. George A. Pushkaran S. Weckbach L. Kalinyak K. Heubi J.E. Kalfa T.A. Cooperating G6PD mutations associated with severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis.Pediatr. Blood Cancer. 2011; 56: 840-842Google Scholar) they performed native PAGE on human red blood cell lysate and found that the predominant species for wild-type G6PD, G6PDWT, are tetramers, followed by dimers, and then monomers. Furthermore, they showed that homo-oligomerization was significantly reduced in patient samples harboring clinical mutations. Our lab identified a small-molecule activator (AG1) of G6PD, which improves the activity and stability of several Class II and III G6PD clinical variants via stabilization of structural NADP+ and the dimer (18Hwang S. Mruk K. Rahighi S. Raub A.G. Chen C.-H. Dorn L.E. Horikoshi N. Wakatsuki S. Chen J.K. Mochly-Rosen D. Correcting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency with a small-molecule activator.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4045Google Scholar, 19Raub A. Hwang S. Horikoshi N. Cunningham A. Rahighi S. Wakatsuki S. Mochly-Rosen D. Small-molecule activators of glucose-6-phosephate dehydrogenase (G6PD) bridging the dimer interface.ChemMedChem. 2019; 14: 1321-1324Google Scholar). These findings suggest that stabilization of oligomerization or NADP+ binding can restore enzyme function. Here, we investigate loss of structural NADP+ binding, its contribution to oligomerization and pathogenic outcome, and whether stabilization of distinct oligomeric forms can be used as therapeutic strategy for treating G6PDdef. Structurally, lysine 403 (K403), forms an important contact with a phosphate group of the structural NADP+ (Fig. 1A), and studies by Wang et al. (12Wang Y.-P. Zhou L.-S. Zhao Y.-Z. Wang S.-W. Chen L.-L. Liu L.-X. Ling Z.-Q. Hu F.-J. Sun Y.-P. Zhang J.-Y. Yang C. Yang Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.-L. Ye D. Regulation of G6PD acetylation by SIRT2 and KAT9 modulates NADPH homeostasis and cell survival during oxidative stress.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 1304-1320Google Scholar) revealed that K403 is acetylated in RBCs under physiological conditions. Mutation of K403 to glutamine (K403Q) mimics acetylation, with both acetylation and K403Q disrupting oligomerization and G6PD activity in cells. To understand how loss of structural NADP+ binding affects G6PD oligomerization in both a pathological and a physiological context, we generated G6PDK403Q for in vitro characterization. To assess the oligomeric state of G6PD, analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used, and a buffer condition where monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric species could be observed for G6PDWT was selected: 500 nM G6PD, 80 mM sodium phosphate (NaP) (pH 8.0). The enzymes used in subsequent assays were expressed and purified as indicated in the Experimental procedures section. In the presence of 80 mM NaP (pH 8.0), G6PDWT consisted of approximately 25% tetramer, 40% dimer, and 22% monomer, with each species clearly defined (Figs. 1B and S1A, % numbers expressed in monomer equivalent throughout this manuscript). Under the same condition, no G6PDK403Q tetramer was observed (Figs. 1B and S1B). Instead, 74% of G6PDK403Q existed as a dimer, with no change in the percentage of monomer. Interestingly, an intermediate species was detected between the dimer and monomer peaks of G6PDWT; however, the intermediate was not detected for G6PDK403Q. This intermediate is likely the result of a dynamic dimer–monomer equilibrium, with intermediate SEC species reported for G6PD (20Wang X.-T. Chan T.F. Lam V.M.S. Engel P.C. What is the role of the second “structural” NADP+-binding site in human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase?.Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1403-1411Google Scholar). When incubating G6PDWT with 10 μM NADP+, NADP+ did not alter the relative percentage of tetramer; however, it slightly increased the dimer (∼8%), resulting in a subsequent reduction of the monomer (Figs. 1C and S1C). Additionally, the monomer migrated through the column faster, as indicated by a slight shift in the monomer elution volume, from 10.5 ml to 10.25 ml. In contrast, NADP+ had no effect on G6PDK403Q oligomerization (Figs. 1D and S1D); there were no changes in the distribution of species and no changes in location of peaks, which is consistent with the inability of G6PDK403Q to bind structural NADP+. When incubating G6PDWT and G6PDK403Q in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM G6P, conditions that should dissociate the dimer (10Wrigley N.G. Heather J.V. Human erythrocyte glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase: Electron microscope studies on structure and interconversion of tetramers, dimers and monomers.J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 483-499Google Scholar), G6PDWT oligomerization was severely impacted; the percentages of tetramers and dimers were both reduced, while the percentages of intermediate species and monomers increased (Figs. 1E and S1E). In contrast, G6PDK403Q had minor changes in the relative distribution of oligomers (Figs. 1E and S1F). Since differences in G6P binding may explain why G6PDWT oligomerization was severely impacted but not G6PDK403Q, we removed G6P. In the absence of G6P, we still observed major differences in the G6PDWT oligomeric distribution; a 16% reduction in the tetramer, a 15% reduction in dimer, and a 34% increase in monomer (Fig. S1G). Therefore, changes in the buffer composition alone affect the quaternary structure for G6PDWT, but not for G6PDK403Q. The fact that G6PDWT had an increase in the relative percentage of monomers but G6PDK403Q did not suggests that the G6PDK403Q dimer has a higher binding affinity than G6PDWT in this condition, and loss of structural NADP+ binding favors the dimeric state. With the G6PDK403Q dimer less prone to dissociation, it should have a higher propensity to form a tetramer; however, lack of tetramer formation suggests that although the dimer is present, loss of structural NADP+ binding may induce allosteric changes that prevent the tetramer from forming. Using partial native PAGE (P-Native PAGE), described in previous work (18Hwang S. Mruk K. Rahighi S. Raub A.G. Chen C.-H. Dorn L.E. Horikoshi N. Wakatsuki S. Chen J.K. Mochly-Rosen D. Correcting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency with a small-molecule activator.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4045Google Scholar), differences between the G6PDWT and G6PDK403Q dimer were observed. Consistent with our SEC data, G6PDWT was more prone to monomer–monomer dissociation, as observed by the presence of more monomeric G6PD (Fig. 1, F and G). However, unlike SEC, three bands were observed near the expected molecular weight (MW) of the G6PD dimer (116 kDa), and major differences between G6PDWT and G6PDK403Q were observed; the G6PDK403Q dimer had a higher apparent MW than the G6PDWT dimer. To validate differences observed on P-Native PAGE were due to inherent differences in the dimer, G6PDWT and G6PDK403Q were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and no differences between the monomer MW were detected, confirming that MW differences were due to differences in mobility (Fig. 1H). Interestingly, although G6PDK403Q forms a dimer that is less prone to dissociation, it is inactive and thermally unstable (Fig. 1, I and J). Loss of activity can be explained by loss of catalytic NADP+ and/or G6P binding as the Michalis–Menten equation could not reproducibly fit our data (Km > 1 mM) with maximum substrate concentrations reaching 1 mM G6P and NADP+. Given that activity, thermostability, and amino acid location correlate with the clinical severity of G6PD variants (13Cunningham A. Colavin A. Huang K.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Coupling between protein stability and catalytic activity determines pathogenicity of G6PD variants.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 2592-2599Google Scholar), G6PDK403Q likely mimics a Class I variant—low activity, low thermostability, and located at the structural NADP+-binding site. Like G6PDK403Q, multiple Class I pathogenic mutations exist near the structural NADP+-binding site. To confirm that G6PDK403Q is representative of a Class I mutant, three clinical Class I variants were examined (Fig. 2A): G6PDP396L, G6PDR393H, and G6PDK238R, with G6PDK238 and G6PDR393H forming direct contacts with the structural NADP+. Like G6PDK403Q, Class I variants at the structural NADP+-binding site have impaired NADP+ binding (Fig. 2B); the monomer peak of the SEC chromatogram displayed a well-defined peak at 10.5 ml in the presence of 10 μM NADP+. Additionally, the dimer was less prone to dissociation, formed a dimer, which migrates slower on P-Native PAGE, could not form a tetramer, and had reduced catalytic activity (Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, for G6PDK238R, although the activity is compromised, it maintained 34% activity, whereas G6PDP396L, G6PDR393H, and G6PDK403Q were catalytically inactive. Additionally, the G6PDK238R dimer dissociated to a greater extent and formed less of the top dimer species. G6PDK238R may retain activity due to the nature of the amino acid substitution; lysine and arginine have a similar size and positive charge. This may reduce, but not eliminate, structural NADP+ binding. To understand if other Class I mutations, where the mutation is distant from the structural NADP+-binding site, exhibit the same features, three additional Class I mutations, G6PDF216L, G6PDE274K, G6PDK275N, distant from the structural NADP+-binding site were generated (Fig. 2E). Like mutations located at the structural NADP+-binding site, G6PDF216L, G6PDE274K, G6PDK275N displayed properties like G6PDK403Q (Fig. 2, F–H). This suggests that mutations at the dimer and/or tetramer interface, with G6PDF216L connecting to the dimer interface while G6PDE274K and G6PDK275N are located at the tetramer interface, can induce allosteric changes, which cause loss of structural NADP+ binding and formation of a dysfunctional dimer. It is likely all variants that exhibit these allosteric changes result in the most severe G6PDdef. To confirm whether the altered biochemical and biophysical properties of G6PDK403Q were the result of changes in protein structure, we solved the crystal structure of G6PDK403Q (PDB 7SEI) at 3.65-Å resolution and observed significant structural changes (Figs. 3 and S2). Firstly, and consistent with our hypothesis, the mutation of lysine to glutamine disrupted structural NADP+ binding—no density was observed for structural NADP+. Additionally, no density was observed for the ßM and ßN strands of the structural NADP+-binding site (shown in black on G6PDWT in Fig. 3A), which caused major changes in the globular structure of the dimer (Fig. 3, A and B and Movies S1 and S2, white to salmon). Secondly, major alterations were observed in the αf-helix; the αf-helix was extended, causing a loop to protrude into the G6P-binding pocket (Fig. S2C and Movie S3). Interestingly, electron density for the catalytic NADP+ was observed (Fig. S2, A and B); though, loss of G6P binding inhibits its conversion. These findings are consistent with recently solved structures of several G6PD Class I variants (21Al-Ali A.K. Pyridine nucleotide redox potential in erythrocytes of Saudi subjects with sickle cell disease.Acta Haematol. 2002; 108: 19-22Google Scholar), suggesting that Class I variants and posttranslational modifications located at the structural NADP+-binding site share a similar structural defect and that a dysfunctional dimer may be a means to regulate G6PDWT activity. It should be noted that the resolution of G6PDK403Q is relatively low, 3.65-Å, with the crystallographic structure having high B-factors. However, we have previously characterized five other Class I and Class I-like dimer structures of G6PD, all having mid to poor resolution with high B-factors, with 6VAQ having the highest resolution—2.95-Å. All of these structures share the same dimer and structural features, which are distinct from the G6PDWT dimer. To understand how structural changes in the dimer impact tetramerization, a hypothetical G6PDK403Q tetramer was generated by reflecting a biological G6PDK403Q dimer along the axis of symmetry, and the G6PDK403Q tetramer was compared with the G6PDWT tetramer (Fig. 3, C and D and Movie S4). Normally, the G6PDWT tetramer interface is stabilized by several salt-bridge interactions: (1) salt bridges between K290 of one monomer and E287 of another monomer stabilize opposing αj-helices across the tetramer interface (Fig. 3E). (2) K275, a residue extending from the αj-helix, forms a salt-bridge with E347, which is located on a ß-sheet loop extending across the tetramer interface on an opposing monomer (Fig. 3G). However, in G6PDK403Q, the αj-helix is shifted, preventing K290/E287 and E347/K275 salt bridges from forming, explaining loss of tetramerization (Fig. 3, F and H and Movies S5 and S6). Since G6PDK403Q and Class I variants could not form a tetramer, we aimed to understand how the tetramer contributes to enzymatic activity and stability. To do this, we made synthetic mutants favoring distinct oligomeric states. Nonnative cysteines were introduced at either the dimer or tetramer interface to cross-link G6PD oligomers together. For generation of the dimer-locked (dL) synthetic mutant, a cysteine was added to the C-terminal end; the C-terminal tail of monomer-1 faces the C-terminal tail of monomer-2 at the dimer interface (Fig. 4A). In theory, a disulfide bond would bridge monomer-1 to monomer-2. Indeed, this was the case as the G6PDWTdL monomer was not present on P-Native PAGE following cross-linking and did not dissociate to a monomer on SEC in monomer conditions (Fig. 4, B and C). To generate synthetic mutants stabilized in or inhibited from being in the tetrameric state, we followed work done by Ranzani et al. (16Ranzani A.T. Cordeiro A.T. Mutations in the tetramer interface of human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reveals kinetic differences between oligomeric states.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591: 1278-1284Google Scholar); we mutated an alanine to a cysteine (G6PDA277C)—to form a disulfide bond across the tetramer interface, and we disrupted a salt bridge between E347 and K275 across the tetramer interface (G6PDE347A)—to prevent tetramerization (Fig. 4D). These mutations are effective due to each disulfide bond pair being multiplied by 4 in the tetramer interface. Consistent with findings by Ranzani et al., the G6PDA277C mutant forms a stable tetramer that does not dissociate when subjected to monomer conditions (Fig. 4, E and F). Additionally, the G6PDE347A mutant does not form a tetramer when placed in conditions favoring tetramer formation; low pH, ionic strength, with addition of NADP+ and MgCl2 (Fig. 4, E and G). These mutations did not modify the biophysical properties of the dimer, as G6PDE347A and G6PDA277C behaved similarly to G6PDWT; P-Native PAGE results show that ∼70% of G6PDWT and G6PDA277C was in monomeric form (Fig. 4H). Interestingly, G6PDE347A had a slight increase in dimer dissociation, ∼80% in the monomeric form, suggesting that the tetramer may aid in preventing monomer–monomer dissociation. When examining the enzyme kinetics of the generated mutants, we found that impairment of the tetramer, G6PDE347A, reduced enzymatic activity by ∼40% (Fig. 4I). Consistent with these findings, stabilization of the tetramer, G6PDA277C, increased the catalytic activity by ∼80%, reinforcing the importance of tetrameric G6PD for catalysis. When comparing the dimeric form, G6PDE347A, against the tetrameric form, G6PDA277C, the tetramer had ∼300% increase in catalytic activity. The Km for NADP+ and G6P for G6PDWT, G6PDE347A, and G6PDA277C supports increased activity as the tetramer binds G6P more readily; a KM of 115 versus 93 μM for G6PDE347A and G6PDA277C, respectively (Fig. 4J). Additionally, the tetramer is more thermally stable than dimeric G6PD (Fig. 4K). Together, these findings suggest that the tetrameric state provides maximum enzymatic activity and stability of G6PD. Previous work in the lab found that stabilizing the dimeric state with a small molecule increases the catalytic activity of Class II and III variants (18Hwang S. Mruk K. Rahighi S. Raub A.G. Chen C.-H. Dorn L.E. Horikoshi N. Wakatsuki S. Chen J.K. Mochly-Rosen D. Correcting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency with a small-molecule activator.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4045Google Scholar, 19Raub A. Hwang S. Horikoshi N. Cunningham A. Rahighi S. Wakatsuki S. Mochly-Rosen D. Small-molecule activators of glucose-6-phosephate dehydrogenase (G6PD) bridging the dimer interface.ChemMedChem. 2019; 14: 1321-1324Google Scholar). As G6PDK403Q has been established as a good model for Class I variants, we sought to determine if stabilizing the dimer or tetramer could correct activity or stability for G6PDK403Q. Using the same mutagenic strategy described above, we made double and triple mutants, the G6PDK403Q mutation combined with either dL, or both dL and tetramer-locked (tL), to determine if inducing oligomerization could recover activity and/or stability for G6PDK403Q. Consistent with our findings that G6PDK403Q forms a stable dimer, locking G6PDK403Q in the dimeric states offered little improvement in activity (Fig. 5A). In contrast, locking G6PDK403Q in the tetrameric state improved activity significantly, ∼200-fold. Similar trends were obtained at substrate concentrations recommended by the WHO (200 μM NADP+ and 600 μM G6P) and when comparing with G6PDWT, tetramer stabilization activated a catalytically dead enzyme to 16.5% of G6PDWT activity (Fig. 5B). To better understand the relationship between substrates and activity, the Michalis–Menten kinetics were measured for the G6PDK403Q series (Fig. 5C). The Km reveals that G6PDK403QdL improved both G6P and NADP+ binding, as we were able to generate a reliable fit to the Michalis– Menten equation, whereas G6PDK403Q could not (previously discussed). However, although dimer locking improved the Km for G6P and NADP+, the Km exceeded 800 μM, binding substrates poorly. Consistent with the fact that tetramer locking was able to activate G6PDK403Q, G6PDK403QdLtL improved G6P and NADP+ binding significantly, as the Km changed from 1382 to 102 μM for G6P and from 802 to 59 μM for NADP+. The Km for G6PDWT appears different (Figs. 4J and 5C) because different protein concentrations were used; ∼3 nM was used for Figure 4J, whereas ∼70 nM was used for Figure 5C—higher concentrations were needed to accurately measure G6PDK403Q kinetics. The physiological concentration of NADP+ in erythrocytes has been reported at 25 to 40 μM NADP+ (21Al-Ali A.K. Pyridine nucleotide redox potential in erythrocytes of Saudi subjects with sickle cell disease.Acta Haematol. 2002; 108: 19-22Google Scholar, 22Kirkman H.N. Gaetani G.D. Clemons E.H. Mareni C.

https://openalex.org/W4225574571,"Metformin, a commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been shown to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Notably, AMPK activation has recently been observed to be associated with anti-inflammatory responses. Metformin is also reported to elicit anti-inflammatory responses in CD4+ T cells, resulting in improvement in experimental chronic inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. To investigate the effect of metformin on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we developed a T cell-transfer model of chronic colitis in which SCID mice were injected with CD4+ CD45RBhigh T cells to induce colitis. We examined the effects of metformin via in vitro and in vivo experiments on lamina propria (LP) CD4+ T cells. We observed that metformin suppresses the frequency of interferon (IFN) -γ-producing LP CD4+ T cells in vitro, which were regulated by AMPK activation, a process possibly induced by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we examined the effects of metformin on an in vivo IBD model. Metformin-treated mice showed AMPK activation in LP CD4+ T cells and ameliorated colitis. Our study demonstrates that metformin-induced AMPK activation in mucosal CD4+ T cells contributes to the improvement of IBD by suppressing IFN-γ production. Moreover, our results indicate that AMPK may be a target molecule for the regulation of mucosal immunity and inflammation. Thus, AMPK-activating drugs such as metformin may be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of IBD."

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, infection control measures were taken, such as hand washing, mask wearing, and behavioral restrictions. However, it is not fully clear how the effects of these non-pharmaceutical interventions changed the prevalence of other pathogens associated with respiratory infections. In this study, we collected 3,508 nasopharyngeal swab samples from 3,249 patients who visited the Yamanashi Central Hospital in Japan from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We performed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel and singleplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR targeting SARS-CoV-2 to detect respiratory disease-associated pathogens. At least one pathogen was detected in 246 (7.0%) of the 3,508 samples. Eleven types of pathogens were detected in the samples collected from March-May 2020, during which non-pharmaceutical interventions were not well implemented. In contrast, after non-pharmaceutical interventions were thoroughly implemented, only five types of pathogens were detected, and the majority were SARS-CoV-2, adenoviruses, or human rhinoviruses / enteroviruses. The 0-9 year age group had a higher prevalence of infection with adenoviruses and human rhinoviruses / enteroviruses compared with those 10 years and older, while those 10 years and older had a higher prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. These results indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions likely reduced the diversity of circulating pathogens. Moreover, differences in the prevalence of pathogens were observed among the different age groups."

Here we describe the response to high glucose of micro- and macro-vascular human endothelial cells (EC) cultured in biomimetic microchannels fabricated through soft lithography and perfused to generate shear stress. In 3D macrovascular EC exposed to a shear stress of 0.4 Pa respond to high glucose with cytoskeletal remodeling and alterations in cell shape. Under the same experimental conditions, these effects are more pronounced in microvascular cells that show massive cytoskeletal disassembly and apoptosis after culture in high glucose. However, when exposed to a shear stress of 4 Pa, which is physiological in the microvasculature, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) show alterations of the cytoskeleton but no apoptosis. This result emphasizes the sensitivity of HDMEC to different regimens of flow. No significant variations in the thickness of glycocalyx were detected in both human endothelial cells from the umbilical vein and HDMEC exposed to high glucose in 3D, whereas clear differences emerge between cells cultured in static 2D versus microfluidic channels. We conclude that culture in microfluidic microchannels unveils unique insights into endothelial dysfunction by high glucose."
https://openalex.org/W4205764878,"The chloroplast chaperone CLPC1 unfolds and delivers substrates to the stromal CLPPRT protease complex for degradation. We previously used an in vivo trapping approach to identify interactors with CLPC1 in Arabidopsis thaliana by expressing a STREPII-tagged copy of CLPC1 mutated in its Walker B domains (CLPC1-TRAP) followed by affinity purification and mass spectrometry. To create a larger pool of candidate substrates, adaptors, or regulators, we carried out a far more sensitive and comprehensive in vivo protein trapping analysis. We identified 59 highly enriched CLPC1 protein interactors, in particular proteins belonging to families of unknown functions (DUF760, DUF179, DUF3143, UVR-DUF151, HugZ/DUF2470), as well as the UVR domain proteins EXE1 and EXE2 implicated in singlet oxygen damage and signaling. Phylogenetic and functional domain analyses identified other members of these families that appear to localize (nearly) exclusively to plastids. In addition, several of these DUF proteins are of very low abundance as determined through the Arabidopsis PeptideAtlas http://www.peptideatlas.org/builds/arabidopsis/ showing that enrichment in the CLPC1-TRAP was extremely selective. Evolutionary rate covariation indicated that the HugZ/DUF2470 family coevolved with the plastid CLP machinery suggesting functional and/or physical interactions. Finally, mRNA-based coexpression networks showed that all 12 CLP protease subunits tightly coexpressed as a single cluster with deep connections to DUF760-3. Coexpression modules for other trapped proteins suggested specific functions in biological processes, e.g., UVR2 and UVR3 were associated with extraplastidic degradation, whereas DUF760-6 is likely involved in senescence. This study provides a strong foundation for discovery of substrate selection by the chloroplast CLP protease system."

Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA-ATPase), is reported to have multiple roles in flavivirus replication. Nevertheless, the importance of each role still has not been addressed. In this study, the functions of 17 VCP mutants that are reportedly unable to interact with the VCP cofactors were validated using the short-interfering RNA rescue experiments.

We show that the depletion of NPL4 impaired the early stage of viral genome replication. In addition, we demonstrate that the direct interaction between NPL4 and viral nonstructural protein (NS4B) is critical for the translocation of NS4B to the sites of viral replication. Finally, we found that Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus promoted stress granule formation only in VCP inhibitor-treated cells and the expression of NS4B or VCP attenuated stress granule formation mediated by protein kinase R, which is generally known to be activated by type I interferon and viral genome RNA.

The genome of the genus Flavivirus is characterized by a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. In humans, flaviviral infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and West Nile virus (WNV), circulate between arthropod and vertebrate hosts and are etiological factors for major epidemics worldwide. Currently, effective antiflaviviral drugs are not available for human use. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel antiflaviviral therapeutic agents (1Gould E. Solomon T. Pathogenic flaviviruses.Lancet. 2008; 371: 500-509Google Scholar). The RNA genome (size: 11 kb) of flaviviruses encodes a large polyprotein, which is translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and integrated into the ER membrane. Subsequently, the polyprotein is processed into three structural proteins (capsid, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by viral and cellular proteases (2Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Flavivirus genome organization, expression, and replication.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Google Scholar). NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B, which are essential for virus replication, are not reported to exhibit enzymatic activities. NS2A is thought to function in virion assembly (3Kümmerer B.M. Rice C.M. Mutations in the yellow fever virus nonstructural protein NS2A selectively block production of infectious particles.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4773-4784Google Scholar, 4Leung J.Y. Pijlman G.P. Kondratieva N. Hyde J. Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Role of nonstructural protein NS2A in flavivirus assembly.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4731-4741Google Scholar), whereas NS4A is known to function in the formation of convoluted membranes at replication organelles (5Miller S. Kastner S. Krijnse-Locker J. Bühler S. Bartenschlager R. The non-structural protein 4A of dengue virus is an integral membrane protein inducing membrane alterations in a 2K-regulated manner.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8873-8882Google Scholar). The role of NS4B in the viral replication cycle remains unclear. However, NS4B is detected at the vesicle packet (VP) in the replication organelle, which indicates that NS4B functions as a scaffolding protein in viral replication (6Kaufusi P.H. Kelley J.F. Yanagihara R. Nerurkar V.R. Induction of endoplasmic reticulum-derived replication-competent membrane structures by West Nile virus non-structural protein 4B.PLoS One. 2014; 9e84040Google Scholar, 7Roosendaal J. Westaway E.G.

Virol. 2006; 80: 4623-4632Google Scholar). NS4B interacts with NS4A and NS3, a hybrid protein with viral helicase and protease domains. This indicates that the major function of NS4B is to promote the recruitment of NS4A and NS3 (8Chatel-Chaix L. Fischl W. Scaturro P. Cortese M. Kallis S. Bartenschlager M. Fischer B.

Brinton M.A. West Nile virus infections suppress early viral RNA synthesis and avoid inducing the cell stress granule response.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 3647-3657Google Scholar). Furthermore, WNV NS4B (along with other NS proteins) suppresses experimentally induced stress granule (SG) formation (9Courtney S.C. Scherbik S.V. Stockman B.M. Brinton M.A. West Nile virus infections suppress early viral RNA synthesis and avoid inducing the cell stress granule response.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 3647-3657Google Scholar, 10Zmurko J. Neyts J. Dallmeier K. Flaviviral NS4b, chameleon and jack-in-the-box roles in viral replication and pathogenesis, and a molecular target for antiviral intervention.Rev. Med. Virol. 2015; 25: 205-223Google Scholar). Valosin-containing protein/p97 (VCP), a hexameric ATPase, regulates diverse cellular functions, including ER-associated degradation (ERAD), autophagy, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair. VCP carries out its regulatory functions by either extracting ubiquitylated proteins from membranes or cellular structures or by separating them from binding proteins (11Meyer H. Bug M. Bremer S. Emerging functions of the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase in the ubiquitin system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 117-123Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in VCP result in inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (12Meyer H. Weihl C.C. The VCP/p97 system at a glance: Connecting cellular function to disease pathogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 3877-3883Google Scholar). Furthermore, various cofactors, including NPL4, UFD1, p47, p37, and UBXD1, bind to the N-terminal domain of VCP through specific interaction domains or motifs and consequently modulate the VCP-mediated processes (11Meyer H. Bug M. Bremer S. Emerging functions of the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase in the ubiquitin system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 117-123Google Scholar). Previously, we had reported that siRNA-mediated knockdown of VCP markedly downregulated the production of JEV or DENV particles (>106-fold titer reductions) without exerting cytotoxic effects (13Tabata K. Arakawa M. Ishida K. Kobayashi M. Nara A. Sugimoto T. Okada T. Mori K. Morita E. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation controls virus protein homeostasis, which is required for flavivirus propagation.J. Virol. 2021; 95e0223420Google Scholar). This indicates that VCP is a potential therapeutic target for flaviviral infections. VCP is involved in at least two steps (capsid uncoating step immediately after virion entry and viral RNA genome replication) of flavivirus replication (14Sehrawat S. Khasa R. Deb A. Prajapat S.K. Mallick S. Basu A. Surjit M. Kalia M. Vrati S. Valosin-containing protein/p97 plays critical roles in the Japanese encephalitis virus life cycle.J. Virol. 2021; 95e02336-20Google Scholar). During capsid uncoating, the VCP complex promotes the transportation of ubiquitinated viral capsids to the proteasome, which leads to the release of the RNA genome into the cytoplasm (15Ramanathan H.N. Zhang S. Douam F. Mar K.B. Chang J. Yang P.L. Schoggins J.W. Ploss A. Lindenbach B.D. A sensitive yellow fever virus entry reporter identifies valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) as an essential host factor for flavivirus uncoating.mBio. 2020; 11e00467-20Google Scholar). In viral genome RNA replication, the VCP-mediated ERAD pathway is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated NS proteins, which is important to maintain the homeostatic levels of viral proteins for efficient flaviviral genome replication (13Tabata K. Arakawa M. Ishida K. Kobayashi M. Nara A. Sugimoto T. Okada T. Mori K. Morita E. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation controls virus protein homeostasis, which is required for flavivirus propagation.J. Virol. 2021; 95e0223420Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the antiviral effect of VCP depletion have not been elucidated. In addition to viral capsid uncoating and viral genome replication, VCP may have other roles in flavivirus replication. Type I interferons and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors are involved in typical host antiviral responses. The cellular stress responses, which are considered important antiviral strategies, mainly involve promoting the rapid repression of cellular translation of proteins essential for cell survival. Several viruses repress the cellular translation to facilitate their replication. Hence, this process is a potential therapeutic target for viral diseases (16Chan Y.K. Gack M.U. Viral evasion of intracellular DNA and RNA sensing.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 360-373Google Scholar). SGs are aggregates of nontranslating messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes formed in response to various environmental and cellular signals (17Panas M.D. Ivanov P. Anderson P. Mechanistic insights into mammalian stress granule dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 215: 313-323Google Scholar). SG formation and translational arrest are mediated by the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which is catalyzed by several cytoplasmic kinases, including protein kinase R (PKR). PKR, which senses the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is important for the response to viral infections (18Miller C.L. Stress granules and virus replication.Future Virol. 2011; 6: 1329-1338Google Scholar). Several independent groups have reported that flaviviruses have multiple machineries to inhibit the formation of SG assembly (19Emara M.M. Brinton M.A. Interaction of TIA-1/TIAR with West Nile and dengue virus products in infected cells interferes with stress granule formation and processing body assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dis. 2017; 11e0005775Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the flavivirus-induced SG disassembly are unclear. The aggregates of messenger ribonucleoproteins dissociate after stress release. VCP is reported to play a critical role in SG clearance (24Buchan J.R. Kolaitis R.-M. Taylor J.P. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules are cleared by autophagy and Cdc48/VCP function.Cell. 2013; 153: 1461-1474Google Scholar, 25Gwon Y. Maxwell B.A. Kolaitis R.-M. Zhang P. Kim H.J. Taylor J.P. Ubiquitination of G3BP1 mediates stress granule disassembly in a context-specific manner.Science. 2021; 372eabf6548Google Scholar). In this study, NPL4, a cofactor of VCP, was identified as a novel flavivirus host factor. In addition, the potential roles of NPL4 in releasing the viral translational machinery from SGs were determined. To determine the cofactors of VCP critical for JEV propagation, 17 VCP-expressing constructs with a mutation in the cofactor-binding region of the N-terminal domain (1–187 amino acids [aa]) were generated (Fig. 1A). These mutants were classified as groups 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1B). Group 1 comprised five prototype mutants (m1 [D35A/V38A], m2 [F52A/R53A], m3 [I70A/L72A], m4 [V108A/K109A/Y110A], and m5 [E141A/Y143A]) and two subprototype mutants (m2a [F52A] and m2b [R53A]). First, we tested the ability of those mutants to bind with known representative cofactors and its truncation fragments, NPL4-Full length (FL), NPL4-N terminal fragment (N), UFD1-FL, UFD1-C terminal fragment (C), p47-FL, p37-FL, and UBXD1-FL, and we reproduced their bindings to VCP-N terminal region using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay (Fig. 1C). All tested cofactors interacted with the full-length VCP protein (Fig. 1C, row 2). Among these, only p47 and p37 interacted with the N-terminal fragment of VCP (Fig. 1C, row 3). The VCP mutants m1 and m3 also interacted with all tested cofactors. However, the m2, m2a, m4, and m5 mutants did not interact with NPL4 alone, whereas m2b did not interact with UFD1 alone. The inability of the VCP m4 mutant to bind to NPL4 was verified using a pull-down assay with the epitope-tagged proteins expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1D). Next, the ability of these mutants to rescue impaired JEV propagation in VCP-depleted cells was examined (Fig. 1E). The E578Q mutant, which lacks in ATPase activity, was used as a control. Only m4 mutants could not effectively rescue VCP-mediated viral propagation (the rescue rate was only 31% of that of the wildtype [WT] control). The m5 mutant also did not rescue VCP-mediated viral propagation function. However, we could not determine whether this mutant is functionally null because its expression was not detected in cells. The viral propagation rescue rates of the m2b mutants, which could not bind to UFD1 alone, were similar to those of WT VCP. This suggests that the binding of UFD1 is dispensable for VCP function in viral propagation. Based on the results of experiments with group 1 mutants, this study focused on m5, m2b, and m3 mutations. The m5 (E141A/Y143A) mutation was split into m5a (E141A) and m5b (Y143A) mutations. The results of the Y2H assay revealed that the m5a mutant interacted with all tested cofactors, whereas the m5b mutant did not interact with NPL4 alone (Fig. 1F). In addition, a combinatorial mutant with m2b (R53A) and m3 (I70A/L72A) mutations was generated and named m2b + 3 (R53A/I70A/L72A). This mutant exhibited significantly decreased binding to p37. These three mutants were expressed at reasonable levels and markedly rescued virus propagation in VCP-depleted cells (Fig. 1G). This indicates that the binding of VCP to p37 and both m5a and m5b mutation sites (E141 and Y143) are not important for VCP-mediated virus propagation (Fig. 1G). In contrast to the m2b mutant, the m2b+3 mutant interacted with UFD1 (Fig. 1, C and F). One explanation for this observation is additional mutations in m2b may have induced a conformational change in the N-terminal region of VCP and consequently restored its ability to bind to UFD1. Next, the following seven additional combinatorial mutants with m4 were generated: m4+2 (F52A/R53A/V108A/K109A/Y110A), m4+2a (F52A/V108A/K109A/Y110A), m4+2b (R53A/V108A/K109A/Y110A), m4+5a (V108A/K109A/Y110A/E141A), m4+5b (V108A/K109A/Y110A/Y143A), m4+5b+2a (F52A/V108A/K109A/Y110A/Y143A), and m4+5b+2b (R53A/V108A/K109A/Y110A/Y143A). The binding of these mutants to cofactors and their ability to rescue virus propagation in VCP-depleted cells were examined (Fig. 1, H and I). All additional m4 mutants exhibited impaired binding to NPL4, whereas the m4+2b mutant exhibited decreased binding to UFD1, p47, and p37. Moreover, all these mutants could not effectively rescue virus propagation in VCP-depleted cells. The rescue rates of all additional m4 mutants were similar to those of the parental m4 mutant, which exhibited 18% to 34% rescue rates of those of the WT control. None of the additional m4 mutants exhibited additive or synergistic inhibitory effects. These findings indicated that only the m4 mutation sites, namely, V108, K109, and Y110, were critical for VCP-mediated virus propagation. The other sites that were tested for their effects on virus propagation were dispensable for VCP-mediated virus propagation. The m4 mutant did not interact with NPL4 alone but interacted with other cofactors. This suggests that VCP binding to NPL4 is critical for VCP-mediated viral propagation and that VCP binding to other cofactors is dispensable for this function. Previously, proteome analysis revealed that both NPL4 and VCP coprecipitated with JEV-NS4B and DENV-NS4B (13Tabata K. Arakawa M. Ishida K. Kobayashi M. Nara A. Sugimoto T. Okada T. Mori K. Morita E. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation controls virus protein homeostasis, which is required for flavivirus propagation.J. Virol. 2021; 95e0223420Google Scholar). Hence, these interactions were confirmed using the reciprocal pull-down assay. As shown in Figure 2A, JEV-NS4B coprecipitated with both VCP and NPL4. These interactions were confirmed via the immunoprecipitation assay using antibodies directly bound to JEV-NS4B and endogenous NPL4. Endogenous NPL4 was coprecipitated with NS4B using a JEV infection–dependent method, indicating the specific interaction between NS4B and NPL4 (Fig. 2B). NPL4 is a well-known cofactor involved in the substrate recognition of VCP. Hence, the effect of NPL4 expression on the interaction between NS4B and VCP was evaluated. NPL4 overexpression was promoted, whereas NPL4 knockdown impaired the interaction between VCP and NS4B (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that NPL4 may act as a bridge for the interaction between VCP and NS4B. Two successive pull-down experiments using Strep-tag and Myc-tag affinity beads showed that NPL4 has a central role in the interaction between the NS4B and NPL4-VCP complexes (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that NPL4 functions as a cofactor of VCP and mediates the interaction between VCP and NS4B during viral infection. Furthermore, NPL4 colocalized with NS4B. NPL4 diffusely localized at the cytoplasm when it was expressed alone but translocated to the NS4B-positive compartment in JEV-infected cells or NS4B-transfected cells (Fig. 2, F and G). This further indicated that NPL4 interacts with NS4B. The direct interaction between NPL4 and NS4B was examined using the Y2H assay (Fig. 2, H and I), which is suitable for analyzing the cytosolic proteins. Hence, the interaction of all possible cytosolic fragments of JEV-NS4B with NPL4 was examined. Strong signals are observed with small proteins. Therefore, NPL4 was divided into three fragments (1–83, 84–247, and 248–608 aa) and the interactions of these fragments with the NS4B fragments were examined. The combination of DNA-binding domain fused to NS4B (2393–2447 aa) and activation domain fused to NPL4 (84–247 aa) yielded a positive signal, indicating that these peptides directly interacted with each other (Fig. 2I). These results suggested that NPL4 directly interacted with the NS4B cytoplasmic loop. To examine the role of NPL4 in flavivirus propagation, the effect of NPL4 knockdown on viral propagation was examined. Treatment with siRNAs efficiently depleted the endogenous NPL4 levels and significantly impaired JEV propagation (Fig. 3A). Two different targeted siRNAs were evaluated, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Treatment with NPL4 siRNAs also significantly impaired DENV replication in the subgenomic replicon cells (Fig. 3B). These findings indicate that NPL4 is required for flavivirus replication. Furthermore, the simultaneous knockdown of NPL4 with VCP did not demonstrate any additive or synergistic inhibitory effect on either JEV propagation or DENV replication (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that NPL4 and VCP play roles in the same pathway. A recent study has reported that the ATPase activity of VCP is required for flavivirus propagation (13Tabata K. Arakawa M. Ishida K. Kobayashi M. Nara A. Sugimoto T. Okada T. Mori K. Morita E. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation controls virus protein homeostasis, which is required for flavivirus propagation.J. Virol. 2021; 95e0223420Google Scholar). Hence, the cells infected with the virus for 2 h were treated with specific small-molecule VCP ATPase inhibitors, such as DBeQ (26Chou T.-F. Brown S.J. Minond D. Nordin B.E. Li K. Jones A.C. Chase P. Porubsky P.R. Stoltz B.M. Schoenen F.J. Patricelli M.P. Hodder P. Rosen H. Deshaies R.J. Reversible inhibitor of p97, DBeQ, impairs both ubiquitin-dependent and autophagic protein clearance pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 4834-4839Google Scholar), for 4 h. Treatment with the VCP ATPase inhibitors impaired the production of infectious JEV in the supernatant (Fig. 3C), which was consistent with the results of a previous study (13Tabata K. Arakawa M. Ishida K. Kobayashi M. Nara A. Sugimoto T. Okada T. Mori K. Morita E. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation controls virus protein homeostasis, which is required for flavivirus propagation.J. Virol. 2021; 95e0223420Google Scholar). A 4-h pulse treatment with DBeQ just after virus inoculation was sufficient to reduce the viral titers. However, the inhibitory effect of DBeQ on virus production was not observed at other time points (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that VCP functions in the early and not the late stage of viral infection. Treatment with the irreversible ERAD inhibitor eeyarestatin I (EerI) (27Wang Q. Shinkre B.A. Lee J. Weniger M.A. Liu Y. Chen W. Wiestner A. Trenkle W.C. Ye Y. The ERAD inhibitor Eeyarestatin I is a bifunctional compound with a membrane-binding domain and a p97/VCP inhibitory group.PLoS One. 2010; 5e15479Google Scholar) impaired virus production irrespective of the timing of inhibitor treatment (Fig. 3, D and E). Buchan et al. (24Buchan J.R. Kolaitis R.-M. Taylor J.P. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules are cleared by autophagy and Cdc48/VCP function.Cell. 2013; 153: 1461-1474Google Scholar) reported that VCP is involved in dissociating SGs after cellular stresses are relieved. Thus, the effect of VCP inhibitors on SG formation was examined in virus-infected cells. The number of cells with G3BP-positive SGs in the DBeQ-treated and JEV-infected group was significantly higher than that in the DBeQ-treated and mock-infected group (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, treatment with 3,4-methylenedioxy-b-nitrostyrene (MDBN; a VCP inhibitor) dose dependently and significantly increased the number of cells with SGs in the JEV-infected cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that these are not the specific phenotypes observed with DBeQ treatment. To examine the VCP inhibition–mediated SG formation, the number of cells with SG formation expressing other SG markers among the virus-infected cells was examined in the same experiments. DBeQ significantly increased the production of TIAR-positive or eIF3η-positive SGs in the virus-infected cells (Fig. 4D). This suggested that these SGs are not G3BP-specific structures. Although VCP or NPL4 knockdown reduced the viral genome replication, the basal levels of viral genome replication and viral protein expression were observed in these cells. The number of SGs-positive cells was increased upon VCP or NPL4 depletion in a JEV infection–dependent manner (Fig. 4E). SG formation was also observed in DENV-infected cells (Fig. 4F). Thus, the induction of SG formation may be a common feature of flaviviruses. VCP inhibition–mediated SG formation was also observed in JEV subgenomic replicon cells (Fig. 4G). In the JEV subgenomic replicon cells, viral protein translation, which is accompanied by viral genome replication, proceeds without the viral structural proteins capsid, prM, and E. This suggested that viral structural proteins are not involved in this process. These findings indicate that flavivirus genome replication or related event potentially induces SG formation in the absence of VCP function. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the G3BP puncta overlapped with dsRNA. The G3BP signals were adjacent to NS3, which was detected in the convoluted membrane (CM) (Fig. 5A arrowhead). A previous study indicated that G3BP was ubiquitinated during its disassembly (25Gwon Y. Maxwell B.A. Kolaitis R.-M. Zhang P. Kim H.J. Taylor J.P. Ubiquitination of G3BP1 mediates stress granule disassembly in a context-specific manner.Science. 2021; 372eabf6548Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is also targeted for NPL4–VCP activity (11Meyer H. Bug M. Bremer S. Emerging functions of the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase in the ubiquitin system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 117-123Google Scholar). Although the ubiquitin signals overlapped with NS3, VCP inhibition–induced SG was partially colocalized with ubiquitin signals (Fig. 5B). This suggests that SGs formed close to the viral replication organelles could be in the disassembly process. Furthermore, partial NPL4 signals overlapped with both NS4B and G3BP (Fig. 5C). This indicated that the NPL4–VCP complex is recruited to the replication organelle through interaction with NS4B and that this complex modulates the formation of SG adjacent to the viral replication organelle. To further analyze VCP inhibition–mediated SG formation, the correlation between viral protein expression and VCP inhibition was examined in JEV-infected cells. The effect of DBeQ on SG formation at an early stage of infection was examined. As shown in Figure 6, the number of NS3-positive cells gradually increased to almost 100% at 22 h post infection. The number of SGs increased between 6 and 10 h post infection, a time frame during which viral proteins were detected. These results suggest that DBeQ-induced SG formation is related to viral protein expression. Viral infection activates the antiviral stress responses, such as the assembly of RNA granules in the host cells to inhibit mRNA translation. Previous studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the virus-mediated modulation of the assembly/disassembly of RNA granules. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the RNA granule formation are unclear. Recently, two studies have reported that VCP plays an important role in SG clearance (24Buchan J.R. Kolaitis R.-M. Taylor J.P. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules are cleared by autophagy and Cdc48/VCP function.Cell. 2013; 153: 1461-1474Google Scholar, 28Seguin S.J. Morelli F.F. Vinet J. Amore D. De Biasi S. Poletti A. Rubinsztein D.C. Carra S. Inhibition of autophagy, lysosome and VCP function impairs stress granule assembly.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21: 1838-1851Google Scholar). Thus, the status of SG formation in virus-infected cells was examined. Consistent with the previous findings in DENV-infected and WNV-infected cells (19Emara M.M. Brinton M.A. Interaction of TIA-1/TIAR with West Nile and dengue virus products in infected cells interferes with stress granule formation and processing body assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Treatment with arsenite or polyinosinic:polycytidylic (poly (I:C); a mimic of viral dsRNA) promoted SG formation through eIF2α phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W4207031420,"Periodontal disease is one of the most common disorders in the oral cavity of dogs and humans. Periodontitis, the irreversible periodontal disease, arises progressively from gingivitis, the reversible inflammatory condition caused by dental plaque. Although the etiology of periodontitis has been widely studied in humans, it is still insufficient for the etiological studies on periodontitis in dogs. Many studies have reported that human periodontitis-related bacteria are putative pathogens responsible for periodontitis in dogs. However, most of these studies have focused on the appearance of a specific microbiome, and most of the cohort studies have insufficient sample sizes to generalize their results. In the present study, subgingival samples collected from 336 teeth were categorized into three groups at first, based on clinical outcomes (healthy, gingivitis, periodontitis). Subsequently, the periodontitis samples were further divided into three subgroups (early, moderate, and advanced periodontitis) according to the degree of periodontal attachment loss. Healthy and gingivitis were grouped as a reversible group, and the three subgroups were grouped as an irreversible group. To investigate trends of periodontopathic bacteria in the samples of dogs, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for quantification of 11 human periodontopathic bacteria as follows: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ( Aa ), Porphyromonas gingivalis ( Pg ), Tannerella forsythia , Treponema denticola ( Td ), Fusobacterium nucleatum , Prevotella nigrescens , Prevotella intermedia , Parvimonas micra , Eubacterium nodatum , Campylobacter rectus , and Eikenella corrodens . The PCR results showed that Aa and Pg , the representative periodontopathic bacteria, were not significantly correlated or associated with the periodontitis cases in dogs. However, interestingly, Td was strongly associated with the irreversible periodontal disease in dogs, in that it was the most prevalent bacterium detected from the dog samples. These findings indicate that the presence and numbers of Td could be used as a prognostic biomarker in predicting the irreversible periodontal disease and the disease severity in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W4226084787,"Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex is essential for the regulation of social behavior. However, stress-causing social withdrawal also promotes dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, this evidence suggests opposite functions of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. However, the influence of dopamine on prefrontal functions is yet to be fully understood. Here, we show that dopamine differentially modulated the neuronal activity triggered by social stimuli in the prefrontal cortex, depending on the duration of the dopamine activation (transient or sustained activation). Using chemogenetic techniques, we have found that social behavior was negatively regulated by a sustained increase in dopamine neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area, while it was positively regulated by an acute increase. The duration of social interactions was positively correlated with the transient dopamine release triggered by social stimuli in the prefrontal cortex and negatively correlated with the sustained increase in prefrontal dopamine levels. Furthermore, the elevation of neural calcium signal, triggered by social stimuli, in the prefrontal cortex was attenuated by the persistent elevation of prefrontal dopamine levels, whereas an acute increase in dopamine levels enhanced it. Additionally, the chronic excess of dopamine suppressed c-Fos induction triggered by social stimuli in prefrontal neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors, but not D2 receptors. These results suggest that sustained activation of prefrontal dopamine, at the opposite of its transient activation, can reduce prefrontal activity associated with social behavior, even for identical dopamine concentrations. Thus, dopamine plays opposite roles in modulating prefrontal activity depending on the duration of its action."

However, the mechanisms controlling high intestinal VDR gene expression are unknown. Here, we used Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) to identify the regulatory sites controlling intestine-specific Vdr gene expression in the small intestine (villi and crypts) and colon of developing, adult, and aged mice. We identified 17 ATAC peaks in a 125 kb region from intron 3 to -55.8 kb from exon 1 of the Vdr gene. Interestingly, many of these peaks were missing/reduced in the developing intestine. Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) peaks for intestinal transcription factors (TFs) were present within the ATAC peaks and at HiChIP looping attachments that connected the ATAC/TF ChIP peaks to the transcription start site and CCCTF-binding factor sites at the borders of the Vdr gene regulatory domain. Intestine-specific regulatory sites were identified by comparing ATAC peaks to DNAse-Seq data from other tissues that revealed tissue-specific, evolutionary conserved, and species-specific peaks. Bioinformatics analysis of human DNAse-Seq peaks revealed polymorphisms that disrupt TF-binding sites. Our analysis shows that mouse intestinal Vdr gene regulation requires a complex interaction of multiple distal regulatory regions and is controlled by a combination of intestinal TFs. These intestinal regulatory sites are well conserved in humans suggesting that they may be key components of VDR regulation in both mouse and human intestines."
https://openalex.org/W4206294372,"CD177 is a neutrophil-specific receptor presenting the proteinase 3 (PR3) autoantigen on the neutrophil surface. CD177 expression is restricted to a neutrophil subset, resulting in CD177pos/mPR3high and CD177neg/mPR3low populations. The CD177pos/mPR3high subset has implications for antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated autoimmune vasculitis, wherein patients harbor PR3-specific ANCAs that activate neutrophils for degranulation. Here, we generated high-affinity anti-CD177 monoclonal antibodies, some of which interfered with PR3 binding to CD177 (PR3 ""blockers"") as determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and used them to test the effect of competing PR3 from the surface of CD177pos neutrophils. Because intact anti-CD177 antibodies also caused neutrophil activation, we prepared nonactivating Fab fragments of a PR3 blocker and nonblocker that bound specifically to CD177pos neutrophils. We observed that Fab blocker clone 40, but not nonblocker clone 80, dose-dependently reduced anti-PR3 antibody binding to CD177pos neutrophils. Importantly, preincubation with clone 40 significantly reduced respiratory burst in primed neutrophils challenged with either monoclonal antibodies to PR3 or PR3-ANCA immunoglobulin G from ANCA-associated autoimmune vasculitis patients. After separating the two CD177/mPR3 neutrophil subsets from individual donors by magnetic sorting, we found that PR3-ANCAs provoked significantly more superoxide production in CD177pos/mPR3high than in CD177neg/mPR3low neutrophils, and that anti-CD177 Fab clone 40 reduced the superoxide production of CD177pos cells to the level of the CD177neg cells. Our data demonstrate the importance of the CD177:PR3 membrane complex in maintaining a high ANCA epitope density and thereby underscore the contribution of CD177 to the severity of PR3-ANCA diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4206989192,"The human serotonin transporter (hSERT) terminates neurotransmission by removing serotonin (5HT) from the synaptic cleft, an essential process for proper functioning of serotonergic neurons. Structures of the hSERT have revealed its molecular architecture in four conformations, including the outward-open and occluded states, and show the transporter's engagement with co-transported ions and the binding mode of inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which the hSERT occludes and sequesters the substrate 5HT. This first step of substrate uptake into cells is a structural change consisting of the transition from the outward-open to the occluded state. Inhibitors such as the antidepressants citalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline inhibit this step of the transport cycle. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we reached a fully occluded state, in which the transporter-bound 5HT becomes fully shielded from both sides of the membrane by two closed hydrophobic gates. Analysis of 5HT-triggered occlusion showed that bound 5HT serves as an essential trigger for transporter occlusion. Moreover, simulations revealed a complex sequence of steps and showed that movements of bundle domain helices are only partially correlated. 5HT-triggered occlusion is initially dominated by movements of transmembrane helix 1b, while in the final step, only transmembrane helix 6a moves and relaxes an intermediate change in its secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W4225785611,"Methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT2A) is the key enzyme to transform methionine and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a general methyl-group donor in vitro. MAT2A has been reported to participate in the NF-κB pathway and maintain the methylated modification, which also affects osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we found the expression of MAT2A was increased upon RANKL stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of MAT2A by its selective inhibitor AG-270 or genetic silencing by MAT2A-shRNA suppressed osteoclast formation and function in vitro. In vivo treatment with the inhibitor AG-270 also prevented OVX-induced bone loss. Further study revealed that the inhibition of MAT2A affected osteoclast differentiation mainly by suppressing crucial transcription factors and reactive oxygen species induced by RANKL. A quasi-targeted metabolomics assay performed by LC-MS/MS indicated that SAM was reduced by MAT2A knockdown, and the administration of SAM partly rescued the effects of MAT2A inhibition on osteoclastogenesis. These findings revealed that MAT2A is crucial for osteoclastogenesis and might be a potential target for the treatment of osteoporosis attributed to osteoclast dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4205201028,"Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated chronic inflammatory condition often characterized by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 molecules presenting gluten epitopes derived from wheat, barley, and rye. Although some T cells exhibit cross-reactivity toward distinct gluten epitopes, the structural basis underpinning such cross-reactivity is unclear. Here, we investigated the T-cell receptor specificity and cross-reactivity of two immunodominant wheat gluten epitopes, DQ2.5-glia-α1a (PFPQPELPY) and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 (PFPQPEQPF). We show by surface plasmon resonance that a T-cell receptor alpha variable (TRAV) 4+-T-cell receptor beta variable (TRBV) 29-1+ TCR bound to HLA-DQ2.5-glia-α1a and HLA-DQ2.5-glia-ω1 with similar affinity, whereas a TRAV4- (TRAV9-2+) TCR recognized HLA-DQ2.5-glia-ω1 only. We further determined the crystal structures of the TRAV4+-TRBV29-1+ TCR bound to HLA-DQ2.5-glia-α1a and HLA-DQ2.5-glia-ω1, as well as the structure of an epitope-specific TRAV9-2+-TRBV7-3+ TCR-HLA-DQ2.5-glia-ω1 complex. We found that position 7 (p7) of the DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-ω1 epitopes made very limited contacts with the TRAV4+ TCR, thereby explaining the TCR cross-reactivity across these two epitopes. In contrast, within the TRAV9-2+ TCR-HLA-DQ2.5-glia-ω1 ternary complex, the p7-Gln was situated in an electrostatic pocket formed by the hypervariable CDR3β loop of the TCR and Arg70β from HLA-DQ2.5, a polar network which would not be supported by the p7-Leu residue of DQ2.5-glia-α1a. In conclusion, we provide additional insights into the molecular determinants of TCR specificity and cross-reactivity to two closely-related epitopes in celiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W4205579315,"Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibody (PLA2R-Ab) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of primary membranous nephropathy (PMN), an autoimmune kidney disease characterized by immune deposits in the glomerular subepithelial spaces and proteinuria. However, the mechanism of how PLA2R-Abs interact with the conformational epitope(s) of PLA2R has remained elusive. PLA2R is a single transmembrane helix receptor containing ten extracellular domains that begin with a CysR domain followed by a FnII and eight CTLD domains. Here, we examined the interactions of PLA2R-Ab with the full PLA2R protein, N-terminal domain truncations, and C-terminal domain deletions under either denaturing or physiological conditions. Our data demonstrate that the PLA2R-Abs against the dominant epitope (the N-terminal CysR-CTLD1 triple domain) possess weak cross-reactivities to the C-terminal domains beyond CTLD1. Moreover, both the CysR and CTLD1 domains are required to form a conformational epitope for PLA2R-Ab interaction, with FnII serving as a linker domain. Upon close examination, we also observed that patients with newly diagnosed PMN carry two populations of PLA2R-Abs in sera that react to the denatured CysR-CTLD3 (the PLA2R-Ab1) and denatured CysR-CTLD1 (the PLA2R-Ab2) domain complexes on Western blots, respectively. Furthermore, the PLA2R-Ab1 appeared at an earlier time point than PLA2R-Ab2 in patients, whereas the increased levels of PLA2R-Ab2 coincided with the worsening of proteinuria. In summary, our data support that an integrated folding of the three PLA2R N-terminal domains, CysR, FnII, and CTLD1, is a prerequisite to forming the PLA2R conformational epitope and that the dominant epitope-reactive PLA2R-Ab2 plays a critical role in PMN clinical progression."
https://openalex.org/W4205596146,"Phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is a key effector enzyme in vertebrate phototransduction, and its maturation and function are known to critically depend on a specialized chaperone, aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1). Defects in PDE6 and AIPL1 underlie several severe retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis. Here, we characterize the complex of AIPL1 with HSP90 and demonstrate its essential role in promoting the functional conformation of nascent PDE6. Our analysis suggests that AIPL1 preferentially binds to HSP90 in the closed state with a stoichiometry of 1:2, with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain and the tetratricopeptide repeat helix 7 extension of AIPL1 being the main contributors to the AIPL1/HSP90 interface. We demonstrate that mutations of these determinants markedly diminished both the affinity of AIPL1 for HSP90 and the ability of AIPL1 to cochaperone the maturation of PDE6 in a heterologous expression system. In addition, the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domain of AIPL1 encloses a unique prenyl-binding site that anchors AIPL1 to posttranslational lipid modifications of PDE6. A mouse model with rod PDE6 lacking farnesylation of its PDE6A subunit revealed normal expression, trafficking, and signaling of the enzyme. Furthermore, AIPL1 was unexpectedly capable of inducing the maturation of unprenylated cone PDE6C, whereas mutant AIPL1 deficient in prenyl binding competently cochaperoned prenylated PDE6C. Thus, we conclude neither sequestration of the prenyl modifications is required for PDE6 maturation to proceed, nor is the FKBP-lipid interaction involved in the conformational switch of the enzyme into the functional state."

In situ structure and organisation of the type IX secretion system.bioRxiv. 2020; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.094771Google Scholar). These PorK-N rings are located in the periplasm, underneath the OM, and are proposed to be inserted into the OM by the PorK lipid moiety. These ring structures comprise approximately 32 to 36 subunits of each protein with a PorK:PorN molar ratio of 1:1. However, the resolution of the cryo-EM data was not sufficient to provide details on the structure of each partner, their organization into the ring, or their mode of interaction. In this study, we focused on the PorN protein (PGN_1673; TIGR03523 family, GI: 188595217). In silico analyses and protease accessibility experiments suggested that the N- and C-terminal regions of PorN are intrinsically disordered. We further showed that these regions are involved in PorN oligomerization and PorK interaction. We then solved the structure of the PorN central core by X-ray crystallography, revealing a new fold, and showed that it mediates contacts with PorM and effector CTDs. In a previous study we have shown that the PorN periplasmic protein (PorNP, residues 23–359, i.e., devoid of the signal peptide) forms dimers and interacts with PorM and PorK (25Vincent M.S. Canestrari M.J. Leone P. Stathopoulos J. Ize B. Zoued A. Cambillau C. Kellenberger C. Roussel A. Cascales E. Characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion trans-envelope PorKLMNP core complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 3252-3261Google Scholar). In order to get structural information, we overproduced and purified PorNP and carried out crystallization trials. Despite extensive screens, no crystal was obtained. Bioinformatic analysis of the PorN sequence suggested the presence of intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal regions, which could prevent crystallization (Fig. 1). As intrinsically disordered regions are usually more prone to proteolysis, the PorNP protein preparation was subjected to limited proteolysis assay with different proteases, and a stable domain (PorNP-G) was obtained after overnight incubation with the endoproteinase Glu-C at a 1:1000 (w:w) ratio (Fig. 2). Edman sequencing of PorNP-G revealed that the protease-resistant folded domain starts at residue 55, and the molecular mass (24,949 Da) obtained by mass spectrometry suggested that it ends at residue 265.Figure 2Size-exclusion chromatography–multiangle light scattering analysis of different PorN constructs. Chromatograms of purified PorNP (blue), PorNΔN (orange), PorNΔC (magenta), and PorNΔNΔC (cyan) are shown. The measured molar masses are ∼82.1, ∼38.8, ∼61.7, and ∼28.0 kDa for PorNP, PorNΔN, PorNΔC, and PorNΔNΔC, respectively. The inset shows the SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue staining analysis of the different constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence encoding the PorN proteolysis-resistant fragment, PorNΔNΔC (residues 55–265), was cloned, and PorNΔNΔC was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2). Size-exclusion chromatograpy–multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of PorNΔNΔC showed that the PorN folded core is monomeric, in contrast to the dimeric form of full-length PorN (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the N- and/or C-terminal region(s) is/are involved in PorNP dimer formation. To better understand the contribution of the N- and C-terminal regions to PorN oligomerization, we engineered PorNP constructs deleted of the N- (PorNΔN, residues 55–359), C- (PorNΔC, residues 25–265), or both (PorNΔNΔC, residues 55–265) terminal regions. These PorN variants were fused to the T18 and T25 domains of the adenylate cyclase, and pairwise interactions were tested by bacterial two-hybrid (BACTH) analyses. Our results show that PorNP and PorNΔC oligomerize but not PorNΔN or PorNΔNΔC (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the N-terminal region is required for PorN oligomerization. This result was confirmed in vitro. The different PorN constructs, fused to an N-terminal His6 tag, were purified by metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration and subjected to SEC-MALS experiments. Figure 2 shows that PorNP and PorNΔC are dimeric in solution, whereas, similarly to PorNΔNΔC, PorNΔN is monomeric (Fig. 2). Taken together, the in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrate that PorN dimer formation is mediated by the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region. PorN was previously shown to interact with the PorK OM lipoprotein, the PorM periplasmic domain, as well as the T9SS effector CTDs (25Vincent M.S. Canestrari M.J. Leone P. Stathopoulos J. Ize B.

Structural insights into the PorK and PorN components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion system.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005820Google Scholar). To gain information on the role of the N- and C-terminal disordered regions and of the central folded core, the PorN variants were assayed for their capacity to interact with PorK, PorM, and effector CTDs by BACTH. The unacylated form of PorK, the PorM periplasmic domain (PorMP), the PorL cytoplasmic domain (PorLC), and the CTDs of various T9SS substrates (the gingipain RgpB, the hemin-binding protein Hbp35, the peptidylarginine deiminase PPAD, and the T9SS components PorU and PorZ) were fused to the T25 domain and tested against T18-PorN fusions. Figure 3B shows that PorNP and PorNΔN interact with PorK and PorMP, whereas PorNΔC interacts only with PorMP. In addition, all PorN constructs interact with the CTDs of T9SS substrates (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that the PorN C-terminal disordered region is required for the interaction with PorK, whereas the PorN central core is sufficient to mediate contacts with PorM and the CTDs. As described above, trials to crystallize PorNP were unsuccessful, probably because of the presence of N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions. Crystallization trials were thus carried out with the PorNΔNΔC fragment, corresponding to the proteolysis-resistant fragment PorNP-G. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted PorNΔNΔC was purified and crystallized, and a single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected at 2.5-Å resolution. Phases were calculated and an initial model comprising residues 67 to 258 was built. Two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit (Fig. S1), but this oligomerization state was likely induced by crystallization as SEC-MALS and BACTH analyses showed that PorNΔNΔC is monomeric (Figs. 2 and 3A). However, whether the arrangement of the two PorN molecules in the crystal packing corresponds to a physiological organization, or not, remains to be determined. In parallel, crystallization trials of the PorNΔC and PorNΔN fragments were performed. Only crystals of PorNΔC were obtained; they were isomorphous to those of PorNΔNΔC, and a native data set was collected at 2.0-Å resolution. The model of PorNΔNΔC was used to solve the structure of PorNΔC by molecular replacement. Two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit, with the same orientation as PorNΔNΔC. The superimposition of PorNΔC and PorNΔNΔC shows an r.m.s.d. of 0.94 Å, indicating that the two molecules are almost identical (Fig. S2). As expected, the N-terminal disordered region of PorNΔC is not visible in the electron density and the refined structure of PorNΔC comprises residues 66 to 260. Nevertheless, the presence of the missing residues is not compatible with the crystal packing, suggesting that PorNΔC has undergone proteolysis during crystallization. Indeed, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified PorNΔC confirmed that the protein was cleaved after 21 days, which corresponds to the crystal growth, and the size of the proteolytic product corresponds to that of PorNΔNΔC (Fig. 2). The structure of the PorN folded core consists of an elongated antiparallel β-sheet covered on one side by six short α-helices connected by long loops, with connectivity β1α1α2α3α4β2β3β4α5α6β5 (Fig. 4). The β-sheet is composed of four β-strands on one extremity and two β-strands on the other, with the long 18-residue β-strand β3 being common to the two parts of the β-sheet. The N and C termini of the PorN folded domain are located very close to each other (<10 Å), suggesting that the N- and C-terminal disordered domains are likely to be at close proximity. A structural similarity search within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) of the PorN folded domain structure using the DALI server (33Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: Conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Google Scholar) did not return any hit with statistically significant similarities. The highest Z-score (4.9) corresponds to the outer membrane enzyme PagL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB entry 2ERV), which folds into an eight-stranded β-barrel. Four β-strands of the PagL β-barrel superimpose with the four-stranded part of the PorN β-sheet with a core r.m.s.d. of 3.3 Ǻ (Fig. S3). Actually, only the PorN β-sheet can be partially superimposed to a part of the structures corresponding to the 10 highest Z-score returned by the DALI server. This absence of similarity with any known structure suggests that the PorN core domain represents a new fold. The T9SS is a large multiprotein complex that delivers substrate proteins into the medium or that anchors them to the cell surface (2Lunar Silva I. Cascales E.

The recent years have started to provide information onto T9SS composition and organization, and the structures of some T9SS subunits have been solved. Here, we pursued this effort and report the structure–function analysis of the P. gingivalis PorN periplasmic protein. Together with PorK, PorN assembles large ring-shaped structures located underneath the membrane for which a low-resolution EM structure has been reported (31Gorasia D.G. Veith P.D. Hanssen E.G.

Structural insights into the PorK and PorN components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion system.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005820Google Scholar). Our analyses show that the PorN N- and C-terminal regions are intrinsically disordered, whereas the central domain is folded. The structure of the folded domain was then solved by X-ray crystallography and presents no similarity with any known structure. It was previously shown that PorN dimerizes (25Vincent M.S. Canestrari M.J. Leone P. Stathopoulos J. Ize B. Zoued A. Cambillau C. Kellenberger C. Roussel A. Cascales E. Characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion trans-envelope PorKLMNP core complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 3252-3261Google Scholar); our bacterial two-hybrid and SEC-MALS analyses reveal that dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal region. PorN dimerization is likely to be physiologically relevant, as PorN dimers were identified by chemical cross-linking of whole cells (31Gorasia D.G. Veith P.D. Hanssen E.G. Glew M.D. Sato K. Yukitake H. Nakayama K. Reynolds E.C. Structural insights into the PorK and PorN components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion system.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005820Google Scholar). Of interest, it was shown that a PorK-N ring is composed of 32 to 36 PorK-N complexes (31Gorasia D.G. Veith P.D. Hanssen E.G. Glew M.D. Sato K. Yukitake H. Nakayama K. Reynolds E.C. Structural insights into the PorK and PorN components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion system.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005820Google Scholar), suggesting that 16 to 18 PorN dimers are involved in ring formation. Bacterial two-hybrid assays revealed also the contribution of the other PorN domains for interaction with its partners. The C-terminal domain is involved in the interaction with PorK, while the folded domain is involved in the interaction with the periplasmic domain of PorM. Furthermore, we showed that the PorN folded domain is also involved in the interaction with the CTDs from five T9SS substrates, RgpB, Hbp35, PPAD, PorU, and PorZ. The current model of T9SS substrate transport suggests that substrates are selected in the periplasm by the PorM subunit and then conveyed to the OM-associated Sov translocon for their secretion across the OM. The PorKN ring, located underneath the OM, connects the PorM transenvelope protein to the translocon complex. By interacting with T9SS effectors, our results suggest that, in addition to playing a central role in the T9SS as"
https://openalex.org/W4205965788,"Broad evolutionary expansion of polymerase families has enabled specialization of their activities for distinct cellular roles. In addition to template-complementary synthesis, many polymerases extend their duplex products by nontemplated nucleotide addition (NTA). This activity is exploited for laboratory strategies of cloning and sequencing nucleic acids and could have important biological function, although the latter has been challenging to test without separation-of-function mutations. Several retroelement and retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) support NTA and also template jumping, by which the RT performs continuous complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using physically separate templates. Previous studies that aimed to dissect the relationship between NTA and template jumping leave open questions about structural requirements for each activity and their interdependence. Here, we characterize the structural requirements for cDNA synthesis, NTA, template jumping, and the unique terminal transferase activity of Bombyx mori R2 non-long terminal repeat retroelement RT. With sequence alignments and structure modeling to guide mutagenesis, we generated enzyme variants across motifs generally conserved or specific to RT subgroups. Enzyme variants had diverse NTA profiles not correlated with other changes in cDNA synthesis activity or template jumping. Using these enzyme variants and panels of activity assay conditions, we show that template jumping requires NTA. However, template jumping by NTA-deficient enzymes can be rescued using primer duplex with a specific length of 3' overhang. Our findings clarify the relationship between NTA and template jumping as well as additional activities of non-long terminal repeat RTs, with implications for the specialization of RT biological functions and laboratory applications."

Most CAP proteins are secreted glycoproteins and share a unique conserved αβα sandwich fold. The precise mode of action of this class of proteins, however, has remained elusive. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three CAP family members, termed pathogen related in yeast (Pry). We have previously shown that Pry1 and Pry2 export sterols in vivo and that they bind sterols in vitro. This sterol binding and export function of yeast Pry proteins is conserved in the mammalian CRISP proteins and other CAP superfamily members. CRISP3 is an abundant protein of the human seminal plasma and interacts with prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94), another major protein component in the seminal plasma. Here we examine whether the interaction between CRISP proteins and PSP94 affects the sterol binding function of CAP family members. We show that coexpression of PSP94 with CAP proteins in yeast abolished their sterol export function and the interaction between PSP94 and CAP proteins inhibits sterol binding in vitro. In addition, mutations that affect the formation of the PSP94–CRISP2 heteromeric complex restore sterol binding. Of interest, we found the interaction of PSP94 with CRISP2 is sensitive to high calcium concentrations. The observation that PSP94 modulates the sterol binding function of CRISP2 in a calcium-dependent manner has potential implications for the role of PSP94 and CRISP2 in prostate physiology and progression of prostate cancer.

CAP proteins form a large superfamily with members found in all kingdoms of life. The superfamily was named after the identification of sequence similarities between its founding members: CRISPs (cysteine-rich secretory proteins) of the mammalian reproductive tract, Ag5 (antigen 5) in the venom secretory duct of stinging insects, and PR-1 (pathogenesis-related protein 1), which is induced in plants upon pathogen infection. They are also referred to as sperm coating proteins (SCPs) or TAPS (Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7). CAP proteins share a unique conserved CAP domain, which adopts a three-layered αβα sandwich fold with a central three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices on both sides (1Szyperski T. Fernandez C. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. Structure comparison of human glioma pathogenesis-related protein GliPR and the plant pathogenesis-related protein P14a indicates a functional link between the human immune system and a plant defense system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2262-2266Google Scholar). They are mostly secreted glycoproteins, implicated in many fundamental biological processes including immune defense in mammals and plants, sperm maturation and fertilization, prostate and brain cancer, pathogen virulence, and venom toxicity. Even though these proteins are extensively studied, their precise mode of action remains to be defined (2Gibbs G.M. Roelants K. O’Bryan M.K.

The CAP protein superfamily: Function in sterol export and fungal virulence.Biomol. Concepts. 2013; 4: 519-525Google Scholar). Yeast cells express three CAP family members, pathogen related in yeast (Pry) 1–3. Pry1 and Pry2 are secreted glycoproteins, whereas Pry3 is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol–anchored cell wall protein. Mutant cells lacking all three Pry proteins are viable, but they fail to secrete acetylated sterols. This block in sterol secretion is rescued by expression of mammalian CAP family members, CRISP2, and purified Pry1, Pry2, and CRISP2 bind radiolabeled cholesterol in the low micromolar range in vitro (5Choudhary V. Schneiter R. Pathogen-related yeast (PRY) proteins and members of the CAP superfamily are secreted sterol-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16882-16887Google Scholar). The sterol binding function of the CAP domain was mapped to a flexible hydrophobic loop, known as the caveolin binding motif (CBM). Mutations within this motif abrogate sterol binding, suggesting that CAP proteins can bind sterols through displacement of this hydrophobic loop (6Choudhary V. Darwiche R. Gfeller D. Zoete V. Michielin O. Schneiter R. The caveolin-binding motif of the pathogen-related yeast protein Pry1, a member of the CAP protein superfamily, is required for in vivo export of cholesteryl acetate.J.

The function of yeast CAP family proteins in lipid export, mating, and pathogen defense.FEBS Lett. 2018; 592: 1304-1311Google Scholar). These results indicate that sterol export is a conserved feature of CAP superfamily members. Consistent with this proposition, plant PR-1 proteins bind sterols in vitro and inhibit growth of sterol auxotrophic pathogenic oomycetes (9Gamir J. Darwiche R. Van't Hof P. Choudhary V. Stumpe M.

Within the male reproductive tract, CRISPs associate with the sperm surface and are required for epididymal sperm maturation and motility. They also function in the female reproductive tract, where they are important for sperm chemotaxis and efficient fertilization (12Gaikwad A.S. Hu J. Chapple D.G. O'Bryan M.K.

In the seminal plasma, CRISP3 interacts with prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94), also known as β-microseminoprotein (MSP/MSMB), a member of the immunoglobulin binding factor family. PSP94 is one of the most abundant proteins secreted by the prostate gland, but it is also present in other body fluids, including the tracheobronchial fluid (16Lilja H. Abrahamsson P.A.

PSP94 also interacts with another CRISP family member, CRISP2, also referred to as Tpx-1 (testis-specific protein 1), a nonglycosylated CRISP family member produced during spermatogenesis, which shares 71% sequence identity with CRISP3 (24Mizuki N.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the functional significance of the interaction between PSP94 and CAP proteins in general and that of the CRISP family members, CRISP2 in particular. Coexpression of PSP94 with either CRISP2 or CRISP3 in yeast cells blocks the sterol export function of CRISP proteins in vivo but not the secretion of these proteins. PSP94 and CRISP2 are secreted as heteromeric protein complex as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation. Purified PSP94 binds CRISP2 and CRISP3 with nanomolar affinity and inhibits sterol binding of CRISP2 in vitro. Inhibition of this sterol binding function of CRISP2 by PSP94 is specific and does not affect the fatty acid binding and export function of CAP proteins or that of CRISP2. Mutations that block the interaction between PSP94 and CRISP2, on the other hand, restore sterol export by CAP proteins in vivo and sterol binding in vitro. Remarkably, this interaction between PSP94 and CRISP2 is sensitive to high calcium concentrations, allowing CRISP2 to bind sterols even in the presence of PSP94. Potential implications of the calcium-dependent interaction between PSP94 and CRISP2 on prostate physiology and their potential role in prostate cancer progression are discussed. The yeast CAP protein Pry1 has previously been shown to bind and export cholesteryl acetate (5Choudhary V. Schneiter R. Pathogen-related yeast (PRY) proteins and members of the CAP superfamily are secreted sterol-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16882-16887Google Scholar). To test whether expression of PSP94 would affect the function of Pry1 in sterol export, we expressed PSP94 fused to the N-terminal signal sequence from Pry1 (amino acids 1–19) from a constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (ADH1) to direct the protein into the yeast secretory pathway. This PSP94-containing plasmid was then transformed into heme-deficient yeast cells lacking the sterol deacetylase Say1 (hem1Δ say1Δ). This strain is able to take up radiolabeled [14C]cholesterol, acetylate it in an alcohol acetyltransferase 2 (Atf2)-dependent pathway, and secrete the resulting radiolabeled cholesteryl acetate back into the culture medium (29Tiwari R. Koffel R. Schneiter R. An acetylation/deacetylation cycle controls the export of sterols and steroids from S. cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5109-5119Google Scholar). Secretion of cholesteryl acetate requires the yeast CAP family members Pry1 and Pry2 and is blocked in a hem1Δ say1Δ pry1Δ pry2Δ quadruple mutant (5Choudhary V. Schneiter R. Pathogen-related yeast (PRY) proteins and members of the CAP superfamily are secreted sterol-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16882-16887Google Scholar). The block in sterol secretion could be relieved by expression of Pry1 or the mammalian CAP family member CRISP2 and CRISP3 (5Choudhary V. Schneiter R. Pathogen-related yeast (PRY) proteins and members of the CAP superfamily are secreted sterol-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16882-16887Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Co-expression of PSP94 with Pry1, CRISP2, or CRISP3, however, blocked sterol secretion by 78% to 82% (Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether expression of PSP94 would affect the synthesis or secretion of Pry1, CRISP2, or CRISP3, we coexpressed FLAG-tagged PSP94 with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Pry1, CRISP2, or CRISP3, separated yeast cells from the culture medium, precipitated proteins from both fractions with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and detected the tagged proteins by Western blotting. The HA-tagged CAP family members were present in both the cells and the culture medium, whereas FLAG-tagged PSP94 was mostly present in the medium, indicating that the protein is efficiently secreted (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that PSP94 does hamper sterol export mediated by Pry1, CRISP2, or CRISP3 not by disturbing their synthesis and/or secretion but by interfering with the sterol binding function of these CAP proteins. We and others have previously shown that CAP proteins can bind eicosanoids and free fatty acids at a second lipid-binding site that is independent of the sterol-binding site (30Xu X. Francischetti I.M. Lai R. Ribeiro J.M. Andersen J.F. Structure of protein having inhibitory disintegrin and leukotriene scavenging functions contained in single domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10967-10976Google Scholar, 31Darwiche R. Mène-Saffrané L. Gfeller D. Asojo O.A. Schneiter R. The pathogen-related yeast protein Pry1, a member of the CAP protein superfamily, is a fatty acid-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 8304-8314Google Scholar). To test whether PSP94 affects fatty acid binding by the CAP domain, we examined whether coexpression of PSP94 with CRISP2 affects fatty acid export from mutant cells lacking the two acyl-CoA synthases Faa1 and Faa4 and two of the three yeast CAP domain proteins, Pry1 and Pry3. Cells coexpressing PSP94 and CRISP2, however, displayed similar levels of fatty acid export as cells expressing only Pry1 or CRISP2, indicating that PSP94 does not affect fatty acid binding and export by CAP family members (Fig. S1). This result suggests that PSP94 specifically affects the sterol-binding site of the CAP domain but not the eicosanoid/fatty acid–binding pocket. To confirm the direct interaction of PSP94 with CRISP3 and to test whether PSP94 would also bind other CAP family members such as yeast Pry1, or CRISP2, we performed in vitro protein binding assay using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Therefore, PSP94 and the CAP family members, Pry1, CRISP2, and CRISP3, were expressed as fusion proteins with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag in Escherichia coli, and the proteins were affinity purified on nickel-NTA agarose beads. The purified CAP proteins were then fluorescently labeled using RED-tris-NTA and incubated with varying concentrations of PSP94. The concentration-dependent interaction of PSP94 with the fluorescently labeled CAP proteins was then monitored by MST and the resulting binding curves are shown in Figure 2, A–D. These results indicate that PSP94 binds CAP family members with nanomolar affinity, ranging from 6 to 70 nM for binding of CRISP2 and Pry1, respectively. PSP94 thus has high binding affinity for all three CAP proteins tested, and it also binds the CAP domain of Pry1 (Pry1CAP) alone. This indicates that PSP94 recognizes a binding site that is shared among different CAP family members and that is present within the CAP domain of these proteins, but not in their C-terminal extension, i.e., the hinge region or the CRD/ICR of CRISP2 and CRISP3. To test whether PSP94 also interacts with CAP family members when expressed in yeast cells, we generated strains coexpressing FLAG-tagged PSP94 with HA-tagged CRISP2. We then immunoprecipitated CRISP2-HA either from the cell pellet or the culture medium and tested whether PSP94-FLAG was coprecipitated (Fig. 2E). Coprecipitation of PSP94-FLAG with CRISP2-HA was observed both in protein extracts from the cell pellet and the culture medium, suggesting that these proteins interact with each other already in the lumen of the secretory pathway and then stay in a heteromeric complex once they are secreted into the culture medium. This coprecipitation was specific as PSP94-FLAG was not detected in cells that did not express CRISP2-HA. To test whether the interaction between PSP94 and CAP family members affects their sterol binding in vitro, we performed ligand binding assays using a more water-soluble cholesterol derivative, cholesterol sulfate. The CAP family members all bound cholesterol sulfate in the micromolar range, whereas PSP94 did not bind this cholesterol derivative as determined by MST (Fig. 3, A and C). In the presence of an equimolar concentration of PSP94, however, sterol binding by the CAP proteins was blocked (Fig. 3B). These results show that complex formation between CAP proteins and PSP94 affects sterol binding by CAP proteins, suggesting that PSP94 could act as a modulator of CAP proteins under physiological conditions. Previous structural characterization of PSP94–CRISP3 interaction has suggested that PSP94 binds CRISP3 through antiparallel beta-sheet interactions between the N-terminal β1-strand of PSP94 and the accessible β2-strand of CRISP3, thereby disrupting homodimer formation of PSP94 (32Ghasriani H. Fernlund P. Udby L. Drakenberg T. A model of the complex between human beta-microseminoprotein and CRISP-3 based on NMR data.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 235-239Google Scholar, 33Kumar A. Jagtap D.D. Mahale S.D. Kumar M. Crystal structure of prostate secretory protein PSP94 shows an edge-to-edge association of two monomers to form a homodimer.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 947-956Google Scholar). This interaction is thus located outside the hydrophobic loop that harbors the sterol-binding CBM. Based on these structural considerations, it is thus not apparent why and how the interaction between PSP94 and CRISP2 would block sterol binding at the CBM. To investigate this question in more detail, we first performed computational docking studies to identify residues in CRISP2 that are critical for the interaction with PSP94. These studies indicated that binding of PSP94 to CRISP2 indeed covers the CBM and that three residues in β2-strand of CRISP2, N97, L98, and Y99, are critical for the interaction with PSP94 (Fig. 4A). Two of these three interacting residues, N97 and L98, are conserved in all three CAP family members tested here, CRISP2, CRISP3, and Pry1 (Fig. 4A). To identify mutations that would only affect the interaction of CRISP2 with PSP94, but not the capacity of CRISP2 to bind sterols, we first generated mutant versions of CRISP2 in which each one of the three interacting amino acids was mutated individually: N97P, L98G, and Y99P. Mutations to proline were chosen with the aim of disrupting the antiparallel β-sheet interactions between the β2-strand of CRISP2 and the β1-strand of PSP94. All three of these single-mutant versions of CRISP2 could still bind cholesterol sulfate in vitro, and this sterol binding capacity was also impaired in the presence of PSP94, indicating that the single point mutant versions of CRISP2 still interacted with PSP94, as was confirmed by MST (Fig. S2, A–C). However, in a mutant version of CRISP2, which bears all three mutations simultaneously, CRISP2N97P L98G Y99P, the interaction with PSP94 was indeed abolished (Fig. 4B). Unfortunately, this triple mutant version of CRISP2 was also impaired in sterol binding in vitro and sterol export in vivo, indicating that the residues that are important for interaction with PSP94 are also important for sterol binding by the protein (Fig. 4, C–E). A HA-tagged version of the CRISP2N97P L98G Y99P triple mutant was stably produced when expressed in yeast and was secreted, as was FLAG-tagged PSP94 when coexpressed with it (Fig. 4F). Thus, the defect in sterol export of the triple mutant CRISP2 is not due to its instability or lack of secretion. Next, we generated all three double mutant combinations of CRISP2: N97P L98G, N97P Y99P, and L98G Y99P. These three double mutant versions of CRISP2 were again expressed as His-tagged proteins in E. coli and purified, and their capacity to bind sterols in the presence or absence of PSP94 was assessed by MST. This analysis revealed that the CRISP2L98G Y99P double mutant was the sole of the three double mutant versions that retained the capacity to bind cholesterol sulfate in the presence of PSP94 in vitro (Fig. 5, A–C). The capacity of the CRISP2L98G Y99P double mutant to bind sterols even in the presence of PSP94 was confirmed by the in vivo sterol export assay (Fig. 6, A and B). When expressed in yeast cells, the CRISP2L98G Y99P double mutant was stably expressed and secreted as monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 6C). However, the CRISP2L98G Y99P double mutant displayed strongly reduced interaction with PSP94 when a HA-tagged version of CRISP2L98G Y99P was immunoprecipitated and binding of FLAG-tagged PSP94 was monitored (Fig. 6D). These data thus indicate that the β2-strand within the CAP domain is of critical importance for the interaction with PSP94 and its docking to PSP94 prevents sterol binding by the CAP domain.Figure 6The CRISP2 double mutant version CRISP2L98G Y99P binds and exports sterols in vivo even in the presence of PSP94.

Quadruple mutant cells (pry1Δ pry2Δ say1Δ hem1Δ) expressing either empty plasmids or plasmids containing the double mutant version of CRISP2 (CRISP2LY) with or without PSP94 were labeled with [14C]cholesterol.

Data correspond to means ± SD of three independent determinations, and statistical significance is indicated: ∗p ≤ 0.05.

Cells expressing an HA-tagged double mutant version of CRISP2 (CRISP2LY) either with or without a FLAG-tagged version of PSP94 were cultivated, and proteins from the cell pellet (P) or culture supernatant (S) were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and detected by Western blotting. D, PSP94 only weakly interacts with CRISP2LY. Cells expressing FLAG-tagged PSP94 (a) and cells coexpressing FLAG-tagged PSP94 together with HA-tagged wildtype CRISP2 (b) or the double mutant version of CRISP2LY (c) were cultivated, and the interaction between PSP94 and CRISP2 in the culture medium was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by Western blotting to detect both HA-tagged CRISP2 and FLAG-tagged PSP94.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To corroborate our previous results, we generated a point mutant version of PSP94, PSP94F24G (F24 corresponds to F4 in the processed, signal-sequence cleaved version of PSP94), which was previously reported to have impaired binding to CRISP3 (34Breed A.A.

PSP94F24G indeed failed to bind Pry1CAP, CRISP2, or the double mutant CRISP2L98G Y99P in vitro when tested by MST (Fig. 7A), and all three CAP proteins retained their capacity to bind sterols in the presence of this mutated form of PSP94 (Fig. 7B). Similarly, when tested for sterol binding and export in vivo, cells expressing CRISP2 exported sterols in the presence of PSP94F24G, indicating that the mutant version of PSP94 did not inhibit sterol binding and export by the CAP family member CRISP2 (Fig. 7C). Consistent with this, cells expressing PSP94F24G regained an export index comparable with that of cells expressing CRISP2 alone (Fig. 7D).

https://openalex.org/W4220682775,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which motor neurons progressively and rapidly degenerate, eventually leading to death. The first protein found to contain ALS-associated mutations was copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which is conformationally stable when it contains its metal ligands and has formed its native intramolecular disulfide. Mutations in SOD1 reduce protein folding stability via disruption of metal binding and/or disulfide formation, resulting in misfolding, aggregation, and ultimately cellular toxicity. A great deal of effort has focused on preventing the misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 as a potential therapy for ALS; however, the results have been mixed. Here, we utilize a small-molecule polytherapy of diacetylbis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (CuATSM) and ebselen to mimic the metal delivery and disulfide bond promoting activity of the cellular chaperone of SOD1, the ""copper chaperone for SOD1."" Using microscopy with automated image analysis, we find that polytherapy using CuATSM and ebselen is highly effective and acts in synergy to reduce inclusion formation in a cell model of SOD1 aggregation for multiple ALS-associated mutants. Polytherapy reduces mutant SOD1-associated cell death, as measured by live-cell microscopy. Measuring dismutase activity via zymography and immunoblotting for disulfide formation showed that polytherapy promoted more effective maturation of transfected SOD1 variants beyond either compound alone. Our data suggest that a polytherapy of CuATSM and ebselen may merit more study as an effective method of treating SOD1-associated ALS."
https://openalex.org/W4205383411,"The stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor that regulates the activity of Orai plasma membrane Ca2+ channels to mediate the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway essential for immunity. Uncoordinated 93 homolog B1 (UNC93B1) is a multiple membrane-spanning ER protein that acts as a trafficking chaperone by guiding nucleic-acid sensing toll-like receptors to their respective endosomal signaling compartments. We previously showed that UNC93B1 interacts with STIM1 to promote antigen cross-presentation in dendritic cells, but the STIM1 binding site(s) and activation step(s) impacted by this interaction remained unknown. In this study, we show that UNC93B1 interacts with STIM1 in the ER lumen by binding to residues in close proximity to the transmembrane domain. Cysteine crosslinking in vivo showed that UNC93B1 binding promotes the zipping of transmembrane and proximal cytosolic helices within resting STIM1 dimers, priming STIM1 for translocation. In addition, we show that UNC93B1 deficiency reduces store-operated Ca2+ entry and STIM1-Orai1 interactions and targets STIM1 to lighter ER domains, whereas UNC93B1 expression accelerates the recruitment of STIM1 to cortical ER domains. We conclude that UNC93B1 therefore acts as a trafficking chaperone by maintaining the pool of resting STIM1 proteins in a state primed for activation, enabling their rapid translocation in an extended conformation to cortical ER signaling compartments."

They are therefore recommended to follow a healthy diet and be physically active in order to reduce that risk. However, achieving and maintaining these behaviours in the postpartum period is challenging. This study sought to explore women's views on suggested practical approaches to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and physical activity to reduce T2DM risk.Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in Cambridgeshire, UK were conducted at three to 48 months after GDM. The participants' current diet and physical activity, intentions for any changes, and views on potential interventions to help manage T2DM risk through these behaviours were discussed. Framework analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. The interview schedule, suggested interventions, and thematic framework were based on a recent systematic review.Most of the participants wanted to eat more healthily and be more active. A third of the participants considered that postpartum support for these behaviours would be transformative, a third thought it would be beneficial, and a third did not want additional support. The majority agreed that more information about the impact of diet and physical activity on diabetes risk, support to exercise with others, and advice about eating healthily, exercising with a busy schedule, monitoring progress and sustaining changes would facilitate a healthy diet and physical activity. Four other suggested interventions received mixed responses. It would be acceptable for this support to be delivered throughout pregnancy and postpartum through a range of formats. Clinicians were seen to have important roles in giving or signposting to support.Many women would appreciate more support to reduce their T2DM risk after GDM and believe that a variety of interventions to integrate changes into their daily lives would help them to sustain healthier lifestyles."
https://openalex.org/W4205923027,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are enzymes that synthesize aminoacyl-tRNAs to facilitate translation of the genetic code. Quality control by aaRS proofreading and other mechanisms maintains translational accuracy, which promotes cellular viability. Systematic disruption of proofreading, as recently demonstrated for alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), leads to dysregulation of the proteome and reduced viability. Recent studies showed that environmental challenges such as exposure to reactive oxygen species can also alter aaRS synthetic and proofreading functions, prompting us to investigate if oxidation might positively or negatively affect AlaRS activity. We found that while oxidation leads to modification of several residues in Escherichia coli AlaRS, unlike in other aaRSs, this does not affect proofreading activity against the noncognate substrates serine and glycine and only results in a 1.6-fold decrease in efficiency of cognate Ala-tRNAAla formation. Mass spectrometry analysis of oxidized AlaRS revealed that the critical proofreading residue in the editing site, Cys666, and three methionine residues (M217 in the active site, M658 in the editing site, and M785 in the C-Ala domain) were modified to cysteine sulfenic acid and methionine sulfoxide, respectively. Alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that none of the identified residues were solely responsible for the change in cognate tRNAAla aminoacylation observed under oxidative stress, suggesting that these residues may act as reactive oxygen species ""sinks"" to protect catalytically critical sites from oxidative damage. Combined, our results indicate that E. coli AlaRS proofreading is resistant to oxidative damage, providing an important mechanism of stress resistance that helps to maintain proteome integrity and cellular viability."
https://openalex.org/W4220760958,"Deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. The F508 residue is located on nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) in contact with the cytosolic extensions of the transmembrane helices, in particular intracellular loop 4 (ICL4). To investigate how absence of F508 at this interface impacts the CFTR protein, we carried out a mutagenesis scan of ICL4 by introducing second-site mutations at 11 positions in cis with F508del. Using an image-based fluorescence assay, we measured how each mutation affected membrane proximity and ion-channel function. The scan strongly validated the effectiveness of R1070W at rescuing F508del defects. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted two features characterizing the ICL4/NBD1 interface of F508del/R1070W-CFTR: flexibility, with frequent transient formation of interdomain hydrogen bonds, and loosely stacked aromatic sidechains (F1068, R1070W, and F1074, mimicking F1068, F508, and F1074 in WT CFTR). F508del-CFTR displayed a distorted aromatic stack, with F1068 displaced toward the space vacated by F508, while in F508del/R1070F-CFTR, which largely retained F508del defects, R1070F could not form hydrogen bonds and the interface was less flexible. Other ICL4 second-site mutations which partially rescued F508del-CFTR included F1068M and F1074M. Methionine side chains allow hydrophobic interactions without the steric rigidity of aromatic rings, possibly conferring flexibility to accommodate the absence of F508 and retain a dynamic interface. These studies highlight how both hydrophobic interactions and conformational flexibility might be important at the ICL4/NBD1 interface, suggesting possible structural underpinnings of F508del-induced dysfunction."

Different from other barrier sites, the immune cells in uterus face the protection against infections and tolerate an allogeneic fetus during a successful pregnancy. In the previous study, we found that tissue-resident memory γδT cells were enriched both in human and murine uterus and highly expressed IL-17 that promoted the invasion of trophocytes in vitro. In the current study, we found that γδT cells in uterus but not in blood or spleens expressed higher levels of estrogen receptors. The injection of estrogen into mice increased the proportion of γδT cells in uterus but not in spleens in vivo via CXCR3-CXCL10 chemokine axis. In addition, we found that estrogen enhanced the production of IL-17 but not IFN-γ in vivo and in vitro via interferon regulatory factor 4 but not RORγt and pSTAT3 at mRNA and protein levels. The analysis of cell transcriptome sequence further identified multiple differentially expressed genes between estrogen and control γδT cells. Our study demonstrated that estrogen directly act on γδT cells in uterus to enhance the production of IL-17 that might promote the invasion of trophocytes. Furthermore, our study might provide a new idea that estrogen increased the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in women by enhancing γδT cell-derived IL-17 production in uterus and uncover the critical pathological roles for estrogen in the development of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4205299860,"The IALB_1185 protein, which is encoded in the gene cluster for endo-β-1,2-glucanase homologs in the genome of Ignavibacterium album, is a glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 35 protein. However, most known GH35 enzymes are β-galactosidases, which is inconsistent with the components of this gene cluster. Thus, IALB_1185 is expected to possess novel enzymatic properties. Here, we showed using recombinant IALB_1185 that this protein has glycosyltransferase activity toward β-1,2-glucooligosaccharides, and that the kinetic parameters for β-1,2-glucooligosaccharides are not within the ranges for general GH enzymes. When various aryl- and alkyl-glucosides were used as acceptors, glycosyltransfer products derived from these acceptors were subsequently detected. Kinetic analysis further revealed that the enzyme has wide aglycone specificity regardless of the anomer, and that the β-1,2-linked glucose dimer sophorose is an appropriate donor. In the complex of wild-type IALB_1185 with sophorose, the electron density of sophorose was clearly observed at subsites −1 and +1, whereas in the E343Q mutant–sophorose complex, the electron density of sophorose was clearly observed at subsites +1 and +2. This observation suggests that binding at subsites −1 and +2 competes through Glu102, which is consistent with the preference for sophorose as a donor and unsuitability of β-1,2-glucooligosaccharides as acceptors. A pliable hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate various aglycone moieties was also observed in the complex structures with various glucosides. Overall, our biochemical and structural data are indicative of a novel enzymatic reaction.

This observation suggests that binding at subsites −1 and +2 competes through Glu102, which is consistent with the preference for sophorose as a donor and unsuitability of β-1,2-glucooligosaccharides as acceptors. A pliable hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate various aglycone moieties was also observed in the complex structures with various glucosides. Overall, our biochemical and structural data are indicative of a novel enzymatic reaction. We propose that IALB_1185 be redefined β-1,2-glucooligosaccharide:d-glucoside β-d-glucosyltransferase as a systematic name and β-1,2-glucosyltransferase as an accepted name. Carbohydrate chains are important polymer compounds for all organisms, which is attributed to the wide variety of carbohydrate chain structures. Such complexity of the structures is thought to be responsible for the repertoire of enzymes that synthesize and degrade carbohydrate chains. The functions and structures of these enzymes have become extensively diversified through molecular evolution. To date, various kinds of enzymes related to carbohydrates have been found and added to the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database (http://www.cazy.org) (1Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E.

A classification of glycosyl hydrolases based sequence similarities amino acid.Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Google Scholar). This database classifies these enzymes called CAZymes into families mainly based on their amino acid sequences and is now expanding. However, obtaining carbohydrates is often difficult due to their rarity or inhomogeneity in nature, which limits exploration of novel enzymes. β-1,2-Glucan is a homopolymer composed of β-1,2-linked glucose units and is one of the carbohydrates difficult to obtain from natural resources practically. β-1,2-Glucans are found mainly as cyclic forms or some as linear forms in nature. Some Gram-negative bacteria, such as Rhizobium (including species named Agrobacterium formerly), Sinorhizobium, and Brucella, produce cyclic β-1,2-glucans (3Roset M.S. Ciocchini A.E. Ugalde R.A.

Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a unicellular green alga, produces both cyclic and linear forms (6Suárez E.R. Bugden S.M. Kai F.B. Kralovec J.A. Noseda M.D. Barrow C.J. Grindley T.B.

Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas syringae produce short linear β-1,2-glucan chains with side chains (7Amemura A. Cabrera-Crespo J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6538-6544Google Scholar), though they are rare examples of short chains. β-1,2-Glucans are involved in bacterial infection of plant and animal cells, hypo-osmotic adaptation, and iron storage (9Rigano L.A.

Cyclic β-1,2-glucans with DPs of around 40 produced by Rhizobium meliloti have also been found (14Koizumi K. Okada Y. Utamura T.

Glycosides possessing β-1,2-glucooligosaccharides (Sopns, n is DP) as glycones have been found in plants such as stevia, citrus fruits, and so on (15Brahmachari G. Mandal L.C. Roy R. Sadhan M.

Sophorolipids are found in many yeast species (17Claus S. Van Bogaert I.N.A. Sophorolipid production by yeasts: A critical review of the literature and suggestions for future research.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2017; 101: 7811-7821Google Scholar), and ones from Candida bombicola are commercially manufactured (18Felse P.A. Shah V. Chan J. Rao K.J. Gross R.A. Sophorolipid biosynthesis by Candida bombicola from industrial fatty acid residues.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2007; 40: 316-323Google Scholar). β-1,2-Glucans are uniquely quite soluble in both cyclic and linear forms, unlike glucose polymers such as cellulose (β-1,4-glucans) and β-1,3-glucans (19Venkatachalam G. Gummadi S. Doble M. Applications of cyclic β-glucans.in: Venkatachalam G. Gummadi S. Doble M. Cyclic β-Glucans from Microorganisms: SpringerBriefs in Microbiology Book Series. Springer, Heidelberg, Berlin2013: 15-32Google Scholar). Cyclic β-1,2-glucans have been reported as inclusion compounds that raise the solubility of hydrophobic molecules (19Venkatachalam G. Gummadi S. Doble M. Applications of cyclic β-glucans.in: Venkatachalam G. Gummadi S. Doble M. Cyclic β-Glucans from Microorganisms: SpringerBriefs in Microbiology Book Series. Springer, Heidelberg, Berlin2013: 15-32Google Scholar). However, the physical and physiological functions of β-1,2-glucans have not been investigated sufficiently, which might be related to less progress in exploration of β-1,2-glucan-associated enzymes. Genes encoding β-1,2-glucan-degrading enzymes had not been identified until a novel phosphorylase was first found in Listeria innocua as an enzyme that can act on linear β-1,2-glucans (Hereafter, β-1,2-glucan represents a linear form unless otherwise noted.) in 2014 (20Kitahata S.

This enzyme was named 1,2-β-oligoglucan phosphorylase (SOGP) and was given a new EC number (EC2.4.1.333) (23Nakajima M. Toyoizumi H. Abe K. Nakai H. Taguchi H. Kitaoka M. 1,2-β-Oligoglucan phosphorylase from Listeria innocua.PLoS One. 2014; 9e92353Google Scholar). After that, a putative glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 3 enzyme in the SOGP gene cluster was found to be a β-glucosidase preferably hydrolyzing Sop2 by functional and structural analyses (24Nakajima M. Yoshida R. Miyanaga A. Abe K. Takahashi Y. Sugimoto N. Toyoizumi H. Nakai H. Kitaoka M. Taguchi H. Functional and structural analysis of a β-glucosidase involved in β-1,2-glucan metabolism in Listeria innocua.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0148870Google Scholar). A carbohydrate-binding subunit of a putative ABC transporter in the same gene cluster was also found to be a Sopns-binding protein (25Abe K. Sunagawa N. Terada T. Takahashi Y. Arakawa T. Igarashi K. Samejima M. Nakai H. Taguchi H. Nakajima M. Fushinobu S. Structural and thermodynamic insights into β-1,2-glucooligosaccharide capture by a solute-binding protein in Listeria innocua.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 8812-8828Google Scholar). These results are the first biochemical evidence of the existence of a gene cluster involved in β-1,2-glucan metabolism. A large-scale preparation method for β-1,2-glucan has been established using SOGP and inexpensive sugars as materials (26Abe K. Nakajima M. Kitaoka M. Toyoizumi H. Takahashi Y. Sugimoto N. Nakai H.

The prepared β-1,2-glucan was used for identification of endo-β-1,2-glucanases (SGLs) from a bacterium and a fungus. Both SGLs have been successfully identified and classified into new families (GH144 and GH162, respectively) (28Abe K. Nakajima M. Yamashita T. Matsunaga H. Kamisuki S. Nihira T. Takahashi Y.

Chem. 2019; 294: 7942-7965Google Scholar). This finding enables us to explore SGL homologs and SGL gene clusters. An SGL homolog possessing an unknown function region at the N terminus has been identified as a novel exolytic enzyme that releases Sop2 from the nonreducing ends of Sopns (30Shimizu H. Nakajima M.

A β-glucosidase preferably acting on longer Sopns and β-1,2-glucan has also been found from an SGL gene cluster in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (31Ishiguro R. Tanaka N. Abe K. Nakajima M. Maeda T.

However, the abovementioned reports are most of the studies on β-1,2-glucan-degrading enzymes, implying insufficient understanding of the variety of β-1,2-glucan-associated enzymes. Here, we focus on an SGL gene cluster in the genome from Ignavibacterium album, a moderately thermophilic anaerobic bacterium found in a hot spring in Japan (33Iino T. Mori K. Uchino Y. Nakagawa T. Harayama S. Suzuki K.I. Ignavibacterium album gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic anaerobic bacterium isolated from microbial mats at a terrestrial hot spring and proposal of Ignavibacteria classis nov., for a novel lineage at the periphery of green sulfur bacteria.Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2010; 60: 1376-1382Google Scholar). This gene cluster includes two genes encoding putative GH144 enzymes, and β-1,2-glucan-related genes encoding a putative GH3 β-glucosidase, a putative GH94 enzyme (a homolog of the SOGP), and a putative Sopns-binding protein in an ABC transporter (Fig. S1). The gene cluster also contains a gene (ialb_1185) encoding a putative GH35 enzyme (IALB_1185, hereafter IaSGT). While GH35 enzymes, which are distributed in a wide range of microorganisms, plants, and animals, are mainly β-galactosidases (β-galactosidase, exo-β-1,4-galactanase, and β-1,3-galactosidase) according to the CAZy database (34Cheng W.

Biotechnol. 2020; 104: 1135-1148Google Scholar), several GH35 enzymes from Archaea have been found to be β-glucosaminindases (GlmAs), and GlmA from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (TkGlmA) hydrolyzes chitosan and chitooligosaccharides (37Liu B. Li Z. Hong Y. Ni J. Sheng D. Shen Y. Cloning, expression and characterization of a thermostable exo-β-D-glucosaminidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii.Biotechnol.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5175-5181Google Scholar). The binding modes of natural substrates are not sufficiently understood, since only the glucosamine (GlcN) complex is available among GlmAs (39Mine S. Watanabe M. Structural insights into the molecular evolution of the archaeal exo-β-D-glucosaminidase.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 2460Google Scholar). Though many GH35 enzymes have been reported, as described above, no glucoside-acting enzyme has been reported in this family. In this study, we report the first β-1,2-glucan-associated GH35 enzyme biochemically and structurally and furthermore describe why the enzyme is a novel enzyme that should be given a new EC number. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the amino acid sequences of characterized GH35 enzymes in the CAZy database and IaSGT. While Eukaryotic GH35 enzymes are divided into two clusters, each bacterial and archaeal GH35 enzymes form one cluster, respectively (Fig. S2 and Table S1). Notably, IaSGT and its homologs form a distinct cluster from the known GH35 enzymes. Though the group of archaeal GlmAs is close to that of IaSGT in the phylogenetic tree, the amino acid sequence identity between these enzymes and IaSGT is low (only ∼28%). IaSGT has no N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that it is localized in the cytosol. Nucleophile and acid/base residues in GlmAs (Glu347 and Glu179 in TkGlmA, respectively) are conserved in IaSGT (E343 and E176, respectively) (Fig. S3). Though most substrate recognition residues at subsite −1 in the GlmAs (Tyr53, Glu103, Glu179, Glu347, and Tyr379 in TkGlmA) are also conserved in IaSGT, aspartate residues (Asp178 in TkGlmA) considered to be responsible for specificity to the amino group in GlcN are replaced by an asparagine residue in IaSGT (Asn175). Furthermore, subsite plus side regions (around Glu184 and Leu282 in TkGlmA) are not conserved at all. These differences imply that IaSGT has different substrate specificity from the GlmAs. The purified IaSGT migrated as a single band corresponding to approximately 75 kDa/m on an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. S4A). The enzyme was eluted at the time corresponding to 141 kDa/m on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S4B). Thus, this enzyme should form a dimer. Since IaSGT acted on Sop2 to release glucose (Glc) as described below in detail, quantification of Glc was used for investigation of pH and temperature profiles. IaSGT showed high activity at pH 5.0 − 8.0 (over 90% relative activity as to the highest) and was stable at pH 5.0 to 11.0 (Fig. S5A). IaSGT showed optimum activity at 55 °C and was stable up to 60 °C after incubation for 1 h (Fig. S5B), which is consistent with the bacterial growth property as to temperature. Since most GH35 enzymes show β-galactosidase activity, the activity of IaSGT toward β-galactosides was investigated. However, IaSGT did not show any hydrolytic activity toward lactose (β-Gal-1,4-Glc) (Fig. 1A) or p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-β-galactopyranoside (Gal), an artificial substrate (less than 0.01 U/mg for 1 mM pNP-β-Gal). Nor did the enzyme act on various oligosaccharides such as cellooligosaccharides (Cel2−5), laminarioligosaccharides (Lam2−5), maltose (α-Glc-1,4-Glc), gentiobiose (β-Glc-1,6-Glc), or sucrose (α-Glc-1,2-β-Fru) (Fig. 1, A–C). On the other hand, IaSGT showed activity toward Sop2−5 obviously (Fig. 1D). IaSGT produced oligosaccharides with both lower and higher DPs than those of the substrates. This disproportionation of DPs proceeded by transfer of a glucose unit. The products appeared not to show decreases in their average DPs even after reaction overnight. The enzyme did not show hydrolytic (glucose-releasing) activity toward Sop3 (less than 0.01 U/mg for 20 mM Sop3). These results indicated that the reaction mode of IaSGT was that of a glycosyltransferase. After the products at the beginning of the reaction with Sop3 were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, only the product at the position corresponding to Sop4 on the TLC plate was collected and analyzed by 1H-NMR (Fig. S6A). The chemical shifts of the product fitted completely with those of the reference Sop4 (Fig. S6, B and C), indicating that the reaction product is Sop4 and that the enzyme transfers a glucose unit to produce a β-1,2-glucosidic bond. Such elongation by transfer of Glc units has been found in GH16 elongating β-transglycosylase, though the GH16 enzyme acts on β-1,3/1,4-linkages (40Qin Z. Yang S. Zhao L. You X. Yan Q. Jiang Z. Catalytic mechanism of a novel glycoside hydrolase family 16 “elongating” β-transglycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 1666-1678Google Scholar). To understand the DPs of the reaction products in detail, the products after the overnight reaction with Sop5 were separated on the TLC plate by developing twice. As a result, Sopns with DP at least up to 9 were clearly detected (Fig. 1E). This is consistent with the fact that Sop2−9 were clearly detected by electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Fig. S7A). Sopns with DPs of 10 or more could also be assigned. Though velocities of disproportionation appeared to slow down after 3 h of the reactions (Fig. 1D), this is probably because the proportion of Sopns molecules with the highest and the lowest DPs to all the substrate molecules in the reaction solution was reduced. In order to determine whether Sopns are appropriate substrates for IaSGT, the kinetic parameters of the glucosyl transferase activity of the enzyme toward Sop2−5 were determined (Table 1). Though IaSGT showed modest kcat values, the Km values were remarkably large, especially for Sop2 and Sop3 (120 mM and 300 mM, respectively), as a GH enzyme. Consequently, the kcat/Km values were quite small (less than 0.1 s−1 mM−1 for Sop2, Sop3, and Sop5, and less than 0.5 s−1 mM−1 for Sop4). Since the substrates in the transferase reaction are both donors and acceptors, the quite large Km values suggest that Sopns are inappropriate as at least either donors or acceptors.Table 1Kinetic parameters of IaSGT for SopnsSubstratekcat (s−1)Km (mM)kcat/Km (s−1 mM−1)Sop28.0 ± 0.9120 ± 200.069 ± 0.002Sop318 ± 1300 ± 200.059 ± 0.001Sop44.8 ± 0.215 ± 20.32 ± 0.02Sop51.7 ± 0.222 ± 30.078 ± 0.005Concentrations used were 5 to 40 mM, except for Sop3 (5–80 mM). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Standard errors are used in the table. Open table in a new tab Concentrations used were 5 to 40 mM, except for Sop3 (5–80 mM). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Standard errors are used in the table. To determine optimal acceptors of IaSGT, the effects of various monosaccharides and disaccharides (1 mM d-mannose, d-glucose, d-galactose, d-xylose, d-talose, l-arabinose, d-fructose, l-rhamnose, d-gluconate, Lam2, Cel2, gentiobiose, sucrose, maltose, α,α-trehalose, or lactose) as acceptors on activity toward 2 mM Sop2 were investigated. However, a remarkable increase in specific activity was not found (less than 15% increase in specific activity, data not shown). Then, the glycosynthase activity of the E343G mutant in the presence of α-d-glucosyl fluoride (α-GlcF) as a donor was investigated by TLC analysis. The mutant showed glycosynthase activity only in the presence of glucose as an acceptor among the examined monosaccharides and disaccharides, though α-GlcF itself acted as an acceptor as well (Fig. S8). When pNP-α-Glc was used as an acceptor, a synthetic product was observed. Therefore, various aryl- and alkyl-glucosides, as acceptors, were investigated using the WT IaSGT in the presence of Sop2 as a donor. Reaction products were detected regardless of the anomer of acceptors except methyl-β-Glc (Fig. 2). Considering the kinetic analysis described later, spots of reaction products derived from methyl-β-Glc seemed to overlap those of Sopns. ESI-MS analysis using phenyl-α-Glc and Sop2 detected peaks assigned as the compounds of phenyl-α-Glc linked with one or two Glc units clearly, though the peak corresponding to Glc was small (Fig. S7B). This result is consistent with detection of two spots indicated by arrows below the spot of phenyl-α-Glc in the TLC plate (Fig. 2). We determined the kinetic parameters of the glycosyltransfer activity of IaSGT using Sop2 as a donor and various glucosides as acceptors. The enzyme showed remarkably higher activity toward most of the investigated acceptors than that in the absence of the acceptors (Table 2). The Km values for the α-glucosides were at the range of 0.044−0.38 mM (approximately 300−2600 times smaller than that of Sop2 without the acceptors), and the kcat/Km values for the acceptors were approximately 70−570 times higher than that of Sop2 without an acceptor. In the case of β-glucosides, the Km values were in the range of 0.021−0.15 mM (approximately 770−5500 times smaller than that of Sop2 without the acceptors), and kcat/Km values were approximately 30−800 times higher than that of Sop2 without an acceptor. Overall, β-glucosides showed smaller Km and kcat values than those of α-glucosides. However, the kcat/Km values for acceptors with both types of anomers were within a similar range and were sufficiently large as those of GH enzymes. Therefore, the enzyme can act on a wide range of glucosides with various aryl- and alkyl-groups and both types of anomers as acceptors. In addition, IaSGT comparably acted on amygdalin, a gentiobioside, as an acceptor, though the Km and kcat/Km values were rather larger and smaller than those of the β-glucosides, respectively.Table 2Kinetic parameters of IaSGT for acceptors and donorsSubstratekcat (s−1)Km (mM)kcat/Km (s−1 mM−1)Acceptora0.025 to 0.4 mM acceptors were used.

https://openalex.org/W4206406440,"Carbohydrate metabolism not only functions in supplying cellular energy but also has an important role in maintaining physiological homeostasis and in preventing oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species. Previously, we showed that arthropod embryonic cell lines have high tolerance to H2O2 exposure. Here, we describe that Rhipicephalus microplus tick embryonic cell line (BME26) employs an adaptive glucose metabolism mechanism that confers tolerance to hydrogen peroxide at concentrations too high for other organisms. This adaptive mechanism sustained by glucose metabolism remodeling promotes cell survival and redox balance in BME26 cell line after millimolar H2O2 exposure. The present work shows that this tick cell line could tolerate high H2O2 concentrations by initiating a carbohydrate-related adaptive response. We demonstrate that gluconeogenesis was induced as a compensation strategy that involved, among other molecules, the metabolic enzymes NADP-ICDH, G6PDH, and PEPCK. We also found that this phenomenon was coupled to glycogen accumulation and glucose uptake, supporting the pentose phosphate pathway to sustain NADPH production and leading to cell survival and proliferation. Our findings suggest that the described response is not atypical, being also observed in cancer cells, which highlights the importance of this model to all proliferative cells. We propose that these results will be useful in generating basic biological information to support the development of new strategies for disease treatment and parasite control."
https://openalex.org/W4206930769,"Complex biological systems are considered to be controlled using feedback mechanisms. Reduced systems modelling has been effective to describe these mechanisms, but this approach does not sufficiently encompass the required complexity that is needed to understand how localised control in a biological system can provide global stable states. Self-Organised Criticality (SOC) is a characteristic property of locally interacting physical systems, which readily emerges from changes to its dynamic state due to small nonlinear perturbations. These small changes in the local states, or in local interactions, can greatly affect the total system state of critical systems. It has long been conjectured that SOC is cardinal to biological systems, that show similar critical dynamics, and also may exhibit near power-law relations. Rate Control of Chaos (RCC) provides a suitable robust mechanism to generate SOC systems, which operates at the edge of chaos. The bio-inspired RCC method requires only local instantaneous knowledge of some of the variables of the system, and is capable of adapting to local perturbations. Importantly, connected RCC controlled oscillators can maintain global multi-stable states, and domains where power-law relations may emerge. The network of oscillators deterministically stabilises into different orbits for different perturbations, and the relation between the perturbation and amplitude can show exponential and power-law correlations. This can be considered to be representative of a basic mechanism of protein production and control, that underlies complex processes such as homeostasis. Providing feedback from the global state, the total system dynamic behaviour can be boosted or reduced. Controlled SOC can provide much greater understanding of biological control mechanisms, that are based on distributed local producers, with remote consumers of biological resources, and globally defined control."
https://openalex.org/W4207008723,"The type A glycan modification found in human pathogen Clostridioides difficile consists of a monosaccharide (GlcNAc) that is linked to an N-methylated threonine through a phosphodiester bond. This structure has previously been described on the flagellar protein flagellin C of several C. difficile strains and is important for bacterial motility. The study of post-translational modifications often relies on some type of enrichment strategy; however, a procedure for enrichment of this modification has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we show that an approach that is commonly used in phosphoproteomics, Fe3+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography, also enriches for peptides with this unique post-translational modification. Using LC-MS/MS analyses of immobilized metal affinity chromatography-captured tryptic peptides, we observed not only type A-modified C. difficile flagellin peptides but also a variety of truncated/modified type A structures on these peptides. Using an elaborate set of mass spectrometry analyses, we demonstrate that one of these modifications consists of a type A structure containing a phosphonate (2-aminoethylphosphonate), a modification that is rarely observed and has hitherto not been described in C. difficile. In conclusion, we show that a common enrichment strategy results in reliable identification of peptides carrying a type A glycan modification, and that the results obtained can be used to advance models about its biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4207066887,"Pectus excavatum (PE) is one of the most frequently reported chest deformities. However, limited studies are available with regard to its CT scan findings in cats. In the present research computed tomographic images of the thoraxes of 14 cats diagnosed with PE has been reviewed. This is one of the first studies exploring the use of CT to characterise PE in animals. The aim of this study was to present characteristic CT features of PE in cats. The introduction of new criteria for better assessing thoracic wall deformity-a correction index (CI) and an asymmetry index (AI)-was also proposed. The study revealed a high variety of morphological features of PE in cats. It was demonstrated that among the 14 cats: cranial PE (an atypical location) occurred in seven cats while seven cats had typical (caudal) PE, long PE occurred in five cats, while short PE had nine cats. Of the 14 cats included in the study eight showed symmetric PE, and asymmetric PE was found insix. Thoracic asymmetry was found in six cats. Six cats had sternal torsion. Based on the Vertebral Index moderate or severe PE was revealed in 11 animals. In the group of cats studied the CI ranged from 12.20 to 32.11. The magnitude of AI did not exceed 10% in any of the cats studied. The study confirmed statistically significant differences in the CI values between groups of cats with different degrees of PE severity (p = 0.02). CT examination showed many PE features that have not been discussed so far. The main benefit of CT examination is its ability to reveal asymmetric PE, thoracic asymmetry and sternal torsion. CI and AI provided a clinically useful tool to quantify thoracic wall deformity in order to obtain comparable results between cats with PE."
https://openalex.org/W4226028983,"Lung cancer has the highest incidence and mortality rates among all types of cancer worldwide, and 80%-85% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which has 5-year survival rate of only 5% at advanced stages. Development of new therapeutic agents and strategies is required to enhance the treatment efficiency in patients with NSCLC. Metabolic alterations and anticancer effects of plant hormones and their derivatives have not been investigated in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigated the cytotoxic effects of 11 plant hormones and their derivatives against NSCLC cell lines; ortho-topolin riboside (oTR) showed the highest cytotoxicity among all tested compounds against NSCLC cells. Alteration of metabolites and lipids was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nano electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry in oTR-treated NSCLC cells and a xenograft mouse model. oTR reduced amino acid and pyrimidine synthesis in NSCLC cells and xenograft tumors. Moreover, oTR reduced glycolytic function and decreased mitochondrial respiration function by inhibiting glutamine and fatty acid oxidation. Increased levels of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine species suggested that oTR might act as a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor. In addition, the increased level of phosphatidylserine species implied that phosphatidylserine-mediated apoptosis occurred in oTR-treated NSCLC cells and xenograft tumor. The antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of oTR were mediated by the reduced p-ERK and p-AKT levels and increased cleaved Caspase-3 levels, respectively. This is the first study to investigate the metabolic alterations and anticancer activity of oTR in in vitro and in vivo models of NSCLC. Our results provide basis for the development of oTR-based therapeutic agent for patients with NSCLC."
