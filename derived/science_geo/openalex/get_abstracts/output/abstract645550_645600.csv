https://openalex.org/W2990561329,"The hypoglycemic effect of Phellinus linteus polysaccharide extract (PLPE) has been documented in several previous studies, but the functional interactions among PLPE, gut microbiota, and the hypoglycemic effect remain unclear. We examined the regulatory effect of PLPE on gut microbiota, and the molecular mechanism underlying improvement of insulin resistance, using a type 2 diabetic rat model. Here, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups that were subjected to intervention of saline (normal and model control group), metformin (120 mg/kg.bw), and PLPE (600 mg/kg.bw) by oral administration. After 8 weeks of treatment, PLPE increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by enhancing abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria. SCFAs maintained intestinal barrier function and reduced lipopolysaccharides content in blood, thereby helping to reduce systemic inflammation and reverse insulin resistance. Our findings suggest that PLPE (in which polysaccharides are the major component) has potential application as a prebiotic for regulating gut microbiota composition in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2994271391,"Increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and proliferation of activated microglia have been found in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and animal models of PD, suggesting that targeting of the microglial inflammatory response may result in neuroprotection in PD. Microglial proliferation is regulated by many factors, but colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) has emerged as a primary factor. Using data mining techniques on existing microarray data, we found that mRNA expression of the CSF1R ligand, CSF-1, is increased in the brain of PD patients compared to controls. In two different neurotoxic mouse models of PD, acute MPTP and sub-chronic LPS treatment, mRNA and protein levels of CSF1R and CSF-1 were significantly increased. Treatment with the CSF1R inhibitor GW2580 significantly attenuated MPTP-induced CSF1R activation and Iba1-positive cell proliferation, without a reduction of the basal Iba1-positive population in the substantia nigra. GW2580 treatment also significantly decreased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory factors, without alteration of anti-inflammatory mediators, and significantly attenuated the MPTP-induced loss of dopamine neurons and motor behavioral deficits. Importantly, these effects were observed in the absence of overt microglial depletion, suggesting that targeting CSF1R signaling may be a viable neuroprotective strategy in PD that disrupts pro-inflammatory signaling, but maintains the beneficial effects of microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2998898616,"The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) branches from glycolysis and forms UDP-GlcNAc, the moiety for O-linked β-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) post-translational modifications. An inability to directly measure HBP flux has hindered our understanding of the factors regulating protein O-GlcNAcylation. Our goals in this study were to (i) validate a LC-MS method that assesses HBP flux as UDP-GlcNAc (13C)-molar percent enrichment (MPE) and concentration and (ii) determine whether glucose availability or workload regulate cardiac HBP flux. For (i), we perfused isolated murine working hearts with [U-13C6]glucosamine (1, 10, 50, or 100 μm), which bypasses the rate-limiting HBP enzyme. We observed a concentration-dependent increase in UDP-GlcNAc levels and MPE, with the latter reaching a plateau of 56.3 ± 2.9%. For (ii), we perfused isolated working hearts with [U-13C6]glucose (5.5 or 25 mm). Glycolytic efflux doubled with 25 mm [U-13C6]glucose; however, the calculated HBP flux was similar among the glucose concentrations at ∼2.5 nmol/g of heart protein/min, representing ∼0.003-0.006% of glycolysis. Reducing cardiac workload in beating and nonbeating Langendorff perfusions had no effect on the calculated HBP flux at ∼2.3 and 2.5 nmol/g of heart protein/min, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct measurement of glucose flux through the HBP in any organ. We anticipate that these methods will enable foundational analyses of the regulation of HBP flux and protein O-GlcNAcylation. Our results suggest that in the healthy ex vivo perfused heart, HBP flux does not respond to acute changes in glucose availability or cardiac workload."
https://openalex.org/W2990221960,"Inflammation-resolution is mediated by the balance between specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) like resolvin D1 (RvD1) and pro-inflammatory factors, like leukotriene B4 (LTB4). A key cellular process of inflammation-resolution is efferocytosis. Aging is associated with defective inflammation-resolution and the accumulation of pro-inflammatory senescent cells (SCs). Therefore, understanding mechanism(s) that underpin this impairment is a critical gap. Here, using a model of hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) remote lung injury, we present evidence that aging is associated with heightened inflammation, impaired SPM:LT ratio, defective efferocytosis, and a decrease in MerTK levels in injured lungs. Treatment with RvD1 mitigated I/R lung injury in aging, promoted efferocytosis, and prevented the decrease of MerTK in injured lungs from old mice. Old MerTK cleavage-resistant mice (MerTKCR) exhibited less neutrophils or polymorpho nuclear cells infiltration and had improved efferocytosis compared with old WT controls. Mechanistically, macrophages that were treated with conditioned media (CM) from senescent cells had increased MerTK cleavage, impaired efferocytosis, and a defective RvD1:LTB4 ratio. Macrophages from MerTKCR mice were resistant to CM-induced efferocytosis defects and had an improved RvD1:LTB4 ratio. RvD1-stimulated macrophages prevented CM-induced MerTK cleavage and promoted efferocytosis. Together, these data suggest a new mechanism and a potential therapy to promote inflammation-resolution and efferocytosis in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2990212321,"Histone deacetylases 3 (HDAC3) modulates the acetylation state of histone and non-histone proteins and could be a powerful regulator of the inflammatory process in stroke. Inflammasome activation is a ubiquitous but poorly understood consequence of acute ischemic stroke. Here, we investigated the potential contributions of HDAC3 to inflammasome activation in primary cultured microglia and experimental stroke models. In this study, we documented that HDAC3 expression was increased in microglia of mouse experimental stroke model. Intraperitoneal injection of RGFP966 (a selective inhibitor of HDAC3) decreased infarct size and alleviated neurological deficits after the onset of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In vitro data indicated that LPS stimulation evoked a time-dependent increase of HDAC3 and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome in primary cultured microglia. Interestingly, AIM2 was subjected to spatiotemporal regulation by RGFP966. The ability of RGFP966 to inhibit the AIM2 inflammasome was confirmed in an experimental mouse model of stroke. As expected, AIM2 knockout mice also demonstrated significant resistance to ischemia injury compared with their wild-type littermates. RGFP966 failed to exhibit extra protective effects in AIM2-/- stroke mice. Furthermore, we found that RGFP966 enhanced STAT1 acetylation and subsequently attenuated STAT1 phosphorylation, which may at least partially contributed to the negative regulation of AIM2 by RGFP966. Together, we initially found that RGFP966 alleviated the inflammatory response and protected against ischemic stroke by regulating the AIM2 inflammasome."
https://openalex.org/W2990137739,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and control biological processes (BPs), including fibrogenesis. Kidney fibrosis remains a clinical challenge and miRNAs may represent a valid therapeutic avenue. We show that miR-9-5p protected from renal fibrosis in the mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). This was reflected in reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers, decreased number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, and diminished tubular epithelial cell injury and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-dependent de-differentiation in human kidney proximal tubular (HKC-8) cells. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies in the UUO model revealed that treatment with miR-9-5p prevented the downregulation of genes related to key metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and glycolysis. Studies in human tubular epithelial cells demonstrated that miR-9-5p impeded TGF-β1-induced bioenergetics derangement. The expression of the FAO-related axis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) was reduced by UUO, although preserved by the administration of miR-9-5p. We found that in mice null for the mitochondrial master regulator PGC-1α, miR-9-5p was unable to promote a protective effect in the UUO model. We propose that miR-9-5p elicits a protective response to chronic kidney injury and renal fibrosis by inducing reprogramming of the metabolic derangement and mitochondrial dysfunction affecting tubular epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2992753803,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit reduced exercise capacity, poor physical function and symptoms of fatigue. The mechanisms that contribute to this are not clearly defined but may involve reductions in mitochondrial function, mass and biogenesis. Here we report on the effect of non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) on mitochondrial mass and basal expression of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis compared to a healthy control cohort (HC). In addition, we sought to investigate the effect of a 12-week exercise-training programme on these aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction in a NDD-CKD cohort.For the comparison between NDD-CKD and HC populations, skeletal muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis (VL) of n=16 non-dialysis dependent CKD patient's stage 3b-5 (NDD-CKD) and n=16 healthy controls matched for age, gender and physical activity (HC). To investigate the effect of exercise training, VL biopsies were collected from n=17 NDD-CKD patients before and after a 12-week exercise intervention that was comprised of aerobic exercise (AE) or a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training (CE). Mitochondrial mass was analysed by citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial protein content by Porin expression, whilst the expression of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis were quantified by real-time qPCR. NDD-CKD patients exhibited a significant reduction in mitochondrial mass when compared to HC, coupled to a reduction in PGC-1α, NRF-1, Nrf2, TFam, mfn2 and SOD1/2 gene expression. 12-weeks of exercise training resulted in a significant increase in PGC-1α expression in both groups, with no further changes seen across indicators of mitochondrial biogenesis. No significant changes in mitochondrial mass were observed in response to either exercise programme. NDD-CKD patients exhibit reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass and gene expression of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis compared to HC. These reductions were not restored following 12-weeks of exercise training implying exercise resistance in this cohort. The reasons for this lack of improvement are currently unknown and require further investigation, as reversing the dysregulation of these processes in NDD-CKD may provide a therapeutic opportunity to improve muscle fatigue and dysfunction in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2996111634,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a devastating type of stroke that lacks an effective treatment. Recent evidence has demonstrated that CCL2 is involved in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and propagermanium (PG) as a CCL2 receptor inhibitor is neuroprotective in ischemic stroke. However, whether PG therapy exert effective role in acute ICH still unclear. In this study, our goal was to investigate the potential role of CCL2 and the effects of PG in ICH. Differentially expressed RNAs including CCL2 were detected in human ICH. CCL2 and the activation of p-p38 MAPK and AQP4 expression were analyzed in rats after ICH. Brain water content and BBB integrity as well as neurological function were also examined after PG administration. In addition, the mechanism by which CCL2-mediated BBB injury was further investigated by cell coculture. Our findings showed that PG could effectively reduce brain edema and improve neurobehavioral functions. p-p38 MAPK and AQP4 expression were significantly inhibited by PG in vivo and in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of PG in neuroprotecting the BBB integrity by inhibition of CCL2-CCR2-p38 MAPK pathway following ICH, targeting CCL2 could be developed as a novel treatment for hemorrhagic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2989676031,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a well-known methyltransferase, mediates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and plays a crucial role in several kidney disease models. However, its role in renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury still remains unclear. In this study, we found that EZH2 was positively related to renal I/R injury and inhibition of EZH2 with DZNeP alleviated I/R injury and blocked the activation of oxidative stress and pyroptosis in vivo. Similarly, inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNeP or si-RNA also exerted an inhibitory effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced oxidative stress and pyroptosis in vitro. Moreover, further study revealed that ablation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) suppressed pyroptosis in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line cells exposed to H/R stimulation. Furthermore, Nox4, which was positively related to the generation of ROS, was upregulated during H/R process, while it could be reversed by EZH2 inhibition. Consistently, Nox4-mediated ROS generation was attenuated upon inhibition of EZH2 with DZNeP or si-RNA. Additionally, the transcriptional activity of Nox4 was enhanced by the activation of ALK5/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, which was abolished by ALK5 knockdown in vitro. Finally, EZH2 inhibition blocked H/R and I/R-activated ALK5/Smad2/3 pathway and also resulted in an obvious decrease in the transcriptional activity and protein expression levels of Nox4. In conclusion, our results proved that EZH2 inhibition alleviated renal pyroptosis by blocking Nox4-dependent ROS generation through ALK5/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, indicating that EZH2 could be a potential therapeutic target for renal I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2989866123,"Sodium valproate (VPA), an antiepileptic drug, may cause dose- and time-dependent hepatotoxicity. However, its iatrogenic molecular mechanism and the rescue therapy are disregarded. Recently, it has been demonstrated that sodium butyrate (NaB) reduces hepatic steatosis, improving respiratory capacity and mitochondrial dysfunction in obese mice. Here, we investigated the protective effect of NaB in counteracting VPA-induced hepatotoxicity using in vitro and in vivo models. Human HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to high VPA concentration and treated with NaB. Mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress were evaluated, using Seahorse analyzer, spectrophotometric, and biochemical determinations. Liver protection by NaB was also evaluated in VPA-treated epileptic WAG/Rij rats, receiving NaB for 6 months. NaB prevented VPA toxicity, limiting cell oxidative and mitochondrial damage (ROS, malondialdehyde, SOD activity, mitochondrial bioenergetics), and restoring fatty acid oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α expression and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase activity) in HepG2 cells, primary hepatocytes, and isolated mitochondria. In vivo, NaB confirmed its activity normalizing hepatic biomarkers, fatty acid metabolism, and reducing inflammation and fibrosis induced by VPA. These data support the protective potential of NaB on VPA-induced liver injury, indicating it as valid therapeutic approach in counteracting this common side effect due to VPA chronic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2990553909,"The α2,3-sialylation of N-glycans is considered important but complicated because the functions of the three β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferases, ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, and ST3GAL6, could be compensating for one another. To distinguish their specific functions, we established each individual knockout (KO) cell line. Loss of either the ST3GAL3 or ST3GAL6 genes decreased cell proliferation and colony formation, as opposed to the effect in the ST3GAL4 KO cells. The phosphorylation levels of ERK and AKT were significantly suppressed in the ST3GAL6 KO and ST3GAL3 KO cells, respectively. The cell aggregations were clearly observed in the KO cells, particularly the ST3GAL3 KO and ST3GAL6 KO cells, and the expression levels of E-cadherin and claudin-1 were enhanced in both those cell lines, but were suppressed in the ST3GAL4 KO cells. Those alterations were reversed with an overexpression of each corresponding gene in rescued cells. Of particular interest, the α2,3-sialylation levels of β1 integrin were clearly suppressed in the ST3GAL4 KO cells, but these were increased in the ST3GAL3 KO and ST3GAL6 KO cells, whereas the α2,3-sialylation levels of EGFR were significantly decreased in the ST3GAL6 KO cells. The decrease in α2,3-sialylation increased the α2,6-sialylation on β1, but not EGFR. Furthermore, a cross-restoration of each of the three genes in ST3GAL6 KO cells showed that overexpression of ST3GAL6 sufficiently rescued the total α2,3-sialylation levels, cell morphology, and α2,3-sialylation of EGFR, whereas the α2,3-sialylation levels of β1 were greatly enhanced by an overexpression of ST3GAL4. These results clearly demonstrate that the three α2,3-sialyltransferases modify characteristic target proteins and regulate cell biological functions in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2992652511,"Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory, gynecological disease characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue lesions outside of the uterus. Neutrophils are elevated in the systemic circulation and peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients; however, whether and how neutrophils contribute to endometriosis pathophysiology remain poorly understood. With emerging roles for neutrophils in chronic and sterile inflammatory conditions, we sought to provide in-depth characterization of neutrophil involvement in endometriosis. We demonstrate that neutrophils reside within patient endometriotic lesions and that patient lesions possess a microenvironment that may influence neutrophil recruitment and function. We also provide the first evidence that systemic circulating neutrophils from endometriosis patients display distinct transcriptomic differences compared neutrophils from healthy control subjects. Time course characterization of our syngeneic, immunocompetent mouse model of endometriosis revealed that neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the peritoneal environment early after endometriotic lesion establishment and remain present in murine lesions long term. In vivo neutrophil depletion altered the systemic and peritoneal immune microenvironment of mice with endometriosis as demonstrated by changes in pro-inflammatory and angiogenic mediators. Taken together, these findings highlight a novel role for neutrophils in early events such as angiogenesis and modulation of the local inflammatory environment associated with endometriosis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2989690151,"For protection from inhaled pathogens many strategies have evolved in the airways such as mucociliary clearance and cough. We have previously shown that protective respiratory reflexes to locally released bacterial bitter ""taste"" substances are most probably initiated by tracheal brush cells (BC). Our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of murine BC revealed high expression levels of cholinergic and bitter taste signaling transcripts (Tas2r108, Gnat3, Trpm5). We directly demonstrate the secretion of acetylcholine (ACh) from BC upon stimulation with the Tas2R agonist denatonium. Inhibition of the taste transduction cascade abolished the increase in [Ca2+]i in BC and subsequent ACh-release. ACh-release is regulated in an autocrine manner. While the muscarinic ACh-receptors M3R and M1R are activating, M2R is inhibitory. Paracrine effects of ACh released in response to denatonium included increased [Ca2+]i in ciliated cells. Stimulation by denatonium or with Pseudomonas quinolone signaling molecules led to an increase in mucociliary clearance in explanted tracheae that was Trpm5- and M3R-mediated. We show that ACh-release from BC via the bitter taste cascade leads to immediate paracrine protective responses that can be boosted in an autocrine manner. This mechanism represents the initial step for the activation of innate immune responses against pathogens in the airways."
https://openalex.org/W2991966712,"Conditions such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease are characterized by aberrant smooth muscle contraction. It has proven difficult to develop human cell-based models that mimic acute muscle contraction in 2D in vitro cultures due to the nonphysiological chemical and mechanical properties of lab plastics that do not allow for muscle cell contraction. To enhance the relevance of in vitro models for human disease, we describe how functional 3D smooth muscle tissue that exhibits physiological and pharmacologically relevant acute contraction and relaxation responses can be reproducibly fabricated using a unique microfluidic 3D bioprinting technology. Primary human airway and intestinal smooth muscle cells were printed into rings of muscle tissue at high density and viability. Printed tissues contracted to physiological concentrations of histamine (0.01-100 μM) and relaxed to salbutamol, a pharmacological compound used to relieve asthmatic exacerbations. The addition of TGFβ to airway muscle rings induced an increase in unstimulated muscle shortening and a decreased response to salbutamol, a phenomenon which also occurs in chronic lung diseases. Results indicate that the 3D bioprinted smooth muscle is a physiologically relevant in vitro model that can be utilized to study disease pathways and the effects of novel therapeutics on acute contraction and chronic tissue stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2990479176,"Arginine methylation is a post-translational modification in histone and nonhistone proteins that can affect numerous cellular activities. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (Prmt7), a type III arginine methyltransferase, catalyzes the formation of stable monomethylarginines of histones. The role of PRMT7 in virus-induced innate immunity signaling, however, remains largely unknown. We demonstrate that zebrafish prmt7 could be inhibited by spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) and grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection. The overexpression of prmt7 suppresses cellular antiviral responses that are partially dependent on the arginine methyltransferase activity of prmt7. Consistently, prmt7-null zebrafish were more resistant to SVCV or GCRV infection, exhibiting enhanced expression of key antiviral genes and fewer necrotic cells in the liver and kidney upon viral infection. Furthermore, we established a zebrafish model to investigate grass carp hemorrhagic disease. Our findings suggest that by suppressing the RIG-I-like receptors signaling, zebrafish prmt7 negatively regulates antiviral responses, indicating the vital role of prmt7 and its arginine methyltransferase activity in innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2990636719,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α activation controls hepatic lipid homeostasis, stimulating fatty acid oxidation, and adapting the metabolic response to lipid overload and storage. Here, we investigate the effect of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous PPAR-α ligand, in counteracting hepatic metabolic inflexibility and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by high-fat diet (HFD) in mice. Long-term PEA administration (30 mg/kg/die per os) in HFD mice limited hepatic lipid accumulation, increased energy expenditure, and markedly reduced insulin resistance. In isolated liver mitochondria, we have demonstrated PEA capability to modulate mitochondrial oxidative capacity and energy efficiency, leading to the reduction of intracellular lipid accumulation and oxidative stress. Moreover, we have evaluated the effect of PEA on mitochondrial bioenergetics of palmitate-challenged HepG2 cells, using Seahorse analyzer. In vitro data showed that PEA recovered mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced lipid accumulation in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increasing fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistic studies showed that PEA effect on lipid metabolism was limited by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition, providing evidence for a pivotal role of AMPK in PEA-induced adaptive metabolic setting. All these findings identify PEA as a modulator of hepatic lipid and glucose homeostasis, limiting metabolic inflexibility induced by nutrient overload."
https://openalex.org/W2991030041,"Mechanical damage or infection to the endometrium can lead to the formation of adhesions in the uterine cavity, which may result in reduced reproductive outcome and/or pregnancy complications. The prognosis of this disease is poor due to few effective treatments and the complex environment of endometrium. Heparin-Poloxamer Hydrogel (HP hydrogel) is a nontoxic and biodegradable biomaterial, which has been commonly used as a sustained-release delivery system. In this study, we applied a mini-endometrial curette to scrape the endometrium of rats to mimic the process of curettage in patients. After the establishment of IUA model in rats, we injected the thermo-sensitive hydrogel(E2-HP hydrogel) into the injured uterine cavity and evaluated the therapeutic effect of E2-HP hydrogel on the recovery of IUA. Our results showed that E2-HP hydrogel can significantly facilitate the regeneration of injured endometrium along with inhibiting the cell apoptosis in IUA model. Furthermore, we revealed that E2-HP hydrogel on the recovery of IUA was closely associated with the upregulation of kisspeptin through activating the ERK1/2 and MAPKs p38 pathways. In conclusion, E2-HP hydrogel can effectively transfer E2 into the injured endometrium and it can be considered as a promising therapeutic method for the women with intrauterine adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2991048312,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe motor and sensory dysfunction, yet there are no effective therapies currently due to the failure of reconstructing the interruption of the neuroanatomical circuit. While neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been considered a potential strategy to repair the neural circuit after SCI, the efficacy of this strategy remains unproven. The main reason is that most of the transplanted NSC differentiates into astrocyte rather than neuron in the microenvironment of SCI. Our results demonstrated that Wnt4 significantly promotes the differentiation of NSC into neuron by activating both β-catenin and MAPK/JNK pathways and suppressing the activation of Notch signaling, which is acknowledged as prevention of NSC differentiation into neuron, through downregulating NICD expression, translocating and preventing the combination of NICD and RbpJ in nucleus. In addition, Wnt4 rescues the negative effect of Jagged, the ligand of Notch signaling, to promote neuronal differentiation. Moreover, in vivo study, transplantation of Wnt4-modified NSC efficaciously repairs the injured spinal cord and recovers the motor function of hind limbs after SCI. This study sheds new light into mechanisms that Wnt4-modified NSC transplantation is sufficient to repair the injured spinal cord and recover the motor dysfunction after SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2993357757,"Gut microbiota and intestinal barrier co-develop after birth, establishing a homeostatic state whereby mucosal cells cohabit with commensal bacteria. We hypothesized that this post-natal co-development follows different timings depending on the intestinal site considered. Jejunal, ileal, and colonic luminal contents and mucosa were sampled in suckling piglets at post-natal day (PND) 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28. Jejunal, ileal, and colonic luminal microbiota (evaluated by 16S DNA sequencing followed by beta-diversity analysis) clustered at PND2 but colonic microbiota diverge afterwards (P < .05). Mucosal permeability, evaluated in Ussing chambers, increased with age in the jejunum and ileum (P < .05) but not the colon. Expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) exhibited different patterns (gradual or sharp increase, decrease, or no change with age, P < .05) depending on PRR and intestinal site considered. Principal component analysis of mucosa data revealed clear clustering of colonic samples, irrespective of the age and clustering of jejunal and ileal samples, with gradual changes with age. Correlation analysis highlighted three families correlating with mucosal parameters: Enterobacteriaceae in the jejunum, Peptostreptococcaceae in the ileum, and Micrococcaceae in the colon. In conclusion, small and large intestine display close microbiota composition early in life but distinct mucosal phenotype and follow very different post-natal development."
https://openalex.org/W2989897376,"The past decade, it has become evident that circadian rhythms within metabolically active tissues are very important for physical health. However, although shift work has also been associated with an increased risk of fractures, circadian rhythmicity has not yet been extensively studied in bone. Here, we investigated which genes are rhythmically expressed in bone, and whether circadian disruption by shifts in light-dark cycle affects bone turnover and structure in mice. Our results demonstrate diurnal expression patterns of clock genes (Rev-erbα, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Clock), as well as genes involved in osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast proliferation and function (Rankl, Opg, Ctsk), and osteocyte function (c-Fos) in bone. Weekly alternating light-dark cycles disrupted rhythmic clock gene expression in bone and caused a reduction in plasma levels of procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP), suggestive of a reduced bone turnover. These effects coincided with an altered trabecular bone structure and increased cortical mineralization after 15 weeks of light-dark cycles, which may negatively affect bone strength in the long term. Collectively, these results show that a physiological circadian rhythm is important to maintain bone health, which stresses the importance of further investigating the association between shift work and skeletal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2991825922,"Bacterial infectious diseases can lead to death or to serious illnesses. These outcomes are partly the consequence of pore-forming toxins, which are secreted by the pathogenic bacteria (eg, pneumolysin of Streptococcus pneumoniae). Pneumolysin binds to cholesterol within the plasma membrane of host cells and assembles to form trans-membrane pores, which can lead to Ca2+ influx and cell death. Membrane repair mechanisms exist that limit the extent of damage. Immune cells which are essential to fight bacterial infections critically rely on survival mechanisms after detrimental pneumolysin attacks. This study investigated the susceptibility of different immune cell types to pneumolysin. As a model system, we used the lymphoid T-cell line Jurkat, and myeloid cell lines U937 and THP-1. We show that Jurkat T cells are highly susceptible to pneumolysin attack. In contrast, myeloid THP-1 and U937 cells are less susceptible to pneumolysin. In line with these findings, human primary T cells are shown to be more susceptible to pneumolysin attack than monocytes. Differences in susceptibility to pneumolysin are due to (I) preferential binding of pneumolysin to Jurkat T cells and (II) cell type specific plasma membrane repair capacity. Myeloid cell survival is mostly dependent on Ca2+ induced expelling of damaged plasma membrane areas as microvesicles. Thus, in myeloid cells, first-line defense cells in bacterial infections, a potent cellular repair machinery ensures cell survival after pneumolysin attack. In lymphoid cells, which are important at later stages of infections, less efficient repair mechanisms and enhanced toxin binding renders the cells more sensitive to pneumolysin."
https://openalex.org/W2990694391,"In a recent study, we identified a fucosylated damage-associated ligand exposed by ischemia on renal tubule epithelial cells, which after recognition by collectin-11 (CL-11 or collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1)), initiates complement activation and acute kidney injury. We exploited the ability to increase the local tissue concentration of free l-fucose following systemic administration, in order to block ligand binding by local CL-11 and prevent complement activation. We achieved a thirty-five-fold increase in the intrarenal concentration of l-fucose following an IP bolus given before the ischemia induction procedure - a concentration found to significantly block in vitro binding of CL-11 on hypoxia-stressed renal tubule cells. At this l-fucose dose, complement activation and acute post-ischemic kidney injury are prevented, with additional protection achieved by a second bolus after the induction procedure. CL-11−/− mice gained no additional protection from l-fucose administration, indicating that the mechanism of l-fucose therapy was largely CL-11-dependent. The hypothesis is that a high dose of l-fucose delivered to the kidney obstructs the carbohydrate recognition site on CL-11 thereby reducing complement-mediated damage following ischemic insult. Further work will examine the utility in preventing post-ischemic injury during renal transplantation, where acute kidney injury is known to correlate with poor graft survival."
https://openalex.org/W2990930782,"Base editors, composed of a cytidine deaminase or an evolved adenine deaminase fused to Cas9 nickase, enable efficient C-to-T or A-to-G conversion in various organisms. However, the NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirement of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) substantially limits the target sites suitable for base editing. Quite recently, a new engineered SpCas9-NG variant, which can recognize minimal NG PAMs more efficiently than the present xCas9 variant. Here, we investigated the efficiency and PAM compatibility of SpCas9-NG-assisted cytidine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs) in rabbits. In this study, we showed that NG-BE4max and NG-ABEmax systems can achieve a targeted mutation efficiency of 75%-100% and 80%-100% with excellent PAM compatibility of NGN PAMs in rabbit embryos, respectively. In addition, both base editors were successfully applied to create new rabbit models with precise point mutations, demonstrating their high efficiency and expanded genome-targeting scope in rabbits. Meanwhile, NG-ABEmax can be used to precisely mimic human Hoxc13 p.Q271R missense mutation in Founder (F0) rabbits, which is arduous for conventional ABEs to achieve due to a NGA PAM requirement. Collectively, NG-BE4max and NG-ABEmax systems provide promising tools to perform efficient base editing with expanded targeting scope in rabbits and enhances its capacity to model human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2992662863,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are increasingly multidrug resistant and cause healthcare-associated pneumonia, a major risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Adenosine is a signaling nucleoside with potential opposing effects; adenosine can either protect against acute lung injury via adenosine receptors or cause lung injury via adenosine receptors or equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT)-dependent intracellular adenosine uptake. We hypothesized that blockade of intracellular adenosine uptake by inhibition of ENT1/2 would increase adenosine receptor signaling and protect against P. aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury. We observed that P. aeruginosa (strain: PA103) infection induced acute lung injury in C57BL/6 mice in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Using ENT1/2 pharmacological inhibitor, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI), and ENT1-null mice, we demonstrated that ENT blockade elevated lung adenosine levels and significantly attenuated P. aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury, as assessed by lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, BAL protein levels, BAL inflammatory cell counts, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pulmonary function (total lung volume, static lung compliance, tissue damping, and tissue elastance). Using both agonists and antagonists directed against adenosine receptors A2AR and A2BR, we further demonstrated that ENT1/2 blockade protected against P. aeruginosa -induced acute lung injury via activation of A2AR and A2BR. Additionally, ENT1/2 chemical inhibition and ENT1 knockout prevented P. aeruginosa-induced lung NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, inhibition of inflammasome prevented P. aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury. Our results suggest that targeting ENT1/2 and NLRP3 inflammasome may be novel strategies for prevention and treatment of P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia and subsequent ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W2990032215,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene and one of the most frequently mutated/deleted genes in human prostate cancer (PCa). However, how PTEN deletion would impact the epigenome and transcriptome alterations remain unknown. This hypothesis was tested in a prostate-specific PTEN-/- (KO) mouse prostatic adenocarcinoma model through DNA methyl-Seq and RNA-Seq analyses. Examination of cancer genomic datasets revealed that PTEN is expressed at lower levels in PTEN-deleted tumor samples than in normal solid tissue samples. Methylome and transcriptome profiling identified several inflammatory responses and immune response signaling pathways, including NF-kB signaling, IL-6 signaling, LPS/IL-1-mediated inhibition of RXR Function, PI3K in B lymphocytes, iCOS-iCOSL in T helper cells, and the role of NFAT in regulating the immune response, were affected by PTEN deletion. Importantly, a small subset of genes that showed DNA hypermethylation or hypomethylation was correlated with decreased or increased gene expression including CXCL1. quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of representative genes validated the RNA-Seq results. Histopathological examinations showed that the severity of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and inflammation development gradually increased as PTEN null mice aged. Collectively, these findings suggest that loss of PTEN drives global changes in DNA CpG methylation and transcriptomic gene expression and highly associated with several inflammatory and immune molecular pathways during PCa development. These biomarkers could be valuable molecular targets for cancer drug discovery and development against PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2991297139,"To explore the mutation characteristics of H. pylori resistance-related genes to antibiotics of clarithromycin (CAM), levofloxacin (LVX) and metronidazole, 23SrRNA, gyrA, gyrB, rdxA, and frxA genes were amplified and sequenced, respectively. Molecular docking study was performed to explore molecular interactions between chemotherapeutic agents and target proteins. In the CAM-resistant strains, the mutation rate in site A2143G was 74.2% (n = 23). The interactions in sites of G1949A, C1953T, and G2211T with CAM were weaker after mutation. In the LVX-resistant strains, the mutation rates in 87 (N to K/I) and 91 (D to N/Y/G) of gyrA were 28.6% (n = 16) and 12.5% (n = 7), respectively. We could infer by docking studies that N87 K/I, D91Y/G/N, D99N, and D143E mutations in GyrA protein all had weakened interaction with LVX. The mutation types of RdxA protein consisted of protein truncation caused by premature stop codons (n = 26, 33.3%), frameshift mutations (n = 8, 10.3%), FMN-binding sites (n = 16, 20.5%), and the others (n = 11, 14.1%). Docking analysis showed that some mutations in those four types of RdxA protein could reduce interaction with MNZ, and play a significant role in antibiotic resistance. What's more, we performed natural transformation with some of these mutated DNA fragments to see if they really impact susceptibility to antibiotics. Our study suggested that in addition to the reported mutation sites, H. pylori antibiotic resistance in this region may also be associated with changes in some new sites. Our study provides novel ideas and methods for the identification of H. pylori resistance-related mutations, and also clues and basis for further investigation on specific molecular mechanism."

It elicits diverse biological responses, including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Adiponectin consists of a globular domain and a collagen-like domain, and it occurs in three major oligomeric forms that self-assemble: trimers, hexamers, and high-molecular-weight oligomers. Adiponectin has been reported to bind to two seven-transmembrane domain receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, as well as to the protein T-cadherin, which is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system and binds only the high-molecular-weight form of adiponectin. The molecular mechanisms underlying this specificity remain unclear. Here we used a combination of X-ray crystallography and protein engineering to define the details of adiponectin's interaction with T-cadherin. We found that T-cadherin binds to the globular domain of adiponectin, relying on structural stabilization of this domain by bound metal ions. Moreover, we show that the adiponectin globular domain can be engineered to enhance its binding affinity for T-cadherin. These results help to define the molecular basis for the interaction between adiponectin and T-cadherin, and our engineered globular domain variants may be useful tools for further investigating adiponectin's functions.

https://openalex.org/W2990420428,"Proteins specialized in the detection, generation, or stabilization of membrane curvature play important roles in establishing various morphologies of cells and cellular organelles. Primary cilia are cellular organelles that protrude from the cell surface using a microtubule-based cytoskeleton called the axoneme as a structural support. It is unclear whether the integrity of the high curvature of the ciliary membrane depends on membrane curvature-related proteins. Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 4B (CHMP4B), a subunit of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), can stabilize membrane curvature. Here we show that CHMP4B is involved in the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia. CHMP4B was localized to primary cilia in mammalian cells. Knockdown of CHMP4B interfered with cilium assembly and also caused fragmentation of preexisting cilia. By contrast, cilium formation was unaffected by the interruption of the ESCRT-dependent endocytic degradation pathway. Morpholino (MO)-mediated CHMP4B depletion in zebrafish embryos induced characteristic phenotypes of ciliary defects such as curved body axis, hydrocephalus, otolith malformation, and kidney cyst. Our study reveals a new role for the multifunctional protein CHMP4B as a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of primary cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2990829922,"Drinking behavior and osmotic regulatory mechanisms exhibit clear daily variation which is necessary for achieving the homeostatic osmolality. In mammals, the master clock in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei has long been held as the main driver of circadian (24 h) rhythms in physiology and behavior. However, rhythmic clock gene expression in other brain sites raises the possibility of local circadian control of neural activity and function. The subfornical organ (SFO) and the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) are two sensory circumventricular organs (sCVOs) that play key roles in the central control of thirst and water homeostasis, but the extent to which they are subject to intrinsic circadian control remains undefined. Using a combination of ex vivo bioluminescence and in vivo gene expression, we report for the first time that the SFO contains an unexpectedly robust autonomous clock with unusual spatiotemporal characteristics in core and noncore clock gene expression. Furthermore, putative single‐cell oscillators in the SFO and OVLT are strongly rhythmic and require action potential‐dependent communication to maintain synchrony. Our results reveal that these thirst‐controlling sCVOs possess intrinsic circadian timekeeping properties and raise the possibility that these contribute to daily regulation of drinking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2991088903,"Preterm infants are vulnerable to inflammation-induced white matter injury (WMI), which is associated with neurocognitive impairment and increased risk of neuropsychiatric diseases in adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, play a role in normal development and modulate the response to pathological challenges. Our aims were to determine how WMI triggered DNA methylation alterations in brains of neonatal rats and if such changes persisted over time. We used a robust model of WMI by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or sterile saline in the corpus callosum of 3-day-old (P3) rat pups. Brains were collected 24 hours (P4) and 21 days post-injection (P24). We extracted genomic DNA from the brain to establish genome-wide quantitative DNA methylation profiles using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Neonatal LPS exposure induced a persistent increased methylation of genes related to nervous system development and a reduced methylation of genes associated with inflammatory pathways. These findings suggest that early-life neuroinflammatory exposure impacts the cerebral methylation landscape with determining widespread epigenetic modifications especially in genes related to neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2991636429,"An inverse correlation between helminth infection and the autoimmune disease appears to be contributed by the anti-inflammatory factors produced by these organisms. Suppressing osteoclast function without affecting the systemic immunological response is an emerging therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We observed that a synthetic peptide corresponding to 34 amino acids of C-terminal sequence of Fasciola helminth defense molecule-1 (C-FhHDM-1) inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and lysosomal acidification with an attendant upregulation of sequestome1/p62, a negative regulator of NF-κB expression. C-FhHDM-1 also suppressed RANKL production from osteoblasts. Macrophages are the major inflammatory cells in the joints of RA and C-FhHDM-1 suppressed ICAM-1 (an inflammatory surrogate) expression in these cells. In a murine model of collagen II-induced arthritis (CIA), C-FhHDM-1 improved clinical score, protected against cartilage destruction, and maintained bone mass and bone architecture of joints compared with the CIA group. C-FhHDM-1 suppressed the CIA-induced expression of TNF, IL-17, and IFN-γ in joints but not their serum levels. The peptide also had no effect on the CIA-induced suppression of T regulatory response. We conclude that C-FhHDM-1 has a joint-specific protective effect in experimental arthritis without mitigating systemic inflammation, and thus could become an adjuvant anti-arthritis therapy to prevent RA-induced osteopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2990561778,"Tannerella forsythia is a periodontopathogen that expresses miropin, a protease inhibitor in the serpin superfamily. In this study, we show that miropin is also a specific and efficient inhibitor of plasmin; thus, it represents the first proteinaceous plasmin inhibitor of prokaryotic origin described to date. Miropin inhibits plasmin through the formation of a stable covalent complex triggered by cleavage of the Lys368-Thr369 (P2-P1) reactive site bond with a stoichiometry of inhibition of 3.8 and an association rate constant (kass) of 3.3 × 105 M-1s-1. The inhibition of the fibrinolytic activity of plasmin was nearly as effective as that exerted by α2-antiplasmin. Miropin also acted in vivo by reducing blood loss in a mice tail bleeding assay. Importantly, intact T. forsythia cells or outer membrane vesicles, both of which carry surface-associated miropin, strongly inhibited plasmin. In intact bacterial cells, the antiplasmin activity of miropin protects envelope proteins from plasmin-mediated degradation. In summary, in the environment of periodontal pockets, which are bathed in gingival crevicular fluid consisting of 70% of blood plasma, an abundance of T. forsythia in the bacterial biofilm can cause local inhibition of fibrinolysis, which could have possible deleterious effects on the tooth-supporting structures of the periodontium."
https://openalex.org/W2990866622,"Retinopathies remain major causes of visual impairment in diabetic patients and premature infants. Introduction of anti-angiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has transformed therapy for these proliferative retinopathies. However, limitations associated with anti-VEGF medications require to unravel new pathways of vessel growth to identify potential drug targets. Here, we investigated the role of Wnt/Frizzled-7 (Fzd7) pathway in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Using transgenic mice, which enabled endothelium-specific and time-specific Fzd7 deletion, we demonstrated that Fzd7 controls both vaso-obliteration and neovascular phases (NV). Deletion of Fzd7 at P12, after the ischemic phase of OIR, prevented formation of aberrant neovessels into the vitreous by suppressing proliferation of endothelial cells (EC) in tufts. Next we validated in vitro two Frd7 blocking strategies: a monoclonal antibody (mAbFzd7) against Fzd7 and a soluble Fzd7 receptor (CRD). In vivo a single intravitreal microinjection of mAbFzd7 or CRD significantly attenuated retinal neovascularization (NV) in mice with OIR. Molecular analysis revealed that Fzd7 may act through the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and Jagged1 expression to control EC proliferation in extra-retinal neovessels. We identified Fzd7/β-catenin signaling as new regulator of pathological retinal NV. Fzd7 appears to be a potent pharmacological target to prevent or treat aberrant angiogenesis of ischemic retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2993290346,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the leading cause of renal failure, and quite a few patients will advance to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the long term. Here, we explore the roles and mechanisms of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) during repeated cisplatin (CP) induced AKI to CKD transition (AKI-CKD). Previously, we reported that murine double minute 2 (MDM2), an E3-ubiquitin ligase, is involved in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, whether tubular MDM2 is implicated in AKI-CKD is undefined. Currently, we confirmed that during AKI-CKD, MDM2 shifts from nucleus to cell membrane in TECs both in vivo and in vitro. Whereas regulating MDM2 distribution chemically or genetically has a prominent impact on tubular disorders. And then we investigated the mechanisms of the above findings. First, in the nucleus, repeated CP administration leads to MDM2 reduction with escalated p53 and cell cycle G2/M arrest. On the other hand, multiple CP treatment increases the level of membranous MDM2 with ensuing integrin β8 degradation and TGF-β1 activation. More interestingly, anchoring MDM2 on cell membranes can mimic the reduction of integrin β8 arousing by repeated CP exposure. Collectively, our findings provided the evidence that tubular MDM2 subcellular shuttling is involved in AKI-CKD through p53-G2/M arrest and integrin β8 mediated TGF-β1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2989598733,"Whereas much is known about the genes regulated by ΔNp63α in keratinocytes, how ΔNp63α is regulated is less clear. During studies with the hydroxylase, factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (FIH-1), we observed increases in epidermal ΔNp63α expression along with proliferative capacity in a conditional FIH-1 transgenic mouse. Conversely, loss of FIH-1 in vivo and in vitro attenuated ΔNp63α expression. To elucidate the FIH-1/p63 relationship, BioID proteomics assays identified FIH-1 binding partners that had the potential to regulate p63 expression. FIH-1 interacts with two previously unknown partners, Plectin1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) leading to the regulation of ΔNp63α expression. Two known interactors of FIH-1, apoptosis-stimulating of P53 protein 2 (ASPP2) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), were also identified. Knockdown of ASPP2 upregulated ΔNp63α and reversed the decrease in ΔNp63α by FIH-1 depletion. Additionally, FIH-1 regulates growth arrest and DNA damage-45 alpha (GADD45α), a negative regulator of ΔNp63α by interacting with HDAC1. GADD45α knockdown rescued reduction in ΔNp63α by FIH-1 depletion. Collectively, our data reveal that FIH-1 positively regulates ΔNp63α in keratinocytes via variety of signaling partners: (a) Plectin1/STAT1, (b) ASPP2, and (c) HDAC1/GADD45α signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2990514041,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote neovascularization and tissue repair by migrating to vascular injury sites; therefore, factors that enhance EPC homing to damaged tissues are of interest. Here, we provide evidence of the prominent role of the Netrin-4 (NTN4)-Unc-5 Netrin receptor B (UNC5B) axis in EPC-specific promotion of ischemic neovascularization. Our results showed that NTN4 promoted the proliferation, chemotactic migration, and paracrine effects of small EPCs (SEPCs) and significantly increased the incorporation of large EPCs (LEPCs) into tubule networks. Additionally, NTN4 prominently augmented neovascularization in mice with hindlimb ischemia by increasing the homing of exogenously transplanted EPCs to the ischemic limb and incorporating EPCs into vessels. Moreover, silencing of UNC5B, an NTN4 receptor, abrogated the NTN4-induced cellular activities of SEPCs in vitro and blood-flow recovery and neovascularization in vivo in ischemic muscle by reducing EPC homing and incorporation. These findings suggest NTN4 as an EPC-based therapy for treating angiogenesis-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2991185765,"Unlike many epithelial tissues, the corneal epithelium is insulin insensitive, meaning it does not require insulin for glucose uptake. In this study, we show that insulin differentially regulates mitochondrial respiration in two human mucosal epithelial cell types: insulin-insensitive corneal epithelial cells and insulin-sensitive bronchial epithelial cells. In both cell types, insulin blocks glycogen synthase kinase beta (GSK3β) activity. In the corneal epithelium however, insulin selectively regulates PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK-1)-mediated mitophagy and mitochondrial accumulation of insulin receptor (INSR). While insulin blocked basal levels of PINK-1-mediated mitophagy in bronchial epithelial cells, mitochondrial trafficking of INSR was not detectable. We further show that in corneal epithelia, INSR interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) in mitochondria and that INSR knockdown triggers robust mitochondrial fragmentation, alterations in mitochondrial polarization, and blocks the induction of PINK-1-mediated mitophagy. Collectively, these data demonstrate that INSR interacts with VDAC1 to mediate mitochondrial stability. We also demonstrate unique interactions between VDAC1 and other receptor tyrosine kinases, indicating a novel role for this family of receptors in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2993489479,"Diabetes is a global medical problem that causes many deaths every year. Complications caused by diabetes are serious and affect patients' quality of life. Diabetes mellitus erectile dysfunction (DMED) affects more than half of male diabetes patients. In this study, we determined the role of microRNA-874-3p (miR-874-3p) and nuclear protein-1 (Nupr1) in streptozocin-induced DMED rats. Control rats received equal amount of vehicle. These rats were also injected with lentiviral vector or agomir to silence or overexpress miR-874-3p or Nupr1. Apomorphine (100 μg/kg, s.c.) was used to induce erection and time of erection was recorded. Intracavernosal and mean arterial pressure ratio (ICP/MAP) were also recorded. O2- level and concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) were detected using lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence method and Colorimetry. Rat cavernosum tissues were collected for subsequent experiments. Cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CSMCs) were also used for in vitro experiments. Nupr1 was found highly expressed (by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis) in cavernosum tissues from DMED rats. Nupr1 silencing improved the ICP/MAP ratio and erection time. Nupr1 silencing also reduced CSMC apoptosis (by TUNEL assay) as well as decreased O2- level and TBAR concentration. Nupr1 was targeted and inhibited by miR-874-3p (by luciferase activity and RNA immunoprecipitation assays), which was downregulated in DMED. miR-874-3p downregulation was due to increased methylation at the promoter region (methylation-specific PCR). miR-874-3p overexpression improved erection time and reduced apoptosis. In summary, miR-874-3p was downregulated which led to increased apoptosis and erectile dysfunction in DMED rats, through inhibition of Nupr1-mediated pathway. This study may also provide a new therapeutic direction for the treatment of DMED."
https://openalex.org/W2994196602,"Zebrafish skeletal muscles are broadly divided into slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers. The slow fibers, which express a slow fiber-specific myosin heavy chain 1 (Smyhc1), are the first group of muscle fibers formed during myogenesis. To uncover Smyhc1 function in muscle growth, we generated three mutant alleles with reading frame shift mutations in the zebrafish smyhc1 gene using CRISPR. The mutants showed shortened sarcomeres with no thick filaments and M-lines in slow fibers of the mutant embryos. However, the formation of slow muscle precursors and expression of other slow muscle genes were not affected and fast muscles appeared normal. The smyhc1 mutant embryos and larvae showed reduced locomotion and food intake. The mutant larvae exhibited increased lethality of incomplete penetrance. Approximately 2/5 of the homozygous mutants were viable and grew into reproductive adults. These adult mutants displayed a typical pattern of slow and fast muscle fiber distribution, and regained normal slow muscle formation. Together, our studies indicate that Smyhc1 is essential for myogenesis in embryonic slow muscles, and loss of Smyhc1 results in defective sarcomere assembly, reduces larval motility and fish survival, but has no visible impact on muscle growth in juvenile and adult zebrafish that escape the larval lethality."

We aimed to study the role of the pro-ANP convertase Corin in the pathogenesis of DN. Corin and ANP expression in DN rat kidneys and high-glucose-treated HK-2 cells was analyzed by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining. The effect of Corin-siRNA or ANP-siRNA HK-2 cells on EA.hy926 cell migration was determined by scratch-wound healing assay. The expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in EA.hy926 cells treated with conditioned medium from Corin-siRNA- or ANP-siRNA-transfected HK-2 cells was determined by western blotting. We found a significant reduction in Corin and ANP expression in DN rat kidneys. These results were recapitulated in HK-2 cells treated with high glucose. EA.hy926 cells treated with conditioned medium from Corin-deficient HK-2 cells had inhibited migration, increased MAPK activity, and decreased eNOS activity. Similar effects were observed with ANP-siRNA transfection. Finally, adding ANP to the Corin-deficient HK-2 conditioned medium rescued the above defects, indicating that Corin mediates its effects through ANP. In conclusion, Corin plays a renoprotective role through pro-ANP processing, and defects in Corin cause endothelial dysfunction through MAPK and eNOS signaling in DN."
https://openalex.org/W2991287538,"The RhoA/ROCK-mediated actin cytoskeleton dynamics have been implicated in adipogenesis. The two ROCK isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, are highly homologous. The contribution of ROCK2 to adipogenesis in vivo has not been elucidated. The present study aimed at the in vivo and in vitro roles of ROCK2 in the regulation of adipogenesis and the development of obesity. We performed molecular, histological, and metabolic analyses in ROCK2+/- and ROCK2+/KD mouse models, the latter harboring an allele with a kinase-dead (KD) mutation. Both ROCK2+/- and ROCK2+/KD mouse models showed a lean body mass phenotype during aging, associated with increased amounts of beige cells in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) and increased thermogenic gene expression in all fat depots. ROCK2+/- mice on a high-fat diet showed increased energy expenditure accompanying by reduced obesity, and improved insulin sensitivity. In vitro differentiated ROCK2+/- stromal-vascular (SV) cells revealed increased beige adipogenesis associated with increased thermogenic gene expressions. Treatment with a selective ROCK2 inhibitor, KD025, to inhibit ROCK2 activity in differentiated SV cells reproduced the pro-beige phenotype of ROCK2+/- SV cells. In conclusion, ROCK2 activity-mediated actin cytoskeleton dynamics contribute to the inhibition of beige adipogenesis in WAT, and also promotes age-related and diet-induced fat mass gain and insulin resistance."

DNMT3A and DNMT3B recognizes H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) through PWWP domain to exert de novo DNA methyltransferase activity and establish imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Since decrease of H3K36me3 and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in SoS were observed, hypomethylation of imprinted DMRs in SoS was suggested. We explored DNA methylation status of 28 imprinted DMRs in 31 SoS patients with NSD1 defect and found that hypomethylation of IGF2-DMR0 and IG-DMR in a substantial proportion of SoS patients. Luciferase assay revealed that IGF2-DMR0 enhanced transcription from the IGF2 P0 promoter but not the P3 and P4 promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) revealed active enhancer histone modifications at IGF2-DMR0, with high enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). CRISPR-Cas9 epigenome editing revealed that specifically induced hypomethylation at IGF2-DMR0 increased transcription from the P0 promoter but not the P3 and P4 promoters. NSD1 knockdown suggested that NSD1 targeted IGF2-DMR0; however, IGF2-DMR0 DNA methylation and IGF2 expression were unaltered. This study could elucidate the function of IGF2-DMR0 as a DNA methylation dependent, P0 promoter-specific enhancer. NSD1 may play a role in the establishment or maintenance of IGF2-DMR0 methylation during the postimplantation period."

It showed very low toxicity in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo; in cytotoxicity tests, its EC50 was as much as 22 times better than that of SET-M33, a peptide with the same amino-acid sequence, but synthesized in tetra-branched form (638 vs 28 µM). In in vivo and ex vivo experiments, SET-M33DIM cleared P. aeruginosa infection, significantly reducing signs of sepsis in animals, and restoring cell viability in lung tissue after bacterial challenge.

https://openalex.org/W3000271207,"Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin and josamycin, are natural polyketide products harboring 14- to 16-membered macrocyclic lactone rings to which various sugars are attached. These antibiotics are used extensively in the clinic because of their ability to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. More recently, some macrolides have been shown to also possess anti-inflammatory and other therapeutic activities in mammalian cells. To better understand the targets and effects of this drug class in mammalian cells, we used a genome-wide shRNA screen in K562 cancer cells to identify genes that modulate cellular sensitivity to josamycin. Among the most sensitizing hits were proteins involved in mitochondrial translation and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, glycolysis, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. Further analysis revealed that cells treated with josamycin or other antibacterial agents exhibited impaired oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic shifts to glycolysis. Interestingly, we observed that knockdown of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) gene, which contributes to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, sensitized cells only to josamycin but not to other antibacterial agents. There is a growing interest in better characterizing the therapeutic effects and toxicities of antibiotics in mammalian cells to guide new applications in both cellular and clinical studies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an unbiased genome-wide screen to investigate the effects of a clinically used antibiotic on human cells. Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin and josamycin, are natural polyketide products harboring 14- to 16-membered macrocyclic lactone rings to which various sugars are attached. These antibiotics are used extensively in the clinic because of their ability to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. More recently, some macrolides have been shown to also possess anti-inflammatory and other therapeutic activities in mammalian cells. To better understand the targets and effects of this drug class in mammalian cells, we used a genome-wide shRNA screen in K562 cancer cells to identify genes that modulate cellular sensitivity to josamycin. Among the most sensitizing hits were proteins involved in mitochondrial translation and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, glycolysis, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. Further analysis revealed that cells treated with josamycin or other antibacterial agents exhibited impaired oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic shifts to glycolysis. Interestingly, we observed that knockdown of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) gene, which contributes to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, sensitized cells only to josamycin but not to other antibacterial agents. There is a growing interest in better characterizing the therapeutic effects and toxicities of antibiotics in mammalian cells to guide new applications in both cellular and clinical studies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an unbiased genome-wide screen to investigate the effects of a clinically used antibiotic on human cells. A subgroup of macrolide antibiotics, characterized by 14- to 16-membered macrocycles to which various sugar substituents are attached, are among the most widely used antibacterial agents to date (Fig. 1A). In the early 1950s, erythromycin, a 14-membered macrolide, was isolated from Saccharopolyspora erythraea and became the first macrolide adopted clinically (1Culić O. Eraković V. Parnham M.J. Anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotics.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 429 (11698042): 209-22910.1016/S0014-2999(01)01321-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Usually serving as bacteriostatic agents, macrolides bind the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit within the polypeptide exit tunnel and inhibit protein synthesis in the pathogen (2Hansen J.L.

In addition to broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and atypical bacteria, these antibiotics have excellent tissue penetration, especially newer antibacterial agents, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin (1Culić O.

In addition to the three main macrolide antibiotics approved for human use in the United States, at least five others, including spiramcyin and josamycin (also known as leucomycin A3), are used clinically in other parts of the world (Fig. 1A) (7Zarogoulidis P.

In parallel, targeted in vitro analyses of immune and other cells exposed to macrolides have ascribed the observed immunomodulatory effects to changes in cytokine production, adhesion molecule expression, neutrophil chemotaxis, and more; mechanisms proposed to explain these changes include shifts in intracellular calcium levels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 5The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseKDknockdownHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneANOVAanalysis of variancecasTLECas9 high-throughput maximum likelihood estimatorRT-qPCRquantitative reverse transcription PCR. signaling, and the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB (1Culić O.

Over the past few years, many unbiased proteomic and genomic methods have been advanced to interrogate the interactions of bioactive small molecules with cellular protein targets. These approaches can generally be classified into affinity-based biochemical methods, computational inference methods based on gene expression or ligand similarity, and functional genomic methods (23Schenone M. Dančík V. Wagner B.K. Clemons P.A. Target identification and mechanism of action in chemical biology and drug discovery.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 (23508189): 232-24010.1038/nchembio.1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Within the last category, high-throughput screens utilizing genome-wide shRNA knockdown (KD) and CRISPR-Cas9 KO libraries have become especially popular (24Jost M. Weissman J.S.

By characterizing how gene KD or KO affect cellular sensitivity to a drug, one can glean insights into both a drug's direct subcellular binding targets as well as its indirect interactions and effects on cellular signaling and processes. We previously conducted parallel shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens to successfully identify genetic modifiers of cellular sensitivity to the host-targeting antiviral molecule GSK983 (25Deans R.M.

In that study, the primary direct binding target of GSK983 was identified among the top sensitizing genes of the shRNA screen rather than the CRISPR-Cas9 screen (25Deans R.M. Morgens D.W. Ökesli A.

Using this shRNA library, we conducted a genome-wide screen to identify gene knockdowns that greatly altered the sensitivity of the human K562 erythroleukemia cell line to josamycin. Because sensitivity to macrolide antibiotics varies based on drug and cell type (35Sugamata R. Sugawara A. Nagao T. Suzuki K. Hirose T. Yamamoto K. Oshima M. Kobayashi K. Sunazuka T.

Upon stable infection of K562 cells with the shRNA library, these cells were split and cultured in the absence or presence of 10 μm josamycin for 14 days (Fig. 1C). To identify which cells (and therefore genes) were selectively depleted or enriched in the josamycin-treated population, genomic DNA was isolated from each population after 14 days. The shRNA-encoding cassettes from each population were amplified and subjected to deep sequencing (39Bassik M.C. Kampmann M. Lebbink R.J. Wang S. Hein M.Y. Poser I. Weibezahn J. Horlbeck M.A. Chen S.

The individual genes conferring sensitivity to or protection from josamycin were ranked according to a maximum likelihood estimator that incorporates results across the entire set of shRNAs targeting each gene (Table S1) (25Deans R.M.

To improve statistical confidence in the identified hits, a subsequent batch shRNA screen was performed on a smaller scale with a custom-synthesized library that was comprised of the top ∼500 genes identified from the genome-wide screen to obtain higher coverage (Table S2). Gene knockdowns that modify cellular sensitivity to josamycin provide insight into the drug's direct subcellular binding targets as well as its indirect effects on cellular signaling and processes. Analysis of the top 40 sensitizing genes identified in the secondary screen revealed that major pathways sensitizing K562 cells to josamycin were involved in mitochondrial function and central carbon metabolism (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1A). In fact, the genes that most strongly sensitized cells to josamycin included those responsible for critical steps in mitochondrial protein translation, including initiation (MTIF2 and MTIF3), formylation (MTFMT), and termination (GFM2). Other macrolide antibacterial agents as well as nonmacrolide inhibitors of bacterial translation (e.g. chloramphenicol, Fig. 1A) are known to affect mitochondrial function, presumably by directly binding to mitochondrial ribosomes, given their strong similarity to bacterial ribosomes (40Duewelhenke N. Krut O. Eysel P. Influence on mitochondria and cytotoxicity of different antibiotics administered in high concentrations on primary human osteoblasts and cell lines.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51 (17088489): 54-6310.1128/AAC.00729-05Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 41Riesbeck K. Bredberg A. Forsgren A. Ciprofloxacin does not inhibit mitochondrial functions but other antibiotics do.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34 (2327755): 167-16910.1128/AAC.34.1.167Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is almost certain that the mitochondrial ribosome is a direct binding target of josamycin, given prior literature and the top hits in our screen. Other notable mitochondrial hits included genes involved in mitochondrial protein quality control and unfolded protein response (CLPP and CLPX) as well as anion (VDAC1 and VDAC2) and phosphatidic acid (TRIAP1) transport. A second major category of sensitizing hits was genes involved in central carbon metabolism, including glycolytic enzymes (GPI, PFKP, and HK2) as well as enzymes responsible for oxidative carbon metabolism (ME2, CS, and ACLY) and monocarboxylate transport (SLC16A1). This suggests that josamycin greatly alters cellular metabolism. Components of the MAPK signaling cascade (MAP3K4, MAP2K3, and GADD45A) also emerged among the most sensitizing genes; this pathway has been implicated previously in the mode of action of macrolide antibiotics in mammalian systems (9Kanoh S. Rubin B.K. Mechanisms of action and clinical application of macrolides as immunomodulatory medications.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 23 (20610825): 590-61510.1128/CMR.00078-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Various genes involved in mRNA surveillance (SMG1 and SMG7), ribosome biogenesis (NPM1 and ARF1), ubiquitination (FBOX11 and UBAP2L), mitotic organization (TPX2, ATRX, PCM1, and NPM1), and phosphatase activity (PPP1R15B and PPP2R2A) also appeared prominently among the top 40 sensitizing hits. Some gene knockdowns showed a protective effect and were enriched in the josamycin-treated population (Fig. S1A and Table S2). These included genes involved in DNA damage and repair (PRKDC), cytosolic protein translation (EIF2AK1 and EIF4G1), RNA processing (DAZAP1, STRAP, and HNRPA1), transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (C14ORF166, TAF3, and TAF4), and oxidative phosphorylation (ATP5O, ATP5H, ATP5F1, ATP5B, and NDUFB8). To validate our findings on an individual gene level, we performed competitive growth assays to compare the growth rate of a given KD cell line relative to its WT counterpart under untreated and josamycin-treated conditions. We established mCherry-positive K562 KD cell lines using the top two sensitizing shRNA constructs for each gene (Table S3). Suppression of mRNA of target genes in KD cells was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. S2, A and B, and Table S4).We then initiated cocultures of a given KD cell line with WT K562 cells at a 1:1 ratio under untreated and josamycin-treated conditions. By comparing the KD/WT ratio in the two cocultured populations over time, we observed whether a KD cell line was specifically depleted under josamycin treatment. This design detects and corrects for any non-drug-related growth defects of a construct relative to WT K562 cells in a controlled fashion over the many days it takes for some phenotypes to emerge. We confirmed that MTIF2, GFM2, MTIF3, MTFMT, PFKP, GPI, HK2, and MAP3K4 knockdown cells were specifically depleted under josamycin treatment relative to untreated cocultured controls after 10 days (Fig. 2, B–D). These results confirm the findings of our pooled genetic screens. In contrast, KD cells harboring nontargeting shRNA constructs were not depleted under jo"
https://openalex.org/W3000529425,"Viral infection is an environmental trigger that has been suggested to initiate pancreatic β-cell damage, leading to the development of autoimmune diabetes. Viruses potently activate the immune system and can damage β cells by either directly infecting them or stimulating the production of secondary effector molecules (such as proinflammatory cytokines) during bystander activation. However, how and where β cells recognize viruses is unclear, and the antiviral responses that are initiated following virus recognition are incompletely understood. In this study, we show that the β-cell response to dsRNA, a viral replication intermediate known to activate antiviral responses, is determined by the cellular location of sensing (intracellular versus extracellular) and differs from the cellular response to cytokine treatment. Using biochemical and immunological methods, we show that β cells selectively respond to intracellular dsRNA by expressing type I interferons (IFNs) and inducing apoptosis, but that they do not respond to extracellular dsRNA. These responses differ from the activities of cytokines on β cells, which are mediated by inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and β-cell production of nitric oxide. These findings provide evidence that the antiviral activities of type I IFN production and apoptosis are elicited in β cells via the recognition of intracellular viral replication intermediates and that β cells lack the capacity to respond to extracellular viral intermediates known to activate innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W3000572934,"Many secretory proteins are activated by cleavage at specific sites. The proprotein convertases (PCs) form a family of nine secretory subtilisin-like serine proteases, seven of which cleave at specific basic residues within the trans-Golgi network, granules, or at the cell surface/endosomes. The seventh member, PC7, is a type-I transmembrane (TM) protein with a 97-residue–long cytosolic tail (CT). PC7 sheds human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) into soluble shTfR1 in endosomes. To better understand the physiological roles of PC7, here we focused on the relationship between the CT-regulated trafficking of PC7 and its ability to shed hTfR1. Deletion of the TMCT resulted in soluble PC7 and loss of its hTfR1 shedding activity. Extensive CT deletions and mutagenesis analyses helped us zoom in on three residues in the CT, namely Glu-719, Glu-721, and Leu-725, that are part of a novel motif, EXEXXXL725, critical for PC7 activity on hTfR1. NMR studies of two 14-mer peptides mimicking this region of the CT and its Ala variants revealed that the three exposed residues are on the same side of the molecule. This led to the identification of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) as a protein that recognizes the EXEXXXL725 motif, thus representing a potentially new regulator of PC7 trafficking and cleavage activity. Immunocytochemistry of the subcellular localization of PC7 and its Ala variants of Leu-725 and Glu-719 and Glu-721 revealed that Leu-725 enhances PC7 localization to early endosomes and that, together with Glu-719 and Glu-721, it increases the endosomal activity of PC7 on hTfR1.

All PCs are first synthesized as inactive zymogens (proPC) that, except for PC2, are subsequently auto-catalytically cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at the C terminus of the inhibitory prodomain. The resulting noncovalent heterodimeric complex (pro-catalytic) then exits the ER and traffics either to the cis/medial-Golgi (SKI-1) or trans-Golgi network (TGN)/secretory granules/cell surface/endosomes where, upon sorting to their final destination, most PCs are activated. Zymogen activation of the basic aa-specific PCs occurs by either a second autocatalytic cleavage within the prodomain, thereby liberating this segment from the active protease (e.g. for furin) (6Seidah N.G.

In this work, we present evidence that the shedding of hTfR1 by human PC7 depends on the integrity of a specific motif EXEXXXL725 present in its CT and that Leu is the only critical aa in the PLC726 motif. We also demonstrated that the PC7-mediated hTfR1 shedding is positively regulated by the cytosolic adaptor protein complex AP-2, as evidenced by overexpression and knockdown experiments of its μ-adaptin subunit. To better appreciate the critical aa in the CT of PC7 that may regulate its subcellular trafficking and hence its ability to shed hTfR1, we first aligned the transmembrane (TM) and CT segments of human (aa 668–785), rat, mouse, and Xenopus laevis PC7 (Fig. 1A). Although the TM is relatively well-conserved between these species (85% aa identity between human and mouse/rat and 55% for X. laevis), the CT is less so with 58, 46, and 35% aa identity between human, rat, mouse, and X. laevis PC7, respectively. To further delineate the critical aa in the CT, we generated chimeric constructs of human (hPC7) or X. laevis (xPC7) where their TMCT or CT was interchanged. Co-expression of the C-terminally V5-tagged hTfR1-V5 with native hPC7, rat PC7 (rPC7), xPC7, or four selected chimeras was achieved in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of cell lysates and media were analyzed for hTfR1 using a V5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (13Guillemot J. Canuel M. Essalmani R. Prat A. Seidah N.G.

The data show that PC7 derived from all constructs was able to shed hTfR1-V5 into the medium (shTfR1-V5) to a similar extent as evidenced from the ratio of media levels of shTfR1 to cellular levels normalized to β-actin (Fig. 1B). This suggests that some conserved residues in the CT of these species may be critical for this processing. We also note that the zymogen processing of proPC7 into PC7 occurs, but it seems somewhat less efficient for xPC7, hPC7-xCT, and hPC7-xTMCT chimeras. Because our antibody is specific for human, rat, and mouse PC7, this may explain why it poorly recognizes xPC7. Finally, similar conclusions were also drawn from co-expression of the above constructs with mouse pro-epidermal growth factor (mproEGF-V5) (Fig. 1C) (14Rousselet E. Benjannet S. Marcinkiewicz E. Asselin M.C. Lazure C. Seidah N.G. The proprotein convertase PC7 enhances the activation of the EGF receptor pathway through processing of the EGF precursor.J. Biol.

We next generated a number of membrane-bound human PC7 constructs with successively shortened C-terminally–truncated segments of its CT, as well as a soluble form (shPC7) lacking the TMCT. These included the wild type (WT) sequence with a CT composed of 97 aa and truncated forms containing 88 (L774X), 67 (L753X), and 29 (G717X) residues and ending at Ser-689 (Q690X; ΔCT) of the CT (Fig. 2A). We then co-expressed hTfR1 with each of these constructs in hepatic HuH7 (Fig. 2B) and HEK293 (Fig. 2C) cells. As shown previously (13Guillemot J. Canuel M. Essalmani R. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Implication of the proprotein convertases in iron homeostasis: proprotein convertase 7 sheds human transferrin receptor 1 and furin activates hepcidin.Hepatology. 2013; 57 (23390091): 2514-252410.1002/hep.26297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), soluble PC7 does not shed hTfR1, reinforcing the importance of the membrane association of PC7 for such activity (Fig. 2, B and C). The lack of either 98% of the CT (ΔCT) or aa 717–785 (G717X) results in an ∼80% (±4.1%) reduction of the PC7-shedding of hTfR1, whereas the lack of aa 753–785 (L753X) or aa 774–785 (L774X) does not significantly affect such processing (Fig. 2, B and C). We conclude that the most critical information regulating the activity of PC7 on hTfR1 resides in the segment comprising aa 717–752 in the CT (Fig. 2A; ♦), with some remaining information in the membranous segment comprising aa 668–689 present in the ΔCT construct. Alignment of human aa 717–753 with the equivalent sequences in the CT of rat, mouse, and Xenopus PC7 revealed that the stretch ESXPL725 is absolutely conserved (Fig. 3A). The human PLC726 motif was previously reported to regulate endosomal entry of PC7 (18Declercq J. Meulemans S. Plets E. Creemers J.W. Internalization of the proprotein convertase PC7 from the plasma membrane is mediated by a novel motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22294700): 9052-906010.1074/jbc.M111.306407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the importance of this sequence in the regulation of the enzymatic activity of PC7 was not investigated. Accordingly, Ala replacement of PLC (P724A,L725A,C726A) and PL (P724A,L725A) resulted in ∼60% (±3.7%) and ∼70% (±8.5%) reduction of PC7 activity on hTfR1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Cys-726 is not critical. Indeed, it is replaced by Phe in Xenopus, and the C726F and C726A mutations do not significantly influence the PC7 activity (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, although the P724A mutant exhibits similar activity to WT PC7, the mutant L725A lost ∼60% (±3.7%) of the activity, similar to the P724A,L725A and P724A,L725A,C726A mutants (Fig. 3C). Thus, Leu-725 seems to be the only aa in the PLC motif that is critical for PC7 ability to shed hTfR1. We next focused on the possible presence of other critical aa preceding Leu-725 in the sequence ELESVPL725. Because Ala mutation of Leu-720, Ser-722, Val-723 or the sequence ESV723 did not affect the PC7 activity (Fig. 4A), this suggests that they are not critical. In addition, individually the E719A or E721A mutations also did not significantly affect the PC7 activity (Fig. 3C). Interestingly Glu-719 is replaced by Ala in mouse and rat and Gly in Xenopus PC7 (Fig. 3A), in line with a minor role of this aa residue. In contrast, the double E719A,E721A and the multiple E719A,E721A,P724A,L725A,C726A or E719A,E721A,L725A mutations reduced by ≥50% (±4.9–11.1%) the PC7 activity, similar to the L725A mutation (Fig. 3, B and C). Note that the bar graph values represent an average of three experiments. However, we only show Western blotting data of one representative experiment. As controls, our data showed that E733A,E735A did not affect PC7 activity (Fig. 3B). Similar results and conclusions were reached from experiments in HeLa and HuH7 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Overall, this suggests that EXEXXXL725 is the critical motif in the CT of human PC7 that regulates its activity on hTfR1. Because mutations of the EXE721 or Leu-725 result in similar reductions of activity, this may indicate that EXEXXXL725 is a binding motif recognized by a common putative cytosolic partner. Because of the theoretically higher mobility of a truncated peptide compared with the same sequence in the native protein, it is difficult to predict the native structure of a motif in the protein from a short peptide structure. However, sequence information of local motifs orchestrate the secondary structure and folding of proteins and give some idea to the native structure of the motif in the protein (23Baldwin R.L. Rose G.D. Is protein folding hierarchic? I. Local structure and peptide folding.Trends Biochem.

Predicting peptide structures in native proteins from physical simulations of fragments.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5 (19197352): e100028110.1371/journal.pcbi.1000281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, the only crystal structure of any basic aa-specific PC known is that of soluble furin lacking the TMCT (25Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. The crystal structure of the proprotein processing proteinase furin explains its stringent specificity.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 (12794637): 520-52610.1038/nsb941Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, the unavailability of a crystal structure of PC7 or its CT led us to solve the structure of a chemically-synthesized CT 14-mer peptide (aa 717–730) using solution NMR methods to investigate the structure of this part of the CT in human PC7. The results suggested that the side chains of the key Glu and Leu residues in the EXEXXXL725 motif are lying on the same side of the molecule, where a likely protein–protein interaction (PPI) could happen (Fig. 5). As anticipated for a short peptide, the two last aa at both ends exhibit more mobility than the rest of the residues, which, however, finely converge in the ensemble. Furthermore, it was found that the peptide does not have a regular secondary structural element (α-helix, β-sheet, or turns), supporting the role of this segment as part of an accessible loop, because nonregular secondary structures are found in half of all PPIs as deduced from a survey of protein data banks (26Gavenonis J. Sheneman B.A. Siegert T.R. Eshelman M.R. Kritzer J.A. Comprehensive analysis of loops at protein–protein interfaces for macrocycle design.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (25038791): 716-72210.1038/nchembio.1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The data support the notion that the three key residues Glu-719,721 and Leu-725 lie on the same side of the molecule (Fig. 5A) and hence are well-poised to possibly interact with a partner/adaptor protein, as identified below. It was shown that removal of the side chains from these triad residues (i.e. Ala mutations of Glu-719,721 and Leu-725) resulted in a substantial reduction in the activity of PC7 on hTfR1, which is likely due to eliminated interactions of these residues with one or more cytosolic adaptor protein(s). To discover more structural elements of the motif, an Ala-719,721,725–mutated 14-mer peptide was synthesized, and the structure was solved by solution NMR. The data revealed that these mutations affected the backbone structure of the peptide (Fig. 5B). Although the mutated peptide still has a coiled-coil structure, alignments of the two structures showed that the mutated peptide has more curvature compared with the native PC7-derived peptide (Fig. 5C). Altered curvature causes a re-orientation and re-positioning of Ala-725 compared with Leu-725, demonstrating a significantly-altered peptide structure. In conclusion, our NMR data demonstrated clear differences between the native CT fragment and its Ala mutant. We showed that the Ala mutant is more compact compared with the peptide representing the native CT, which translates into the greater accessibility of the Glu side chains to interact with potential binding partners. The intracellular localization of human PC7 and its CT mutants was best analyzed by fluorescence immunocytochemistry in HeLa cells, compared with HEK293 or HuH7 cells, because HeLa cells have a more visible subcellular distribution of organelles, including its Golgi architecture (27Tie H.C. Chen B. Sun X. Cheng L. Lu L. Quantitative localization of a Golgi protein by imaging its center of fluorescence mass.J. Vis. Exp. 2017. 2017; (28829416)10.3791/55996Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reached similar conclusions regarding the effect of the PC7 mutants on hTfR1 cleavage activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). Immunocytochemistry of C-term"
https://openalex.org/W2991383556,"Intramembrane cleavage of transmembrane proteins is a fundamental cellular process to produce important signals that elicit biological responses. These proteolytic events are known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). ATF6 and BBF2H7 are transmembrane basic leucine zipper transcription factors and are subjected to RIP by site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) sequentially in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the detailed mechanisms responsible for RIP of the transcription factors, including the precise cutting sites, are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that S1P cleaves BBF2H7 just before the RXXL S1P recognition motif. Conversely, S2P cut at least three different sites in the membrane (next to Leu380, Met381, and Leu385), indicating that S2P cleaves the substrates at variable sites or via a multistep process. Interestingly, we found BBF2H7-derived small peptide (BSP) fragments located between the S1P and S2P cleavage sites in cells exposed to ER stress. Major type of BSP fragments was composed of 45 amino acid including partial transmembrane and luminal regions and easily aggregates like amyloid β (Aβ) protein. These results advance the understanding of poorly characterized ER stress-dependent RIP. Furthermore, the aggregable peptides produced by ER stress could link to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2991633694,"The nucleolus is best known for its cellular role in regulating ribosome production and growth. More recently, an unanticipated role for the nucleolus in innate immunity has recently emerged whereby downregulation of fibrillarin and nucleolar contraction confers pathogen resistance across taxa. The mechanism of this downregulation, however, remains obscure. Here we report that rather than fibrillarin itself being the proximal factor in this pathway, the key player is a fibrillarin-stabilizing deubiquitinylase USP-33. This was discovered by a candidate-gene search of Caenorhabditis elegans in which CED-3 caspase was revealed to execute targeted cleavage of USP-33, thus destabilizing fibrillarin. We also showed that cep-1 and ced-3 mutant worms altered nucleolar size and decreased antimicrobial peptide gene, spp-1, expression rendering susceptibility to bacterial infection. These phenotypes were reversed by usp-33 knockdown, thus linking the CEP-1-CED-3-USP-33 pathway with nucleolar control and resistance to bacterial infection in worms. Parallel experiments with the human analogs of caspases and USP36 revealed similar roles in coordinating these two processes. In summary, our work outlined a conserved cascade that connects cell death signaling to nucleolar control and innate immune response."
