https://openalex.org/W2903579321,"Deserts, such as those found in Saudi Arabia, are one of the most hostile places for plant growth. However, desert plants are able to impact their surrounding microbial community and select beneficial microbes that promote their growth under these extreme conditions. In this study, we examined the soil, rhizosphere and endosphere bacterial communities of four native desert plants Tribulus terrestris, Zygophyllum simplex, Panicum turgidum and Euphorbia granulata from the Southwest (Jizan region), two of which were also found in the Midwest (Al Wahbah area) of Saudi Arabia. While the rhizosphere bacterial community mostly resembled that of the highly different surrounding soils, the endosphere composition was strongly correlated with its host plant phylogeny. In order to assess whether any of the native bacterial endophytes might have a role in plant growth under extreme conditions, we analyzed the properties of 116 cultured bacterial isolates that represent members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Our analysis shows that different strains have highly different biochemical properties with respect to nutrient acquisition, hormone production and growth under stress conditions. More importantly, eleven of the isolated strains could confer salinity stress tolerance to the experimental model plant Arabidopsis thaliana suggesting some of these plant-associated bacteria might be useful for improving crop desert agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2904654653,"Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening is highly destructive disease that is affecting the citrus industry worldwide and it has killed millions of citrus plants globally. HLB is caused by the phloem limited, Gram negative, non-culturable, alpha-proteobacterium, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus'. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real time PCR have been the gold standard techniques used for detection of 'Ca. L. asiaticus'. These diagnostic methods are expensive, require well equipped laboratories, not user-friendly and not suitable for on-site detection of the pathogen. In this study, a sensitive, reliable, quick and low cost recombinase polymerase based isothermal amplification combined with lateral flow assay (HLB-RPA-LFA) technique has been developed as a diagnostic tool for detection of 'Ca. L. asiaticus'. The assay was standardized by designing the specific primer pair and probe based on the conserved 16S rRNA gene of 'Ca. L. asiaticus'. The assay was optimized for temperature and reaction time by using purified DNA and crude plant extracts and the best HLB-RPA-LFA was achieved at the isothermal temperature of 38°C for 20 to 30 min. The efficacy and sensitivity of the assay was carried out by using field grown, HLB-infected, HLB-doubtful and healthy citrus cultivars including mandarin, sweet orange cv. mosambi, and acid lime. The HLB-RPA-LFA did not show cross-reactivity with other citrus pathogens and is simple, cost-effective, rapid, user-friendly and sensitive. Thus, the HLB-RPA-LFA method has great potential to provide an improved diagnostic tool for detection of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' for the farmers, nurserymen, disease surveyors, mobile plant pathology laboratories, bud-wood certification and quarantine programs."

Methodology We conducted the first Phase IIb clinical trial assessing the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP in 700 healthy malaria exposed children aged 5–17 months in a highly endemic malaria transmission area of Burkina Faso. Results ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP was shown to be safe and immunogenic but induced only moderate T cell responses (median 326 SFU/106 PBMC (95% CI 290–387)) many fold lower than in previous trials. No significant efficacy was observed against clinical malaria during the follow up period, with efficacy against the primary endpoint estimate by proportional analysis being 13.8% (95%CI -42.4 to 47.9) at sixth month post MVA ME-TRAP and 3.1% (95%CI -15.0 to 18.3; p = 0.72) by Cox regression. Conclusions This study has confirmed ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP is a safe and immunogenic vaccine regimen in children and infants with prior exposure to malaria. But no significant protective efficacy was observed in this very highly malaria-endemic setting. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01635647. Pactr.org PACTR201208000404131."
https://openalex.org/W2904123059,"RWP-RKs represent a small family of transcription factors (TFs) that are unique to plants and function particularly under conditions of nitrogen starvation. These RWP-RKs have been classified in two sub-families, NLPs (NIN-like proteins) and RKDs (RWP-RK domain proteins). NLPs regulate tissue-specific expression of genes involved in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and RKDs regulate expression of genes involved in gametogenesis/embryogenesis. During the present study, using in silico approach, 37 wheat RWP-RK genes were identified, which included 18 TaNLPs (2865 to 7340 bp with 4/5 exons), distributed on 15 chromosomes from 5 homoeologous groups (with two genes each on 4B,4D and 5A) and 19 TaRKDs (1064 to 5768 bp with 1 to 6 exons) distributed on 12 chromosomes from 4 homoeologous groups (except groups 1, 4 and 5); 2-3 splice variants were also available in 9 of the 37 genes. Sixteen (16) of these genes also carried 24 SSRs (simple sequence repeats), while 11 genes had targets for 13 different miRNAs. At the protein level, MD simulation analysis suggested their interaction with nitrate-ions. Significant differences were observed in the expression of only two (TaNLP1 and TaNLP2) of the nine representative genes that were used for in silico expression analysis under varying levels of N at post-anthesis stage (data for other genes was not available for in silico expression analysis). Differences in expression were also observed during qRT-PCR, when expression of four representative genes (TaNLP2, TaNLP7, TaRKD6 and TaRKD9) was examined in roots and shoots of seedlings (under different conditions of N supply) in two contrasting genotypes which differed in NUE (C306 with low NUE and HUW468 with high NUE). These four genes for qRT-PCR were selected on the basis of previous literature, level of homology and the level of expression (in silico study). In particular, the TaNLP7 gene showed significant up-regulation in the roots and shoots of HUW468 (with higher NUE) during N-starvation; this gene has already been characterized in Arabidopsis and tobacco, and is known to be involved in nitrate-signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2905546739,"Objective To describe the opinions of British general practitioners regarding the potential of future technology to replace key tasks carried out in primary care. Design Cross sectional online survey. Participants 1,474 registered GPs in the United Kingdom. Main outcome measures Investigators measured GPs’ opinions about the likelihood that future technology will be able to fully replace–not merely aid–the average GP in performing six primary care tasks; in addition, if GPs considered replacement for a particular task likely, the survey measured opinions about how many years from now this technological capacity might emerge. Results A total of 720 (49%) responded to the survey. Most GPs believed it unlikely that technology will ever be able to fully replace physicians when it comes to diagnosing patients (489, 68%), referring patients to other specialists (444, 61%), formulating personalized treatment plans (441, 61%), and delivering empathic care (680, 94%). GPs were not in agreement about prognostics: one in two participants (380, 53%) considered it likely that technology will be fully capable of replacing physicians in performing this task, nearly half (187, 49%) of whom believed that the technological capacity will arise in the next ten years. Against these findings, the majority of GPs (578, 80%) believed it likely that future technology will be able to fully replace humans to undertake documentation; among them 261 (79%) estimated that the technological wherewithal would emerge during the next ten years. In general, age and gender were not correlated with opinions; nor was reported burnout and job satisfaction or whether GPs worked full time or part time. Conclusions The majority of UK GPs in this survey were skeptical about the potential for future technology to perform most primary care tasks as well as or better than humans. However, respondents were optimistic that in the near future technology would have the capacity to fully replace GPs’ in undertaking administrative duties related to patient documentation."
https://openalex.org/W2903779258,"The German cockroach, Blatella germanica, is a common pest in urban environments and is among the most resilient insects in the world. The remarkable ability of the German cockroach to develop resistance when exposed to toxic insecticides is a prime example of adaptive evolution and makes control of this insect an ongoing struggle. Like many other organisms, the German cockroach is host to a diverse community of symbiotic microbes that play important roles in its physiology. In some insect species, there is a strong correlation between the commensal microbial community and insecticide resistance. In particular, several bacteria have been implicated in the detoxification of xenobiotics, including synthetic insecticides. While multiple mechanisms that mediate insecticide resistance in cockroaches have been discovered, significant knowledge gaps still exist in this area of research. Here, we examine the effects of altering the microbiota on resistance to a common insecticide using antibiotic treatments. We describe an indoxacarb-resistant laboratory strain in which treatment with antibiotic increases susceptibility to orally administered insecticide. We further reveal that this strains harbors a gut microbial community that differs significantly from that of susceptible cockroaches in which insecticide resistance is unaffected by antibiotic. More importantly, we demonstrate that transfer of gut microbes from the resistant to the susceptible strain via fecal transplant increases its resistance. Lastly, our data show that antibiotic treatment adversely affects several reproductive life-history traits that may contribute to the dynamics of resistance at the population level. Together these results suggest that the microbiota contributes to both physiological and evolutionary aspects of insecticide resistance and that targeting this community may be an effective strategy to control the German cockroach."
https://openalex.org/W2904868363,"In face-to-face communication, recurring intervals of mutual gaze allow listeners to provide speakers with visual feedback (e.g. nodding). Here, we investigate the potential feedback function of one of the subtlest of human movements—eye blinking. While blinking tends to be subliminal, the significance of mutual gaze in human interaction raises the question whether the interruption of mutual gaze through blinking may also be communicative. To answer this question, we developed a novel, virtual reality-based experimental paradigm, which enabled us to selectively manipulate blinking in a virtual listener, creating small differences in blink duration resulting in ‘short’ (208 ms) and ‘long’ (607 ms) blinks. We found that speakers unconsciously took into account the subtle differences in listeners’ blink duration, producing substantially shorter answers in response to long listener blinks. Our findings suggest that, in addition to physiological, perceptual and cognitive functions, listener blinks are also perceived as communicative signals, directly influencing speakers’ communicative behavior in face-to-face communication. More generally, these findings may be interpreted as shedding new light on the evolutionary origins of mental-state signaling, which is a crucial ingredient for achieving mutual understanding in everyday social interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2904579550,"The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between perceived occupational stress and psychological well-being among secondary school heads in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A sample of 402 secondary school heads (male n = 260, female n = 142) was selected through multistage sampling technique. A descriptive, quantitative and correlative research design was used. For gathering information from the participants, two standardized tools i.e., ""Occupational Stress Index (OSI)"" and ""Ryff's Psychological Wellbeing Scale (RPWB)"" were used for measuring perceived occupational stress and psychological well-being respectively. For statistical analysis, mean, standard deviation, Pearson's product-moment correlation and multiple regression were employed. The findings revealed that there is a strong negative correlation between perceived occupational stress and psychological well-being. Furthermore, moderate negative correlation was found between all the sub-scales of perceived occupational stress and psychological well-being. All the subscales of occupational stress except low status were found significant predictors and have negative effect on psychological well-being of secondary school heads. So, it was suggested that Elementary & Secondary Education Department Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should have a collaboration with policy makers to formulate a comprehensive strategy for stress reduction management for secondary school heads so that they may develop good psychological well-being and perform their duties effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2904362086,"In light of the growing antibiotic resistance, the usage of plant-derived antimicrobial agents could serve as an effective alternative treatment against oral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of Mediterranean herb extracts against representative oral microorganisms. The extraction procedures and the analysis of the obtained extracts were performed under established experimental conditions. The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations of the methanol extracts of Cistus creticus ssp. creticus, Cistus monspeliensis, Origanum vulgare, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia sclarea and Thymus longicaulis against eight typical oral bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans were determined. The antibiofilm activity against Streptococcus mutans was also quantified using the microtiter plate test. Overall, all tested extracts inhibited effectively the screened obligate anaerobic microorganisms and in concentrations ≥0.3 mg ml-1 had moderate to high antibiofilm activity comparable to that of chlorhexidine (CHX) against S. mutans. In particular, R. officinalis (MIC: 0.08-5.00 mg ml-1) and S. sclarea (MIC: 0.08-2.50 mg ml-1) showed the highest antibacterial activity, while Cistus spp., R. officinalis and S. sclarea significantly inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation at 0.60, 1.25 and 2.50 mg ml-1, respectively. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Parvimonas micra were high susceptible to O. vulgare (MIC = 0.30 mg ml-1), whereas T. longicaulis eradicated all oral bacteria (MBC: 0.15-2.50 mg ml-1). Nevertheless, C. albicans showed no sensitivity to the tested extracts. In conclusion, the tested plant extracts could serve as alternative natural antibacterial and antibiofilm components against oral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2904842428,"Triclabendazole is a poorly-water soluble (0.24 μg/mL) compound classified into the Class II/IV of the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. It is the drug of choice to treat fascioliasis, a neglected parasitic disease worldwide disseminated. Triclabendazole is registered as veterinary medicine and it is only available for human treatment as 250 mg tablets. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop novel drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology approaches. The chitosan-based nanocapsules and nanoemulsions of triclabendazole were fully characterized regarding their particle size distribution, polydispersity index and zeta potential, in-vitro release and stability in biological media. Cytotoxicity evaluation and cellular uptake studies using CaCo-2 cell line were also investigated. The results indicated an average hydrodynamic size around ~160 nm were found for unloaded nanoemulsions which were slightly increased up to ~190 nm for loaded one. In contrast, the average hydrodynamic size of the nanocapsules increased from ~160 nm up to ~400 nm when loaded with triclabendazole. The stability studies upon 30 days storage at 4, 25 and 37°C showed that average size of nanoemulsions was not modified with varying amounts of loaded TCBZ while an opposite result was seen in case of loaded nanocapsules. In addition, a slight reduction of zeta potential values over time was observed in both triclabendazole nanosystems. Release of TCBZ from nanoformulations over 6 h in simulated gastric fluid was 9 to 16-fold higher than with untreated TCBZ dispersion. In phosphate buffer saline solution there was no drug release for neither nanocapsules nor nanoemulsions. Cell viabilities studies indicated that at certain concentrations, drug encapsulation can lower its cytotoxic effects when compared to untreated drug. Confocal laser scanning microscopy study has shown that nanocapsules strongly interacted with Caco-2 cells in vitro which could increase the passage time of triclabendazole after oral administration. The results of this study constitute the first step towards the development of nanoformulations intended for the oral delivery of anti-parasitic drugs of enhanced bioavailability."
https://openalex.org/W2903655860,"The article presents an original analysis which combines use-wear, 3D modelling and spatial analyses to experimental archaeology in order to investigate Early Upper Palaeolithic flint-knapping gestures and techniques involving the use of macro-lithic tools. In particular, the methodological framework proposed in this paper was applied to the study of Protoaurignacian and Aurignacian macro-tools from Fumane Cave (Verona, Italy). Combining spatial analysis and use wear investigation, both at low and high magnifications, permitted the identification and detailed description of the use-related traces affecting both the hammerstones and retouchers which, at Fumane Cave, were used at different stages during flint tool production. Several experimental activities were performed including core reduction, maintenance, and blank production together with different types of edge retouching. From a methodological perspective, the protocol of analysis permitted to codify specific traces and to produce quantitative data related to their geometry and distribution over the tool's surface, according to the activities and gestures performed. The results obtained allowed a careful investigation of the function and the gestures associated to the use of the macro-lithic tools coming from the Protoaurignacian and Aurignacian levels of Fumane Cave while providing a methodological tool for interpreting different archaeological samples."
https://openalex.org/W2904920786,"Background Social denormalisation of smoking can provide an environment that helps smokers to quit. This study examined which of three measures of anti-smoking social norms have the greatest influence on quitting-related cognitions and behaviours, and if this influence differs according to socioeconomic status (SES). Methods The Victorian Tracking Survey measured social norms among 1,348 (n(weighted) = 1,373) Australian adult smokers (aged 18–59) between 2012 and 2014, who were followed-up one week later. Weighted logistic regression analyses examined prospective associations of baseline subjective (family and friends’ disapproval of smoking), injunctive (feeling embarrassed about being a smoker) and descriptive norms (living with someone who tried to quit in the past 12 months), with quitting-related cognitions and behaviours at follow-up. Data were weighted to account for telephony status (landline or mobile phone), sex and age. Analyses were adjusted for demographic characteristics, addiction level, tobacco control policies and quitting-related outcomes measured at baseline. Differences in associations between lower and higher SES smokers (based on educational attainment and area-based disadvantage) were examined through interaction terms and stratified analyses. Results Sixty-four percent of participants (n(weighted) = 872) perceived disapproval from family and friends, 31% (n(weighted) = 419) felt embarrassed to be a smoker, and 11% (n(weighted) = 155) lived with a recent quitter. All three norms were associated with having set a firm date to quit in the next month and with engaging in smoking limiting behaviours. Embarrassment was also associated with an increased likelihood of talking about quitting and with making a quit attempt. Associations were mostly comparable for lower and higher SES smokers, with no significant negative rebound effects overall or among subgroups. Conclusions These findings indicate close others’ disapproval and feelings of embarrassment most strongly motivate smokers to try to quit. If tobacco control policies or media campaigns further denormalise smoking, there should be no reason for concern that such denormalisation undermines cessation behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2905091430,"Elucidating whether there is a correlation between biomechanical functions and histomorphometric data in the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model would contribute to an accurate evaluation of the regeneration state without sacrificing animals. The gold standard for functional evaluation is the sciatic functional index (SFI) despite there being intrinsic shortcomings. Kinematic analysis is considered a reliable and sensitive approach for functional evaluation, most commonly assessed as ankle angle at various phases of a gait cycle. Studies utilizing the toe angle for functional evaluation are scarce, and changes in the toe angle following surgery remain unknown. The present study assessed correlations of ankle angle, toe angle and SFI with histomorphometric data, aiming to determine which parameters most accurately reflect changes in histomorphometric data over time. Six Lewis rats were designated as the control group. 30 animals received surgery, six of them were randomly selected on the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth week after surgery for measurements of ankle and toe angles in the “toe-off” phase, and for evaluation of SFI. Histomorphometric analysis were also performed, to determine the number of myelinated nerve fibers, diameters of myelinated nerve fibers, axon diameters, and myelin sheath thicknesses. Furthermore, we investigated changes in ankle angle, toe angle, SFI, and histomorphometric data over time, as well as correlations between ankle angle, toe angle, and SFI with histomorphometric data. The results revealed that changes in SFI, ankle angle, and toe angle highly correlate with histomorphometric data in the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model. Toe angle reflected changes in histomorphometric data with time more precisely than ankle angle or SFI did, and ankle angle was a better prognostic parameter than SFI."
https://openalex.org/W2904396361,"This paper proposes a method based on a local weather type classification approach to facilitate analysis and communication of climate information in local climate studies. Presented herein is an application to urban climatology in Toulouse, France, but the method can be used in other applied fields of climatology as well. To describe the climatic context of this urbanized area, the local weather types that explain the plurality of weather situations Toulouse faces are presented in depth. In order to show the potential for use of this approach, this information is applied to the study of changes in local weather types in terms of frequency and intensity within a series of future climate projections, a classic urban canopy and a series of atmospheric boundary layer analyses, and as a support for communication aimed to initiate urban climate awareness in urban planning practices. The proposed classification method has been coded in an R script and is provided as a supporting information file. The paper concludes that a systematic pre-study using this kind of climatic analysis is a good practice for performing climatic contextualization in local scale applied studies, both for scientific analysis and communication."
https://openalex.org/W2904410013,"The role of noninvasive liver fibrosis markers which were developed to evaluate the severity of chronic liver disease remains unclear in cirrhosis.To evaluate the correlation between noninvasive markers and hemodynamic parameters and their prognostic performance in cirrhotic patients.A total of 242 cirrhotic patients undergoing hemodynamic study were analyzed. The correlations between noninvasive models, including FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, cirrhosis discriminant score, Lok index, Goteborg University Cirrhosis Index, and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score and hemodynamic parameters were investigated, along with their predictive accuracy for short- and long-term survival.There was a significant correlation between all noninvasive markers and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), and ALBI score had the best correlation (r = 0.307, p<0.001). For the prediction of 3-month and 6-month mortality, serum sodium (sNa) levels had the highest area under curve (AUC; 0.799 and 0.818, respectively) among all parameters, and ALBI score showed the best performance (AUC = 0.691 and 0.740, respectively) compared with other 5 noninvasive models. Of 159 patients with low MELD scores (<14), high ALBI score (>-1.4) and low sNa (<135 mmol/L) predicted early mortality. In the Cox multivariate model, ALBI, MELD, HVPG and sNa were independent predictors of long-term survival.Among noninvasive markers, ALBI score is best correlated with HVPG and associated with short-term outcome in cirrhotic patients. A high ALBI score and low sNa identify high-risk patients with low MELD scores. High MELD, HVPG, ALBI and low sNa levels are independent predictors of survival. Independent studies are required to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2905126204,"It has been hypothesized that the energy balance closure problem of single-tower eddy-covariance measurements is linked to large-scale turbulent transport. In order to shed light on this problem, we investigate the functional dependence of the normalized residual for the potential temperature and humidity conservation equations, i.e. the imbalance ratio for the fluxes of latent and sensible heat. We set up a suite of simulations consisting of cases with different stability and surface Bowen ratio. We employ a nesting approach in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary-layer to achieve higher spatial resolution near the surface. Our simulations reproduce earlier simulation results for the mixed layer and also mimic the saw-blade pattern of real flux measurements. Focusing on homogeneous terrain, we derive a parameterization for the spatially averaged flux imbalance ratios of latent and sensible heat in the surface layer. We also investigate how the remaining imbalance for a given point measurement is related to the local turbulence, by deriving a statistical model based on turbulence characteristics that are related to large-scale turbulence. The average imbalance ratio scales well with friction velocity, especially for sensible heat. For the latent heat flux, our results show that the Bowen ratio also influences the underestimation. Furthermore, in the surface layer the residual has a linear dependence on the absolute height divided by the boundary-layer height. Our parameterization allows us to deduce an expression for the residual in the energy budget for a particular measurement half hour, based on the measurement height and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2905245744,"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a molecular imaging technique that maps the distribution of molecules in biological tissues with high spatial resolution. The most widely used MSI modality is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), mainly due to the large variety of analyte classes amenable for MALDI analysis. However, the organic matrices used in classical MALDI may impact the quality of the molecular images due to limited lateral resolution and strong background noise in the low mass range, hindering its use in metabolomics. Here we present a matrix-free laser desorption/ionization (LDI) technique based on the deposition of gold nanolayers on tissue sections by means of sputter-coating. This gold coating method is quick, fully automated, reproducible, and allows growing highly controlled gold nanolayers, necessary for high quality and high resolution MS image acquisition. The performance of the developed method has been tested through the acquisition of MS images of brain tissues. The obtained spectra showed a high number of MS peaks in the low mass region (m/z below 1000 Da) with few background peaks, demonstrating the ability of the sputtered gold nanolayers of promoting the desorption/ionization of a wide range of metabolites. These results, together with the reliable MS spectrum calibration using gold peaks, make the developed method a valuable alternative for MSI applications."
https://openalex.org/W2904548572,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a common serovar associated with non-typhoidal salmonellosis globally. However, there is insufficient data on molecular characterization of S. Typhimurium isolates from India. This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial resistance (AMR), plasmid, virulence profiles and molecular subtypes of S. Typhimurium Indian isolates (n = 70) of clinical and environmental origin isolated during 2010-2017. Antimicrobial susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by disc diffusion and E-test methods respectively. Plasmid extraction was done following standard protocol. AMR genes, virulence genes and plasmid incompatibility types were detected by PCR; Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used for molecular subtyping. Majority (57%) of the study isolates was pan susceptible; five AMR profiles were observed among the resistant (43%) isolates. AMR was significantly (p = 0.004) associated with extra-intestinal isolates than intestinal isolates.The class 1 integron and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnrB1, qnrS1) in the resistant isolates were transferable by conjugation. Plasmids (≥1) ranging from 1.9 to 254kb size and of IncFIIS and/or FIB type were found in most isolates. A total of 39 pulsotypes by PFGE and four sequence types by MLST like ST36 (55.7%), ST19 (32.9%), ST313 (10%) and ST213 (1.4%) were observed. ST36 and ST19 were found circulating in both clinical and environmental host, while ST313 isolates had an exclusive clinical origin. All ST19 isolates (100%) were drug-resistant, while isolates belonging to ST313 (100%), ST213 (100%) and ST36 (82%) were pan susceptible. The virulence plasmid (VP) genes (spvB- spvC) were present in all genotypes except ST36. The VP was significantly (p<0.001) associated with extra-intestinal than intestinal isolates. Some environmental and clinical isolates were clonal indicating their zoonotic transmission. Knowledge on the molecular subtypes and AMR profiles of locally prevalent Salmonella serotypes is important for effective control of spread of resistant organisms. The MLST of S. Typhimurium isolates and its association with AMR, virulence profiles was not reported earlier from India."
https://openalex.org/W2905201973,"Altered production of adipokines is suggested to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs) play diverse roles in regulation of metabolism in physiologic and pathologic conditions. In the present study, we assessed serum concentrations of adiponectin, CTRP12, and CTRP13 in individuals with PCOS and those without PCOS. We also evaluated the possible association of these adipokines with metabolic and hormonal variables. A total of 171 premenopausal women (86 with PCOS and 85 without PCOS) enrolled in this study. Serum levels of adiponectin, CTRP12, and CTRP13 were measured. The results showed significantly lower serum concentrations of adiponectin, CTRP12, and CTRP13 in PCOS women compared to non-PCOS women. This difference remained significant after controlling for age, body mass index (BMI), and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). However, we did not observe any significant differences in serum levels of adiponectin, CTRP12, and CTRP13 between the overweight/obese and normal weight subgroups in PCOS and non-PCOS women. Multiple linear regression analysis showed associations of CTRP12 with adiponectin and BMI with CTRP13 in both the PCOS and non-PCOS groups. CTRP12 was significantly associated with BMI and adiponectin in the non-PCOS group, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) and CTRP13 in the PCOS group. Our results indicated that decreased adiponectin, CTRP12, and CTRP13 levels, regardless of obesity, could independently predict PCOS. This finding suggested a novel link between adipokines and PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W2905216009,"Most infants born before 30 weeks gestational age (GA) develop respiratory distress syndrome soon after birth. Methods of surfactant administration that avoid ventilation have been recently introduced. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of implementing a new procedure of less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) and determine whether it is associated with an improvement in respiratory outcome.This single center cohort quality improvement study analyzed preterm infants born before 30 weeks GA between May 2010 and April 2016. Changes in health care practices and respiratory outcomes following the implementation of a LISA, i.e. the administration of surfactant through a thin catheter, were analyzed using quality control charts. Then, the effect of LISA on respiratory outcome was assessed by propensity score matching and logistic regression weighted by the inverse of the propensity score.During the study period, 379 infants were included. Of those that were not intubated at ten minutes of life, 129 received surfactant and were ventilated for one hour or more (InVent), 127 received LISA, five received surfactant with tracheal mechanical ventilation for less than one hour (InSurE), and 55 were only treated with nasal continuous positive pressure during the first hour of neonatal care (nCPAP). Quality-chart analysis revealed rapid implementation of the method with a concomitant decrease in required ventilation. LISA was associated with fewer tracheal ventilation days and a lower incidence of supplemental oxygen on day 28. When controlling for the propensity to be exposed or not to LISA, this procedure was not associated with a lower risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.In this study, the successful implementation of the new method was associated with lower rates of mechanical ventilation, but without a significant reduction of grade I/II/III BPD or death."
https://openalex.org/W2904775560,"The propensity for differentiation varies substantially across human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines, greatly restricting the use of hPSCs for cell replacement therapy or disease modeling. Here, we investigate the underlying mechanisms and demonstrate that activation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway in a transient manner is important for differentiation. In prior work, we demonstrated that pre-treating hPSCs with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) before directed differentiation enhanced differentiation potential across all three germ layers. Here, we show that exposure to DMSO improves the efficiency of hPSC differentiation through Rb and by repressing downstream E2F-target genes. While transient inactivation of the Rb family members (including Rb, p107, and p130) suppresses DMSO’s capacity to enhance differentiation across all germ layers, transient expression of a constitutively active (non-phosphorylatable) form of Rb increases the differentiation efficiency similar to DMSO. Inhibition of downstream targets of Rb, such as E2F signaling, also promotes differentiation of hPSCs. More generally, we demonstrate that the duration of Rb activation plays an important role in regulating differentiation capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2904179228,"The study of leaf litter as a resource for shredders has emerged as a key topic in trophic links in ecology. However, thus far, most studies have emphasized the leaf quality as one of the main determinants of shredder behaviour and growth without simultaneously considering the leaf quantity availability. Nevertheless, the combined effects of leaf quantity and quality on shredder behaviour and growth is particularly crucial to further understand how ecosystem functioning may respond to the increasing flow intermittency due to climate change. In this study, we explore how changes in the leaf litter quality and quantity influence the feeding preferences and growth of an invertebrate shredder (Potamophylax latipennis). To do so, we used black poplar leaves conditioned in two streams with different flow regimens as a food resource. Afterwards, using a microcosm approach, we offered leaf discs that varied in terms of leaf quantity and quality to P. latipennis. Our results showed that flow intermittency had a negative effect on the quality of the food resource, and a lower quality had a negative effect on the consumption and growth rates of P. latipennis. Furthermore, we found that P. latipennis fed selectively on higher quality leaves even though the availability (quantity) of this resource was lower. In the context of climate change, with higher aridity/drier conditions/scenarios, our findings suggest that a decrease in the availability (quantity) of high-quality resources could potentially threaten links in global fluvial food webs and thus threaten ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2903856336,"Ancestral M. tuberculosis complex lineages such as M. africanum are underrepresented among retreatment patients and those with drug resistance. To test the hypothesis that they respond faster to TB treatment, we determined the rate of smear conversion of new pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Bamako, Mali by the main MTBc lineages.Between 2015 and 2017, we conducted a prospective cohort study of new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Bamako. Confirmed MTBc isolates underwent genotyping by spoligotyping for lineage classification. Patients were followed at 1 month (M), 2M and 5M to measure smear conversion in auramine (AR) and Fluorescein DiAcetate (FDA) vital stain microscopy.All the first six human MTBc lineages were represented in the population, plus M. bovis in 0.8% of the patients. The most widely represented lineage was the modern Euro-American lineage (L) 4, 57%, predominantly the T family, followed by L6 (M. africanum type 2) in 22.9%. Ancestral lineages 1, 5, 6 and M. bovis combined amounted to 28.8%. Excluding 25 patients with rifampicin resistance, smear conversion, both by AR and FDA, occurred later in L6 compared to L4 (HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.66-0.97) for AR, and HR 0.81 (95%CI 0.68-0.97) for FDA). In addition we found that HIV negative status, higher BMI at day 0, and patients with smear grade at baseline ≤ 1+ were associated with earlier smear conversion.The six major human lineages of the MTBc all circulate in Bamako. Counter to our hypothesis, we found that patients diseased with modern M. tuberculosis complex L4 respond faster to TB treatment than those with M. africanum L6."
https://openalex.org/W2904055442,"Finding standard cost-effective methods for monitoring biodiversity is challenging due to trade-offs between survey costs (including expertise), specificity, and range of applicability. These trade-offs cause a lack of comparability among datasets collected by ecologists and conservationists, which is most regrettable in taxonomically demanding work on megadiverse inconspicuous taxon groups. We have developed a site-scale survey method for diverse sessile land organisms, which can be analyzed over multiple scales and linked with ecological insights and management. The core idea is that field experts can effectively allocate observation effort when the time, area, and priority sequence of tasks are fixed. We present the protocol, explain its specifications (taxon group; expert qualification; plot size; effort) and applications based on >800 original surveys of four taxon groups; and we analyze its effectiveness using data on polypores in hemiboreal and tropical forests. We demonstrate consistent effort-species richness curves and among-survey variation in contrasting ecosystems, and high effectiveness compared with casual observations both at local and regional scales. Bias related to observer experience appeared negligible compared with typical assemblage variation. Being flexible in terms of sampling design, the method has enabled us to compile data from various projects to assess conservation status and habitat requirements of most species (specifically rarities and including discovery of new species); also, when linked with site descriptions, to complete environmental assessments and select indicator species for management. We conclude that simple rules can significantly improve expert-based biodiversity surveys. Ideally, define (i) a common plot size that addresses multiple taxon groups and management goals; (ii) taxon groups based on field expertise and feasible number of species; (iii) sufficient and practical search time; (iv) a procedure for recording within-plot heterogeneity. Such a framework, combined with freedom to allocate effort on-site, helps utilizing full expertise of observers without losing technical rigor."
https://openalex.org/W2903843015,"To identify the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (EP) in a population of Cameroonian women.We performed a matched case-control study; 88 women with diagnosed EP (cases), and 176 women with first trimester intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) (controls), who underwent questionnaires. Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and adjusted for potential confounding factors via multivariate logistic regression analysis.Of the fifteen identified risk factors, 4 were independently associated with increased odds of EP: prior pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 13.18; 95% CI 6.19-27.42), followed by current use of levonorgestrel-only pills for emergency contraception (LNG-EC) (AOR 10.15; 95% CI 2.21-46.56), previous use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (AOR 3.01; 95% CI 1.04-8.69) and smoking at the time of conception (AOR 2.68; 95% CI 1.12-6.40).The present study confirms the wide variety of EP's risk factors. Moreover, some new findings including current use of LNG-EC, previous use of DMPA, smoking at the time of conception are noteworthy. Thus, in our limited resources country where prevention remains the cornerstone for reducing EP chances of occurrence, clinicians should do enough counselling, especially to women with known risk factors. The necessity to facilitate access to more equipment to enable early diagnosis of EP is very crucial and should be seriously considered, in order to reduce the burden of EP in Cameroonian women."
https://openalex.org/W2904231066,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with reduced physical fitness, higher disease burden, and impaired cognitive functions. Little is known about the operation of these risk factors in older adults when considered comprehensively without relying on the cut-off values of the single MetS components. The three main aims of the current study were to: (i) establish a latent metabolic load factor (MetL), using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and representing a continuous measure of MetL, defined by indicators that are commonly used to separate MetS groups from healthy individuals; (ii) examine the associations of this MetL factor with objective health, and cognitive function in men and women; (iii) compare the magnitude of these associations to those observed for the individual indicators used to define the MetL factor as well to the classical categorized MetS vs. non-MetS groups. The current analysis is based on cross-sectional data from 1,609 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (mean age = 68.5 years, SD (3.7); 50.1% female). We applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to establish a latent MetL factor defined by the five indicators commonly used to diagnose MetS. The latent MetL factor was associated with physician-assessed morbidity and kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) in both men and women, but not with hand grip strength and lung function (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)). In addition, we found a negative association between MetL and fluid intelligence among men. A continuous latent variable approach representing the common variance of MetS indicators is well suited to foster our understanding of human aging as a systemic phenomenon in which risk factors are operating on either side of the normal versus pathological divide."
https://openalex.org/W2904272858,"Current research on gait analysis mostly involves horses and dogs. Feline kinetics and kinematics are being investigated and receiving more clinical interest at present. Ground reaction forces measured on pressure-sensitive mattresses have been established in healthy Domestic Shorthair cats (DSH). Currently, no further information exists on either breed-specific measured gait reaction forces or comparisons among breeds. Because Maine Coon (MC) cats appear to be over-represented with orthopaedic diseases of the hind limb (hip dysplasia, patellar luxation), we evaluated ground reaction force GRF measurements in MC cats and compared them with those of DSH cats. Pre-evaluation radiological and clinical exams determined that the cats were not lame. The parameters evaluated were peak vertical force (PFz), vertical impulse (IFz), time to PFz (TPFz), step length (SL), paw contact area (PCA), stance phase duration (SPD) and symmetry index (SI) for the fore- and hind limbs. In both breeds, PFz and IFz were greater in forelimbs than in hind limbs. The PFz and IFz in Newtons were higher in the MC cats compared to the DSH cats, but not after normalisation for total force (%TF) and body mass (%BM). Furthermore, due to their body conformation, MC cats have a longer SL, larger PCA, and higher body weight than DSH cats. No other parameters differed significantly, except that the TPFz displayed an earlier value in the MC hind limbs. Measured symmetry indices were similar to those reported in dogs and did not differ between breeds. This is the first study to report GRF values and temporospatial parameters in a healthy MC cat population. However, our results could not confirm differences between normalized PFz and IFz and temporospatial parameters between the breeds. The authors therefore conclude that genetic or other causes may be involved in orthopaedic hind limb pathogenesis seen in MC cats more often than in other breeds."

However, its tall tree body often brings many inconveniences to production management. In order to modify the tree size or growth for productivity optimization and simplifying management, it is urgent to reveal the dwarf mechanism of litchi for dwarfing rootstocks or cultivar breeding. However, to date, the mechanisms on litchi dwarfism is still poor known. In the present study, transcriptome profiling were performed on L. chinensis cv. ‘Feizixiao’ (FZX, vigorous cultivar) and ‘Ziniangxi’ (ZNX, dwarf cultivar). A total of 55,810 unigenes were obtained, and 9,190 unigenes were differentially expressed between vigorous and dwarf litchi samples. Gene functional enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were related to phytohormone metabolism and signal transduction, and energy metabolism pathways. In particular, GA2ox were only up-regulated in ZNX samples, indicating GA might play an important role in regulating huge difference between vigorous and dwarf litchi cultivars. In addition, the 35S::LcGA2ox transgenic tobacco plants were dwarf and had smaller leaves or branches than wild type plants. Our study provided a series of candidate genes to reveal the mechanism of litchi dwarf."
https://openalex.org/W2904442689,"Holocene climate variability in the Mediterranean Basin is often cited as a potential driver of societal change, but the mechanisms of this putative influence are generally little explored. In this paper we integrate two tools–agro-ecosystem modeling of potential agricultural yields and spatial analysis of archaeological settlement pattern data–in order to examine the human consequences of past climatic changes. Focusing on a case study in Provence (France), we adapt an agro-ecosystem model to the modeling of potential agricultural productivity during the Holocene. Calibrating this model for past crops and agricultural practices and using a downscaling approach to produce high spatiotemporal resolution paleoclimate data from a Mediterranean Holocene climate reconstruction, we estimate realistic potential agricultural yields under past climatic conditions. These serve as the basis for spatial analysis of archaeological settlement patterns, in which we examine the changing relationship over time between agricultural productivity and settlement location. Using potential agricultural productivity (PAgP) as a measure of the human consequences of climate changes, we focus on the relative magnitudes of 1) climate-driven shifts in PAgP and 2) the potential increases in productivity realizable through agricultural intensification. Together these offer a means of assessing the scale and mechanisms of the vulnerability and resilience of Holocene inhabitants of Provence to climate change. Our results suggest that settlement patterns were closely tied to PAgP throughout most of the Holocene, with the notable exception of the period from the Middle Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age. This pattern does not appear to be linked to any climatically-driven changes in PAgP, and conversely the most salient changes in PAgP during the Holocene cannot be clearly linked to any changes in settlement pattern. We argue that this constitutes evidence that vulnerability and resilience to climate change are strongly dependent on societal variables."
https://openalex.org/W2904585625,"Quantitative models describing environmentally-mediated disease transmission rarely focus on the independent contribution of recruitment and the environment on the force of infection driving outbreaks. In this study we attempt to investigate the interaction between external factors and host's population dynamics in determining the outbreaks of some indirectly transmitted diseases. We first built deterministic and stochastic compartmental models based on anthrax which were parameterized using information from literature and complemented with field observations. Our force of infection function was derived modeling the number of successful transmission encounters as a pure birth process that depends on the pathogen's dispersion effort. After accounting for individual heterogeneity in pathogen's dispersion effort, we allowed the force of infection to vary seasonally according to external factors recreating a scenario in which disease transmission increases in response to an environmental variable. Using simulations we demonstrate that anthrax disease dynamics in mid-latitude grasslands is decoupled from hosts population dynamics. When seasonal forcing was ignored, outbreaks matched hosts reproductive events, a scenario that is not realistic in nature. Instead, when allowing the force of infection to vary seasonally, outbreaks were only present in years were environmental variables were appropriate for the outbreaks to develop. We used the stochastic formulation of the force of infection to derive R0 under scenarios with different assumptions. The derivation of R0 allowed us to conclude that during epizootic years, pathogen contribution to disease persistence is nearly independent of dispersion. In endemic years, only pathogens with high dispersion significantly prevent disease extinction. Finally, we used our model in a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the parameters that determined a significant anthrax outbreak in Montana in 2008. Our study highlights the importance of the environment in determining anthrax outbreak intensity and could be useful to predict future events that could result in significant wildlife and domestic livestock losses."
https://openalex.org/W2905033620,"Determining the efficiency of amino acid (AA) utilization in growing animals is crucial to estimate their requirement accurately. In broiler chickens, the composition of AA in feather is different from feather-free body and the proportion of feathers will change along broiler’s growth, which may impact the efficiency of utilization on AA consumed. Therefore, in order to establish a method that predicts the efficiency of utilization for feather-free body and feather, two approaches were evaluated: a multiple linear regression and a multivariate analysis. Additionally, a new factorial model was proposed to predict AA requirements in broiler chickens. Data from 13 trials that evaluated the requirements for lysine (Lys), sulphur AA (SAA), threonine (Thr), and valine (Val) in male broilers were used for the analyses. Both methods of analysis were consistent in showing that the efficiency of utilization in feather-free body and feather were different. Using multiple linear regression, the values of efficiency of utilization estimated in feather-free body were 0.68, 0.72, 0.81, 0.79 (mg of amino acid deposited / mg of amino acid consumed above maintenance) and in feather were 0.58, 0.77, 0.78, and 1.57 (mg/mg) for Lys, SAA, Thr, and Val, respectively. Applying the multivariate approach, the corresponding predicted values were 0.68, 0.67, 4.23, 0.27 (mg/mg) in feather-free body and 1.16, 0.86, 0.16, and 1.10 (mg/mg) in feather, respectively. According to the results, efficiency of utilization may be related, to some extent, on the concentration determined in each tissue. The uncertainty around the amount of AA consumed for gain directed to feather-free body or feather deposition could be a limitation for multivariate analyses. The results indicated that multiple linear regression predictions may be better estimates of utilization efficiency. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the effect of age on deposition and partitioning of dietary AA in different parts of the broiler."
https://openalex.org/W2903940261,"Species are shifting their ranges due to climate change, many moving to cooler and higher locations. However, with elevation increase comes oxygen decline, potentially limiting a species' ability to track its environment depending on what mechanisms it has available to compensate for hypoxic stress. Pikas (Family Ochotonidae), cold-specialist small mammal species, are already undergoing elevational range shifts. We collected RNA samples from one population of Ochotona roylei in the western Himalaya at three sites- 3,600, 4,000, and 5,000 meters-and found no evidence of significant population genetic structure nor positive selection among sites. However, out of over 10,000 expressed transcripts, 26 were significantly upregulated at the 5,000 m site and were significantly enriched for pathways consistent with physiological compensation for limited oxygen. These results suggest that differences in gene expression may play a key role in enabling hypoxia tolerance on this local scale, indicating elevational flexibility that may facilitate successful range shifts in response to climate change."

The exact characterization of its chromosomes is important for the detailed analysis of prebreeding materials produced with this species. The major aim of this study was to identify and characterize new molecular markers to be used for the rapid analysis of E genome chromatin in wheat background. Sixty of the 169 conserved orthologous set (COS) markers tested on diverse wheat-Th. elongatum disomic/ditelosomic addition lines were assigned to various Th. elongatum chromosomes and will be used for marker-assisted selection. The macrosyntenic relationship between the wheat and Th. elongatum genomes was investigated using EST sequences. Several rearrangements were revealed in homoeologous chromosome groups 2, 5, 6 and 7, while chromosomes 1 and 4 were conserved. Molecular cytogenetic and marker analysis showed the presence of rearranged chromosome involved in 6ES and 2EL arms in the 6E disomic addition line. The selected chromosome arm-specific COS markers will make it possible to identify gene introgressions in breeding programmes and will also be useful in the development of new chromosome-specific markers, evolutionary analysis and gene mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2904092056,"The extinct marsupial ‘lion’ Thylacoleo carnifex was Australia’s largest mammalian carnivore. Despite being the topic of more discussion than any other extinct Australian marsupial (excepting perhaps the Thylacine), basic aspects of its palaeobiology, including its locomotory repertoire, remain poorly understood. Recent discoveries allowed the first reconstruction of an entire skeleton including the first complete tail and hitherto-unrecognised clavicles. Here we describe these elements and re-assess the biomechanics of the postcranial skeleton via comparisons with a range of extant terrestrial, scansorial and arboreal Australian marsupials. Our analysis suggests that T. carnifex possessed: a relatively stiff tail comprising half of the vertebral column length; proximal caudal centra exhibiting a relatively high resistance to sagittal and lateral bending (RSB and RTB); relatively enlarged areas of origin for caudal flexors and extensors; a rigid lumbar spine; and a shoulder girdle braced by strong clavicles. The lever arms of major muscle/tendon systems controlling the axial and appendicular skeleton were identified and RSB and RTB calculated. The combination of these features compared most closely overall with those of the much smaller Tasmanian Devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), a hunter/scavenger capable of climbing. Similar locomotor behaviour is proposed for Thylacoleo carnifex. Orientation of articular facets and RSB stresses also indicate that T. carnifex may have held its tail in a dorsally-flexed position."
https://openalex.org/W2903947494,"The aim of this study was to characterize the biochemical changes and microbiological processes involved in the sensory deviation of “sobretablas” wines during biological aging, which leads to the origin of special or rare “palo cortado” wines. Industrial trials of biological aging of “sobretablas” wines with the potential for the development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were performed to study this phenomenon. The results showed that sensory deviation was due to the development of malolactic fermentation (MLF) together with an attenuated aerobic metabolism of “flor” yeast. Malolactic fermentation (MLF) was promoted by the presence of malic acid concentrations that were higher than 1 g/L and the coexistence of LAB and “flor” velum yeast. Ethyl lactate, acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are some of the volatile compounds that are responsible for this sensory deviation. Wines with high levels of gluconic and malic acids (> 1 g/L) can cause, with very low probability, the sensory deviation of “palo cortado”. A lysozyme dose of 12 g/hL is an effective treatment to avoid malolactic fermentation (MFL) and sensory deviation. Understanding the biochemical and microbiological changes involved in sensory deviation can be useful to wineries as markers to identify the origin of the special sherry wines ""palo cortado"" type."

Using a population-based panel survey of community-dwelling people aged 50-75 years, this cross-sectional study aimed to find the age threshold at which a higher protein intake is associated with higher muscle strength. We utilized a dataset from the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement conducted between 2007 and 2011. Dietary protein intake was estimated using a validated dietary questionnaire and energy-adjusted via density method. Grip strength was measured using a Smedley-type handheld dynamometer. We calculated the marginal effect (and 95% confidence intervals) of protein intake on grip strength with stratification by age using multiple linear regression analyses with robust variance adjusting for potential confounders. There were 9,485 observations from 5,790 participants in the final analysis. Marginal effects of protein intake on grip strength increased with age, and it reached significance and had a positive impact only among men aged ≥75 years and women aged ≥65 years. With an additional 1% energy of protein intake, grip strength was increased by 0.10 kg and 0.19 kg for men and women aged ≥75 years, respectively. Our result indicated the possibility that women needed a high protein intake from a younger age compared with men.

Several current therapies aim at improving availability and/or function of the mutant CFTR proteins. The combination therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi, luma/iva) partially corrects folding and potentiates CFTR function impaired by the F508del mutation. Despite the potential for clinical benefit, a substantial number of patients discontinue treatment due to intolerable adverse effects. The aim of the present study is to identify differences between individuals who continued treatment and those who discontinued due to adverse respiratory effects to potentially inform treatment decisions. Clinical data from the year prior to treatment initiation were analyzed from 82 patients homozygous for the F508del mutation treated at the Colorado Adult CF Program. Blood samples were collected from 30 of these subjects before initiation of treatment to examine expression of circulating leukocyte surface antigens and cytokines. Clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed along with inflammatory markers to determine biomarkers of drug discontinuation. The use of oral prednisone and/or nasal budesonide in the year prior to luma/iva initiation was more prevalent in CF subjects who did not tolerate luma/iva (82% vs. 43%). Increased age, but not gender or initial lung function, was associated with higher probability of discontinuing treatment due to side effects overall. Worse lung function (lower ppFEV1, ppFEF25-75 ≤ 60%) was associated with higher incidence of discontinuing treatment due to pulmonary adverse effects. In a nested cohort of patients, increased surface levels of CXCR2 on CD14+CD16- monocytes were associated with discontinuation. Overall, the patients who tolerated luma/iva were distinguishable from those who did not tolerate the drug based on clinical and cellular markers obtained prior to treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2905458468,"Background Exposure to horses can cause severe allergic reactions in sensitized individuals. The breed, American Bashkir Curly Horse is categorized as hypoallergenic, primarily due to reports of allergic patients experiencing fewer symptoms while handling this special breed. The possible reasons for this phenomenon could be lower allergen production and/or reduced allergen release into the air because of increased sebum content in their skin and hair compared to other breeds. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare different horse breeds in relation to allergen content in hair and airborne dust samples. Methods In total, 224 hair samples from 32 different horse breeds were investigated. Personal nasal filters were used to collect airborne dust during the grooming of 20 Curly Horses and 20 Quarter Horses. Quantitative analysis of all samples was performed using two newly developed immunoassays for the detection of horse dander (HD) antigens and the major allergen Equ c 1 and the commercial assay for Equ c 4. Results were analyzed using multiple linear regression models for hair samples and the Mann Whitney U test for airborne samples. Results Horse antigen and allergen levels differed up to four orders of magnitude between individual animals. Despite enormous variability, levels of HD antigen, Equ c 1 and Equ c 4 in hair were significantly related to the breed and gender combined with the castration status of male animals. Curly Horses had significantly higher concentrations of all three tested parameters compared to the majority of the investigated breeds (medians: 11800 μg/g for HD antigen, 2400 μg/g for Equ c 1, and 258 kU/g for Equ c 4). Tinker Horses, Icelandic Horses and Shetland Ponies were associated with approximately 7-fold reduced levels of HD antigen and Equ c 1, and up to 25-fold reduced levels of Equ c 4 compared to Curly Horses. Compared to mares, stallions displayed increased concentrations of HD antigens, Equ c 1 and Equ c 4 by a factor 2.2, 3.5 and 6.7, respectively. No difference was observed between mares and geldings. No differences in airborne allergen concentrations collected with personal nasal filters during grooming were found between Curly and Quarter Horses. Conclusion Breed and castration status had a significant influence on the antigen and allergen levels of horse hair. However, these differences were smaller than the wide variability observed among individual horses. Compared to other breeds, Curly Horses were not associated with lower allergen levels in hair and in air samples collected during grooming. Our approach provides no molecular explanation why Curly Horses are considered to be hypoallergenic."
https://openalex.org/W2904076803,"We proposed a new efficient image denoising scheme, which mainly leads to four important contributions whose approaches are different from existing ones. The first is to show the equivalence between the group-based sparse representation and the Schatten-p norm minimization problem, so that the sparsity of the coefficients for each group can be measured by estimating the underlying singular values. The second is that we construct the proximal operator for sparse optimization in ℓp space with p ∈ (0, 1] by using fixed-point iteration and obtained a new solution of Schatten-p norm minimization problem, which is more rigorous and accurate than current available results. The third is that we analyze the suitable setting of power p for each noise level σ = 20, 30, 50, 60, 75, 100, respectively. We find that the optimal value of p is inversely proportional to the noise level except for high level of noise, where the best values of p are 1 and 0.95, when the noise levels are respectively 75 and 100. Last we measure the structural similarity between two image patches and extends previous deterministic annealing-based solution to sparsity optimization problem through incorporating the idea of dictionary learning. Experimental results demonstrate that for every given noise level, the proposed Spatially Adaptive Fixed Point Iteration (SAFPI) algorithm attains the best denoising performance on the value of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and structure similarity (SSIM), being able to retain the image structure information, which outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D), Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (WNNM) and Weighted Schatten p-Norm Minimization (WSNM)."
https://openalex.org/W2904458004,"Background Male partner participation improves uptake, retention and outcomes of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services. However, in patriarchal settings few men accompany their partners to antenatal care (ANC) and PMTCT services. We explored whether community leaders can improve male partner participation in ANC and PMTCT. Methods We integrated initiatives to increase male partner participation in routine ANC care in six health facilities (attending about 4,500 new pregnant women per quarter) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in 2015/16. These initiatives were adapted from a best performing health facility, on male partner participation in ANC and PMTCT, referred to as the “best practice site”. At the six purposively selected intervention sites, we sensitized and garnered commitment from healthcare providers to provide couple friendly services. We then worked with the providers to sensitize and engage community leaders to integrate and promote male partner participation initiatives in their routine community activities. We assessed change in male partner participation in ANC and PMTCT using the proportion of women testing for HIV together with their partners (i.e. couple HIV testing) by quarter. We used 203 ANC facilities (attending about 31,000 new pregnant women per quarter) in the same area as control sites. Results After one year, couple HIV testing in the six intervention sites had tripled from 11.9% at baseline to 36.0% (p<0.001) while there was very little change (from 17.7% to 18.3%) in the 203 control sites (p = 0.07). Statistically significant improvements in couple testing were observed in four of the six intervention sites (6.7% to 19.1%; 9.3% to 74.6%; 46.2% to 95.2%; and 4.7% to 15.1% respectively. p<0.001 for all sites). Two of these four sites, located in the same administrative district as the best practice site, achieved remarkably high couple HIV testing (95.2% and 74.6%). This may be attributable to the greater engagement and active participation of the community leaders in these two sites compared to the other four. Conclusion Effective engagement and functional partnerships between healthcare providers and community leaders can contribute to improve male partner participation in ANC and PMTCT services. PMTCT programs should capitalize on community leaders, in addressing low male partner participation in ANC and PMTCT, in order to improve effective uptake, retention and outcomes of HIV prevention and treatment services among pregnant and breastfeeding women, their partners, infants and families."
https://openalex.org/W2905533812,"Background Anastomotic leakage can be classified by free and contained leakage according to clinical manifestations. The risk factors and their comparison between these leakage subtypes are uncertain. This study aims to evaluate anastomotic leakage patterns and to compare clinical features between free and contained leakages after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Materials and methods Between January 2005 and December 2012, a total of 2035 consecutive patients who underwent low anterior resection for primary rectal cancer were evaluated retrospectively at two-tertiary referral centers. The primary end points of this study were to assess detailed clinical features among leakage subtypes. The secondary end point was to compare risk factors between free and contained leakages. Results Patients were subdivided into a no leakage group (n = 1890), free leakage group (n = 73), and contained leakage group (n = 72). Free leakage occurred more frequently in laparoscopic and robotic surgeries than open surgery (p = 0.015). On the other hand, contained leakage was developed in a higher rate of patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (p<0.001). The mean development time was 4.6 days in the free leakage group, and 23.6 days in the contained leakage group. Patients with free leakage had a lower rate of a defunctioning stoma than contained leakage (5.5% vs. 29.2%, p<0.001). Risk factors for free leakage were smoking, tumor location, and laparoscopic surgery. However, tumor location and preoperative chemoradiotherapy increased the risk for contained leakage. Conclusions Contained leakage in rectal cancer surgery showed different clinical manifestations and risk factors compared to free leakage. It is necessary to pay more attention to patients with particular risk factors for anastomotic leakage subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2904211736,"Attention maps have been fused in the VggNet structure (EAC-Net) [1] and have shown significant improvement compared to that of the VggNet structure. However, in [1], E-Net was designed based on the facial action unit (AU) center and for facial AU detection only. Thus, for the use of attention maps in every image type, this paper proposed a new convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, P_VggNet, comprising the following parts: P_Net and VggNet with 16 layers (VggNet-16). The generation approach of P_Net was designed, and the P_VggNet structure was proposed. To prove the efficiency of P_VggNet, we designed two experiments, which indicated that P_VggNet could more efficiently extract image features than VggNet-16."
https://openalex.org/W2903692566,"Differentiation of B cells is a stringently controlled multi-step process, which is still incompletely understood. Here we identify and characterize a rare population of human B cells, which surprisingly carry CD8AB on their surface. Existence of such cells was demonstrated both in tonsils and in human apheresis material. Gene expression profiling and real time PCR detected however no CD8A or CD8B message in these cells. Instead, we found that surface CD8 was hijacked from activated CD8+ T cells by a transfer process that required direct cell-to-cell contact. A focused transcriptome analysis at single cell level allowed the dissection of the CD8 positive B cell population. We found that the affected cells are characteristically of the CD27+CD200- phenotype, and consist of two discrete late-stage subpopulations that carry signatures of activated memory B like cells, and early plasmablasts. Thus, there is only a restricted time window in the differentiation process during which B cells can intimately interact with CD8+ T cells. The findings point to a novel link between the T and B arms of the adaptive immune system, and suggest that CD8+ T cells have the capability to directly shape the global antibody repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2904948365,"Bortezomib, a first generation proteasome inhibitor, is used in both newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma settings. Considerable differences exist in the usage of bortezomib therapy in the clinical practice setting in comparison to clinical trial setting as well manufacturer's recommendations. These differences include route of administration (intravenous (iv) vs. subcutaneous (sc)), frequency from twice to once weekly, choice of alkylating agent used in combination with bortezomib (melphalan or cyclophosphamide), and choice of glucocorticoids (dexamethasone or prednisolone). We reviewed data from 272 consecutive bortezomib-treated myeloma patients, who received therapy within the regional Thames Valley Cancer Network for both newly diagnosed myeloma (NDMM, n = 120) and relapsed MM (RMM, n = 152). We investigated the influence of age, sex, transplant, bortezomib combinations (doublet vs. triplet), cumulative bortezomib dose per treatment line (<50mg vs. ≥50mg), and route of administration (iv vs. sc) on time to next treatment (TTNT) and on overall survival (OS). Route of bortezomib administration (iv vs. sc) influenced neither OS (41 vs 35 months, p = 0.5), nor TTNT (14 vs. 19 months, p = 0.052). Our study showed a statistically significant improvement in median OS in patients receiving a cumulative dose ≥50mg compared to <50mg (42 vs. 33months, p = 0.003), although presence of confounders need to be taken into account, such as disease stage, performance status, genetic changes and prior therapies. Median OS was longer using triplet therapies compared to a doublet in the RMM cohort (37 vs. 29 months, p = 0.06), although this did not reach statistical significance. Multivariate Cox Regression analysis showed that cumulative bortezomib dose ≥50mg (p = 0.002, HR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67) and autologous transplant (p = 0.002, HR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.41-3.98) were both significant factors associated with improved OS. Our data argues in favour of continuing bortezomib for the recommended duration as per Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), subject to good tolerability, in order to deepen response or extend the duration of best response."
https://openalex.org/W2903669936,"To describe level of education and work participation among adults with congenital unilateral upper limb deficiency (CUULD) in Norway and to explore associations between work participation and demographic and clinical factors.Cross-sectional study. In 2012, a postal questionnaire was sent to 186 persons with congenital limb deficiency (CLD), age ≥ 20 years, registered at the TRS National Resource Center for Rare Disorders. In the original CLD study, 77 persons with CUULD responded. In this paper 64 persons with CUULD of working age (20-67 years) are included. Data on demographic factors as education level and work participation, and clinical factors including limb deficiency characteristics, chronic pain (Standardized Nordic Questionnaire), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), physical and mental health (SF-36) were analyzed through descriptive and comparable statistics and logistic regression analyses.Sixty-four persons participated, mean age 43.4 (SD 13.7; range 20-67 years), 45 were women. Education level >13 years was reported by 34. Forty- three of the 64 participants were employed, 21 were prematurely retired (disability benefits). 11 of the 43 employed, and 6 of the 21 prematurely retired had completed vocational education. Physically demanding occupations (work activities that required standing, walking and lifting) were reported by 25 of the 43 employed and 13 of the 21 prematurely retired. 17 of the 64 reported need for further adaptions in their workplaces. The strongest predictors of work participation were younger age (OR 0.86) and good physical health (OR 1.21).Two thirds of persons with CUULD were employed; while one third was prematurely retired and had left work earlier than expected. This suggests that persons with CUULD may experience challenges in work participation. Although levels of education were relatively high, several had chosen careers that required physical strain. Younger age and good physical health were the most important factors mediating work participation."

This study evaluate changes over time in QoC measurement performance in a large diabetes registry among newly diagnosed diabetics and it association with mortality.Retrospective cohort study of patients in a large health maintenance organization diabetes registry from years 2000 to 2013. We identified 58,182 patients diagnosed with diabetes from 2000-2008 and examined the level of performance for seven QoC measurements (HbA1c, LDL, albumin-creatinine-ratio, fundus/foot examinations, BMI and Blood-pressure) at diagnosis year. We also searched data regarding visits to dietitians or endocrinologists, and purchase of diabetes and statin medications. We used Mantel-Haenszel's χ2 test to assess QoC performance and mortality rate by calendar year of entry into the registry, and Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality up to 5 years from diagnosis adjusted for age, gender, socio-economic status and comorbidities.The total QoC measurements improved from a mean of 2.71 tests performed in 2000 to 5.69 in 2008 (p<0.001). The mortality rate dropped from 7.7% in 2000 to 5.7% in 2008 (p<0.001). Patients with more QoC measurements performance who visited a dietitian and purchased statin medications had a lower mortality risk (HRs (95% CIs) 0.89 (0.87-0.92), 0.83 (0.76-0.91) and 0.70(0.65-0.75) respectively). Visits to endocrinologists and purchases of oral diabetes medication and insulin were associated with a higher risk of mortality (HRs (95% CIs) 1.20(1.07-1.35), 1.35(1.26-1.46) and 3.36(2.92-3.87) respectively).Performance of QoC measurements including visiting a dietitian and purchase of statin medications were associated with lower mortality in patients with diabetes. It may be that the early active involvement of the patients in their care plays a protective role in long term mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2904557127,"This paper introduces a new model of sleep for mammals. It extends the classic 'two-process' model of sleep to account for differences in external circumstances. We apply this model to previously-collected data on elephants and sloths, comparing sleep patterns in the wild with sleep patterns in captivity. We find that the model does very well in explaining sleeping patterns for both types of animals, in both the captive state and in the wild state."
https://openalex.org/W2905524397,"Premature baboons exhibit peripheral insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling. 5’ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation improves insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake (via increased glucose transporter type 4 [GLUT4] translocation and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]/ atypical protein kinase C [aPKC] pathway), and increasing fatty acid oxidation (via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 [ACC]), while downregulating gluconeogenesis (via induction of small heterodimer partner [SHP] and subsequent downregulation of the gluconeogenic enzymes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [PEPCK], glucose 6-phosphatase [G6PASE], fructose- 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 [FBP1], and forkhead box protein 1 [FOXO1]). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacologic activation of AMPK with AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboximide riboside) administration improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in preterm baboons. 11 baboons were delivered prematurely at 125±2 days (67%) gestation. 5 animals were randomized to receive 5 days of continuous AICAR infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg·g-1·day-1. 6 animals were in the placebo group. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed at 5±2 and 14±2 days of life. Key molecules potentially altered by AICAR (AMPK, GLUT4, ACC, PEPCK, G6PASE, FBP1, and FOXO1), and the insulin signaling molecules: insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), protein kinase B (AKT), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) were measured using RT-PCR and western blotting. AICAR infusion did not improve whole body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in preterm baboons (12.8±2.4 vs 12.4±2.0 mg/(kg·min), p = 0.8, placebo vs AICAR). One animal developed complications during treatment. In skeletal muscle, AICAR infusion did not increase phosphorylation of ACC, AKT, or AMPK whereas it increased mRNA expression of ACACA (ACC), AKT, and PPARGC1A (PGC1α). In the liver, INSR, IRS1, G6PC3, AKT, PCK1, FOXO1, and FBP1 were unchanged, whereas PPARGC1A mRNA expression increased after AICAR infusion. This study provides evidence that AICAR does not improve insulin sensitivity in premature euglycemic baboons, and may have adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W2903883242,"The transfer of protons through proton translocating channels is a complex process, for which direct samplings of different protonation states and side chain conformations in a transition network calculation provide an efficient, bias-free description. In principle, a new transition network calculation is required for every unsampled change in the system of interest, e.g. an unsampled protonation state change, which is associated with significant computational costs. Transition networks void of or including an unsampled change are termed unperturbed or perturbed, respectively. Here, we present a prediction method, which is based on an extensive coarse-graining of the underlying transition networks to speed up the calculations. It uses the minimum spanning tree and a corresponding sensitivity analysis of an unperturbed transition network as initial guess and refinement parameter for the determination of an unknown, perturbed transition network. Thereby, the minimum spanning tree defines a sub-network connecting all nodes without cycles and minimal edge weight sum, while the sensitivity analysis analyzes the stability of the minimum spanning tree towards individual edge weight reductions. Using the prediction method, we are able to reduce the calculation costs in a model system by up to 80%, while important network properties are maintained in most predictions."
