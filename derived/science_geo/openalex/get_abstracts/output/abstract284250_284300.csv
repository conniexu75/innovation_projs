https://openalex.org/W2151161113,"The observed interannual variability of temperature at 60 degrees N has been investigated. The results indicate that the surface warming due to increased carbon dioxide which is predicted by three-dimensional climate models should be detectable now. It is not, possibly because the predicted warming is being delayed more than a decade by ocean thermal inertia, or because there is a compensating cooling due to other factors. Further consideration of the uncertainties in model predictions and of the likely delays introduced by ocean thermal inertia extends the range of time for the detection of warming, if it occurs, to the year 2000. The effects of increasing carbon dioxide should be looked for in several variables simultaneously in order to minimize the ambiguities that could result from unrecognized compensating cooling."
https://openalex.org/W2033304296,"Multichannel seismic-reflection data show that the Victoria Land-basin, unlike other sedimentary basins in the Ross Sea, includes a rift-depression 15 to 25 kilometers wide that parallels the Transantarctic Mountains and contains up to 12 kilometers of possible Paleozoic to Holocene age sedimentary rocks. An unconformity separates the previously identified Cenozoic sedimentary section from the underlying strata of possible Mesozoic and Paleozoic age. Late Cenozoic volcanic rocks intrude into the entire section along the eastern flank of the basin. The Victoria Land basin is probably part of a more extensive rift system that has been active episodically since Paleozoic time. Inferred rifting and basin subsidence during Mesozoic and Cenozoic time may be associated with regional crustal extension and uplift of the nearby Transantarctic Mountains."
https://openalex.org/W1988377274,"Sea level rise, deltaic progradation, and floodplain aggradation have changed the landscape in the vicinity of ancient Troy during the past 10,000 years. With the waning of the last major world glaciation and resultant sea level rise and fluctuation, a marine embayment protruded nearly 10 kilometers south of the site of Troy at Hisarlik in the Troad of northwest Turkey. As the sea approached its present level approximately 6000 years ago, fluvial and marine deposition caused a northerly migration of the delta and floodplain of the Scamander and Simois Rivers past the site of Troy toward the present-day coast about 6 kilometers north of the site. In view of these major changes in morphology, interpretations of ancient geographies related to historical or historical-mythological settings must be changed. A number of paleogeographic maps have been reconstructed with the use of subsurface data that records the continuing landscape change since the first occupancy of the site at Troy 5000 years ago. These show that ancient Troy was located on an embayment of the sea. If the Trojan War occurred, then the axis of the battlefield and associated events must be relocated to the south and west of Troy."

A comparison of the fluxes of ten elements into the traps and into the surface sediment indicates that the refractory elements iron, aluminum, and barium are accumulating in the sediments at rates very similar to those measured in the traps. In contrast, at least 80 percent of the opal, 50 percent of the carbonate, and 90 percent of the organic carbon is consumed at the sediment-water interface."

It was possible to stimulate this morphological event with physiological amounts of hormone by mimicking, with two injections, the timing of normal increases in endogenous hormone of blood-fed females."

Marginopora vertebralis and Cyclorbiculina compressa show distinct differences in life history, growth rate history, and life-span, as reflected in stable isotope patterns within their shells."
https://openalex.org/W2004614548,"Infrared reflectance spectra have been obtained for the meteorites Shergotty and Allan Hills (ALHA) 77005, a unique achondrite apparently related to the shergottites. Comparisons with the reflectance spectra of eucrites and asteroid 4 Vesta indicate that the surface of Vesta is covered with eucrite-like basalts and that, if shergottite-like basalts are present on the surface of Vesta, they must be a minor rock type. The paradox that both the eucrite and shergottite parent bodies should presently exist is examined. The preferred solution is that both eucrites and shergottites are derived from Vesta, and that this asteroid is compositionally and isotopically heterogeneous; however, other possible solutions cannot be ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W2084018458,"Three high-temperature, high-density experments were conducted recently with the 10-terawatt, short-wavelength Novette laser system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The experiments demonstrated successful solutions to problems that arose during previous laser-plasma interaction experiments with long-wavelength (greater than 1 micrometer) lasers: (i) large-scale plasmas, with dimensions approaching those needed for high-gain inertial fusion targets, were produced in which potentially deleterious laser-plasma instabilities were collisionally damped; (ii) deuterium-tritium fuel was imploded to a density of 20 grams per cubic centimeter and a pressure of 10(10) atmospheres under the improved laser conditions, and compression conditions (preheating and pressure) were consistent with code calculations that predict efficient (high-gain) burn of a large thermonuclear fuel mass when driven with a large, short-wavelength laser; and (iii) soft x-rays were amplified by a factor of 700 by stimulated emission at 206 and 209 angstroms (62 electron volts) from selenium ions in a laser-generated plasma. These small, short-pulse x-ray sources are 10(10) to 10(11) times brighter than the most powerful x-ray generators and synchrotron sources available today. The plasma conditions for these experiments were made possible by advances in Nd:glass laser technology, in techniques to generate efficiently its short-wavelength harmonics at 0.53, 0.35, and 0.26 micrometers, and in diagnostic and computational modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2008875140,"The passive (rifted) continental margin of Wilkes Land, Antarctica, is characterized on seismic reflection records by (i) in the south, a block-faulted sequence of highly stratified continental beds overlain by two distinct unconformities; (ii) a transitional, greatly thinned continental crust overlain by material interpreted to be flood basalt; and (iii) in the north, oceanic crust with a boundary ridge at its edge. The MohoroviciÄ‡ discontinuity can be followed across the continent-ocean boundary and shows a progressive thinning of continental crust to a minimum of 2.5 kilometers at its northern edge."

https://openalex.org/W2088282936,"The Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS) is a promising energy-conservation program that lacks the appeal of crash programs for synthetic fuels and is under heavy attack by home builders and utilities, who want to delay implementation for a testing period in different climatic regions. If an amendment to BEPS is passed, the testing period will allow time to demonstrate the costs and benefits of different building designs in several parts of the country. A linkage of BEPS with government housing loans could be dropped, making the standards essentially voluntary. Environmental and consumer groups and the American Institute of Architects feel the standards should be even stronger. Home builders object on the grounds of cost and the complexity of the standards. They would prefer a flexible approach based on final building performance. The electric utilities object to the restrictions on electric-resistance heating because of the weighting scheme. (DCK)"
