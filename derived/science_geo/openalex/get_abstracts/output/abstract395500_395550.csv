A combination of whole-genome amplification and sequencing of single nuclei separated by fluorescence activated cell sorting now reveals the population structure of breast tumours from two patients. In both, tumour growth is by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates, in contrast to the many gradual models of tumour progression. Single-cell sequencing of this type — once it becomes cheaper — is likely to have clinical implications for cancer prognosis and staging. Although it is known that tumours are genetically heterogeneous it has so far been difficult to dissect this heterogeneity at a single cell level. This paper combines whole-genome amplification and next-generation sequencing of flow-sorted nuclei from breast tumours to investigate their population structure and evolution. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, the results indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates. Genomic analysis provides insights into the role of copy number variation in disease, but most methods are not designed to resolve mixed populations of cells. In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common1,2,3, very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse ‘pseudodiploid’ cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2070910260,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has an important role in regulating cellular energy metabolism; in response to a fall in intracellular ATP levels, it activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes. Here, a role for ADP in regulating AMPK by protecting the enzyme from dephosphorylation is defined, and a crystal structure of the active enzyme containing the kinase domain is presented. A model is proposed for how AMP and ADP regulate AMPK activity. The heterotrimeric AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism; in response to a fall in intracellular ATP levels it activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes1. AMPK has been implicated in a number of diseases related to energy metabolism including type 2 diabetes, obesity and, most recently, cancer2,3,4,5,6. AMPK is converted from an inactive form to a catalytically competent form by phosphorylation of the activation loop within the kinase domain7: AMP binding to the γ-regulatory domain promotes phosphorylation by the upstream kinase8, protects the enzyme against dephosphorylation, as well as causing allosteric activation9. Here we show that ADP binding to just one of the two exchangeable AXP (AMP/ADP/ATP) binding sites on the regulatory domain protects the enzyme from dephosphorylation, although it does not lead to allosteric activation. Our studies show that active mammalian AMPK displays significantly tighter binding to ADP than to Mg-ATP, explaining how the enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions where the concentration of Mg-ATP is higher than that of ADP and much higher than that of AMP. We have determined the crystal structure of an active AMPK complex. The structure shows how the activation loop of the kinase domain is stabilized by the regulatory domain and how the kinase linker region interacts with the regulatory nucleotide-binding site that mediates protection against dephosphorylation. From our biochemical and structural data we develop a model for how the energy status of a cell regulates AMPK activity."

https://openalex.org/W2079362912,"We carried out a genome-wide association study of IgA nephropathy, a major cause of kidney failure worldwide. We studied 1,194 cases and 902 controls of Chinese Han ancestry, with targeted follow up in Chinese and European cohorts comprising 1,950 cases and 1,920 controls. We identified three independent loci in the major histocompatibility complex, as well as a common deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 at chromosome 1q32 and a locus at chromosome 22q12 that each surpassed genome-wide significance (P values for association between 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ and 4.84 × 10⁻⁹ and minor allele odds ratios of 0.63-0.80). These five loci explain 4-7% of the disease variance and up to a tenfold variation in interindividual risk. Many of the alleles that protect against IgA nephropathy impart increased risk for other autoimmune or infectious diseases, and IgA nephropathy risk allele frequencies closely parallel the variation in disease prevalence among Asian, European and African populations, suggesting complex selective pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2068326740,"This report uncovers that activation of Src lies downstream of multiple trastuzumab-resistance–driving pathways. The authors show that Src, a major mediator of PI3K and IGFR resistance pathways, also drives resistance caused by PTEN loss, revealing that Src is directly dephosphorylated by PTEN. Src inhibition can overcome de novo and acquired trastuzumab resistance, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy broadly applicable in breast cancer. Trastuzumab is a successful rationally designed ERBB2-targeted therapy. However, about half of individuals with ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer do not respond to trastuzumab-based therapies, owing to various resistance mechanisms. Clinically applicable regimens for overcoming trastuzumab resistance of different mechanisms are not yet available. We show that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (SRC) is a key modulator of trastuzumab response and a common node downstream of multiple trastuzumab resistance pathways. We find that SRC is activated in both acquired and de novo trastuzumab-resistant cells and uncover a novel mechanism of SRC regulation involving dephosphorylation by PTEN. Increased SRC activation conferred considerable trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells and correlated with trastuzumab resistance in patients. Targeting SRC in combination with trastuzumab sensitized multiple lines of trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab and eliminated trastuzumab-resistant tumors in vivo, suggesting the potential clinical application of this strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2096200085,"In this paper we report the development of two attachments to a commercial cell phone that transform the phone's integrated lens and image sensor into a 350x microscope and visible-light spectrometer. The microscope is capable of transmission and polarized microscopy modes and is shown to have 1.5 micron resolution and a usable field-of-view of 150 x 50 with no image processing, and approximately 350 x 350 when post-processing is applied. The spectrometer has a 300 nm bandwidth with a limiting spectral resolution of close to 5 nm. We show applications of the devices to medically relevant problems. In the case of the microscope, we image both stained and unstained blood-smears showing the ability to acquire images of similar quality to commercial microscope platforms, thus allowing diagnosis of clinical pathologies. With the spectrometer we demonstrate acquisition of a white-light transmission spectrum through diffuse tissue as well as the acquisition of a fluorescence spectrum. We also envision the devices to have immediate relevance in the educational field."
https://openalex.org/W2062046532,"Two single-stranded DNA binding proteins, POT1 and RPA, associate with the ends of DNA chromosomes, which are known as telomeres. Binding of RPA to telomeres can activate a DNA damage response, so it was suggested that POT1 might bind telomeres to prevent RPA association. Zou and colleagues unexpectedly find that POT1 and its partner TPP1 do not prevent RPA binding, but hnRNPA1 does. TERRA, a telomere-associated RNA, displaces hnRNPA1 and promotes POT1 binding after S phase, when replication is completed. Two single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, POT1 and RPA, associate with telomeres. Binding of RPA to telomeres can activate a DNA damage response, so it was previously proposed that POT1 binds telomeres to prevent RPA association. Here, it is found that POT1–TPP1 cannot prevent RPA binding, and hnRNPA1 is identified as having this activity instead. In addition, it is shown that TERRA, a telomere-associated RNA, displaces hnRNPA1 and promotes POT1 binding after S phase, when replication is completed. Maintenance of telomeres requires both DNA replication and telomere ‘capping’ by shelterin. These two processes use two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins, replication protein A (RPA) and protection of telomeres 1 (POT1). Although RPA and POT1 each have a critical role at telomeres, how they function in concert is not clear. POT1 ablation leads to activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinase at telomeres1,2, suggesting that POT1 antagonizes RPA binding to telomeric ssDNA. Unexpectedly, we found that purified POT1 and its functional partner TPP1 are unable to prevent RPA binding to telomeric ssDNA efficiently. In cell extracts, we identified a novel activity that specifically displaces RPA, but not POT1, from telomeric ssDNA. Using purified protein, here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) recapitulates the RPA displacing activity. The RPA displacing activity is inhibited by the telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) in early S phase, but is then unleashed in late S phase when TERRA levels decline at telomeres3. Interestingly, TERRA also promotes POT1 binding to telomeric ssDNA by removing hnRNPA1, suggesting that the re-accumulation of TERRA after S phase helps to complete the RPA-to-POT1 switch on telomeric ssDNA. Together, our data suggest that hnRNPA1, TERRA and POT1 act in concert to displace RPA from telomeric ssDNA after DNA replication, and promote telomere capping to preserve genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1999731014,"Predator-prey interactions, including between large mammalian wildlife species, can be represented as a ""space race"", where prey try to minimize and predators maximize spatial overlap. Human activity can also influence the distribution of wildlife species. In particular, high-human disturbance can displace large carnivore predators, a trait-mediated direct effect. Predator displacement by humans could then indirectly benefit prey species by reducing predation risk, a trait-mediated indirect effect of humans that spatially decouples predators from prey. The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that high-human activity was displacing predators and thus indirectly creating spatial refuge for prey species, helping prey win the ""space race"". We measured the occurrence of eleven large mammal species (including humans and cattle) at 43 camera traps deployed on roads and trails in southwest Alberta, Canada. We tested species co-occurrence at camera sites using hierarchical cluster and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analyses; and tested whether human activity, food and/or habitat influenced predator and prey species counts at camera sites using regression tree analysis. Cluster and NMS analysis indicated that at camera sites humans co-occurred with prey species more than predator species and predator species had relatively low co-occurrence with prey species. Regression tree analysis indicated that prey species were three times more abundant on roads and trails with >32 humans/day. However, predators were less abundant on roads and trails that exceeded 18 humans/day. Our results support the hypothesis that high-human activity displaced predators but not prey species, creating spatial refuge from predation. High-human activity on roads and trails (i.e., >18 humans/day) has the potential to interfere with predator-prey interactions via trait-mediated direct and indirect effects. We urge scientist and managers to carefully consider and quantify the trait-mediated indirect effects of humans, in addition to direct effects, when assessing human impacts on wildlife and ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1963503185,"The diurnal cycle of light and dark is one of the strongest environmental factors for life on Earth. Many species in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems use the level of ambient light to regulate their metabolism, growth, and behavior. The sky glow caused by artificial lighting from urban areas disrupts this natural cycle, and has been shown to impact the behavior of organisms, even many kilometers away from the light sources. It could be hypothesized that factors that increase the luminance of the sky amplify the degree of this “ecological light pollution”. We show that cloud coverage dramatically amplifies the sky luminance, by a factor of 10.1 for one location inside of Berlin and by a factor of 2.8 at 32 km from the city center. We also show that inside of the city overcast nights are brighter than clear rural moonlit nights, by a factor of 4.1. These results have important implications for choronobiological and chronoecological studies in urban areas, where this amplification effect has previously not been considered."
https://openalex.org/W1977819146,"Background Mangroves are transitional coastal ecosystems in tropical and sub-tropical regions and represent biologically important and productive ecosystems. Despite their great ecological and economic importance, mangroves are often situated in areas of high anthropogenic influence, being exposed to pollutants, such as those released by oil spills. Methodology/Principal Findings A microcosm experiment was conducted, which simulated an oil spill in previously pristine mangrove sediment. The effect of the oil spill on the extant microbial community was studied using direct pyrosequencing. Extensive bacterial diversity was observed in the pristine mangrove sediment, even after oil contamination. The number of different OTUs only detected in contaminated samples was significantly higher than the number of OTUs only detected in non-contaminated samples. The phylum Proteobacteria, in particular the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, were prevalent before and after the simulated oil spill. On the other hand, the order Chromatiales and the genus Haliea decreased upon exposure to 2 and 5% oil, these are proposed as sensitive indicators of oil contamination. Three other genera, Marinobacterium, Marinobacter and Cycloclasticus increased their prevalence when confronted with oil. These groups are possible targets for the biomonitoring of the impact of oil in mangrove settings. Conclusions/Significance We suggest the use of sequences of the selected genera as proxies for oil pollution, using qPCR assessments. The quantification of these genera in distinct mangrove systems in relation to the local oil levels would permit the evaluation of the level of perturbance of mangroves, being useful in field monitoring. Considering the importance of mangroves to many other environments and the susceptibility of such areas to oil spills this manuscript will be of broad interest."
https://openalex.org/W1987146639,"In somatic cells, Holliday junctions can be formed between sister chromatids during the recombinational repair of DNA breaks or after replication fork demise. A variety of processes act upon Holliday junctions to remove them from DNA, in events that are critical for proper chromosome segregation. In human cells, the BLM protein, inactivated in individuals with Bloom's syndrome, acts in combination with topoisomerase IIIα, RMI1 and RMI2 (BTR complex) to promote the dissolution of double Holliday junctions. Cells defective for BLM exhibit elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and patients with Bloom's syndrome develop a broad spectrum of early-onset cancers caused by chromosome instability. MUS81-EME1 (refs 4-7), SLX1-SLX4 (refs 8-11) and GEN1 (refs 12, 13) also process Holliday junctions but, in contrast to the BTR complex, do so by endonucleolytic cleavage. Here we deplete these nucleases from Bloom's syndrome cells to analyse human cells compromised for the known Holliday junction dissolution/resolution pathways. We show that depletion of MUS81 and GEN1, or SLX4 and GEN1, from Bloom's syndrome cells results in severe chromosome abnormalities, such that sister chromatids remain interlinked in a side-by-side arrangement and the chromosomes are elongated and segmented. Our results indicate that normally replicating human cells require Holliday junction processing activities to prevent sister chromatid entanglements and thereby ensure accurate chromosome condensation. This phenotype was not apparent when both MUS81 and SLX4 were depleted from Bloom's syndrome cells, suggesting that GEN1 can compensate for their absence. Additionally, we show that depletion of MUS81 or SLX4 reduces the high frequency of SCEs in Bloom's syndrome cells, indicating that MUS81 and SLX4 promote SCE formation, in events that may ultimately drive the chromosome instabilities that underpin early-onset cancers associated with Bloom's syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2081988754,"Plasmalemmal neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) regulate the level of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA) and glutamate, after their release at brain synapses. Stimuli including protein kinase C (PKC) activation can lead to the internalization of some NTTs and a reduction in neurotransmitter clearance capacity. We found that the protein Flotillin-1 (Flot1), also known as Reggie-2, was required for PKC-regulated internalization of members of two different NTT families, the DA transporter (DAT) and the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2, and we identified a conserved serine residue in Flot1 that is essential for transporter internalization. Further analysis revealed that Flot1 was also required to localize DAT within plasma membrane microdomains in stable cell lines, and was essential for amphetamine-induced reverse transport of DA in neurons but not for DA uptake. In sum, our findings provide evidence for a critical role of Flot1-enriched membrane microdomains in PKC-triggered DAT endocytosis and the actions of amphetamine."

Interestingly, these two domains are separated by a short linker that can be cleaved after secretion. The cleavage phenomenon has been shown to occur in humans as well as in rodents (13Ge H. Yang G.

The physiological relevance of the proteolytic processing of ANGPTL4 is largely unknown. In a human study, treatment with fenofibrate, a potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α agonist, markedly increased plasma levels of cleaved ANGPTL4. On this basis, it was proposed that the cleaved form of ANGPTL4 may have specific functions (14Mandard S. Zandbergen F. Tan N.S. Escher P. Patsouris D. Koenig W. Kleemann R. Bakker A. Veenman F.

This may be due to an ability of the N-terminal domain to facilitate the interaction between the C-terminal domain and the cell surface.

Early studies in endothelial and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells showed that ANGPTL4 is cleaved after a conserved basic sequence (-RXKR-), and mutation of all four of these amino acids abolishes the cleavage of ANGPTL4 in vitro and in vivo (15Yin W.

There are nine members of the PC family (seven are basic amino acid-cleaving enzymes), but little is known about the relative effectiveness of each of them in the normal processing of ANGPTL4.

The media collected with 10 units/ml heparin are referred to as conditioned media. The cells were lysed using the RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell lysate was then collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The EGFP expression in the cell lysate was measured (excitation/emission, 482/515 nm) using a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (MDS Analytical Technology). It was considered to be positive when it was 5-fold higher than the signal from the untreated cell lysate. The LPL-myc stably expressing cells were used as described previously (18Jin W. Fuki I.V.

Murine primary hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (19Jin W. Wang X. Millar J.S. Quertermous T. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) (Pierce) in biotinylation buffer (2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5) for 40 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by incubation with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 20 min. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with DMEM for the indicated time. The biotin-labeled proteins in the media were captured using streptavidin-coated agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with cold PBS. The bound proteins were eluted from beads using 4× sample loading buffer for 10 min at 70 °C. The elute was separated from the beads by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature and readied for protein analysis. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were carried out as described previously (20Jin W. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Octtaviani E. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ANGPTL4 cleavage analysis was performed using the anti-Myc or anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies. Blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by detection with chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Pierce). A modified ELISA was used to measure any Myc tag-containing protein as described previously (19Jin W. Wang X. Millar J.S. Quertermous T. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Primers for PC1–9 were confirmed to be specific for the targeted genes by bioinformatics analysis. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was converted into cDNA using the SuperScriptTM first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). PCR primer sequences used for cloning are available upon request. Real time PCR was carried out using the ABI 7900 real time PCR system. All of data were normalized to β-actin expression. Triglyceride lipase activity was assayed as described previously (21McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglyceride levels were measured using the triglyceride kit from Wako Chemicals Inc. (Richmond, VA). Recombinant adenoviruses encoding human ANGPTL4 (AdANGPTL4) and its mutant (AdR161A) were generated using the Viralpower Expression kit from Invitrogen. Both constructs expressed a C-terminal Myc-His in-frame with ANGPTL4. Female 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice obtained from Taconic Farms, Inc. (Germantown, NY) were used for the experiments. All procedures were conducted in conformity with the United States Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. Adenovirus was administered at the indicated dose via the tail vein on day 0 of the study. For blood sampling, mice were fasted for 4 h and bled from the saphenous vein at days 0, 3, and 6 after virus injection. Mice were sacrificed under anesthesia, and livers were removed and snap-frozen at day 6. Liver protein extracts were prepared as reported previously (19Jin W. Wang X. Millar J.S. Quertermous T. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Post-heparin samples were collected at 5-min intervals after heparin injection (i.v., 250 units/kg). Values for LPL activity are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Comparisons between the two groups were analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test. Comparisons among multiple mouse groups were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by unpaired Student's t tests if necessary to determine significant differences. Because human ANGPTL4 is expressed and cleaved in the liver, a human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, was used to study the expression and processing of human ANGPTL4 protein in cell culture. Endogenous ANGPTL4 mRNA expression in Huh7 cells could be detected by PCR, but ANGPTL4 protein could not be detected with a commercial antibody to ANGPTL4 (data not shown). Therefore, a plasmid encoding a C-terminal Myc-His-tagged version of human ANGPTL4 was constructed for detection and purification of ANGPTL4 protein (ANGPTL4-myc, Fig. 1A). The same tag has been used by other groups and was reported to not interfere with ANGPTL4 function (22Ge H. Yang G. Huang L. Motola D.L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2038-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ANGPTL4 protein was secreted in conditioned medium as three forms under reducing conditions. The 52-kDa band corresponded to the full-length protein (with a Myc-His tag); the 37-kDa band corresponded to the C-terminal fragment (with a Myc-His tag, Fig. 1B), and the 15-kDa band corresponded to the N-terminal fragment (Fig. 1C). Therefore, ANGPTL4 in the conditioned medium is also cleaved in Huh7 cells, similar to what is seen in HEK293 and HUVEC cells (15Yin W. Romeo S. Chang S. Grishin N.V. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13213-13222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Chomel C. Cazes A. Faye C. Bignon M. Gomez E. Ardidie-Robouant C. Barret A. Ricard-Blum S. Muller L. Germain S. Monnot C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme(s) responsible for cleaving ANGPTL4 are also present in hepatocytes. To trace the turnover of cell surface ANGPTL4 protein, cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin, and the appearance of ANGPTL4 in the culture medium was monitored in the presence or absence of heparin over 24 h (10 units/ml). The biotin-labeled ANGPTL4 proteins were captured using streptavidin beads and detected by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, the full-length ANGPTL4 appeared in the medium first, and then cleavage products increased during incubation. In the presence of heparin, more cell surface ANGPTL4 was rapidly released into culture media in the full-length form, indicating ANGPTL4 is tethered to the cell surface via HSPGs. Similar data were obtained using murine primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with previous data on endogenous ANGPTL4 secretion in HUVECs (16Chomel C. Cazes A. Faye C. Bignon M. Gomez E. Ardidie-Robouant C. Barret A. Ricard-Blum S. Muller L. Germain S. Monnot C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the full-length ANGPTL4 bound to the cell surface is likely the precursor of ANGPTL4 in the culture medium. To identify the precise cleavage site, we expressed ANGPTL4 protein in Huh7 cells by transient transfection, using a plasmid encoding ANGPTL4-myc. Proteins containing a His epitope from the cell culture medium were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to membranes. The C terminus of ANGPTL4-myc was confirmed by Western blotting. Edman degradation-based amino acid sequencing analysis of the major cleavage products revealed that the cleavage of ANGPTL4 occurs immediately after residue 164 (data not shown), consistent with data on ANGPTL4 cleavage from HEK293 cells (23Yang Y.H. Wang Y. Lam K.S. Yau M.H. Cheng K.K. Zhang J. Zhu W. Wu D. Xu A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The angptl4 gene and its translated protein are present in at least 40 different species from mammals to fish based on information available through Ensembl. The protein homology among these species ranges from 37 to 76%. However, the basic residues surrounding the cleavage site are only conserved in mammals. The residues of ANGPTL4 adjacent to the cleavage site for representative species are shown in the Fig. 3A, upper panel. In each case, the conserved PC consensus recognition sequence, RXKR, was present before the cleavage site. To test whether the basic amino acids in the conserved PC consensus motif are important for the ANGPTL4 cleavage, the arginines at positions 161 or 164 were mutated to alanines, and the mutant ANGPTL4 constructs were expressed in Huh7 cells. Both mutants R161A and R164A dramatically reduced the cleavage of ANGPTL4 (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Thus, both arginines at site 161 and 164 are critical for ANGPTL4 cleavage. Hereafter, we designate the R161A mutant as the cleavage-resistant mutant. Because the sequence RXXR is a typical PC consensus motif, PC inhibitors were used to study their effects on the proteolytic processing of ANGPTL4. The prosegments of furin and PC5/6 are potent autoinhibitors of PC activity by noncovalently attaching to PCs. Profurin and pro-PC5/6 inhibit both furin and PC5/6 (18Jin W. Fuki I.V. Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36551-36559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both are also highly potent inhibitors of several other PCs (with Ki in the low nanomolar range) (17Fugère M. Limperis P.C. Beaulieu-Audy V. Gagnon F. Lavigne P. Klarskov K. Leduc R. Day R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7648-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The ability of overexpressed profurin and pro-PC5/6 to inhibit the processing of ANGPTL4 was examined. As seen in Fig. 3B, comparing the ratio between cleaved C terminus to full-length ANGPTL4, overexpression of profurin or pro-PC5/6 resulted in a significant inhibition of ANGPTL4 cleavage. Also, profurin had a dose-dependent effect on ANGPTL4 processing (data not shown). Therefore, the members of the PC family are likely responsible for the cleavage of ANGPTL4. These data are consistent with an early observation using another specific PCs inhibitor, α-1 PDX (16Chomel C. Cazes A. Faye C. Bignon M. Gomez E. Ardidie-Robouant C. Barret A. Ricard-Blum S. Muller L. Germain S. Monnot C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine which member(s) of the PC family cleave ANGPTL4, ANGPTL4-myc was co-expressed with each of the PCs individually in the Huh7 cell line. The different forms of ANGPTL4 protein were detected using a polyclonal antibody against ANGPTL4. PACE4, PC5/6, furin, and PC7 were all found to significantly reduce the ratio of full-length to C-terminal ANGPTL4 (Fig. 4A), except PCSK9. Similar changes in the ratio of full-length to N-terminal fragments were also observed (data not shown). The presence of each PC was confirmed by measuring the EGFP signal in the cell lysates (Fig. 4A, lower panel). To test whether cleavage by furin, PC5/6, PACE4, or PC7 required the intact RXKR consensus sequence of ANGPTL4, the cleavage-resistant mutant of ANGPTL4 (R161A) was co-expressed with furin, PC5/6, PACE4, or PC7 in Huh7 cells. Cleavage of R161A was slightly increased after co-expression of PC5/6 and PACE4 but not furin and PC7 (Fig. 4B); therefore, the cleavage-resistant mutant is indeed resistant to cleavage by different PCs (Fig. 4, B versus A). To directly prove that PCs can cleave ANGPTL4, purified individual PCs and ANGPTL4 were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The processing of ANGPTL4 was determined by immunoblotting. In order of potency, PC5/6, PACE4, and PC7 but not soluble furin were able to cleave ANGPTL4 (Fig. 4C). The mRNA expression of endogenous PCs in Huh7 cells was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. PC-specific primers covering at least two exons were designed for all members of the PC family. Furin, PC5/6, PACE4, and PC7 were found to be expressed in the Huh7 cells but not PC1/3 and PC2 (data not shown). In order of abundance, as determined by real time PCR, PACE4 was most abundant, followed by PC7, furin, PC5/6, and PC1 (data not shown). Thus, more than one of the PCs that were able to cleave ANGPTL4 was in fact normally expressed in hepatocytes. To understand the functional effects of ANGPTL4 cleavage on LPL activity, two cell-based assays were used to mimic the endocrine effects of ANGPTL4. The N terminus of ANGPTL4 protein was generated by transfecting cells with a plasmid coding amino acids 1–160 of human ANGPTL4 protein, and the full-length ANGPTL4 was generated by transfecting cells with the ANGPTL4R161A mutant or by co-transfection of wild-type ANGPTL4 with profurin (which equally inhibits all the relevant convertases). The concentration of these proteins was determined by using a modified ELISA (data not shown). The LPL-myc stably expressing cells were incubated with similar amounts (based on molarity) of ANGPTL4 proteins in the conditioned media for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5A, the N terminus of ANGPTL4 was more effective in inhibiting LPL activity than the cleavage-resistant mutant R161A (p < 0.05). Also, blockage of ANGPTL4 cleavage by co-expression of profurin reduced its inhibitory effects on LPL activity (p < 0.05, Fig. 5B). Thus, cleavage of ANGPTL4 is likely to generate more potent inhibitor(s) of LPL. To mimic the effects of ANGPTL4 on LPL function in vivo, a co-culture assay was developed. Huh7 cells were cultured on the porous membrane of the top well, and the stably LPL-myc-expressing cells were maintained in the lower chamber. As shown in Fig. 6A, both wild-type and cleavage-resistant forms of ANGPTL4 inhibited LPL activity, but the cleavage-resistant form had significantly less inhibitory effect (p < 0.05), despite the fact that similar expressions of wild-type and mutant of ANGPTL4 proteins were detected in the media of Huh7 cells (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the cleavage-resistant ANGPTL4 and wild-type ANGPTL4 also enhanced, although to a similar degree, LPL cleavage as indicated by the accumulation of the C-terminal LPL in the culture media (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the extent of ANGPTL4 cleavage does not affect the ability of PCs to cleave LPL. Because both ANGPTL4 and LPL can be cleaved by PCs and ANGPLT4 enhances LPL cleavage, we examined whether ANGPTL4 can enhance its own processing. We incubated ANGPTL4-myc- or LPL-myc-expressing cells with the purified N terminus of ANGPTL4. As shown in Fig. 6C, the N terminus of ANGPTL4 enhanced the cleavage of LPL but not of ANGPTL4. To test the effects of ANGPTL4 cleavage on plasma TG metabolism, the adenoviral vector system was used to express ANGPTL4-myc protein or its cleavage-resistant R161A-myc mutant in mice. We normalized the titer of AdANGPTL4 (WT) and AdR161A vectors in vitro by examining the expression of ANGPTL4 protein after infecting cells using different doses of vectors (Fig. 7A). When wild-type ANGPTL4 was expressed at the dose range of 1010 to 20·1010 viral particles per mouse (Fig. 7B), very little ANGPTL4 protein was detected in the pre-heparin samples; however, abundant ANGPTL4 proteins were found in the post-heparin samples at day 3 after transduction. This is consistent with the observation that most of ANGPTL4 binds to the cell surface via HSPGs. Importantly, there was a linear increase of plasma TG levels with respect to plasma ANGPTL4 expression (Fig. 7C), and there was a linear decrease of plasma LPL activity (Fig. 7D). The N terminus of ANGPTL4 could only be detected at a high dose (>20·1010 viral particles per mouse) after extended exposure times (Fig. 7E). We tested whether cleavage of ANGPTL4 affected its ability to increase plasma TG levels. Pre-matched (both TG and total cholesterol) female wild-type mice were given either Adempty, WT, or R161A, at the dose of 10·1010 viral particles per mouse. As expected, overexpression of ANGPTL4 resulted in a significant increase of plasma TG levels, up to 15-fold change on day 3 post-injection compared with mice injected with the control virus. However, the cleavage-resistant mutant form, R161A, raised plasma TG levels significantly less than did the wild-type ANGPTL4 (Fig. 8A). Consistent with these data, the cleavage-resistant mutant form of ANGPTL4 inhibited less LPL activity than the wild type (Fig. 8B), despite the fact that both wild-type and mutant forms of ANGPTL4 proteins were expressed at similar levels in the mouse livers (Fig. 8C, upper panel), and similar concentrations of the full-length ANGPTL4 protein were detected in the post-heparin samples (Fig. 8D). Very little cleavage product of the cleavage-resistant R161A mutant (about 6% of the wild-type ANGPTL4) was detected in mouse plasma using the anti-Myc antibody (data not shown). Therefore, the less ANGPTL4 is cleaved, the less it can increase plasma TG levels. To understand why the R161A mutant is much less effective than wild-type ANGPTL4 in vivo, two sets o"

Mechanical stress is an often underappreciated contributor to lung epithelial injury. Following injury, differentiated epithelia can assume a myofibroblast phenotype in a process termed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to aberrant wound healing and fibrosis. We demonstrate that cyclic mechanical stretch induces EMT in alveolar type II epithelial cells, associated with increased expression of low molecular mass hyaluronan (sHA). We show that sHA is sufficient for induction of EMT in statically cultured alveolar type II epithelial cells and necessary for EMT during cell stretch. Furthermore, stretch-induced EMT requires the innate immune adaptor molecule MyD88. We examined the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is known to mediate EMT. The Wnt target gene Wnt-inducible signaling protein 1 (wisp-1) is significantly up-regulated in stretched cells in hyaluronan- and MyD88-dependent fashion, and blockade of WISP-1 prevents EMT in stretched cells. In conclusion, we show for the first time that innate immunity transduces mechanical stress responses through the matrix component hyaluronan, and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

In conclusion, we show for the first time that innate immunity transduces mechanical stress responses through the matrix component hyaluronan, and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Epithelial injury is now recognized as a primary event in the pathogenesis of lung disease (1Berthiaume Y. Lesur O. Dagenais A. Thorax. 1999; 54: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Alveolar cells consist of type I epithelia (AT1), 2The abbreviations used are: AT1alveolar type IAT2alveolar type IIEMTepithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionHAhyaluronanhasHA synthase genesHAshort fragment HAα-SMAα-smooth muscle actinVILIventilator-induced lung injuryWISP-1Wnt-inducible signaling protein 1. which serve gas exchange, and type II epithelia (AT2), which produce surfactant and are now recognized as the critical responders to lung injury. Although AT1 cells usually undergo cell death after critical injury, AT2 cells can present a variety of responses, including proinflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation to AT1 epithelia, or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The AT2 response to injury may ultimately lead to restoration of pulmonary architecture and function, or to dysregulated repair, fibrosis, and respiratory failure (2Corvol H. Flamein F. Epaud R. Clement A. Guillot L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The factors that promote regulated or pathological repair are incompletely understood. However, it is often forgotten that alveolar epithelia are not static cells. Alveolar epithelia undergo continuous cyclic stretch during ventilation; moreover, pathologically high levels of stretch are exerted on alveolar epithelia either as a consequence of injury (anatomical distortion from scarring) or iatrogenically (mechanical ventilation). The response of alveolar epithelia to injury must therefore be seen in the context of mechanical strain. The importance of stretch injury as a cause of lung disease is exemplified in the acute lung injury of critically ill patients, which is estimated at 200,000 cases in the United States annually (3Wurfel M.M. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2007; 4: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Epithelial injury is central to the pathogenesis of VILI. Experimental VILI increases epithelial expression of inflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-6 (4Tremblay L.N. Miatto D. Hamid Q. Govindarajan A. Slutsky A.S. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, excessive epithelial cell stretch is a major cause of VILI (5Lionetti V. Recchia F.A. Ranieri V.M. Curr. Opin. Crit. Care. 2005; 11: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Lung ventilation volume increases lead to progressive epithelial cell deformation (6Tschumperlin D.J. Margulies S.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 86: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), with disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier and injury to both AT1 and AT2 epithelia. AT2 cells are of particular importance in VILI. AT2 cells constitute the majority of alveolar epithelial cells (7Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Gehr P. Bachofen M. Weibel E.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1982; 125: 740-745PubMed Google Scholar) and are capable of self-renewal, but can also undergo EMT when injured. EMT is indicated by a decrease in epithelial cell markers, such as E-cadherin, and an increase in mesenchymal cell markers such as vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). EMT is found in healthy tissue during embryogenesis and is observed in wound healing, but it has also been recognized as a source for myofibroblasts in fibrosis and occurs in fibrotic lung in bleomycin-treated mice (8Königshoff M. Kramer M. Balsara N. Wilhelm J. Amarie O.V. Jahn A. Rose F. Fink L. Seeger W. Schaefer L. Günther A. Eickelberg O. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 772-787PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, alveolar EMT was shown in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (9Kim K.K. Kugler M.C. Wolters P.J. Robillard L. Galvez M.G. Brumwell A.N. Sheppard D. Chapman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). EMT is therefore an important part of the aberrant wound healing response and can lead to lung fibrosis and respiratory failure. Components of the extracellular matrix can act as signaling molecules that contribute to EMT (10Taliana L. Evans M.D. Ang S. McAvoy J.W. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 1233-1242PubMed Google Scholar, 11Câmara J. Jarai G. Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair. 2010; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is of particular interest in VILI because HA production is increased in VILI, leading to an inflammatory response (12Bai K.J. Spicer A.P. Mascarenhas M.M. Yu L. Ochoa C.D. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HA also plays a central role in EMT in embryonic development, certain types of cancer cells (13Toole B.P. Zoltan-Jones A. Misra S. Ghatak S. Cells Tissues Organs. 2005; 179: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as in mammary and kidney epithelial cells (14Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45801-45810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that HA may be an important molecule in the mechanical signaling of alveolar cells during ventilation. We therefore hypothesized that mechanical stretch induces EMT via hyaluronan production in alveolar epithelium. We examined our hypothesis using an in vitro stretch injury model of AT2 cells.

Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). AT2 cells were plated on Flexcell Amino silicone-bottomed plates coated with 0.6 mg/ml collagen I solution (Sigma-Aldrich). AT2 were cultured overnight in bronchial epithelial growth medium (Lonza) with all supplements except hydrocortisone and the addition of 1% anti-biotic anti-mycotic (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), and keratinocyte growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich). The isolated AT2 population was 92.9 ± 3.2% pure as determined by Pap staining performed as previously published (17Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1A). Static culture of AT2 retained prosurfactant protein C staining throughout the 4-day culture period (supplemental Fig. 1B). AT2 cells were stretched in a Flexcell Tension Plus system (Flexcell International Corporation, Hillsborough, NC) at 15% stretch, 0.86 Hz for 4 consecutive days in bronchial epithelial growth medium supplemented with 0.1% FBS. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to static cells as a positive control. Wnt-inducible signaling protein 1 (WISP-1) monoclonal anti-mouse antibody (R&D Systems) and isotype rat IgG controls (R&D Systems) were added to stretched culture in some experiments at 20 μg/ml. This WISP-1 antibody has been shown previously to block WISP-1 (8Königshoff M. Kramer M. Balsara N. Wilhelm J. Amarie O.V. Jahn A. Rose F. Fink L. Seeger W. Schaefer L. Günther A. Eickelberg O. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 772-787PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, TGF-β1 blocking antibody (MAB240, R&D Systems) or mouse isotype IgG control was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Cells were cultured for 4 days statically as controls. In HA-treated statically cultured experiments, Healon (AMO, Santa Ana, CA) was sonicated as described previously (18Garantziotis S. Li Z. Potts E.N. Kimata K. Zhuo L. Morgan D.L. Savani R.C.

Size of sonicated Healon is found in supplemental Fig. 2. Amine group-modified tissue culture plates (BD Primeria, Becton Dickinson) were coated with collagen type I (Sigma-Aldrich) or the sonicated sHA at 0.2 mg/ml overnight at 4 °C prior to cell plating. Additionally, short fragment hyaluronan (sHA) was added to culture medium at the same concentration. AT2 cells were cultured for 4 days with a one-time dose of sHA. In these statically cultured experiments, “collagen” refers to the control cells grown statically on collagen, “collagen + TGF-β1” refers to cells grown on collagen with a one-time TGF-β1 treatment, and “HA” refers to cells grown on sHA-coated plates with a one-time dose of additional sHA. In some experiments, HA-binding peptide (pep-1), scrambled peptide, and dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control were added to the stretched and static AT2 culture according to methods published previously (19Mummert M.E. Mohamadzadeh M. Mummert D.I. Mizumoto N. Takashima A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Pep-1 and scrambled peptide were custom designed (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). In other experiments, TGF-β1 blocking antibody (MAB240) or mouse isotype IgG control was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Supernatant was collected from stretched and static AT2 and was used for HA size measurements according to the method published by Aytekin et al. (20Aytekin M. Comhair S.A. de la Motte C. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Farver C.F. Hascall V.C. Erzurum S.C. Dweik R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2008; 295: L789-L799Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For HA concentration measurement, a commercially available ELISA as used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified RNA was treated with DNase and real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. Relative gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method using the housekeeping gene 18s. Primary antibodies used for Western blotting were rabbit anti mouse α-SMA (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-mouse E-cadherin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and goat anti-mouse vimentin (Chemicon, Billerica, MA). Loading control was rabbit S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling). Immunoprecipitation for CD44 was performed as shown previously (21Taylor K.R. Yamasaki K. Radek K.A. Di Nardo A. Goodarzi H. Golenbock D. Beutler B. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18265-18275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were anti-goat HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-rabbit HRP (Pierce). HRP was detected using ECL west detection kit (Pierce). Blots were exposed to autoradiography film and processed using a Kodak film developer. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for HA staining and in 4% paraformaldehyde for F-actin staining. HA staining was done with biotinylated HA-binding protein (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). F-actin staining was done with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Images were taken using a confocal scanning microscope at 400× magnification. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism GraphPad software. One-way ANOVAs were performed with the Tukey test for post hoc pairwise comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We first examined whether mechanical stretch induces EMT. We evaluated gene expression of surfactant protein C as an AT2 cell marker and established that it was significantly decreased with TGF-β1, but remained statistically unchanged with stretch (Fig. 1A). However, in vitro mechanical stretch of AT2 cells caused significant reduction in gene expression of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, stretch increased gene expression in mesenchymal genes vimentin and α-SMA (Fig. 1, C and D). As a positive control, TGF-β1 significantly decreased E-cadherin expression and increased a-SMA expression (Fig. 1, B and D). Our stretch-induced gene expression results were confirmed on a protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 1, E and F). F-actin staining showed actin in the cell membrane of statically cultured AT2 (Fig. 1G) whereas actin was polymerized throughout the stretched cells (Fig. 1H). Additionally, cell morphology was altered in the experimental groups compared with static controls. Statically cultured AT2 retained a cobblestone appearance as seen in both F-actin staining (Fig. 1G) and prosurfactant protein C staining (supplemental Fig. 1B), whereas stretch alone caused increased cell spreading and slight spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 1H and supplemental Fig. 1B). Thus, these results suggest that cell stretch induced EMT in cultured primary AT2 cells. Because mechanical ventilation increases HA synthase 3 expression in a mouse model (12Bai K.J. Spicer A.P. Mascarenhas M.M. Yu L. Ochoa C.D. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we examined expression of HA synthase (has) genes 1, 2, and 3 in our in vitro cell stretch injury model. Mechanical stretch significantly increased has3 expression and significantly reduced has1 and has2 expression compared with static control (Fig. 2A). We also determined the size of HA in the supernatant of static and stretched cells with agarose gel electrophoresis. The supernatant of both groups contained HA as indicated by negative staining in hyaluronidase-treated samples (Fig. 2B). Static cultured supernatant contained HA of varying sizes including a larger amount of high molecular mass HA than supernatant from stretched cells. The stretched cell supernatant contained mostly low molecular mass HA (Fig. 2B). Hyaluronan staining of the cells showed that stretch increased HA compared with static control (Fig. 2C). Quantification of HA in supernatant revealed significantly more HA in the stretched cells compared with static (Fig. 2D). Because we found a significant increase of sHA in our stretched cells, we pursued the question of whether sHA is important in stretch-induced EMT. We added sHA to a static culture of AT2 cells and examined the same epithelial and mesenchymal markers as in our stretch experiments. We found that sHA induced EMT as indicated both by mRNA and protein expression of relevant markers (Fig. 3). We then used the HA antagonist pep-1 during AT2 stretch and examined EMT. Pep-1 diminished the stretch-induced changes in EMT markers shown in RT-PCR (Fig. 4, A–C) and by Western blotting (Fig. 4D). To confirm further that stretch causes EMT via HA, we stretched primary AT2 cells from mice deficient for the HA receptor CD44. We found that CD44-deficient stretched AT2 cells did not undergo EMT. CD44-deficient stretched AT2 cells did not lose E-cadherin expression in protein (Fig. 4E) or mRNA expression (Fig. 4F) and did not gain mesenchymal markers α-SMA and vimentin in either mRNA expression (Fig. 4, E and F) or protein (Fig. 4G).FIGURE 4HA blockade inhibits stretch-induced EMT. A–C, mRNA expression of EMT markers with HA binding peptide (pep-1) treatment. A, E-cadherin significantly decreased with stretch in vehicle and scrambled groups. B, mRNA expression of vimentin significantly increased with stretch in the scrambled group and unchanged in the vehicle or pep-1 groups. C, mRNA expression of α-SMA significantly increased with stretch in the vehicle and scrambled groups. There is no significant change in the pep-1-treated cells. D, immunoblot of cell lysates from pep-1 experiments. E-cadherin protein is unchanged with stretch when treated with pep-1. pep-1-treated cells have decreased vimentin and α-SMA for both static and stretch compared with other treatments. E, mRNA expression of E-cadherin significantly decreased with stretch in wild-type cells. F, mRNA expression of vimentin significantly increased with stretch in the wild-type cells but not in the CD44−/− cells. G, mRNA expression of α-SMA significantly increased with stretch in the wild-type cells but not in the CD4−/− cells. G and H, immunoblot of cell lysates from CD44−/− experiments showing that E-cadherin is completely diminished with stretch in the wild-type cells but not in CD44−/− cells.

Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of TGF-β1 in our stretch-induced EMT. We performed an ELISA on cell culture supernatants (supplemental Methods). We found no increase in active or latent TGF-β1 in stretched samples compared with static over 4 days of culture (supplemental Fig. 4A). Additionally, we performed experiments adding TGF-β1 to statically cultured cells deficient in CD44 or MyD88. These TGF-β1-treated cells underwent EMT as indicated by gene expression (supplemental Fig. 4,B–G). Finally, we performed blocking experiments of TGF-β1 in either stretched or sHA-treated primary murine AT2 cells. The results suggested that TGF-β1 blockade does not alter expression of EMT markers in these models. Because HA is a known endogenous activator of the innate immune receptors, TLR-2 and TLR-4, we examined aspects of innate immune activation with stretch. CD44 co-immunoprecipitated with TLR-4 in stretched AT2 and TGF-β1-treated AT2 cells (Fig. 5A). TLR-2 and TLR-4 mediate, in part, their innate immune action through the adaptor molecule MyD88, and MyD88 mediates HA effects on cell fate after bleomycin treatment (23Jiang D. Liang J. Fan J. Yu S. Chen S. Luo Y. Prestwich G.D. Mascarenhas M.M. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Homer R.J. Goldstein D.R. Bucala R. Lee P.J. Medzhitov R. Noble P.W. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). We therefore used primary AT2 cells from mice deficient in the adaptor molecule MyD88. In these cells, stretch did not significantly decrease gene or protein expression of E-cadherin (Fig. 5, B and E). Additionally, MyD-88 AT2 cells did not exhibit markers of the mesenchymal phenotype vimentin and α-SMA in either mRNA (Fig. 5, C and D) or protein (Fig. 5E). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is known to cause EMT. We examined mRNA expression of genes downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway including ccnd1, wnt10a, tcf6, srfp1, and wisp-1. We chose to focus on wisp-1 because it is a target gene of Wnt/β-catenin activation and can cause EMT in pulmonary epithelial cells (8Königshoff M. Kramer M. Balsara N. Wilhelm J. Amarie O.V. Jahn A. Rose F. Fink L. Seeger W. Schaefer L. Günther A. Eickelberg O. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 772-787PubMed Google Scholar). Gene expression of wisp-1 was significantly up-regulated in statically cultured AT2 with sHA (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, expression of wisp-1 and other Wnt-related genes was significantly increased in stretched “wild-type” AT2 cells, but not in myd88- or cd44-deficient AT2 cells compared with static cultures (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 3). We then added a blocking antibody to WISP-1 to our stretched cultures and examined markers of EMT. We found that blockade of WISP-1 prevented the occurrence of EMT in stretched AT2 cells. WISP-1-treated cells were no different from statically cultured cells in the expression of relevant EMT markers, whereas control IgG-treated cells showed EMT, as expected (Fig. 6, C–E). These results suggest that elements of the Wnt pathway, in particular WISP-1, are involved in stretch-induced, HA/MyD88-mediated EMT. Epithelial injury is a central event in lung disease, such as acute lung injury (1Berthiaume Y. Lesur O. Dagenais A. Thorax. 1999; 54: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mechanical ventilation is commonly used as support treatment in lung injury, but it compounds the damage by itself causing more lung injury. Alveolar overdistension is a critical mechanism of VILI; even during low tidal volume ventilation, overdistension of the compliant healthy alveoli leads to their damage (24Treggiari M.M. Martin D.P. Yanez N.D. Caldwell E. Hudson L.D. Rubenfeld G.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 176: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that abnormal stretch of AT2 cells directly leads to abnormal wound healing via intrinsic innate immune activation and induction of EMT. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking mechanical stress, innate immune activation, and EMT in primary mammalian epithelia. We describe three steps that determine stretch-induced alveolar EMT: (i) overdistension induces sHA production; (ii) extracellular sHA induces EMT; and (iii) at a minimum, stretch/sHA-induced EMT requires the innate immune adaptor molecule MyD88 and the Wnt/β-catenin target gene WISP-1. HA is emerging as an important regulator of lung cell fate in development and injury. has2-mediated production of higher molecular mass HA is necessary for normal cardiac development in utero (25Camenisch T.D.

Mechanical stretch causes sHA production in pulmonary fibroblasts, leading to inflammation (12Bai K.J. Spicer A.P. Mascarenhas M.M. Yu L. Ochoa C.D. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Mascarenhas M.M. Day R.M. Ochoa C.D. Choi W.I. Yu L. Ouyang B. Garg H.G. Hales C.A. Quinn D.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Our work demonstrates that mechanical stretch of AT2 epithelia is sufficient for sHA production, even in the absence of fibroblasts. This effect occurs very early on in stretch injury: at 4 h after initiation of cell stretch, has3 was up-regulated in our model (data not shown). Ultimately, we cannot make a conclusive statement as to the relative contribution of epithelial or mesenchymal sHA origin in VILI. Fibroblasts only constitute <0.2% of alveolar cells (7Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Gehr P. Bachofen M. Weibel E.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1982; 125: 740-745PubMed Google Scholar) but are professional matrix-producers. However, our results are important for two reasons: first, they suggest that sHA in lung injury, regardless of origin, induces EMT in AT2 cells, thus leading to aberrant wound healing; second, our results indicate that treatments targeting solely fibroblasts may not be sufficient to abrogate VILI. AT2 cells are central elements in alveolar regeneration; they replenish the AT1 pool after injury (30Lwebuga-Mukasa J.S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but can also contribute to aberrant wound healing. For example, targeted injury of AT2 cells induces pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model (31Sisson T.H. Mendez M. Choi K. Subbotina N. Courey A. Cunningham A. Dave A. Engelhardt J.F. Liu X. White E.S.

We demonstrate that sHA induces AT2 EMT in an autofeedback loop, highlighting the central role of these cells in VILI and other models of lung injury. The role of innate immunity in sterile pulmonary injury is now well established (23Jiang D. Liang J. Fan J. Yu S. Chen S. Luo Y. Prestwich G.D. Mascarenhas M.M. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Homer R.J.

We (HCE and DPH) are currently undertaking a worldwide survey to assess the taxonomy and ecology of this highly variable species.We formally describe and name four new species belonging to the O. unilateralis species complex collected from remnant Atlantic rainforest in the south-eastern region (Zona da Mata) of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.

https://openalex.org/W2094183370,"CYP3A4 expression in breast cancer correlates with decreased overall survival, but the mechanisms are unknown. Cytochrome P450 gene profiling by RNAi silencing demonstrates that CYP3A or 2C8 gene expression is specifically required for growth of the breast cancer lines MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231. CYP3A4 silencing blocks the cell cycle at the G(2)/M checkpoint and induces apoptosis in the MCF7 line, thereby inhibiting anchorage-dependent growth and survival. CYP3A4 was profiled for NADPH-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and synthesized AA epoxygenase products (±)-8,9-, (±)-11,12-, and (±)-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) (total turnover of ∼2 pmol/pmol CYP3A4/min) but not hydroxylase products (±)-15-, (±)-19-, or 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Furthermore, eicosanoid profiling revealed that MCF7 cells synthesize EETs in a CYP3A4-dependent manner. The (±)-14,15-EET regioisomer selectively rescues breast cancer cells from CYP3A4 silencing in a concentration-dependent fashion and promotes mitogenesis and anchorage-dependent cloning. Stat3 (Tyr-705) phosphorylation was inhibited by CYP3A4 silencing, providing a potential mechanism for CYP3A4 involvement in breast cancer cell growth. Silencing Stat3 blocks breast cancer cell growth and abrogates (±)-14,15-EET-induced proliferation, indicating a Stat3 requirement for (±)-14,15-EET-mediated cell growth. Although silencing of CYP3A4 reduces nuclear Tyr(P)-705-Stat3, (±)-14,15-EET restores this signaling process and promotes Tyr(P)-705-Stat3 translocation to the nucleus, suggesting that (±)-14,15-EET may be involved in an autocrine/paracrine pathway driving cell growth. These studies indicate that CYP3A4 is a highly active AA epoxygenase that promotes Stat3-mediated breast cancer cell growth in part through (±)-14,15-EET biosynthesis. Furthermore, these studies indicate an essential role for Stat3 as a mediator of epoxygenase activity in breast cancer."

Although HIV-1 sequencing is frequently used to substantiate linkage between newly HIV-1 infected individuals and their sexual partners in epidemiologic and forensic studies, viral sequencing is seldom applied in HIV-1 prevention trials. The Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00194519) was a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial that enrolled serodiscordant heterosexual couples to determine the efficacy of genital herpes suppression in reducing HIV-1 transmission; as part of the study analysis, HIV-1 sequences were examined for genetic linkage between seroconverters and their enrolled partners.We obtained partial consensus HIV-1 env and gag sequences from blood plasma for 151 transmission pairs and performed deep sequencing of env in some cases. We analyzed sequences with phylogenetic techniques and developed a Bayesian algorithm to evaluate the probability of linkage. For linkage, we required monophyletic clustering between enrolled partners' sequences and a Bayesian posterior probability of ≥ 50%. Adjudicators classified each seroconversion, finding 108 (71.5%) linked, 40 (26.5%) unlinked, and 3 (2.0%) indeterminate transmissions, with linkage determined by consensus env sequencing in 91 (84%). Male seroconverters had a higher frequency of unlinked transmissions than female seroconverters. The likelihood of transmission from the enrolled partner was related to time on study, with increasing numbers of unlinked transmissions occurring after longer observation periods. Finally, baseline viral load was found to be significantly higher among linked transmitters.In this first use of HIV-1 sequencing to establish endpoints in a large clinical trial, more than one-fourth of transmissions were unlinked to the enrolled partner, illustrating the relevance of these methods in the design of future HIV-1 prevention trials in serodiscordant couples. A hierarchy of sequencing techniques, analysis methods, and expert adjudication contributed to the linkage determination process."
https://openalex.org/W1974351849,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Here, we report elevated expression of tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) in primary human lung tumors and in non-small cell lung cancer cells that express low levels of differentiation-inducing transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα). In approximately 10–20% of cases, elevated TRIB2 expression resulted from gene amplification. TRIB2 knockdown was found to inhibit cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth. In addition, TRIB2 knockdown led to morphological changes similar to C/EBPα overexpression and correlated with increased expression and activity of C/EBPα. TRIB2-mediated regulation of C/EBPα was found to occur through the association of TRIB2 with the E3 ligase TRIM21. Together, these data identify TRIB2 as a potential driver of lung tumorigenesis through a mechanism that involves downregulation of C/EBPα."
https://openalex.org/W2081447201,"Most existing methods for phylogenetic analysis involve developing an evolutionary model and then using some type of computational algorithm to perform multiple sequence alignment. There are two problems with this approach: (1) different evolutionary models can lead to different results, and (2) the computation time required for multiple alignments makes it impossible to analyse the phylogeny of a whole genome. This motivates us to create a new approach to characterize genetic sequences.To each DNA sequence, we associate a natural vector based on the distributions of nucleotides. This produces a one-to-one correspondence between the DNA sequence and its natural vector. We define the distance between two DNA sequences to be the distance between their associated natural vectors. This creates a genome space with a biological distance which makes global comparison of genomes with same topology possible. We use our proposed method to analyze the genomes of the new influenza A (H1N1) virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV) and mammalian mitochondrial. The result shows that a triple-reassortant swine virus circulating in North America and the Eurasian swine virus belong to the lineage of the influenza A (H1N1) virus. For the HRV and mammalian mitochondrial genomes, the results coincide with biologists' analyses.Our approach provides a powerful new tool for analyzing and annotating genomes and their phylogenetic relationships. Whole or partial genomes can be handled more easily and more quickly than using multiple alignment methods. Once a genome space has been constructed, it can be stored in a database. There is no need to reconstruct the genome space for subsequent applications, whereas in multiple alignment methods, realignment is needed to add new sequences. Furthermore, one can make a global comparison of all genomes simultaneously, which no other existing method can achieve."
https://openalex.org/W2014556797,"Although membrane proteins are ubiquitous within all living organisms and represent the majority of drug targets, a general method for direct, label-free measurement of ligand binding to native membranes has not been reported. Here we show that backscattering interferometry (BSI) can accurately quantify ligand-receptor binding affinities in a variety of membrane environments. By detecting minute changes in the refractive index of a solution, BSI allows binding interactions of proteins with their ligands to be measured at picomolar concentrations. Equilibrium binding constants in the micromolar to picomolar range were obtained for small- and large-molecule interactions in both synthetic and cell-derived membranes without the use of labels or supporting substrates. The simple and low-cost hardware, high sensitivity and label-free nature of BSI should make it readily applicable to the study of many membrane-associated proteins of biochemical and pharmacological interest."

Such a measure would allow comparison with other diseases and assessment of the cost-effectiveness of pandemic control measures.Cases of H1N1v confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR negative cases with similar influenza-like illness (ILI controls) in 7 regions of England were sent two questionnaires, one within a week of symptom onset and one two weeks later, requesting information on duration of illness, work loss and antiviral use together with EQ-5D questionnaires. Results were compared with those for seasonal influenza from a systematic literature review. A total QALY loss for the 2009 pandemic in England was calculated based on the estimated total clinical cases and reported deaths. A total of 655 questionnaires were sent and 296 (45%) returned. Symptoms and average illness duration were similar between confirmed cases and ILI controls (8.8 days and 8.7 days respectively). Days off work were greater for cases than ILI controls (7.3 and 4.9 days respectively, p = 0.003). The quality-adjusted life days lost was 2.92 for confirmed cases and 2.74 for ILI controls, with a reduction in QALY loss after prompt use of antivirals in confirmed cases. The overall QALY loss in the pandemic was estimated at 28,126 QALYs (22,267 discounted) of which 40% was due to deaths (24% with discounting).Given the global public health significance of influenza, it is remarkable that no previous prospective study of the QALY loss of influenza using standardised and well validated methods has been performed. Although the QALY loss was minor for individual patients, the estimated total burden of influenza over the pandemic was substantial when compared to other infectious diseases."

The disease is caused by Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites, which accumulate in the placenta by adhering to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). The interaction between infected erythrocytes and the placental receptor is mediated by a parasite expressed protein named VAR2CSA. A vaccine protecting pregnant women against placental malaria should induce antibodies inhibiting the interaction between VAR2CSA and CSA. Much effort has been put into defining the part of the 350 kDa VAR2CSA protein that is responsible for binding. It has been shown that full-length recombinant VAR2CSA binds specifically to CSA with high affinity, however to date no sub-fragment of VAR2CSA has been shown to interact with CSA with similar affinity or specificity. In this study, we used a biosensor technology to examine the binding properties of a panel of truncated VAR2CSA proteins. The experiments indicate that the core of the CSA-binding site is situated in three domains, DBL2X-CIDRPAM and a flanking domain, located in the N-terminal part of VAR2CSA. Furthermore, recombinant VAR2CSA subfragments containing this region elicit antibodies with high parasite adhesion blocking activity in animal immunization experiments.

IntroductionCarbohydrates, or glycans, are highly diverse in structure and biological function and are expressed by virtually all mammalian cells. Many microorganisms, i.e. viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, have evolved mechanisms to establish infection by interacting with glycans on the host cell surface (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. 2nd Ed. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar), and the Plasmodium parasites causing malaria are no exception. Of the different Plasmodium species that can infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is by far the most virulent form and was the cause of 89% of all deaths due to malaria infection in the African region in 2008 (the World Malaria Report 2009, WHO).A number of important potential P. falciparum vaccine targets have been defined as glycan-binding proteins or lectins, e.g. circumsporozoite protein, which interacts with highly sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) 3The abbreviations used are: HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; CSA, chondroitin sulfate A; PfEMP1, P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1; CIDR, cysteine-rich interdomain region; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; DBL, Duffy binding-like domain; FCM, flow cytometry; FV2, full-length ectodomain of the VAR2CSA protein without N-terminal segment; GLURP, glutamate-rich protein; ID, interdomain; IE, P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte; MSP-2, merozoite surface protein 2; NTS, N-terminal segment; PAM, pregnancy-associated malaria; PM, placental malaria. during sporozoite invasion of the liver, and the EBA-175 surface antigen that mediates merozoite invasion of erythrocytes through the interaction with sialic acid on glycophorin A (2Brown A.

In addition to these proteins, VAR2CSA, a unique member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family has been characterized as a lectin with binding preference for a low-sulfated form of chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) anchored to proteoglycans (CSPG) in placental tissue (3Salanti A.

VAR2CSA, is a large multidomain antigen expressed on the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) where it mediates sequestration of the IEs to the placenta (8Salanti A. Dahlbäck M. Turner L. Nielsen M.A. Barfod L. Magistrado P. Jensen A.T. Lavstsen T. Ofori M.F. Marsh K. Hviid L. Theander T.G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This placental sequestration causes placental malaria (PM), a major cause of mother and offspring morbidity such as severe maternal anemia, low birth weight, and stillbirth (9Brabin B.J. Romagosa C. Abdelgalil S. Menéndez C. Verhoeff F.H. McGready R. Fletcher K.A. Owens S. d'Alessandro U. Nosten F. Fischer P.R. Ordi J. Placenta. 2004; 25: 359-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Pregnant women and their unborn children are the victims of this severe disease, and it should be feasible to protect them by a vaccine. This is based on the fact that immunity to PM in malaria-endemic regions is acquired as a function of parity (10Fried M. Nosten F. Brockman A. Brabin B.J. Duffy P.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 851-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 11Ricke C.H. Staalsoe T. Koram K. Akanmori B.D. Riley E.M. Theander T.G. Hviid L. J.

Dis. 2001; 184: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the main antigen-mediating sequestration, VAR2CSA, has been found in all P. falciparum genomes studied. When looking at PfEMP1 sequence variation VAR2CSA appears as an unusually conserved PfEMP1 protein with as high as 75–83% amino acid identity between variants (13Bockhorst J. Lu F. Janes J.H. Keebler J. Gamain B. Awadalla P. Su X.Z. Samudrala R. Jojic N. Smith J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 155: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The large molecular weight of VAR2CSA makes production of full-length recombinant protein for vaccine use difficult. The ideal scenario for vaccine development is to define a region of the VAR2CSA, which induces antibodies that can abrogate placental adhesion of the full repertoire of genetically different P. falciparum parasites. The consequences of vaccinating to induce VAR2CSA-specific antibodies that are opsonising but not able to block parasite sequestration are not known but could potentially worsen the parasite-induced inflammation in the placenta.Considering the size and the complex structure it is essential to define smaller regions of VAR2CSA that can be included in a vaccine, the obvious approach being to define the glycan-binding site. However, this has not been straightforward and the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between VAR2CSA and CSA remains unresolved. This is in part due to the difficulties in analyzing protein-glycan binding in vitro, which easily gives rise to false positive identification of nonspecific glycan-binding proteins because of the large impact of low affinity charge-charge interactions (14Dahlbäck M. Nielsen M.A. Salanti A. Trends Parasitol. 2010; 5: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar).To date, vaccine development has relied on the production of a large panel of various recombinant VAR2CSA-derived protein fragments and analysis of their capacity to induce antibodies in animals that can block adhesion of IEs to CSA in vitro. This trial and error approach has generated several potential vaccine antigens (15Nielsen M.A. Pinto V.V. Resende M. Dahlbäck M. Ditlev S.B. Theander T.G. Salanti A. Infect.

Nevertheless, understanding the mode of CSA binding of VAR2CSA is likely to be essential for the optimal design of a vaccine against PM.An important breakthrough in this respect was recently made when the full-length ectodomain of VAR2CSA was successfully expressed as a recombinant protein and for the first time high affinity binding, within the nanomolar range, was attained when binding this complete ectodomain of VAR2CSA to CSA (6Khunrae P. Dahlbäck M. Nielsen M.A. Andersen G. Ditlev S.B. Resende M. Pinto V.V. Theander T.G. Higgins M.K. Salanti A. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Srivastava A.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) proposed that the entire ectodomain is required for a specific high affinity CSA interaction. This would explain the reported observations that no single recombinant VAR2CSA domain binds with high affinity to CSA (18Resende M. Ditlev S.B. Nielsen M.A. Bodevin S. Bruun S. Pinto V.V. Clausen H. Turner L. Theander T.G. Salanti A. Dahlbäck M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Khunrae P. Philip J.M. Bull D.R. Higgins M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In this study we have systematically analyzed recombinant fragments of VAR2CSA for affinity to CSA and defined two overlapping protein constructs that possess the same binding properties as the full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain. Specific binding activity locates to the four N-terminal domains, DBL1X-ID1, DBL2X, CIDRPAM, and DBL3X. A major part of the interaction seems to be conferred by proteins encompassing the DBL2X-CIDRPAM region, however an additional domain is required to obtain high affinity binding. Importantly animal-induced antibodies against a recombinant protein encoding the entire binding region effectively block adhesion of IEs to CSA.DISCUSSIONSpecific accumulation of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the developing placenta causes the severe malaria syndrome named placental malaria. The main placental receptor for parasite binding are the CSA chains of CSPG (22Fried M. Duffy P.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar).The unique sulfation pattern of the placental CSA (4Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J.

The VAR2CSA protein is the major parasite-encoded antigen associated with placental parasite adhesion and is the leading PM vaccine candidate. Several different regions of VAR2CSA have been proposed as responsible for the binding to CSA (23Gamain B. Trimnell A.R. Scheidig C. Scherf A. Miller L.H. Smith J.D. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Avril M. Gamain B. Lépolard C. Viaud N. Scherf A. Gysin J. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2863-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and it was recently suggested that the entire ectodomain is required for a high affinity interaction (7Srivastava A. Gangnard S. Round A. Dechavanne S. Juillerat A. Raynal B. Faure G. Baron B. Ramboarina S. Singh S.K. Belrhali H. England P. Lewit-Bentley A. Scherf A. Bentley G.A. Gamain B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to define the exact minimum CSA-binding region of the VAR2CSA protein.Proteins of the PfEMP1 family consist of several highly cysteine-rich domains, which form a complex structure held together by a number of intramolecular disulfide bridges. Because of the many disulfide bonds, the production of these molecules as correctly folded protein has been, and remains, a challenge. VAR2CSA is the only PfEMP1 molecule in which the entire extracellular region has been successfully produced as a recombinant protein, and this has only been done in an insect cell expression system (6Khunrae P. Dahlbäck M. Nielsen M.A. Andersen G. Ditlev S.B. Resende M. Pinto V.V. Theander T.G. Higgins M.K. Salanti A. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and in HEK293 cells (7Srivastava A. Gangnard S. Round A. Dechavanne S. Juillerat A. Raynal B. Faure G. Baron B. Ramboarina S. Singh S.K. Belrhali H. England P. Lewit-Bentley A. Scherf A. Bentley G.A. Gamain B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, all VAR2CSA proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and successful formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges was confirmed by reduced and non-reduced SDS-PAGE.Our protein-glycan binding results provide compelling evidence that the receptor binding site of VAR2CSA from the FCR3 parasite lies within the N-terminal region, i.e. DBL1X-ID1-DBL2X-CIDRPAM-DBL3X, within which the binding core consists of DBL2X-CIDRPAM (summarized in Table 2). The DBL2X-CIDRPAM protein does not possess all the elements required for a specific CSA interaction of high affinity, but when this core assembles with either the DBL1X domain in the N-terminal end or the DBL3X domain in the C-terminal end, the CSA binding strength is increased to the level of the full-length protein and the specificity seems to be retained. It is possible that these flanking domains have a stabilizing effect on the binding core without directly participating in the CSA binding. Alternatively, DBL1X and DBL3X exhibit residues that are directly involved in the CSA binding, which is enhanced by the presence of these domains. We have previously shown that the DBL2X single domain does bind to some extend to CSA in a solid phase binding assay but with low specificity (18Resende M. Ditlev S.B. Nielsen M.A. Bodevin S. Bruun S. Pinto V.V. Clausen H. Turner L. Theander T.G. Salanti A. Dahlbäck M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is supported by the present data showing that the affinity of the DBL2X protein to CSA is low.The CSA binding properties of the DBL3X domain has been extensively studied (19Khunrae P. Philip J.M. Bull D.R. Higgins M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Higgins M.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but these results have not conformed to the expected specificity and affinity of the interaction between VAR2CSA and CSA. Although the DBL3X domain alone binds with weak affinity and not specifically to CSA, this domain has been considered to be part of the true CSA-binding site. Thus, it was an unexpected discovery that DBL3X is not necessary for achieving specific high affinity binding in vitro.Many of the tested proteins also showed some affinity to HSPG. However when looking at the raw data in the sensorgrams it is apparent that the peak response is much lower than the CSPG binding, indicating that only a subfraction of the proteins binds to HSPG. This prompts the use of homogenous proteins as well as direct comparative analyses as shown here.On the basis of our results it seems likely that all four N-terminal domains (DBL1X-ID1-DBL2X-CIDRPAM-DBL3X) form a binding cleft or pocket in the native VAR2CSA protein, which enables specific CSA interactions of high affinity. This kind of multivalent binding is rather typical for protein-glycan interactions, although there are exceptions. Monovalent protein-glycan binding tends to be of relatively low affinity (micro-molar range) and high avidity is therefore often required for the protein-glycan interaction to achieve specificity and function in vivo (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. 2nd Ed. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar).The full-length ectodomain of VAR2CSA from the 3D7 parasite binds with similar affinity to CSA as the FCR3 variant analyzed here (7Srivastava A. Gangnard S. Round A. Dechavanne S. Juillerat A. Raynal B. Faure G. Baron B. Ramboarina S. Singh S.K. Belrhali H. England P. Lewit-Bentley A. Scherf A. Bentley G.A. Gamain B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the overall structure of VAR2CSA from 3D7 is quite compact, which supports the idea that the binding site resides in multiple rather than single domains (7Srivastava A. Gangnard S. Round A. Dechavanne S. Juillerat A. Raynal B. Faure G. Baron B. Ramboarina S. Singh S.K. Belrhali H. England P. Lewit-Bentley A. Scherf A. Bentley G.A. Gamain B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). From a broader perspective, it is interesting that the receptor binding region of VAR2CSA from the FCR3 isolate lies within the N-terminal part of the protein, which corresponds to the conserved domain composition of other PfEMP1 molecules (28Su X.Z. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.A. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.A. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Several domains within this N-terminal region have been implicated in receptor binding activities, e.g. CD36 binding of CIDR1 domains (29Smith J.D. Kyes S. Craig A.G. Fagan T. Hudson-Taylor D.

Blood. 2003; 101: 2405-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).It is tempting to speculate that all PfEMP1 molecules share a fundamentally similar mode of binding such that the receptor/ligand contact zone is always in the semi-conserved N-terminal part, although the number of domains necessary for high affinity and specificity may vary. However, considerably more structural knowledge about the diverse ectodomains and binding sites of PfEMP1 proteins are needed to substantiate this proposal.The inhibitory function of the VAR2CSA-specific antibodies generated for this study support the location of the CSA-binding site in the N-terminal part since antibodies induced against the NTS-DBL3X protein efficiently abrogate parasite adhesion. The NTS-DBL3X construct binds specifically and with nanomolar affinity to CSPG, which suggests that it displays an essentially fully functional receptor binding site and that epitopes within and around this site are the targets of the inhibitory antibodies. By contrast, the individual domains DBL2X and DBL3X both bind poorly to CSPG, probably because many residues necessary for a strong interaction are not present in a single domain. This would explain why the antigen epitopes necessary for inducing adhesion-blocking antibodies, which are probably conformation dependent and contributed by separate domains, are absent from these constructs. Supporting this view, pooled antibodies raised against individual domains (DBL1X, DBL2X, and DBL3X) were not able to inhibit the interaction between VAR2CSA and CSPG. One additional possible explanation for the lack of adhesion inhibition demonstrated by pooled IgG could be the absence of antibodies specific for the CIDRPAM domain, which seems to be an essential region of the CSA-binding site.Significantly, our current leading PM vaccine candidate, which is based on the DBL4ϵ domain including a small interdomain region (ID4) from the FCR3 parasite, is not required for a specific CSA interaction of high affinity in vitro, although this protein induces inhibitory antibodies that effectively block parasite adhesion to CSA (15Nielsen M.A. Pinto V.V. Resende M. Dahlbäck M. Ditlev S.B. Theander T.G. Salanti A. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind the binding inhibition induced by immunization with this domain is not known, but it could be explained by steric hindrance since the DBL4ϵ domain has been shown by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis to be in close proximity to the CSA binding structure of VAR2CSA. 4S. Christoffersen, A. E. Langkilde, L. Turner, T. Lavstsen, B. Berisha, K. E. Jensen, M. A. Nielsen T. G. Theander, S. Larsen, and A. Salanti, manuscript in preparation. These DBL4ϵ-ID4 antibodies have recently proven to be capable of inhibiting the CSA binding of a panel of P. falciparum parasites isolated from the placenta of delivering mothers in both Tanzania and Benin (36Magistrado P.A. Minja D. Doritchamou J. Ndam N.T. John D. Schmiegelow C. Massougbodji A. Dahlbäck M. Ditlev S.B. Pinto V.V. Resende M. Lusingu J. Theander T.G. Salanti A. Nielsen M.A. Vaccine. 2011; 29: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cross-inhibition is an essential property of any candidate for PM vaccine development and by targeting the exact CSA-binding site it might be possible to induce an even more potent immune response than has been achieved with the DBL4ϵ-ID4 construct. In addition, such a directed antibody response against the actual receptor binding site would be much more difficult for the parasite to evade by mutation, following introduction of an inhibitory PM vaccine. Possibly the DBL4 domain could be fused to the DBL2X-CIDRPAM to make a stable chimeric protein, both presenting the minimal binding region as well as the DBL4 epitopes that has been shown to induce inhibitory antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2068118704,"Background Man-induced mortality of birds caused by electrocution with poorly-designed pylons and power lines has been reported to be an important mortality factor that could become a major cause of population decline of one of the world rarest raptors, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti). Consequently it has resulted in an increasing awareness of this problem amongst land managers and the public at large, as well as increased research into the distribution of electrocution events and likely mitigation measures. Methodology/Principal Findings We provide information of how mitigation measures implemented on a regional level under the conservation program of the Spanish imperial eagle have resulted in a positive shift of demographic trends in Spain. A 35 years temporal data set (1974–2009) on mortality of Spanish imperial eagle was recorded, including population censuses, and data on electrocution and non-electrocution of birds. Additional information was obtained from 32 radio-tracked young eagles and specific field surveys. Data were divided into two periods, before and after the approval of a regional regulation of power line design in 1990 which established mandatory rules aimed at minimizing or eliminating the negative impacts of power lines facilities on avian populations. Our results show how population size and the average annual percentage of population change have increased between the two periods, whereas the number of electrocuted birds has been reduced in spite of the continuous growing of the wiring network. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that solving bird electrocution is an affordable problem if political interest is shown and financial investment is made. The combination of an adequate spatial planning with a sustainable development of human infrastructures will contribute positively to the conservation of the Spanish imperial eagle and may underpin population growth and range expansion, with positive side effects on other endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2070801816,"Background Several studies have reported a reduction in acute coronary events (ACEs) in the general population after the enforcement of smoking regulations, although there is uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the effect of such interventions. We conducted a country-wide evaluation of the health effects of the introduction of a smoking ban in public places, using data on hospital admissions for ACEs from the Italian population after the implementation of a national smoking regulation in January 2005. Methods and Findings Rates of admission for ACEs in the 20 Italian regions from January 2002 to November 2006 were analysed using mixed-effect regression models that allowed for long-term trends and seasonality. Standard methods for interrupted time-series were adopted to assess the immediate and gradual effects of the smoking ban. Effect modification by age was investigated, with the assumption that exposure to passive smoking in public places would be greater among young people. In total, 936,519 hospital admissions for ACEs occurred in the Italian population during the study period. A 4% reduction in hospital admissions for ACEs among persons aged less than 70 years was evident after the introduction of the ban (Rate Ratio [RR], 0.96; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.95–0.98). No effect was found among persons aged at least 70 years (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.99–1.02). Effect modification by age was further suggested by analyses using narrower age categories. Conclusions Smoke-free policies can constitute a simple and inexpensive intervention for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and thus should be included in prevention programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2106441513,"The idea that species diversity can influence ecosystem functioning has been controversial and its importance relative to compositional effects hotly debated. Unfortunately, assessing the relative importance of different explanatory variables in complex linear models is not simple. In this paper we assess the relative importance of species richness and species composition in a multilevel model analysis of net aboveground biomass production in grassland biodiversity experiments by estimating variance components for all explanatory variables. We compare the variance components using a recently introduced graphical Bayesian ANOVA. We show that while the use of test statistics and the R² gives contradictory assessments, the variance components analysis reveals that species richness and composition are of roughly similar importance for primary productivity in grassland biodiversity experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1977114806,"Fisheries have major impacts on seabirds, both by changing food availability and by causing direct mortality of birds during trawling and longline setting. However, little is known about the nature and the spatial-temporal extent of the interactions between individual birds and vessels. By studying a system in which we had fine-scale data on bird movements and activity, and near real-time information on vessel distribution, we provide new insights on the association of a threatened albatross with fisheries. During early chick-rearing, black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris from two different colonies (separated by only 75 km) showed significant differences in the degree of association with fisheries, despite being nearly equidistant to the Falklands fishing fleet. Most foraging trips from either colony did not bring tracked individuals close to vessels, and proportionally little time and foraging effort was spent near ships. Nevertheless, a few individuals repeatedly visited fishing vessels, which may indicate they specialise on fisheries-linked food sources and so are potentially more vulnerable to bycatch. The evidence suggests that this population has little reliance on fisheries discards at a critical stage of its nesting cycle, and hence measures to limit fisheries waste on the Patagonian shelf that also reduce vessel attractiveness and the risk of incidental mortality, would be of high overall conservation benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2125300645,"We report that dermatopontin (DP), an abundant dermal extracellular matrix protein, is found in the fibrin clot and in the wound fluid, which comprise the provisional matrix at the initial stage of wound healing. DP was also found in the serum but at a lower concentration than that in wound fluid. DP co-localized with both fibrin and fibronectin on fibrin fibers and interacted with both proteins. Both normal fibroblast and HT1080 cell adhesion to the fibrin-fibronectin matrix were dose-dependently enhanced by DP, and the adhesion was mediated by α5β1 integrin. The cytoskeleton was more organized in the cells that adhered to the fibrin-fibronectin-DP complex. When incubated with DP, fibronectin formed an insoluble complex of fibronectin fibrils as visualized by electron microscopy. The interacting sites of fibronectin with DP were the first, thirteenth, and fourteenth type III repeats (III(1), III(13), and III(14)), with III(13) and III(14) assumed to be the major sites. The interaction between III(2-3) and III(12-14) was inhibited by DP, whereas the interaction between I(1-5) and III(12-14) was specifically and strongly enhanced by DP. Because the interaction between III(2-3) and III(12-14) is involved in forming a globular conformation of fibronectin, and that between I(1-5) and III(12-14) is required for forming fibronectin fibrils, DP promotes fibronectin fibril formation probably by changing the fibronectin conformation. These results suggest that DP has an accelerating role in fibroblast cell adhesion to the provisional matrix in the initial stage of wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1974224857,"Correlative data suggest that thyroid hormone receptor-β (TRβ) mutations could increase the risk of mammary tumor development, but unequivocal evidence is still lacking. To explore the role of TRβ mutants in vivo in breast tumor development and progression, we took advantage of a knock-in mouse model harboring a mutation in the Thrb gene encoding TRβ (ThrbPV mouse). Although in adult nulliparous females, a single ThrbPV allele did not contribute to mammary gland abnormalities, the presence of two ThrbPV alleles led to mammary hyperplasia in ∼36% ThrbPV/PV mice. The ThrbPV mutation further markedly augmented the risk of mammary hyperplasia in a mouse model with high susceptibility to mammary tumors (Pten+/− mouse), as demonstrated by the occurrence of mammary hyperplasia in ∼60% of ThrbPV/+Pten+/− and ∼77% of ThrbPV/PVPten+/− mice versus ∼33% of Thrb+/+Pten+/− mice. The ThrbPV mutation increased the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5) to increase cell proliferation and the expression of the STAT5 target gene encoding β-casein in the mammary gland. We next sought to understand the molecular mechanism underlying STAT5 overactivation by TRβPV. Cell-based studies with a breast cancer cell line (T47D cells) showed that thyroid hormone (T3) repressed STAT5 signaling in TRβ-expressing cells through decreasing STAT5-mediated transcription activity and target gene expression, whereas sustained STAT5 signaling was observed in TRβPV-expressing cells. Collectively, these findings show for the first time that a TRβ mutation promotes the development of mammary hyperplasia via aberrant activation of STAT5, thereby conferring a fertile genetic ground for tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2058992247,"Existence of humoral immunity has been previously demonstrated in malignant ascitic fluids. However, only a limited number of immunogenic tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were identified, and few of which are associated with ovarian cancer. Here, we identified salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) as a TAA through screening of a random peptide library in the phage display system. Overexpression of SIK3 markedly promoted cell proliferation, attenuated p21Waf/Cip1 and p27Kip expressions in low-grade OVCAR3 cells, and permitted the cells to grow in mice. Decrease in SIK3 expression in high-grade SK-OV3 cells consistently demonstrated its tumorigenic potency by modulating the protein levels of cell cycle regulators. When the expressions of SIK3 and CA125 were compared in cancer tissues, immunohistochemical (IHC) studies indicated that cytoplasm-localized SIK3 was highly expressed in 55% of the ovarian cancer samples. In contrast, it was rarely detected in adenomyosis, leiomyoma and normal ovary tissues, showing its higher specificity (97%) to CA125 (65%) in ovarian cancer. Moreover, experiments using pharmacological inhibitors to block SIK3-induced p21Waf/Cip1 expression revealed that activation of c-Src and phosphoinositide-3-kinase were critically required for its biological activity, suggesting that they are the downstream signaling mediators of SIK3. These data were further supported by IHC studies, showing coexpression of c-Src with SIK3 in 85% of the ovarian tumor samples stained positive for SIK3. Collectively, our findings indicate that SIK3 is a novel ovarian TAA. Overexpression of SIK3 promotes G1/S cell cycle progression, bestows survival advantages to cancer cells for growth and correlates the clinicopathological conditions of patients with ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2053050301,"The identification of molecular markers useful for predicting prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients is crucial for advances in disease management. The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) is known to express in most epithelial malignancies and was reported as a tumor marker or a candidate of molecular targeting therapy. However, the clinical significance of Ep-CAM expression in pancreatic cancer is not well-known. We determined the difference of malignant potential between parental and Ep-CAM-transfected pancreatic cancer cell lines by using proliferation, invasion and migration assay. Furthermore, we determined the relationship between tumoral Ep-CAM expression of resected specimens and clinical prognosis in 95 pancreatic cancer patients receiving radical surgery at two different cancer centers. One of the three Ep-CAM-transfected cell lines showed significantly low proliferation rate compared with the parental cell, while there was no difference in the other two cell lines. In invasion and migration assays, Ep-CAM-transfected cells showed significantly lower malignant potential than parental in all of the three cell lines. In 95 pancreatic cancer patients, 47 patients showed high-Ep-CAM expression, while 48 patients showed low, and there was no difference of clinicopathological features between Ep-CAM high and low-expression group. High-Ep-CAM expression group showed significantly good prognosis in overall survival (3-year survival; 56.2 versus 19.2%, P=0.0018) as well as in disease-free survival (3-year survival; 40.3 versus 14.4%, P=0.038) compared with low-expression group. In addition, the impact of Ep-CAM was observed strongly in LN-negative group when the influence of Ep-CAM was examined with dividing patients into LN-positive and negative group. In multivariate analysis, Ep-CAM expression was one of the independent prognostic factors as well as histology and lymph node metastasis. Ep-CAM expression was found to be related to the suppression of pancreatic cancer cell activity and the good prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients receiving the curative resection."
https://openalex.org/W2080039840,"Bats in the northeastern U.S. are affected by geomycosis caused by the fungus Geomyces destructans (Gd). This infection is commonly referred to as White Nose Syndrome (WNS). Over a million hibernating bats have died since the fungus was first discovered in 2006 in a cave near Albany, New York. A population viability analysis conducted on little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), one of six bat species infected with Gd, suggests regional extinction of this species within 20 years. The fungus Gd is a psychrophile (“cold loving”), but nothing is known about how it thrives at low temperatures and what pathogenic attributes allow it to infect bats. This study aimed to determine if currently available antifungal drugs and biocides are effective against Gd. We tested five Gd strains for their susceptibility to antifungal drugs and high-throughput screened (HTS) one representative strain with SpectrumPlus compound library containing 1,920 compounds. The results indicated that Gd is susceptible to a number of antifungal drugs at concentrations similar to the susceptibility range of human pathogenic fungi. Strains of Gd were susceptible to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole. In contrast, very high MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of flucytosine and echinocandins were needed for growth inhibition, which were suggestive of fungal resistance to these drugs. Of the1,920 compounds in the library, a few caused 50% - to greater than 90% inhibition of Gd growth. A number of azole antifungals, a fungicide, and some biocides caused prominent growth inhibition. Our results could provide a theoretical basis for future strategies aimed at the rehabilitation of most affected bat species and for decontamination of Gd in the cave environment."
https://openalex.org/W1973938553,"The inactivation of BRCA2, a suppressor of breast, ovarian and other epithelial cancers, triggers instability in chromosome structure and number, which are thought to arise from defects in DNA recombination and mitotic cell division, respectively. Human BRCA2 controls DNA recombination via eight BRC repeats, evolutionarily conserved motifs of ∼35 residues, that interact directly with the recombinase RAD51. How BRCA2 controls mitotic cell division is debated. Several studies by different groups report that BRCA2 deficiency affects cytokinesis. Moreover, its interaction with HMG20b, a protein of uncertain function containing a promiscuous DNA-binding domain and kinesin-like coiled coils, has been implicated in the G2-M transition. We show here that HMG20b depletion by RNA interference disturbs the completion of cell division, suggesting a novel function for HMG20b. In vitro, HMG20b binds directly to the BRC repeats of BRCA2, and exhibits the highest affinity for BRC5, a motif that binds poorly to RAD51. Conversely, the BRC4 repeat binds strongly to RAD51, but not to HMG20b. In vivo, BRC5 overexpression inhibits the BRCA2-HMG20b interaction, recapitulating defects in the completion of cell division provoked by HMG20b depletion. In contrast, BRC4 inhibits the BRCA2-RAD51 interaction and the assembly of RAD51 at sites of DNA damage, but not the completion of cell division. Our findings suggest that a novel function for HMG20b in cytokinesis is regulated by its interaction with the BRC repeats of BRCA2, and separate this unexpected function for the BRC repeats from their known activity in DNA recombination. We propose that divergent tumor-suppressive pathways regulating chromosome segregation as well as chromosome structure may be governed by the conserved BRC motifs in BRCA2."

However, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host we now demonstrate that deletion of the protist type lysozyme LYS-7 renders animals susceptible to killing by the fatal fungal human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, but, remarkably, enhances tolerance to the enteric bacteria Salmonella Typhimurium. This trade-off in immunological susceptibility in C. elegans is further mediated by the reciprocal activity of lys-7 and the tyrosine kinase abl-1. Together this implies a greater complexity in C. elegans innate immune function than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2019339797,"Loss of epithelial integrity often correlates with the progression of malignant tumors. Sds22, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), has recently been linked to regulation of epithelial polarity in Drosophila. However, its role in tumorigenesis remains obscure. In this study, using Drosophila imaginal tissue as an in vivo model system, we show that sds22 is a new potential tumor suppressor gene in Drosophila. Without sds22, cells lose epithelial architecture, and become invasive and tumorigenic when combined with Ras overexpression; conversely, sds22 overexpression can largely suppress tumorigenic growth of RasV12scrib−/− mutant cells. Mechanistically, we show that sds22 prevents cell invasion and metastasis by inhibiting myosin II and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity downstream of PP1. Loss of this inhibition causes cells to lose epithelial organization and promotes cell invasion. Finally, human Sds22 is focally deleted and downregulated in multiple carcinomas, and this downregulation correlates with tumor progression, suggesting that sds22 inactivation may contribute to tumorigenesis and metastatic potential in human cancers via a similar mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2067820992,"According to clinical guidelines, every patient affected by stroke should be given a brain-imaging scan (BIS) - Computerized Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging - immediately after being admitted to hospital.To describe the variation in use of BIS among English public hospitals and identify any patient groups being excluded from appropriate care.We collected hospital administrative data for all patients admitted to any English public hospital with a principal diagnosis of stroke from 2006 to 2009. We calculated the proportion of patients treated with BIS in the whole sample and after stratification by hospital. We compared hospitals' performance using funnel plots. We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis using BIS as outcome and age, gender, socio-economic deprivation, and comorbidity as covariates.In English public hospitals there are about 70,000 emergency admissions for stroke per year. Nationally, only 35% receive a BIS immediately, and only 84% receive it within the admission. There is large variation in the use of BIS for stroke patients among English public hospitals, with some of them approaching the recommended 100% and some having very low rates. Young (P<0.001), male (P = 0.012), and least socio-economically deprived patients (P = 0.001), as well as patients with fewer comorbidities (P<0.001) appear to have more chance of being selected for a brain scan.Some English public hospitals appear to be falling well below the clinical guideline standards for scanning stroke patients and inappropriate patient selection criteria may be being applied, leading to health inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2057392962,"The DNp73 proteins act as trans-repressors of p53 and p73-dependent transcription and exert both anti-apoptotic activity and pro-proliferative activity. DNp73s are frequently up-regulated in a variety of human cancers, including human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Increased levels of DNp73 proteins confer to HCC cells resistance to apoptosis and, irrespective to p53 status, a chemoresistant phenotype. Here, we show that interferon (IFN)α down-regulates DNp73 expression in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and HCC cell lines. IFNα has been used as pro-apoptotic agent in the treatment of malignancies and there is increasing evidence of IFNα effectiveness in HCC treatment and prevention of recurrence. The precise mechanisms by which class I IFNs exert their anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity remain unclear. IFNα binding to its receptor activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades regulating the transcription of numerous direct target genes through the recruitment of a complex comprising of STAT1, STAT2 and IFN regulatory factor (IRF)9 to their promoters. We found that, in response to IFNα, the P2p73 promoter undergoes substantial chromatin remodeling. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) replace histone acetyl transferases. STAT2 is recruited onto the endogenous P2p73 promoter together with the polycomb group protein Ezh2, leading to increased H3K27 methylation and transcriptional repression. The reduction of DNp73 levels by IFNα is paralleled by an increased susceptibility to IFNα-triggered apoptosis of Huh7 hepatoma cells. Our results show, for the first time, that IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 recruitment may serve both in activating and repressing gene expression and identify the down-regulation of DNp73 as an additional mechanism to counteract the chemoresistance of liver cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050192915,"Stomach carcinogenesis involves mucosal and luminal changes that favor spontaneous disappearance of Helicobacter pylori. Therefore, the association between the infection and cancer risk might typically be underestimated. As acquisition of the infection almost invariably occurs before adulthood, the serostatus at age 16-40 should best reflect the lifetime occurrence of the infection. We therefore conducted a case-control study nested within a historic cohort of about 400,000 individuals who donated sera before age 40 to either of two large Swedish Biobanks between 1968 and 2006, and whose records were linked to complete nationwide registers. For each stomach adenocarcinoma case occurring at least 5 years after serum donation 2 controls were selected matched on age, sex and year of donation and biobank. Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies against H. pylori cell-surface antigens (Hp-CSAs) were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and antibodies against CagA with an immunoblot assay. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for stomach adenocarcinoma among H. pylori infected relative to uninfected. We confirmed 59 incident cases of stomach adenocarcinoma (41 non-cardia tumors) during follow-up. ORs for non-cardia stomach adenocarcinoma among subjects with Hp-CSA antibodies (regardless of CagA serostatus), antibodies against CagA (regardless of Hp-CSA serostatus), and antibodies to both, relative to those who were seronegative to both, were 17.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0-72.9), 10.9 (95% CI 3.2-36.9), and 48.5 (95% CI 5.8-407.4), respectively. H. pylori infection is a much stronger risk factor for non-cardia stomach adenocarcinoma than initially realized. However, further studies are needed to answer whether it is a necessary cause, as the possibility of misclassification of H. pylori status could not be ruled out in our study."
https://openalex.org/W2144377439,"Type I DNA methyltransferases contain one specificity subunit (HsdS) and two modification subunits (HsdM). The electron microscopy model of M.EcoKI-M₂S₁ methyltransferase shows a reasonable closed state of this clamp-like enzyme, but the structure of the open state is still unclear. The 1.95 Å crystal structure of the specificity subunit from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (TTE-HsdS) shows an unreported open form inter-domain orientation of this subunit. Based on the crystal structure of TTE-HsdS and the closed state model of M.EcoKI-M₂S₁, we constructed a potential open state model of type I methyltransferase. Mutational studies indicated that two α-helices (aa30-59 and aa466-495) of the TTE-HsdM subunit are important inter-subunit interaction sites in the TTE-M₂S₁ complex. DNA binding assays also highlighted the importance of the C-terminal region of TTE-HsdM for DNA binding by the TTE-M₂S₁ complex. On the basis of structural analysis, biochemical experiments and previous studies, we propose a dynamic opening and closing mechanism for type I methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2110694293,"Uracil is removed from DNA by the conserved enzyme Uracil DNA N-glycosylase (UNG). Previously, we observed that inhibiting UNG in Xenopus egg extracts blocked assembly of CENP-A, a histone H3 variant. CENP-A is an essential protein in all species, since it is required for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Thus, the implication of UNG in CENP-A assembly implies that UNG would also be essential, but UNG mutants lacking catalytic activity are viable in all species. In this paper, we present evidence that UNG2 colocalizes with CENP-A and H2AX phosphorylation at centromeres in normally cycling cells. Reduction of UNG2 in human cells blocks CENP-A assembly, and results in reduced cell proliferation, associated with increased frequencies of mitotic abnormalities and rapid cell death. Overexpression of UNG2 induces high levels of CENP-A assembly in human cells. Using a multiphoton laser approach, we demonstrate that UNG2 is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage. Taken together, our data are consistent with a model in which the N-terminus of UNG2 interacts with the active site of the enzyme and with chromatin."

We aim to compare the differences in presentation between influenza and non-influenza cases among those with febrile respiratory illness (FRI) to determine predictors of influenza infection. Methods Personnel with FRI (defined as fever≥37.5°C, with cough or sore throat) were recruited from the sentinel surveillance system in the Singapore military. Nasal washes were collected, and tested using the Resplex II and additional PCR assays for etiological determination. Interviewer-administered questionnaires collected information on patient demographics and clinical features. Univariate comparison of the various parameters was conducted, with statistically significant parameters entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. The final multivariate model for influenza versus non-influenza cases was used to build a predictive probability clinical diagnostic model. Results 821 out of 2858 subjects recruited from 11 May 2009 to 25 Jun 2010 had influenza, of which 434 (52.9%) had 2009 influenza A (H1N1), 58 (7.1%) seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and 269 (32.8%) influenza B. Influenza-positive cases were significantly more likely to present with running nose, chills and rigors, ocular symptoms and higher temperature, and less likely with sore throat, photophobia, injected pharynx, and nausea/vomiting. Our clinical diagnostic model had a sensitivity of 65% (95% CI: 58%, 72%), specificity of 69% (95% CI: 62%, 75%), and overall accuracy of 68% (95% CI: 64%, 71%), performing significantly better than conventional influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria. Conclusions Use of a clinical diagnostic model may help predict influenza better than the conventional ILI definition among young adults with FRI."
https://openalex.org/W1965119176,"In insects, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), surrounded with auxiliary cells and protected by a cuticular wall, form small discrete sensory organs--the sensilla. The moth pheromone-sensitive sensillum is a well studied example of hair-like sensillum that is favorable to both experimental and modeling investigations. The model presented takes into account both the molecular processes of ORNs, i.e. the biochemical reactions and ionic currents giving rise to the receptor potential, and the cellular organization and compartmentalization of the organ represented by an electrical circuit. The number of isopotential compartments needed to describe the long dendrite bearing pheromone receptors was determined. The transduction parameters that must be modified when the number of compartments is increased were identified. This model reproduces the amplitude and time course of the experimentally recorded receptor potential. A first complete version of the model was analyzed in response to pheromone pulses of various strengths. It provided a quantitative description of the spatial and temporal evolution of the pheromone-dependent conductances, currents and potentials along the outer dendrite and served to determine the contribution of the various steps in the cascade to its global sensitivity. A second simplified version of the model, utilizing a single depolarizing conductance and leak conductances for repolarizing the ORN, was derived from the first version. It served to analyze the effects on the sensory properties of varying the electrical parameters and the size of the main sensillum parts. The consequences of the results obtained on the still uncertain mechanisms of olfactory transduction in moth ORNs--involvement or not of G-proteins, role of chloride and potassium currents--are discussed as well as the optimality of the sensillum organization, the dependence of biochemical parameters on the neuron spatial extension and the respective contributions of the biochemical and electrical parameters to the overall neuron response."
https://openalex.org/W2159943090,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) potently inhibits cholinergic signaling at the neuromuscular junction. The ideal countermeasures for BoNT exposure are monoclonal antibodies or BoNT antisera, which form BoNT-containing immune complexes that are rapidly cleared from the general circulation. Clearance of opsonized toxins may involve complement receptor-mediated immunoadherence to red blood cells (RBC) in primates or to platelets in rodents. Methods of enhancing immunoadherence of BoNT-specific antibodies may increase their potency in vivo. We designed a novel fusion protein (FP) to link biotinylated molecules to glycophorin A (GPA) on the RBC surface. The FP consists of an scFv specific for murine GPA fused to streptavidin. FP:mAb:BoNT complexes bound specifically to the RBC surface in vitro. In a mouse model of BoNT neutralization, the FP increased the potency of single and double antibody combinations in BoNT neutralization. A combination of two antibodies with the FP gave complete neutralization of 5,000 LD50 BoNT in mice. Neutralization in vivo was dependent on biotinylation of both antibodies and correlated with a reduction of plasma BoNT levels. In a post-exposure model of intoxication, FP:mAb complexes gave complete protection from a lethal BoNT/A1 dose when administered within 2 hours of toxin exposure. In a pre-exposure prophylaxis model, mice were fully protected for 72 hours following administration of the FP:mAb complex. These results demonstrate that RBC-targeted immunoadherence through the FP is a potent enhancer of BoNT neutralization by antibodies in vivo."

For highly pathogenic bacteria, such as Yersinia pestis, these studies are currently limited because deliberate introduction of antibiotic resistance is restricted to those few which are not human treatment options. In this work, we report the development of alternatives to antibiotics as tools for host-pathogen research during Yersinia pestis infections focusing on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) pathway, a requirement for cell wall synthesis in eubacteria. We generated a mutation in the dapA-nlpB(dapX) operon of Yersinia pestis KIM D27 and CO92 which eliminated the expression of both genes. The resulting strains were auxotrophic for diaminopimelic acid and this phenotype was complemented in trans by expressing dapA in single and multi-copy. In vivo, we found that plasmids derived from the p15a replicon were cured without selection, while selection for DAP enhanced stability without detectable loss of any of the three resident virulence plasmids. The dapAX mutation rendered Y. pestis avirulent in mouse models of bubonic and septicemic plague which could be complemented when dapAX was inserted in single or multi-copy, restoring development of disease that was indistinguishable from the wild type parent strain. We further identified a high level, constitutive promoter in Y. pestis that could be used to drive expression of fluorescent reporters in dapAX strains that had minimal impact to virulence in mouse models while enabling sensitive detection of bacteria during infection. Thus, diaminopimelic acid selection for single or multi-copy genetic systems in Yersinia pestis offers an improved alternative to antibiotics for in vivo studies that causes minimal disruption to virulence."

However, in noisy environments, the player volume is often set to extremely high levels in order to drown out the intense ambient noise and satisfy the appetite for music. Extensive and inappropriate usage of portable music players might cause subtle damages in the auditory system, which are not behaviorally detectable in an early stage of the hearing impairment progress. Here, by means of magnetoencephalography, we objectively examined detrimental effects of portable music player misusage on the population-level frequency tuning in the human auditory cortex. We compared two groups of young people: one group had listened to music with portable music players intensively for a long period of time, while the other group had not. Both groups performed equally and normally in standard audiological examinations (pure tone audiogram, speech test, and hearing-in-noise test). However, the objective magnetoencephalographic data demonstrated that the population-level frequency tuning in the auditory cortex of the portable music player users was significantly broadened compared to the non-users, when attention was distracted from the auditory modality; this group difference vanished when attention was directed to the auditory modality. Our conclusion is that extensive and inadequate usage of portable music players could cause subtle damages, which standard behavioral audiometric measures fail to detect in an early stage. However, these damages could lead to future irreversible hearing disorders, which would have a huge negative impact on the quality of life of those affected, and the society as a whole."
