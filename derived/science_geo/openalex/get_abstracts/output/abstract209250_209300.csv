https://openalex.org/W1972101599,"Marked increases in sweating rate occurred within 1.5 seconds after the initiation of muscular activity in a warm room. This increase did not seem dependent upon thermal stimuli, but was related to the work rate, and the ambient temperature, or the sweating rate during the pre-exercise perhiod."

https://openalex.org/W2031346156,"Female salamanders with large erythrocytes and erythrocyte nuclei produced triploid larvae; females with small erythrocytes and erythrocyte nuclei produced diploid larvae. Larval chromosome counts, dimorphism in cell size, and sex inheritance indicate distinct, persisting populations of triploid females in parts of the range of the Ambystoma jeffersonianum complex."
https://openalex.org/W2149601805,"Electrical stimulation of multiple peripheral nerves, elicited ""H"" reflexes in a patient, 61 years old, with botulism. These reflexes are extremely suggestive of some central release or failure of inhibitory control of a monosynaptic or polysynaptic spinal reflex arc. This ""central"" action of botulinus toxin is similar to that suggested for tetanus toxin."

https://openalex.org/W2031530041,"Variations in cholinesterase and RNA concentrations and in levels of neural activity have been linked to learning. These three groups of experimental evidence suggest that the basis of memory lies in an increase of the concentrations of enzymes associated with transmitter substances, as a long-lasting effect of stimulation. Biological precedent exists in microbial physiology."

https://openalex.org/W2040038609,"Anuran metamorphosis is accompanied by changes in the sedimentation patterns of the lysates of red blood cells of several species. Rana grylio and Rana catesbeiana tadpoles have hemoglobins that sediment at 4.3S (molecular weight, 68,000) and gradually produce a heavier 7.0S component (estimated molecular weight, 136,000) during metamorphosis to the adult frog. There is extensive change in the amino acid compositions of these hemoglobins; these changes may account for observed changes in electrophoretic mobility."

https://openalex.org/W2768437044,"IMMUNOLOGICAL differences between γ-globulins of the same species have been demonstrated in man, rabbit, guinea pig, mouse and possibly baboon. In man and rabbit, these differences have been examined in great detail1. In the mouse, only one allotypic specificity has so far been described in a report by Kelus and Moor-Jankowski2. These authors elicited, in C57BL mice, an antibody to the γ-globulin of BALB/c mice. This antibody reacted with the γ-globulin of BALB/c, C3H/He and ‘Champagne Glaxo’ individuals. We have immunized BALB/cJ mice with the antigen obtained from C3H/HeN × C57BL/6J mice in two ways: (1) by injection with sera incorporated in Freund's adjuvant; (2) by injection with bacteria coated with antibody incorporated in Freund's adjuvant or suspended in 0.15 M sodium chloride3."

https://openalex.org/W2024855431,"Derrick and Thatcher1 have recently shown that the admissions for asthma in Brisbane in the 5–10 year age-group falls rapidly from 30 per 10,000 of population to a minimum of 6 per 10,000 of population at the age of twenty-seven. The initial incidence does not return to its former level until past the age of sixty, and it continues to rise. This work was reported at the August meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in Sydney last year, and it appeared likely to me2 that this could be an effect of testosterone depressing the sensitivity to H substances released in asthma. Especially did this seem likely owing to the unchanging incidence in the female. Dungan3 pointed out that admissions of asthma cases to hospital did not reflect asthma incidence, but rather the supervention of status asthmaticus, and this is undoubtedly true."

https://openalex.org/W2013632285,"SULPHATION procedures involving the use of 35S-chlorosulphonic acid and 35S-sulphuric acid have been widely applied in the chemical synthesis of 35S-labelled sulphate esters of carbohydrates1, amino-acids2,3 and phenols4,5. A constantly recurring feature of these procedures is that a relatively small proportion only of the 35S-labelled starting material is consumed during the preparation of the required ester, the remainder eventually being removed from the products of reaction as ‘waste’ Ba35SO4. Thus, in a typical preparation of 35S-tyrosine O-sulphate2 using 44 mc. of concentrated H235SO4 as sulphating agent, 38.27 mc. of 35S was eventually recovered as Ba35SO4. In general, Ba35SO4 has only limited use in biological tracer experiments, and in consequence, several methods have been devised for the conversion of this material to a form more suitable for such studies6. The present report describes a method for the conversion of Ba35SO4 to the useful sulphating agent 35S-chlorosulphonic acid."
