https://openalex.org/W1991296275,"IN 1956 Wiener and his colleagues1 described an antibody occurring in a case of cold antibody hæmolytic anæmia which they called anti-I. The I antigen has an almost universal distribution, but five examples of i cells were found in testing 22,000 donors. It was considered that the Ii phenotypes arose by the action of two allelomorphic genes I and i, individuals of the phenotype i being ii."

https://openalex.org/W1977333893,"Heart rate, recorded continuously from rats trained to press a bar for intracranial electrical stimulation of their septal areas, fell consistently after brain stimulation. Interpretation of the rewarding effect of septal stimulation had previously been limited by the absence of any data on the autonomic effects of the stimulation. The results of this study suggest that the rewarding effect may possibly be produced by a parasympathetic (quieting) reaction of the autonomic nervous system to septal stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1963931331,"The principal shortcoming common to previous attempts to interpret the atmospheric behavior of fall-out is the failure to distinguish the iufluence of latitude, altitude, and time of injection on the storage time and fall-out pattern for stratospheric sources. On the basis of evidence provided by fission- product concentration ratios in precipitation, Mantell pointed out that the short- lived radioisotopes in world-wide fall-out were principally of stratospheric origin and that stratospheric storage times decrease markedly with latitude and increase with altitude. Use was made of 12.8-d Ba140, 53-d Sr89, 28- y Sr90, and 74-d W185 concentrations in individual precipitation samples in interpreting some major features of transpont and deposition patterns for stratospheric fall-out. The usefulness of fission-product ratio data for estimating the relative con tribution of various nuclear-test sources to total fall-out has been questioned on the basis of possibly serious physical and chemical fractionation effects and uncertainties in fission-product production- yield ratios. The chemical similarity of barium and strontium limits chemical fractionation effects on Ba140/Sr90 ratio data; Sr89/Sr s0 ratio data obviously are unaffected by chemical factors. Uncertainties due to the use of production-ratio values, or due to the assumption that there are no fractionation effects, do not seriously affectmore » the usefulness of isotope- ratio data for distinguishing major differences in atmospheric behavior of nuclear-cloud sources of different altitude and latitude for well-spaced nuclear tests. The U. S. Hardtack nuclearteat series provided a useful tracer in W185 for studying the behavior of fall-out debris from equatorial tests. Data are given for Ba140/Sr90 and Sr89/Sr90 ratio s and for Sr90 and W185 concentrations in rainfall for various time periods.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2068999439,"IT has been almost twenty years since Osborn1 reported his now classical work on antimicrobial substances from green plants. Since that time the literature accumulated on this subject has been voluminous2. The vascular plants tested, however, have been essentially spermatophytes, with little attention to the pteridophytes. This work is concerned with the extraction of antimicrobial substances from thirty ferns collected at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. The specimens were selected at random, and the cut fronds were allowed to dry in air for at least one week before testing. Four additional dried ferns were obtained from other sources and likewise tested."

This corresponds in time and duration with the rise in 17-hydroxycorticoid excretion. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid and 28 other urinary indoles failed to show this rise predictably."

https://openalex.org/W2011681220,The shape of the self-absorption correction curve of beta-emitters is not universal but depends on the geometrical arrangement of the sample and counting device. This may explain why the correction factor defined by Hendler (1) is not always linearly related to the thickness of the sample.

https://openalex.org/W2073312119,"CERTAIN effects of X-irradiation of the exteriorized or in situ intestine of Sprague–Dawley rats were previously reported from these Laboratories1. In view of the scarcity of information concerning the occurrence of tumours after exposure of the intestine to irradiation, survivors of that study, and their controls were kept for further observation. This communication reports the incidence of intestinal tumours among 51 rats that were irradiated at an age of 5 months and were killed between 9 and 30 months later. All but seven experimental and two control animals were killed because of the presence of tumours or other diseases. The nine rats were arbitrarily killed at an age of ten months at the conclusion of the period of experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W1996334412,"ANTI-I was the name given by Wiener et al. 1 in 1956 to a cold antibody found in the serum of a patient suffering from cold antibody hæmolytic anaemia. Further investigations into the I group system were made by Jenkins et al. 2, Tippett et al. 3, Weiner et al. 4 and Marsh5. These workers showed that cold auto-antibodies (previously called nonspecific cold agglutinins) had I specificity and that occasional powerful examples of these antibodies may be found as auto-agglutinins in cases of cold antibody hæmolytic anaemia. The I antigen has an almost universal distribution, Wiener et al. finding only five i people from 22,000 blood donors, while Jenkins et al. failed to find an example of the i phenotype after testing 17,000 donors. Marsh afterwards described examples of cold auto-antibodies having i specificity and showed that normal infants at birth possessed the i phenotype, which changed within 18 months of birth to I. He concluded that the rare i phenotype in adults arose from the absence of a genetically determined factor essential for the proper development of I. The majority of cold auto-antibodies therefore appear to have I specificity, a minority may be anti-i."

The depression in spontaneous behavior shown by the animals does not seem to be dependent upon any psychogenic action of emetine; there appears to be a correlation between the cardiac damage and the depression caused by the drug."

https://openalex.org/W2046465442,"WHILE testing the effects of insulin on the circulatory reaction of laboratory rats to dextran, we found that many animals died after combined doses of the two agents which were not lethal when administered separately. The validity of this observation was put to experimental test. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing at least 150 gm. and fasted 24 hr. were sub-cutaneously injected with zinc insulin (‘Iletin’) at two dose-levels, 7.5 or 10 U./kgm. body-weight. An hour later dextran was administered by vein in a total volume of 10 ml./kgm. 0.85 per cent sodium chloride containing either 60 or 600 mgm. dextran (‘Expandex’). Control animals received saline without dextran. Fatalities due to these amounts of dextran have not occurred in our work. The results of eight experiments are summarized in Table 1, which shows the incidence of survival after 24 hr. Animals that died exhibited convulsions usually within 3 hr. of insulin administration. Few signs of the dextran reaction characteristic of this species were noticed."
