https://openalex.org/W1481433938,"Catalase was inhibited by a flux of O2- generated in situ by the aerobic xanthine oxidase reaction. Two distinct types of inhibition could be distinguished. One of these was rapidly established and could be as rapidly reversed by the addition of superoxide dismutase. The second developed slowly and was reversed by ethanol, but not by superoxide dismutase. The rapid inhibition was probably due to conversion of catalase to the ferrooxy state (compound III), while the slow inhibition was due to conversion to the ferryl state (compound II). Since neither compound III nor compound II occurs in the catalatic reaction pathway, they are inactive. This inhibition of catalase by O2- provides the basis for a synergism between superoxide dismutase and catalase. Such synergisms have been observed in vitro and may be significant in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2084324077,"The concentration of oxytocin receptors increased in the myometrium of pregnant women and reached maximum levels in early labor. Concentrations of oxytocin receptors were also high in the decidua and reached a maximum at parturition. In vitro, prostaglandin production by the decidua, but not by the myometrium, was increased by the addition of oxytocin. Oxytocin may therefore stimulate uterine contractions by acting both directly on the myometrium and indirectly on decidual prostaglandin production. Oxytocin receptors are probably crucial for the onset of human labor, and the stimulus for the increase in uterine prostaglandins may be oxytocin originating from the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W1985525186,"Intracellular recordings in vivo from noradrenergic neurons in the rat locus coeruleus showed that membrane potential was hyperpolarized by the administration of clonidine (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) or after a burst of spikes evoked by intracellular pulses; both types of hyperpolarization were associated with a decrease in membrane input resistance, and both could be blocked by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist piperoxane. These results suggest that a hyperpolarization of membrane potential mediated by an alpha 2-adrenoceptor underlies both clonidine- and activation-induced inhibition of locus coeruleus cell firing."
https://openalex.org/W2037936859,"The pituitary cell line, AtT-20, synthesizes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as a glycoprotein precursor that is cleaved into mature hormones during packaging into secretory granules. The cells also produce an endogenous leukemia virus (MuLV) that is glycosylated after translation similar to the glycosylation of the ACTH precursor. Our evidence suggests that the envelope glycoprotein and some precursor ACTH get to the cell surface in a vesicle different from the mature ACTH secretory granule. Viral glycoproteins and ACTH precursor are released from the cells much sooner after synthesis than mature ACTH. Isolated secretory granules do not contain significant amounts of the envelope glycoprotein or ACTH precursor. Exposing cells to 8Br-cAMP stimulates release of mature ACTH four to five fold, but has little effect on the release of the ACTH precursor or the viral glycoproteins. We propose that the viral glycoproteins and some of the ACTH precursor are transported by a constitutive pathway, while mature ACTH is stored in secretory granules where its release is enhanced by stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2093189266,"The genome of avian erythroblastosis virus contains two independently expressed genetic loci (v-erbA and v-erbB) whose activities are probably responsible for oncogenesis by the virus. Both loci are closely related to nucleotide sequences found in the DNA and RNA of chickens and other vertebrates. We have isolated and characterized chicken DNA homologous to v-erbA and v-erbB. The two viral genes are represented by separate domains within chicken DNA (c-erbA and c-erbB), which are separated by a minimum of 12 kilobases (kb) of DNA and may not be linked at all. The nucleotide sequences shared by the viral and cellular erb loci are colinear, but the cellular loci are interrupted by multiple intervening sequences of various lengths. Polyribosomes prepared from normal chicken embryos contain two polyadenylated RNAs transcribed from c-erbA and two transcribed from c-erbB. The evident coding regions of these RNAs represent an unusually small fraction of the lengths of the RNAs, as if the 3' untranslated domains of the RNAs might be exceptionally large (3-11 kb). These findings indicate that the c-erb loci are normal vertebrate genes rather than genes of cryptic endogenous retroviruses, and that they may have a role in the metabolism of normal cells. It appears that the viral erb genes, like most other retrovirus oncogenes, have been copied from cellular genes. In the viral genome, the two genes are devoid of introns, but they remain independently expressed loci, and they remain colinear with the coding domains of their cellular progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W1512982676,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a mitogenic polypeptide hormone, stimulates the phosphorylation of certain endogenous proteins in membrane preparations derived from A431 cells, a human tumor cell line. Membrane vesicles prepared from A431 cells were reacted with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (5'-p-FSO2BzAdo). Reaction of the vesicles with 5'-p-FSO2BzAdo results in a time-dependent inhibition of EGF-stimulable protein kinase activity which parallels an increase in incorporation into the vesicles of the 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl-[8-14C]adenosine moiety from 5'-p-FSO2Bz[14C]Ado. The primary bands labeled have Mr = 170,000 and 150,000. Labeling of these bands by 5'-p-FSO2Bz[14C]Ado is inhibited by incubation of the membrane vesicles with adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, an ATP analog. Inactivation of the kinase with N-ethylmaleimide or by heating results in a sharply decreased labeling of the proteins with Mr = 170,000 and 150,000. Proteins of these molecular weights have previously been identified in these cells as the EGF receptor and a degradation product of the receptor. These experiments provide chemical evidence that the EGF receptor and the EGF-stimulable kinase are the same protein."
https://openalex.org/W2047736683,"Transposon Tn10 inserts at many sites in the bacterial chromosome, but preferentially inserts at particular hotspots. We believe we have identified the target DNA signal responsible for this specificity. We have determined the DNA sequences of 11 Tn10 insertion sites and identified a particular 6 base pair (bp) symmetrical consensus sequence (GCTNAGC) common to those sites. The sequences at some sites differ from the consensus sequence but only in limited and well defined ways. The sequences at some sites differ from the consensus sequence than do sequences at other sites, and the consensus sequence and closely related sequences are generally absent from potential target regions where Tn10 is known not to insert. Other aspects of the target DNA can significantly influence the efficiency with which a particular target site sequence is used. The 6 bp consensus sequence is symmetrically located within the 9 bp target DNA sequence that is cleaved and duplicated during Tn10 insertion. This juxtaposition of recognition and cleavage sites plus the symmetry of the perfect consensus sequence suggest that the target DNA may be both recognized and cleaved by the symmetrically disposed subunits of a single protein, as suggested for type II restriction endonucleases. There is plausible homology between the consensus sequence and the very ends of Tn10, compatible with recognition of transposon ends and target DNA by the same protein. The sequences of actual insertion sites deviate from the perfect consensus sequence in a way which suggests that the 6 bp specificity determinant may be recognized through protein-DNA contacts along the major groove of the DNA double helix."

https://openalex.org/W2111012194,"The 68C locus in the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands is puffed during the last half of the third larval instar and harbors the structural gene for sgs3, one of the glue polypeptides synthesized by the glands during this period. This puff regresses in response to the steroid hormone ecdysone. We have isolated a set of overlapping cloned segments that define approximately 50 kb of DNA at the 68C puff locus. Three polysomal poly(A)+ RNAs that are abundant in the salivary glands during the intermolt-puff stage are transcribed from three genes (II, III and IV) that map near the center of the cloned DNA in a 5 kb cluster region. These are the only transcripts from the 50 kb of 68C DNA detectable in these glands, and they are undetectable in other larval tissues at this stage, or in whole animals at other stages of development. Correlative criteria indicate that gene IV, which yields an RNA of 1.1 kb, is the structural gene for sgs3. Genes II and III, which yield RNAs of 0.36 kb and 0.32 kb, respectively, are oppositely oriented so that their promoters are adjacent, suggesting that this pair may form a single regulated unit, a suggestion that is enhanced by the fact that the pair is bounded by an inverted repeat of 0.3 kb elements. The possible, but as yet unidentified, functions of this gene pair are discussed. A 9.2 kb element belonging to a family of transposable elements called roo is inserted adjacent to the 5 kb cluster region in some but not other D. melanogaster strains. This insertion has no obvious effect on the transcription of genes II, III and IV. Although roo elements yield a 9 kb poly(A)+ RNA in embryos, no roo transcripts were detected in intermolt salivary glands, whether they do or do not contain an element at the 68C puff site."
https://openalex.org/W2094544071,"The glucagon analog [l-N alpha-trinitrophenylhistidine, 12-homoarginine]-glucagon (THG) was examined for its ability to lower blood glucose concentrations in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin. In vitro, THG is a potent antagonist of glucagon activation of the hepatic adenylate cyclase assay system. Intravenous bolus injections of THG caused rapid decreases (20 to 35 percent) of short duration in blood glucose. Continuous infusion of low concentrations of the inhibitor led to larger sustained decreases in blood glucose (30 to 65 percent). These studies demonstrate that a glucagon receptor antagonist can substantially reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic animals without addition of exogenous insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1539052045,"An activity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initially noted for its catalysis of aggregation of covalently closed double-stranded DNA rings in the presence of ATP, has been identified as a type II DNA topoisomerase and is designated yeast DNA topoisomerase II. The formation of the DNA aggregate, which has been shown to be a network of DNA rings that are topologically interlocked, requires the presence of a yeast DNA-binding protein in addition to the topoisomerase. In the absence of the binding protein, yeast DNA topoisomerase II catalyzes decatenation and unknotting of duplex DNA rings and the relaxation of negatively or positively supercoiled DNA. All reactions are ATP-dependent and require Mg(II). Similar to other eukaryotic and phage T4-type II DNA topoisomerases, the yeast enzyme does not catalyze DNA supercoiling under the assay conditions employed. The activity is not sensitive to the gyrase inhibitor nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, or novobiocin. Coumermycin inhibits the activity, however, at a concentration as low as 5 microgram/ml."
https://openalex.org/W2064435123,"Approximately 40% of the 5'-nucleotidase activity in cultured rat embryo fibroblasts was patent, as judged by enzymatic assays comparing the activity of intact cells with detergent-solubilized cells. The patent activity was inhibited when cells were incubated with anti-5'-nucleotidase serum at 2 degrees C, whereas latent activity (calculated as the difference between total and patent activity) was not. Latent activity was inhibited by antibody when the antiserum was added directly to detergent-solubilized cells or when cells were cultured in the presence of antiserum for several hours. Patent activity was inhibited by antibody, and cells were returned to culture in antibody-free medium; after 12 hr, 30% of the total activity was expressed in intact cells and 60% of the anti-5'-nucleotidase, assayed by the binding of sheep antirabbit antibodies to intact cells, was lost from the cell surface, indicating an exchange of 5'-nucleotidase between the latent and patent compartments. Cytochemical studies showed that the patent activity was located on the cell surface and that latent activity was present in cytoplasmic vacuoles and vesicles, and in the Golgi complex. Over 30% of the anti-5'-nucleotidase internalized during 6 hr in culture returned to the cell surface after a further 9 hr, indicating a continual exchange of the enzyme between the cell surface and cytoplasmic membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1544879211,"Mouse fibroblast 3T6 cells, selected for resistance to hydroxyurea, were shown to overproduce protein M2, one of the two nonidentical subunits of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase. Packed resistant cells gave an EPR signal at 77 K very much resembling the signal given by the tyrosine-free radical of the B2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase. Also, the M2-specific free radical was shown to be located at a tyrosine residue. Of the known tyrosine-free radicals of ribonucleotide reductases from E. coli, bacteriophage T4 infected E. coli and pseudorabies virus infected mouse L cells, the M2-specific EPR signal is most closely similar to the signal of the T4 radical. The small differences in the low temperature EPR signals between these four highly conserved tyrosine-free radical structures can be explained by slightly different angles of the beta-methylene group in relation to the plane of the aromatic ring of tyrosine, reflecting different conformations of the polypeptide chain around the tyrosines. The pronounced difference in microwave saturation between the E. coli B2 tyrosine radical EPR signal and the M2 signal could be due to their different interactions with unspecific paramagnetic ions or with the antiferromagnetically coupled iron pair, shown to be present in the E. coli enzyme and postulated also for the mammalian enzyme. A difference in the iron-radical center between the bacterial and mammalian ribonucleotide reductase is also observed in the ability to regenerate the free radical structure. In contrast to the B2 radical, the M2 tyrosine free radical could be regenerated by merely adding dithiothreitol in the presence of O2 to a cell extract where the radical had previously been destroyed by hydroxyurea treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2019395739,"The high-affinity binding sites for mianserin and imipramine appear to be locate in different neurons of rat brain. Studies in which lesions were produced with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and other studies in which the 5-hydroxytryptamine content was decreased with p-chlorophenylalanine indicate that some of the imipramine binding sites are on serotonin axon terminals and others are on nonserotonergic synapses. The sites that bind mianserin are on postsynaptic serotonin sites as well as on synapses of other neuronal systems."
https://openalex.org/W2041216205,"Brief tetanic stimulation of the preganglionic nerves to the superior cervical ganglion enhances the postganglionic response to single preganglionic stimuli for 1 to 3 hours. This long-term potentiation of transmission through the ganglion is apparently not attributable to a persistent muscarinic action of the preganglionic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, since neither the magnitude nor the time course of the phenomenon is reduced by atropine. The decay of long-term potentiation can be described by a first-order kinetic process with a mean time constant of 80 minutes. We conclude that long-term potentiation, once considered a unique property of the hippocampus, is in fact a more general feature of synaptic function. This form of synaptic memory may significantly influence information processing and control in other regions of the nervous system, including autonomic ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W1524972664,"A subcellular particulate fraction containing the NADPH-dependent O2.--generating oxidase from stimulated human neutrophils was prepared. This fraction was depleted of certain enzyme markers of primary and secondary granules and was devoid of measurable myeloperoxidase, both enzymatically and spectrally. When prepared from neutrophils which had been previously stimulated with phorbal myristate acetate, this fraction contained cyanide-insensitive, pyridine nucleotide-dependent O2.--generating activity with a specific activity of 260 nmol min-1 mg-1. O2.--generating activity is completely ablated by p-chloromercuribenzoate exposure. Preparations from normal unstimulated neutrophils or stimulated neutrophils from a male patient with chronic granulomatous disease had negligible amounts of this O2.--generating enzymatic activity. The dominant chromophore in this preparation was a b-type cytochrome, the spectral and functional characteristics of which are further described herein. Pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of the intrinsic cytochrome b closely parallels O2.- generation in this preparation. Specifically, reduction occurs in preparations from phorbal myristate acetate-stimulated neutrophils and is absent in unstimulated or stimulated p-chloromercuribenzoate-inactivated preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1564076413,"Fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) has been shown to specifically inactivate the Na+- and K+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase ((Na,K)-ATPase) at low concentrations (Karlish, S. J. D. (1979) Na+,K+ATPase Structure and Kinetics 115-128). The site of modification of purified dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase by FITC has been investigated by enzymatic cleavage and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The binding of FITC, which occurs at a stoichiometry of approximately one site per ATP binding site, causes an ATP-protectable inactivation of ATPase activity suggesting that it is reacting at the ATP hydrolysis site. The FITC reaction site apparently is located near the center of the COOH-terminal 77,000-dalton peptide fragment obtained by chymotryptic cleavage of the alpha subunit. Addition of ouabain to the native enzyme in the presence of chymotrypsin enhances cleavage at this site and releases the fluorescein moiety from the membrane. It is further shown that the distance from the FITC reaction site to the ouabain binding site, as judged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from anthroyl ouabain to FITC, is approximately 74 A. These results demonstrate that ouabain inhibits the (Na,K)-ATPase by causing a protein conformational change which extends an unusually large distance across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1551044207,"Administration of insulin in vivo provoked rapid (near maximal in 30 min) increases (65-90%) in the concentrations of phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, and polyphosphoinositides in rat adipose tissue. Insulin also increased phosphatidylinositol levels in adipocytes incubated in vitro. Dose-response relationships suggested that these effects of insulin were physiologically relevant. The enrichment of membranes with acidic phospholipids in the phosphatidate-inositide cycle may play a role in the action of insulin in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1548590032,"Rat liver membranes were subjected to centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient in which the Golgi apparatus was separated into several subfractions. Two enzymes involved in the synthesis of the phosphorylated recognition marker in lysosomal enzymes, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme precursor N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase and alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase fractionated with alpha-1,2-mannosidase, a marker enzyme of cis Golgi membranes and differently from galactosyltransferase, a marker enzyme of trans Golgi membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2082652433,"Endogenous phospholipase A2 activity of brain synaptic vesicles was Ca2+ -dependent and was increased by prostaglandin F2 alpha, calmodulin, adenosine 3', 5' -monophosphate, and adenosine triphosphate, whereas the activity was inhibited by prostaglandin E2 in the absence or presence of calmodulin. Light-scattering measurements demonstrated that stimulation of the enzyme's activity correlated with the induction of vesicle-vesicle aggregation. The effects of these compounds on endogenous synaptic vesicle phospholipase A2 activity may imply a common end point of their purported neuromodulatory actions, and indicate that synaptic vesicle phospholipase A2 may play a central role in presynaptic neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2017715943,"Two types of cell death occur in the intersegmental muscles of the giant silkmoth Antheraea polyphemus. The first results from a slow atrophy of the fibers, and the second is a rapid, programmed dissolution of the muscle. Both types appear to be mediated by endocrine factors. The slow atrophy is brought about by the decline in the steroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and can be prevented with exogenous steroid. The rapid degeneration is triggered by the peptide eclosion hormone, but the sensitivity of the muscle to the peptide depends on the history of exposure of the muscle to 20-hydroxyecdysone."
https://openalex.org/W2009116404,The giant interneurons from the nerve system of the cockroach Periplaneta americana exhibit a peculiar reciprocal synaptic interaction. The synaptic potentials are not blocked by addition of 5 millimolar cobalt chloride and have an extrapolated reversal potential close to 0 millivolt. Hyperpolarizing current injected into one cell does not spread to the other. Intracellular injection of tetraethylammonium ions into one giant interneuron increases the duration of the action potential of the injected cell to 30 milliseconds and reduces the rise time and amplitude of the postsynaptic response recorded in the other giant interneuron. These results indicate that the interaction between the interneurons is not mediated by conventional chemical or electrotonic synapses. All evidence points to generation of the potentials by localized increases in extracellular potassium concentrations as a consequence of firing of one neuron.
https://openalex.org/W1591764605,"We report the complete DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli elt A gene, which codes for the A subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin, LT. The amino acid sequence of the LT A subunit has been deduced from the DNA sequence of elt A. The LT A subunit starts with methionine, ends with leucine, and comprises 254 amino acids. The computed molecular weight of LT A is 29,673. The A subunit of cholera toxin (CT A) has been shown to be structurally and functionally related to the LT A subunit. Comparison of the primary structure of LT A with the known partial amino acid sequence of CT A indicates that the 2 polypeptides share considerable homology throughout their sequences. The NH2-terminal regions exhibit the highest degree of homology (91%), while the COOH-terminal region, containing the sole cystine residue in each toxin is less conserved (approximately 52%). Alignment of homologous residues in the COOH-terminal regions of LT A and CT A indicates that a likely site for proteolytic cleavage of LT A is after Arg residue 188. The resulting A2 polypeptide would be 46 amino acids long, would contain a single cysteine residue, and have Mr = 5261. The elt A nucleotide sequence further predicts that the LT A protein is synthesized in a precursor form, possessing an 18-amino acid signal sequence at its NH2 terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1994479113,"A reduce uptake and retention of the mitochondria-specific membrane potential probe rhodamine 123 by feline sarcoma virus (FeSV)-transformed mink fibroblasts (64F3) has been detected. The decreased accumulation of rhodamine 123 by 64F3 mitochondria is not due to abnormal plasma membrane dye permeability, since after microinjection of the dye these cells are still unable to retain the dye at levels comparable to the untransformed parental cells, CCL 64. Nigericin, an ionophore that mediates an electrically neutral exchange of protons for potassium ions resulting the elimination of the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane and a compensatory increase in mitochondrial membrane potential with continued respiration, increases both the dye uptake and the retention time in transformed 64F3 cells. These results suggest that mitochondria in FeSV-transformed mink cells may have an abnormally low mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by a relatively high pH gradient. Since anioic metabolites such as pyruvate and glutamate are accumulated by mitochondria in proportion to the delta pH across the mitochondrial membrane, the abnormal mitochondria described here may contribute to the abnormal metabolic state of FeSV-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1565037888,"A rapid increase in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was observed when freshly isolated hepatocytes derived from adult rats were established in primary monolayer culture. (ADP-ribose)n-degrading activity remained constant over a period of 48 h of culture. Inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity with pyridine derivatives, 3-aminobenzamide, theophylline, or thymidine, was accompanied by an enhanced DNA repair synthesis in response to the direct-acting carcinogen, methyl methanesulfonate, or UV irradiation. Three aminobenzamides differing only in the position of the amino group exhibited the same structure-activity relationship in regard to their action on DNA repair synthesis and ADP-ribosyltransferase. Spermine treatment of hepatocytes apparently had an inverse effect on both these cellular functions. The removal of DNA strand breaks following methyl methanesulfonate treatment was accelerated by inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferase. The results suggest that ADP-ribosylation interacts with late stages in the process of DNA repair. This interaction apparently is dependent on the nature of damage imposed on chromatin since repair synthesis in response to a number of carcinogens is unaffected by inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W1510970324,"Streptococcus sanguis, whose growth appears to be independent of the availability of iron, makes no hemes, contains neither catalase nor peroxidase, and can accumulate millimolar concentration levels of H2O2 during aerobic growth. It possesses a single manganese-containing superoxide dismutase whose concentration can be varied over a 50-100-fold range by manipulating the availability of oxygen during growth. Cell extracts contain a soluble NADH-plumbagin diaphorase which mediates O2- production in vitro and presumably also in vivo. Plumbagin increased oxygen consumption by S. sanguis and imposed an oxygen-dependent toxicity. Cells grown aerobically and containing elevated levels of superoxide dismutase were resistant to this toxicity. Dimethyl sulfoxide, which was shown to permeate S. sanguis freely, was used as an indicating scavenger of OH. An in vitro enzymic source of O2- plus H2O2 generated formaldehyde from dimethyl sulfoxide, an indication of OH. production. Either superoxide dismutase or catalase inhibited this OH. production and iron salts augmented it. Intact, aerobic cells of S. sanguis also gave evidence of OH. production, in the presence of plumbagin, but all of it appeared to be generated outside the cells. In addition, 0.5 M dimethyl sulfoxide did not diminish the oxygen-dependent toxicity of plumbagin. We conclude that, in S. sanguis, O2- can exert a toxic effect independent of the production of OH.."
https://openalex.org/W1575294415,"pBR322 DNA contains two separate regions on opposite strands and close to the origin of replication which, when in single-stranded form, can act as effectors for the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli replication factor Y. Small fragments of DNA containing these sites when cloned into an fl phage vector act as origins of DNA replication allowing the formation of complementary double-stranded DNA in a rifampicin-resistant, dnaB-, dnaG-, and dnaC-dependent fashion in vitro. We report here the maximal limits of the E. coli replication factor Y effector sites of pBR322 DNA. The site on the H strand of pBR322 DNA can form a structure resistant to digestion by E. coli exonuclease VII, the site on the L strand cannot. The H and L strand sites lie within nucleotides 2144-2185 and 2353-2416, respectively, of pBR322 DNA. A deletion of 34 nucleotides (nucleotides 2121-2154) within the H strand site renders it totally inactive as an effector for factor Y ATPase activity. No extensive homology could be detected between the three known factor Y effector sites, the two reported here and the one previously identified on the phi X174 viral DNA strand (Shlomai, J., and Kornberg, A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 799-803)."
https://openalex.org/W1535994471,"Human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been previously shown to stimulate low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in cultured cells. Studies were conducted to delineate in detail the effects of PDGF on the LDL receptor pathway in normal human fibroblasts and to explore relationships between the effects of PDGF on LDL metabolism, on cholesterol metabolism, and on DNA synthesis. Increasing concentrations of PDGF stimulated parallel increases in both DNA synthesis and 125I-LDL cell surface binding. The effect of PDGF was due entirely to an increase (up to 4.3-fold) in the number of receptor sites per cell, and not to a change in receptor affinity (Kd approximately 2.0 nM). Parallel PDGF concentration-dependent increases in 125I-LDL binding, internalization, and degradation at 37 degrees C were observed. The results indicate that PDGF-stimulated cells metabolize receptor-bound LDL in a manner that is identical with that seen with quiescent cells. A single study with highly purified PDGF demonstrated that it was PDGF itself, and not some other component in the partially purified PDGF preparation used in most of this work, that was responsible for the observed effects. Studies were conducted on the effects of PDGF on hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase activity, on cholesterol esterification, and on down-regulation by LDL of the LDL receptor. These studies indicated that LDL cholesterol taken into the PDGF-stimulated cell via the receptor pathway, appeared to become available normally and to have metabolic effects within the cell similar to those seen in quiescent cells. Fibroblasts from subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia showed a normal mitogenic response to PDGF, despite the absence or near absence of an effect on the LDL receptor pathway. Finally, studies were also conducted with endothelial cell-conditioned medium (ECCM), used as a source of the endothelial cell-derived growth factor. ECCM was similar to PDGF in stimulating LDL binding, but differed strikingly from PDGF in that the degradation of internalized LDL was inhibited. As a result, ECCM-treated cells did not effectively increase cholesterol esterification or suppress hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase activity when LDL was present. These findings with substances produced by endothelial cells may have important implications for atherogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2012283454,"Methylation mediated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine is required for the chemotaxis of mononuclear leukocytes. We investigated whether transmethylation reactions are required for normal functioning of chemotactic factor receptors. Three chemoatractant-mediated functions in macrophages, chemotaxis, the stimulated release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and superoxide production, are markedly depressed by agents that inhibit cellular methylation reactions. Treatment of macrophages with methylation inhibitors decreased the affinity of the N-formylated chemoattractant receptor present on these cells by a factor of 4.5, but did not significantly alter the total receptor on macrophages can exist in more than one affinity state and that an ongoing methylation reaction is required for the maintenance of the receptor in its higher affinity form. Inhibition of methylation lowers the affinity of the receptor and renders it nonfunctional or ""uncoupled"" in its ability to produce chemotaxis, superoxide and the release of a arachidonic acid from leukocyte membranes."

Restriction endonuclease cleavage maps on SP6 DNA for Ava II, Kpn I, Bgl II, Eco RI, and HindIII have been determined. SP6 DNA is transcribed selectively in vitro by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, predominantly from three strong promoter sites located near the left end of the standard physical map, reading rightward to a termination site near 6,000 base pairs. Transcription in vitro by purified SP6-specific RNA polymerase gives rise to at least 10 discrete RNA species, all of which are read rightward. Promoter sites for these species are located throughout the rightmost 90% of the SP6 DNA molecule, although precise mapping has not yet been carried out. The general form of the SP6 transcriptional map is similar to the T7- and T3-like phages, although no gross sequence homologies are evident from DNA-RNA hybridization experiments."

When [3H]hyaluronate was added to cultures of the two cell lines, four times more ligand was bound per mg of protein by the SV3T3 cells than by the 3T3 cells. Of the bound [3H] hyaluronate, 40% was degraded by the SV3T3 cells to oligosaccharides characteristic of the breakdown of hyaluronate, but only 2% was degraded by 3T3 cells. Hyaluronidase activity was found in the cell layer and medium of the SV3T3 cultures, but was not detectable in 3T3 cells. The SV3T3 enzyme was active only at acidic pH, but at neutral pH the secreted SV3T3 hyaluronidase was thermally more stable then the cell-associated enzyme. In contrast, both cell lines were found to contain similar amounts of beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. We conclude that the elevated capacity of SV3T3 cells to degrade hyaluronate may be partially responsible for their lack of the hyaluronate-containing pericellular coat which is prominent around 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529843512,"We have previously shown that the (Na+ and K+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase from canine kidney reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles is capable of K+-independent transport of Na+ against a concentration gradient (Forgac, M., and Chin, G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3645-3646). The Na+ dependence of the stoichiometry of this process has been investigated and suggests that Na+ ions can be bound and transported by the sites normally occupied by K+. Measurement of the membrane potential generated during active Na+ uptake by [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium ion distribution gave a value of 50 mV (positive inside). The electrogenicity of Na+ transport is sufficient to explain the observed uptake of an approximately equivalent amount of Cl-. We have also measured Na+ transport into reconstituted vesicles containing neither Na+ nor K+. Na+ uptake was half-maximal at an external Na+ concentration of 1 mM and was accompanied by a less than equivalent amount of Cl- uptake. In order to determine whether protons might also be moving in this system, the intravesicular pH was measured with the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 1-hydroxypyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid. Active Na+ uptake was accompanied by proton efflux, the amount of proton movement depending on the counterion present."
https://openalex.org/W1524968973,"Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine lung exhibits two distinct and specific binding sites for cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP bound to Site II dissociates very rapidly (t 1/2 less than 10 s at 0 or 30 degrees C) and requires the presence of ammonium sulfate in the wash buffer for its detection using cellulose ester filters. Both sites are highly specific for cyclic GMP and show affinities for cyclic GMP in the physiological range (less than 1 microM at 30 degrees C). Only cyclic GMP bound to the high affinity site (Site I) correlated with stimulation of histone kinase activity using arginine-rich histone as the substrate; however, both sites were involved with stimulation of histone kinase activity using mixed histones as the substrate. Stimulation of autophosphorylation by cyclic GMP was closely correlated with the binding of cyclic GMP to Site I."

https://openalex.org/W1528704167,"When purified with hydroxylapatite, bovine spleen purple acid phosphatase, bearing two iron atoms/molecule, is EPR-silent. In contrast, enzyme purified without hydroxylapatite exhibits the distinctive g' = 1.74 EPR signal characteristic of porcine uteroferrin, with an intensity accounting for about 10% of the total iron. The intensity of the signal is increased 8-fold by the addition of ferrous iron. This treatment, while shifting the visible absorption maximum of the protein from 550 to 525 nm, does not significantly alter the intensity of its visible absorption. Loss of the g' = 1.74 EPR signal upon addition of phosphate to EPR-active preparations and the detection of virtually stoichiometric amounts of phosphate in the protein as isolated suggest that phosphate-binding may abolish the g' = 1.75 EPR signal. Such binding may bring the two iron atoms of the enzyme into juxtaposition, causing loss of EPR signal intensity either through spin-lattice relaxation broadening or antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, perhaps involving phosphate or other ligands intercalated between the two paramagnetic iron atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2068019408,"Cytosolic fractions of frog heart homogenates contain large amounts of a soluble, large molecular weight protein that binds the specific neurotoxin saxitoxin with the same high affinity as does the plasma membrane. Another neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, which ordinarily is competitive with saxitoxin, does not displace saxitoxin from the cytosolic sites or from plasma membrane-enriched vesicular fractions even when its concentration exceeds that of saxitoxin by a factor of 1000. Thus, cytosolic sites are similar to membrane sites in this respect. The vesicular fraction accounts quantitatively for the amount of saxitoxin bound by whole ventricles, so that no appreciable losses seem to occur. Therefore, the cytosolic site probably is a membrane site precursor, although other possibilities cannot be ruled out. In any case, the occurrence of a soluble molecule closely related to the sodium channel provides opportunities for further study of the structure of the sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1528690987,"A rabbit liver protein kinase (PC0.7), able to phosphorylate glycogen synthase and phosvitin, has been extensively purified. The enzyme had apparent Mr = 170,000-190,000 as judged by gel filtration and was associated with two major polypeptide species, alpha (Mr = 43,000) and beta (Mr = 25,000). Two other polypeptides, Mr = 38,000 and Mr = 35,000, were also detected. Treatment with trypsin led to an enzyme composed only of polypeptides of Mr = 35,000 and Mr = 25,000. The beta-polypeptide underwent autophosphorylation when incubated with Mg2+ and ATP or GTP. The protein kinase was effective in utilizing both ATP and GTP as the phosphoryl donor (apparent Km values 5-11 microM and 9-19 microM, respectively). The enzyme phosphorylated phosvitin, casein, and glycogen synthase but not histone or phosphorylase and was inhibited by heparin. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase proceeded to approximately 0.5 phosphate/subunit with little inactivation of the glycogen synthase. The phosphorylation occurred predominantly in a 21,000-dalton CNBr fragment of glycogen synthase that had been previously shown to reside toward the COOH terminus of the molecule. The liver PC0.7 appeared very similar to an analogous enzyme isolated from rabbit muscle (DePaoli-Roach, A. A., Ahmad, Z., and Roach, P. J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8955-8962). The present work, therefore, provides a point of contact between the Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotide-independent glycogen synthase kinases of rabbit liver and muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2050246811,Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus was isolated from the soft-shelled tick (Ornithodoros coriaceus). Serological identification of the isolated viruses was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion of purified virus DNA. These isolations indicate that the soft-shelled tick may be a vector for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus. This may be the first reported isolation of mammalian herpesvirus from an arthropod vector.

https://openalex.org/W1527536137,"Abstract We have previously shown that crude bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations markedly increase cGMP levels in rat fetal liver cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. To provide evidence that this effect was due to LPS and not an impurity in the preparations, three series of experiments were undertaken. First, LPS was prepared from Escherichia coli 055:B5 cells and its cGMP potency assessed at various stages of purification; second, the cGMP activity of three highly purified LPS preparations of known chemical structure was measured, and third, a well characterized LPS was broken into its lipid A and polysaccharide fractions and the cGMP activity of each fraction determined. The results showed that the cGMP stimulatory activity in E. coli 055:B5 cells co-purified in a parallel fashion with the LPS molecule derived from those cells, that the three chemically defined, highly purified LPS preparations were all very potent stimulators of cGMP levels, and that the ability to increase cGMP levels of lipid A prepared from a highly purified LPS was comparable in potency to the intact LPS, whereas the polysaccharide portion of the molecule was without activity. These findings indicate that the cGMP effect of LPS preparation is due to LPS and not a contaminant and that the activity resides within the lipid A moiety of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1506933953,"The refolding of reduced ribonuclease A has been studied by measurements of enzymatic activity under conditions where the oxidation of thiol groups into disulfide bonds is rather slow. The sensitivity to a treatment by N-ethylmaleimide has been used to distinguish between partially and totally oxidized active species. It is found that the first active protein molecules to be formed do not have all of their disulfide bonds. Because they are active, these partially oxidized intermediates probably have very close to native conformation, which they can reach without being trapped in a wrong structure by forming too many incorrect disulfide bonds. The significance of these intermediates to the refolding pathway of reduced ribonuclease is discussed."
