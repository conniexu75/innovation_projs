https://openalex.org/W1994674028,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, can be caused by a mutation on either chromosome 19q13 (DM1) or 3q21 (DM2/PROMM). DM1 is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica–protein kinase gene ( DMPK ). Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain how this mutation, which does not alter the protein-coding portion of a gene, causes the specific constellation of clinical features characteristic of DM. We now report that DM2 is caused by a CCTG expansion (mean ∼5000 repeats) located in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 ( ZNF9 ) gene. Parallels between these mutations indicate that microsatellite expansions in RNA can be pathogenic and cause the multisystemic features of DM1 and DM2."
https://openalex.org/W2086068316,"The interactive regulation between clock genes is central for oscillator function. Here, we show interactions between the Arabidopsis clock genes LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1). The MYB transcription factors LHY and CCA1 negatively regulate TOC1 expression. We show that both proteins bind to a region in the TOC1 promoter that is critical for its clock regulation. Conversely, TOC1 appears to participate in the positive regulation of LHY and CCA1 expression. Our results indicate that these interactions form a loop critical for clock function in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W1978976893,"An early event in RNA interference (RNAi) is the cleavage of the initiating double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to short pieces, 21 to 23 nucleotides in length. Here we describe a null mutation in dicer-1 ( dcr-1 ), a gene proposed to encode the enzyme that generates these short RNAs. We find that dcr-1 (−/−) animals have defects in RNAi under some, but not all, conditions. Mutant animals have germ line defects that lead to sterility, suggesting that cleavage of dsRNA to short pieces is a requisite event in normal development."
https://openalex.org/W1990564460,"We report on the direct observation of an oscillating atomic current in a one-dimensional array of Josephson junctions realized with an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. The array is created by a laser standing wave, with the condensates trapped in the valleys of the periodic potential and weakly coupled by the interwell barriers. The coherence of multiple tunneling between adjacent wells is continuously probed by atomic interference. The square of the small-amplitude oscillation frequency is proportional to the microscopic tunneling rate of each condensate through the barriers and provides a direct measurement of the Josephson critical current as a function of the intermediate barrier heights. Our superfluid array may allow investigation of phenomena so far inaccessible to superconducting Josephson junctions and lays a bridge between the condensate dynamics and the physics of discrete nonlinear media."
https://openalex.org/W2094112735,"Detection of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities in the urine from patients with a variety of cancers has been closely correlated to disease status. Among these activities, the presence of a group of high molecular weight (HMW) MMPs independently serves as a multivariate predictor of the metastatic phenotype (). The identity of these HMW MMP activities has remained unknown despite their novelty and their potentially important applications in non-invasive cancer diagnosis and/or prognosis. Here, we report the identification of one of these HMW urinary MMPs of approximately 125-kDa as being a complex of gelatinase B (MMP-9) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Multiple biochemical approaches verified this identity. Analysis using substrate gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the 125-kDa urinary MMP activity co-migrates with purified human neutrophil MMP-9 x NGAL complex. The 125-kDa urinary MMP-9 x NGAL complex was recognized by a purified antibody against human NGAL as well as by a monospecific anti-human MMP-9 antibody. Furthermore, these same two antibodies were independently capable of specifically immunoprecipitating the 125-kDa urinary MMP activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the complex of MMP-9 x NGAL could be reconstituted in vitro by mixing MMP-9 and NGAL in gelatinase buffers with pH values in the range of urine and in normal urine as well. Finally, the biochemical consequences of the NGAL and MMP-9 interaction were investigated both in vitro using recombinant human NGAL and MMP-9 and in cell culture by overexpressing NGAL in human breast carcinoma cells. Our data demonstrate that NGAL is capable of protecting MMP-9 from degradation in a dose-dependent manner and thereby preserving MMP-9 enzymatic activity. In summary, this study identifies the 125-kDa urinary gelatinase as being a complex of MMP-9 and NGAL and provides evidence that NGAL modulates MMP-9 activity by protecting it from degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2075626220,"Transgenic crops producing insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely used for pest control. Bt-resistant insect strains have been studied, but the molecular basis of resistance has remained elusive. Here, we show that disruption of a cadherin-superfamily gene by retrotransposon-mediated insertion was linked to high levels of resistance to the Bt toxin Cry1Ac in the cotton pest Heliothis virescens. Monitoring the early phases of Bt resistance evolution in the field has been viewed as crucial but extremely difficult, especially when resistance is recessive. Our findings enable efficient DNA-based screening for resistant heterozygotes by directly detecting the recessive allele."
https://openalex.org/W1972615373,"The low O2 content of the Archean atmosphere implies that methane should have been present at levels approximately 10(2) to 10(3) parts per million volume (ppmv) (compared with 1.7 ppmv today) given a plausible biogenic source. CH4 is favored as the greenhouse gas that countered the lower luminosity of the early Sun. But abundant CH4 implies that hydrogen escapes to space (upward arrow space) orders of magnitude faster than today. Such reductant loss oxidizes the Earth. Photosynthesis splits water into O2 and H, and methanogenesis transfers the H into CH4. Hydrogen escape after CH4 photolysis, therefore, causes a net gain of oxygen [CO2 + 2H2O --> CH4 + 2O2 --> CO2 + O2 + 4H(upward arrow space)]. Expected irreversible oxidation (approximately 10(12) to 10(13) moles oxygen per year) may help explain how Earth's surface environment became irreversibly oxidized."
https://openalex.org/W1996218285,"One of the most dominant influences in the patterning of multicellular embryos is exerted by the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins. Here, we identify a segment polarity gene in Drosophila melanogaster, skinny hedgehog (ski), and show that its product is required in Hh-expressing cells for production of appropriate signaling activity in embryos and in the imaginal precursors of adult tissues. The ski gene encodes an apparent acyltransferase, and we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Hh proteins from ski mutant cells retain carboxyl-terminal cholesterol modification but lack amino-terminal palmitate modification. Our results suggest that ski encodes an enzyme that acts within the secretory pathway to catalyze amino-terminal palmitoylation of Hh, and further demonstrate that this lipid modification is required for the embryonic and larval patterning activities of the Hh signal."
https://openalex.org/W1994975574,"In the oligotrophic North Atlantic and North Pacific, ultrafiltration studies show that concentrations of soluble iron and soluble iron-binding organic ligands are much lower than previously presumed “dissolved” concentrations, which were operationally defined as that passing through a 0.4-micrometer pore filter. Our studies indicate that substantial portions of the previously presumed “dissolved” iron (and probably also iron-binding ligands) are present in colloidal size range. The soluble iron and iron-binding organic ligands are depleted at the surface and enriched at depth, similar to distributions of major nutrients. By contrast, colloidal iron shows a maximum at the surface and a minimum in the upper nutricline. Our results suggest that “dissolved” iron may be less bioavailable to phytoplankton than previously thought and that iron removal through colloid aggregation and settling should be considered in models of the oceanic iron cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1967445973,"Most striatal and cortical interneurons arise from the basal telencephalon, later segregating to their respective targets. Here, we show that migrating cortical interneurons avoid entering the striatum because of a chemorepulsive signal composed at least in part of semaphorin 3A and semaphorin 3F. Migrating interneurons expressing neuropilins, receptors for semaphorins, are directed to the cortex; those lacking them go to the striatum. Loss of neuropilin function increases the number of interneurons that migrate into the striatum. These observations reveal a mechanism by which neuropilins mediate sorting of distinct neuronal populations into different brain structures, and provide evidence that, in addition to guiding axons, these receptors also control neuronal migration in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2063076489,"Signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family members is mediated by Smad proteins that regulate gene transcription through functional cooperativity and association with other DNA-binding proteins. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a transcriptional complex that plays a key role in oxygen-regulated gene expression. We demonstrate that hypoxia and TGF-β cooperate in the induction of the promoter activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a major stimulus in the promotion of angiogenesis. This cooperation has been mapped on the human VEGF promoter within a region at −1006 to −954 that contains functional DNA-binding sequences for HIF-1 and Smads. Optimal HIF-1α-dependent induction of the VEGF promoter was obtained in the presence of Smad3, suggesting an interaction between these proteins. Consistent with this, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HIF-1α physically associates with Smad3. These results demonstrate that both TGF-β and hypoxia signaling pathways can synergize in the regulation of VEGF gene expression at the transcriptional level.

Based on structural and functional characteristics, Smads fall into the following three different families: (i) Smad substrates of the signaling TGF-β receptor family of Ser/Thr kinases (Smad1–3, -5, or -8), also known as receptor-regulated Smads; (ii) common Smads that associate with the phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads and then translocate into the nucleus as a heteromeric complex (Smad4); and (iii) inhibitory Smads that antagonize Smad signaling (Smad6 and -7). In the nucleus, Smads regulate transcriptional responses through functional cooperativity and physical interactions with different transcription factors, whose activity can be modulated by other signaling pathways. Thus, Smad2 associates with the winged helix proteins Fast-1 and Fast-2 to stimulate the Xenopus Mix-2and mouse goosecoid promoter activities (5Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M.

In summary, Smads regulate TGF-β-dependent gene expression by recruiting co-activators and co-repressors to a wide array of DNA-binding partners, thus functioning as transcriptional co-modulators. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a transcriptional complex with a crucial role in oxygen-regulated gene expression (26Ratcliffe P.J. O'Rourke J.F. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. J. Exp.

Among hypoxia-regulated genes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prototypic example because it plays a critical role in angiogenesis, a process that regulates oxygen access to tissues (35Forsythe J.A.

A major hypoxia-responsive enhancer was identified as a 28-base pair sequence located at 900 base pairs upstream from the CAP site of the VEGF promoter region (38Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S.

Independent lines of investigation have shown that TGF-β (40Pepper M.S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) or hypoxia (41Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3432) Google Scholar) is able to regulate angiogenesis, a process where VEGF plays a critical role. By using the VEGF promoter as a model system, we have investigated the putative cooperation between hypoxia and TGF-β. These two different signaling pathways were able to synergize in stimulating VEGF transcription, and accordingly, a functional cooperation and physical interaction between Smad and HIF-1α transcription factors could be demonstrated. The human endothelial HMEC-1, the rat myoblast L6E9, the human hepatoma HepG2 and Hep3B, the human epithelioid carcinoma HeLa, the monkey kidney COS, and the human colon adenocarcinoma SW480.7 cell lines were cultured in MCD131, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C, as described previously (9Zhang Y.

Hypoxic exposure was carried out under 1% oxygen, 5% CO2, and 94% nitrogen (AL Air Liquide España) for 24 (promoter activity assays) or 4 h (DNA-protein and protein-protein interaction assays). In some cases, chemical hypoxia was carried out by an overnight treatment in the presence of 100 µmdeferrioxamine (Sigma). Unless otherwise indicated, treatment of cells with recombinant human TGF-β1 (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was performed at a concentration of 200 pm in culture medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal calf serum. Hep3B cells before confluency were preincubated for 48 h with serum-free medium. Then the culture medium was replaced by fresh serum-free medium containing or not containing 200 pm TGF-β1. At time 0, cells were incubated under normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions for 3–72 h. The medium was removed at the indicated time points and stored at −80 °C until assayed. VEGF concentrations were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (R & D Systems), following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples from three different experiments were analyzed in triplicate, and the mean and S.D. were calculated. Total RNA from human hepatoma Hep3B and endothelial HMEC-1 cells was isolated using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (10 µg) were denatured, fractionated in 1.1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were hybridized in 50% formamide at 42 °C with excess32P-labeled probe and washed under high stringency conditions (0.2× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 52 °C).

Transfection of L6E9, HepG2, HeLa, and COS cells was carried out using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SW480.7 cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. Cells in 24-well plates were transfected with the appropriate reporter and/or expression vectors at densities of 5 × 104 cells/well. When the reporter vector was co-transfected with expression vectors, the amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized by using the corresponding insertless expression vector as carrier. Relative luciferase units from duplicate samples were determined in a TD20/20 Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI) with a sensitivity range of 0.05–10,000. Each transfection experiment was performed at least three times with different DNA preparations. Correction for transfection efficiency was made by co-transfection with the β-galactosidase expression vector pCMV-β-galactosidase, and the corresponding enzymatic activity was determined using the Galacto-Light kit (Tropix). The mean and S.D. were calculated, and experimental results of the promoter constructs were displayed either as arbitrary units of luciferase activity or as a fold induction to the corresponding untreated sample.

Binding reactions were performed in 20 µl with 2 µg of poly- (dI-dC) in a buffer containing 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, on ice for 30 min. When required, samples were supplemented with anti-human HIF-1α (mAb OZ 12+15; Lab Vision Corp.), anti-human HIF-1β (mAb 2B10; Alexis Biochemicals), anti-human Smad3, or anti-human Smad4 (I-20 and H-552, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were electrophoresed on a 4.5–7.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 175 V for 3 h. For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides were incubated in the reaction mixture. Competitor oligonucleotides corresponding to the human VEGF promoter are as follows: the wild type −1006/−954; −1006/−954-HM mutated at the consensus HIF-1 site −973/−971 (AAA by CGT); −1006/−954-SM, mutated at the consensus Smad site −992/−987 (AAAAA by CAGAC); −1006/−954-FM mutated at positions −984/−978 (AAAAATA by CACAGTG) and −961/−956 (TATTTT by CAGGTC); and the wild type −985/−954 lacking the consensus Smad site at −992. EMSAs were repeated at least three times with similar results, and representative experiments are shown in the corresponding figures. For DNAP experiments, COS cells were transfected with the expression vectors encoding HIF-1α, FLAG-Smad3, or the constitutively activated form of the TGF-β receptor type I (TβRI). Transfected cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and lysed by sonication. Cell extracts were incubated with 200 ng of double-stranded biotinylated −1006/−954 oligonucleotide, and DNA-protein complexes were isolated by centrifugation with ImmunoPure streptavidin-agarose (Pierce). Complexed proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the presence of HIF-1α and Smad3 was revealed with specific monoclonal antibodies using a chemiluminescence assay. DNAP experiments were repeated at least four times with similar results, and a representative experiment is shown in the corresponding figure. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with the appropriate expression vectors, and 48 h later, cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-human HIF-1α (mAb OZ 12+15, Lab Vision Corp.) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For GST pull-downs, GST fusion constructs of full-length Smad3, Smad3-MH1 (amino acids 1–144), Smad3-MH2 (amino acids 199–440), and Smad3-NC (non-conserved linker region; amino acids 145–234) were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro transcription/translation GST pull-downs with in vitro transcribed and translated HIF-1α or HIF-1β in pcDNA3 were conducted as described (9Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Basically, HIF-1α or HIF-1β labeled with [35S]Met were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound fusion proteins on ice for 2 h. Beads were washed five times in wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), and specifically bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Western blot analysis, cell extracts, DNAP, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Filters were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h. Specific immunodetection was carried out by incubation with anti-HIF-1α (mAb 54, Becton Dickinson; mAb H1α67, Novus Biologicals), anti-Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig at room temperature. The presence of antigens was revealed using a chemiluminescence assay (Supersignal detection kit, Pierce). Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results, and representative experiments are shown in the corresponding figures. To determine whether TGF-β and hypoxia-triggered pathways could collaborate to induce VEGF gene expression, human Hep3B cells were chosen because they have been shown to stimulate production of VEGF in response to hypoxic conditions (35Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3178) Google Scholar). Thus, Hep3B cells were incubated in hypoxic or normoxic conditions, with or without TGF-β, and the culture supernatants were assayed for secreted VEGF protein by ELISA (Fig. 1A). Hypoxia, and to a lower extent TGF-β, enhanced the production of VEGF, particularly to untreated cells under normoxic conditions. Thus, at 72 h, VEGF secretion was increased 44% with hypoxia and 20% with TGF-β, whereas the combined treatment of hypoxia/TGF-β resulted in a much higher production (146% increase) of VEGF. To investigate whether this collaboration was also present at the VEGF transcript level, Hep3B and endothelial cells were incubated with TGF-β1 under normoxic or hypoxic (1% oxygen) atmospheres; total RNA was extracted, and VEGF transcripts were analyzed by Northern blot (Fig.1B). VEGF mRNA levels were found to be almost unaffected in response to TGF-β and moderately increased upon hypoxia treatment, whereas the simultaneous stimulation with both TGF-β and hypoxia showed a marked synergistic effect. To assess whether this collaborative effect was taking place at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the activity of the human VEGF promoter region (38Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 39Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we used a reporter construct containing the 5′-flanking region of the human VEGF gene promoter (−1910/+379), fused to the luciferase gene. This VEGF promoter construct contains the hypoxia-response element (HRE) located at −975/−968, where HIF-1α binds to mediate hypoxia induction of VEGF (35Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3178) Google Scholar). For transfection experiments with promoter constructs, the myoblast cell line L6E9 was chosen because preliminary experiments in our laboratory demonstrated a relatively high efficiency of transfection, as well as reproducible and comparable responses to hypoxia and TGF-β as individual stimuli; also, muscle cells are known to be a major source VEGF in vivo (45Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, transient transfection experiments demonstrated induction of the VEGF promoter activity in the presence of either TGF-β (1.8-fold) or hypoxia (2.7-fold), whereas the simultaneous presence of both stimuli resulted in a significant cooperative effect (7.3-fold induction). In a parallel experiment, protein levels of HIF-1α were stimulated by hypoxia but were not affected by the TGF-β treatment (Fig. 1C, lower panel), excluding the possibility of a TGF-β-dependent induction of HIF-1α as responsible for the VEGF activation. These results suggest that the collaboration between TGF-β and hypoxia has a transcriptional control basis. TGF-β and hypoxia signaling pathways mediate their transcriptional regulation mainly through Smads (2Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3ten Dijke P.

Biol. 1998; 201: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar, 28Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) transcription complexes, respectively. Thus, the involvement of these transcription factors in the TGF-β/hypoxia collaboration was analyzed. In order to elucidate the participation of Smad proteins, co-transfection experiments of the human VEGF promoter construct with expression vectors coding for different Smad members that could mediate this effect, namely Smad2, Smad3, and the co-smad Smad4, were carried out (Fig.2A). The VEGF promoter activity was found to be increased significantly by Smads under normoxic conditions (between 1.4- and 3-fold induction), and it was markedly augmented in hypoxia. Smad3 (4.7-fold), and to a lower extent Smad2 (2.5-fold) and Smad4 (2.7-fold), clearly increased the hypoxia-dependent induction, either in the presence or in the absence of TGF-β. As expected, the strongest activation was observed when Smad3 and Smad4 were co-expressed under hypoxic conditions, yielding a 6.3-fold stimulation. Thus, this Smad3/Smad4 combination was selected for future studies. Next, we analyzed the participation of HIF-1 by co-transfection of the VEGF promoter construct with an expression vector coding for HIF-1α (Fig.2B). HIF-1α expression was able to synergize with TGF-β resulting in an enhanced VEGF promoter activity. Furthermore, in the presence of several combinations of Smad3/Smad4, HIF-1α expression markedly increased the VEGF promoter activity. The strongest HIF1α-dependent response was observed in the presence of Smad3/Smad4 with or without TGF-β. These results demonstrate that cooperation between TGF-β and hypoxia is mediated at the transcriptional level by the cooperation between Smads and HIF-1α proteins. Within the human VEGF promoter, the major HRE motif, responsible for HIF-1 binding, has been localized at −975/−968 (35Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3178) Google Scholar). By contrast, to our knowledge, no specific binding motifs for Smad proteins have been reported within the VEGF promoter. To analyze further the mechanism of synergy between Smads and HIF-1α, we focused our attention on the HRE element at −975/−968 and its flanking sequences. Thus, fragment −1006/−954 containing not only the HRE element at −975/−968 but also the flanking sequence GCCAGACT encoding the putative Smad-binding motifs GNCNGNCN (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr.

Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) was used to synthesize the promoter construct 2HRE-LUC (Fig. 3A). This construct contains the dimerized −1006/−954 fragment from the VEGF promoter fused to a minimal TATA promoter and the luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 3B, the promoter activity of 2HRE-LUC clearly reproduced in myoblasts the sy"

Using DNA microarrays to analyze interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine FL5.12 pro-B cells, we found that the gene undergoing maximal transcriptional induction after cytokine withdrawal is 24p3, which encodes a secreted lipocalin. Conditioned medium from IL-3-deprived FL5.12 cells contained 24p3 and induced apoptosis in naive FL5.12 cells even when IL-3 was present. 24p3 also induced apoptosis in a wide variety of leukocytes but not other cell types. Apoptotic sensitivity correlated with the presence of a putative 24p3 cell surface receptor. We conclude that IL-3 deprivation activates 24p3 transcription, leading to synthesis and secretion of 24p3, which induces apoptosis through an autocrine pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2005165257,"The yeast Snf1 kinase and its metazoan orthologues, the AMP-activated protein kinases, are activated in response to nutrient limitation. Activation requires the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of the catalytic subunit. A phosphopeptide antibody was generated that specifically recognizes Snf1 protein that is phosphorylated in its activation loop on threonine 210. Using this reagent, we show that phosphorylation of threonine 210 correlates with Snf1 activity, since it is detected in cells subjected to glucose limitation but not in cells grown in abundant glucose. A Snf1 mutant completely lacking kinase activity was phosphorylated normally on threonine 210 in glucose-starved cells, eliminating the possibility that the threonine 210 modification is due to an autophosphorylation event. Cells lacking the Reg1 protein, a regulatory subunit for the Glc7 phosphatase, showed constitutive phosphorylation of Snf1 threonine 210. Exposure of cells to high concentrations of sodium chloride also induced phosphorylation of Snf1. Interestingly, Mig1, a downstream target of Snf1 kinase, is phosphorylated in glucose-stressed but not sodium-stressed cells. Finally, cells lacking the γ subunit of the Snf1 kinase complex encoded by the SNF4 gene exhibited normal regulation of threonine 210 phosphorylation in response to glucose limitation but are unable to phosphorylate Mig1 efficiently.

AMP-activated protein kinase hemagglutinin The Snf1 and AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK)1 define a highly conserved family of serine-threonine protein kinases found in fungi, plants, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals. Members of the Snf1-AMPK family are central components of signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to nutrient stress (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The Snf1-AMPK enzymes are heterotrimers with a single catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits denoted β and γ (2Davies S.P. Hawley S.A. Woods A. Carling D. Haystead T.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4936-4943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stapleton D. Gao G. Michell B.J.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Snf1 kinase plays a critical role when glucose becomes limiting. The net effect of Snf1 kinase activation is to down-regulate certain enzymes to conserve ATP energy and to relieve glucose repression of gene expression. Downstream targets of Snf1 include metabolic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (5Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Gao G. House C. Michell B. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4936-4943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). While there has been tremendous progress made in our understanding of glucose sensing and signal transduction (9Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), it is still unclear how glucose limitation is sensed and the information transduced to Snf1. Intracellular concentration of AMP, by analogy with the mammalian enzyme, is a good candidate for the signaling molecule, yet AMP has no effect on Snf1 kinase activity in vitro (6Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). While AMP might not activate Snf1 directly, it is still possible that AMP might activate the Snf1 pathway by acting upstream of Snf1. To understand the regulation of Snf1 kinase, it is necessary to determine the number and identity of the regulators acting upstream of Snf1. A common regulatory switch observed in protein kinases is the phosphorylation of one or more residues in the activation loop of the catalytic subunit. In the unphosphorylated state, the activation loop can block access of substrates to the active site (11Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop causes a large outward rotation of the activation loop, thus making the active site accessible to substrate and aligning active site residues for catalysis (12Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 13Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In many instances, the phosphorylation of one kinase is catalyzed by a distinct upstream kinase, thereby creating kinase cascades. The mitogen-activated protein kinases are held in a physical complex with their upstream activating kinases, thereby routing molecular signals through insulated cascades (14Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Several members of the AGC group of protein kinases (protein kinase family including protein kinase A, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C), a group named after the protein kinases PKA, PKG, and PKC (15Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar), are known to be phosphorylated by the phosphotidylinositol-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 (16Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism for the modification of activation loop residues is autophosphorylation, either intermolecular or intramolecular. While PDK-1 phosphorylates the activation loop of other kinases, the phosphorylation of its own activation loop is most likely due to autophosphorylation, since it is observed with recombinant protein in the absence of all other mammalian kinases (18Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Many of the Src family tyrosine kinases are activated by intermolecular autophosphorylation of residues in the activation loop (19Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Sato K. Aoto M. Mori K. Akasofu S. Tokmakov A.A. Sahara S. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13250-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In yet another variation on this theme, proteins can bind to the activation loop to exert control over kinase activity. In the case of TAK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), intramolecular autophosphorylation of the activation loop is stimulated by the binding of the TAB1 protein (21Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the case of the JAK family of kinases, binding of the activation loop by the JAB protein inhibits kinase activity (22Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Thus, many different mechanisms of regulating protein kinase activity are mediated through events at the activation loop. The activity of the Snf1 protein kinase, a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase family of serine/threonine protein kinases (15Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar), is also regulated by phosphorylation (10Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of Snf1 kinase is at position 210. The first suggestion that this residue was important for Snf1 regulation came from the finding that a threonine to alanine mutation at position 210 inactivated the Snf1 kinase (23Estruch F. Treitel M.A. Yang X. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 132: 639-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study documented that threonine 210 was essential for Snf1 activity but did not address whether or not threonine 210 was modified. A subsequent study by Hardie and colleagues (10Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) showed that Snf1 kinase activity measured in vitro was greatly reduced by phosphatase treatment. This study indicated that the phosphorylation of Snf1 was essential for catalytic activity but did not identify the site(s) of modification. However, these studies and the numerous parallels with other protein kinases strongly suggested that the Snf1 kinase is activated by phosphorylation on threonine 210 and possibly other sites as well. The down-regulation of Snf1 kinase by dephosphorylation is almost certainly catalyzed by the PP1 phosphatase Glc7 in complex with the regulatory subunit Reg1 (24Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Studies of the mammalian orthologue of Snf1, AMPK, have shown that its regulation is mediated by multiple phosphorylation events, the most important one being at the conserved threonine residue in the activation loop (26Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of rat liver extracts have identified an activity that is responsible for the phosphorylation of AMPK (27Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The activating enzyme, called AMP-activated protein kinase kinase (AMPK kinase), is likely to be distinct from AMPK based on differences in chromatographic properties, response to allosteric regulation by AMP, and inactivation by phosphatase treatment. However, AMPK and AMPK kinase are very similar in size, and until the AMPK kinase is characterized at the molecular level, one cannot rule out the possibility that AMPK kinase is a modified form of AMPK itself. The focus of this study is on the Snf1 signaling pathway in yeast. While genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that the Snf1 kinase is regulated by phosphorylation on threonine 210, genetic screens for Snf mutants have failed to detect any kinases that could act upstream of Snf1 kinase. One possible explanation for the failure to identify the Snf1-activating kinase genetically is that it may not exist. The Snf1 protein could be activated by an autophosphorylation mechanism. For instance, the Snf1 reactivating factor identified by Wilson et al. (10Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) could represent a protein that binds Snf1 and stimulates an autophosphorylation event similar to the effect of TAB1 protein on TAK1 kinase (21Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the failure to identify a Snf1-activating kinase genetically is that more than one kinase may be capable of phosphorylating Snf1. Thus, in genetic screens for loss of function alleles, redundant Snf1-activating kinases would complement each other and never be detected. To further define the Snf1 signaling pathway, we have developed an assay to measure the phosphorylation of Snf1 kinase on threonine 210. The combination of genetics with an immunological assay for threonine 210 phosphorylation has allowed us to unambiguously determine that the Snf1 kinase is regulated by an upstream kinase. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table I. Except where indicated, growth of yeast utilized standard medium at 30 °C (28Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

Glucose and raffinose were present at 2% (g/100 ml) except for derepressing medium, which contained 0.05% glucose (g/100 ml). Antimycin A was included at 1 μg/ml in all raffinose media. Transformation of yeast strains utilized the lithium acetate procedure (29Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Repressed cultures were grown in 2% glucose and harvested in mid-log phase at an A600 of 0.4–0.8. Derepressed cultures were prepared by resuspending repressed cells in medium containing 0.05% glucose and continuing growth for an additional 2 h.Table IS. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeSource or referenceMSY182MATaura3–52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 his3Δ200Ganster et al.(36Ganster R.W.

McCartney R.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4936-4943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Snf1 protein was epitope-tagged by polymerase chain reaction-amplifying three copies of the HA epitope present in plasmid pMR2307 (30Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) with primers containingEcoRI sites at the termini. The tag was then inserted into the naturally occurring MunI site, which partially overlaps the Snf1 stop codon. The resulting construct encodes full-length Snf1 protein with these additional amino acids added to the C terminus: SYPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPDYAGSYPYDVPDYAA. Antibodies directed against phosphorylated threonine 210 were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). A 13-mer peptide (DGNFLK[T-PO4]SCGSPN) corresponding to amino acids 204–216 of Snf1 protein was synthesized such that the central threonine residue was phosphothreonine. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin and used to immunize two rabbits. Sera were pooled, and antibodies were purified by two sequential steps of affinity chromatography. First, antibodies that bound to a phosphopeptide column were purified. Next, antibodies that bound to a column containing the unphosphorylated peptide were removed. The collection of antibodies resulting from these affinity selections are referred to as the α-PT210 antibodies. Protein extracts were prepared using a glass bead lysis procedure (31Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wolfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in NHTG buffer (40 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 350 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of benzamidine, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. For analysis of Thr210 phosphorylation, protein extracts were prepared using a modification of the NaOH extraction procedure developed by Kushnirov (32Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Cell cultures (25 ml) were grown to anA600 of 0.5–0.8. NaOH was added directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.1 m, and cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation and proteins extracted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (10 μl per OD of cells) for 5 min. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was recovered and extensively dialyzed against an excess of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 50 mmsodium fluoride and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Protein recovery following dialysis was typically 1.75 mg of protein from a 25-ml culture. Western blots were performed using the method described previously (31Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wolfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against the HA epitope were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a dilution of 1:1000. Affinity-purified α-PT210 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000. For immunoprecipitations, 300–500 μg of protein was incubated with 2 μl of anti-HA for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml chymostatin). Immune complexes were collected by low speed centrifugation following incubation with 20 μl of protein A beads (Sigma) that had been washed in RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved on an SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting with either anti-HA or α-PT210 antibodies (31Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wolfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All Western blotting experiments have been repeated at least twice with extracts from independent transformants and have produced comparable results. A representative exposure of one blot is shown. The Snf1 kinase is required by yeast for the fermentation of sucrose and the related trisaccharide raffinose (33Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Strains that carry the deletion allele snf1Δ10 manifest a pronounced growth defect on raffinose medium that can be complemented by a plasmid-encoded SNF1 gene that bears three copies of the HA epitope at the C terminus (Fig.1A). The point mutation K84R eliminates the catalytic activity of Snf1 kinase by disrupting the ATP binding domain (34Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The K84R mutation was engineered in the epitope-tagged SNF1 gene and tested for the ability to complement the snf1Δ10 deletion for growth on raffinose. The K84R mutation completely blocks the ability of the plasmid-encoded gene to complement; however, the accumulation of the K84R-Snf1 protein, as judged by Western blot directed against the HA tag, is unaffected (Fig. 1B). In a similar manner, a mutation that converts the activation loop threonine to the nonphosphorylatable residue alanine was engineered and tested. The T210A allele of SNF1 was also completely unable to complement the snf1Δ10 deletion for the fermentation of raffinose, but this mutation had no effect on protein levels as judged by Western blot. The affects of these two point mutations on Snf1 kinase activity have been reported previously (23Estruch F. Treitel M.A. Yang X. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 132: 639-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We show here that these two mutations inactivate the Snf1 kinase without affecting protein levels. Thus, these alleles are suitable for further studies to probe the regulation of Snf1 activity. To study the activation of the Snf1 kinase, we sought a reagent that could specifically detect Snf1 protein that had been phosphorylated on threonine 210. A 13-residue synthetic peptide, corresponding to amino acids 204–216 of Snf1 and containing phosphothreonine at position 210, was synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. Antibodies that recognized the phosphorylated peptide were affinity-purified and used in Western blotting experiments. A functional HA-tagged Snf1 protein was collected by immunoprecipitation and resolved on an SDS gel. When anti-HA monoclonal was used to probe the blot, equivalent levels of Snf1 protein were detected in extracts expressing wild type Snf1 or the T210A mutant (Fig.2B, lanes 1 and2). However, when the α-PT210 antibodies were used, the wild type, but not the T210A mutant, was detected. When the extracts were pretreated with either calf intestine alkaline phosphatase or λ-phosphatase, the α-PT210 antibodies were no longer able to detect the Snf1 protein (Fig. 2, lanes 3–7). Pretreatment with phosphatase did not alter Snf1 reactivity with the HA monoclonal antibody. Therefore the α-PT210 antibodies detected Snf1 protein only when threonine 210 was present and only when the endogenous phosphorylations were left intact. When combined with the knowledge of the immunogen, the simplest conclusion is that the α-PT210 antibodies specifically recognize Snf1 protein that is phosphorylated on threonine 210. The phosphorylation state of threonine 210 was assessed in cells that were grown under conditions of excess glucose (6%) or glucose limitation (0.05%) for 1 h. Since the mere act of centrifugation has been shown to be sufficient to activate Snf1 kinase (10Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), a procedure was devised to block cellular metabolism prior to harvest. Using a modification of a simple protein extraction procedure (32Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), cell metabolism was arrested first by the addition of sodium hydroxide to a concentration of 0.1 m for 5 min prior to harvesting cells by centrifugation. Protein extracts were then isolated from cultures expressing both wild type Snf1 protein from the chromosome and an epitope-tagged Snf1 protein from a centromere plasmid. When an extract from glucose-repressed cultures was probed directly by Western blot with the α-PT210 antibodies, very little reactivity was observed (Fig.3A, lane 1). In contrast, extracts prepared from glucose-limited cultures readily detected a doublet with the α-PT210 antibodies. The upper band represents the epitope-tagged protein (75.6 kDa), and thelower band represents the chromosomal untagged Snf1 (72.0 kDa). Therefore, the phosphorylation state of the Snf1 threonine 210 correlates with glucose limitation. As a control, the same experiment was repeated using the T210A allele of SNF1 as the plasmid-encoded gene. In this case, the wild type (lower band) Snf1 protein was phosphorylated normally in response to glucose limitation, but the T210A protein (upper band) shows no reactivity with the α-PT210 antibodies (Fig. 3A,lanes 3 and 4). Equivalent levels of the epitope-tagged Snf1 protein was detected in all the extracts (lower panel) confirming that the T210A protein was present, although not detected by the α-PT210 antibodies. In a similar experiment, extracts were prepared from cells expressing only the epitope-tagged Snf1 protein. The Snf1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody prior to resolution by SDS gel and Western blot with both α-PT210 antibody and anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3B). The Snf1 protein is present in both extracts at comparable levels as judged by reactivity with the HA antibody. However, the reactivity with the α-PT210 antibodies is only found in derepressed cultures. Therefore, the phosphorylation of threonine 210 directly correlates with glucose stress and the activity of the Snf1 kinase. Several different mechanisms can be responsible for the phosphorylation of kinase activation loop residues. We sought to determine directly whether the Snf1 kinase is activated by an upstream kinase or by one of two possible modes of autophosphorylation (Fig.4A). If Snf1 were activated by a distinct upstream kinase, then a mutation in the Snf1 active site should not affect the phosphorylation of the Thr210 site. However, if the Thr210 phosphorylation were the result of an autophosphorylation event, then an active site mutation in Snf1 would eliminate the Thr210 phosphorylation. Cells that contained either wild type SNF1 or the snf1Δ10allele on the chromosome were transformed with HA-tagged Snf1 that was either catalytically active or inactivated by the K84R mutation in the ATP binding domain (34Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Snf1 protein was harvested by immunoprecipitation with HA antibody and the phosphorylation state of threonine 210 assessed with the α-PT210 antibodies (Fig.4B). The SNF1 cells expressing the K84R kinase dead mutant are still able to phosphorylate Thr210, thereby eliminating intermolecular autophosphorylation as a mechanism. Thesnf1Δ10 cells transformed with a plasmid expressing the K84R kinase dead mutant have no Snf1 kinase activity, and yet they showed levels of phosphorylated threonine 210 equivalent to cells expressing active Snf1 kinase (Fig. 4B, lanes 2and 4). This result eliminates intramolecular autophosphorylation as a mechanism. Cells lacking Snf1 kinase activity also exhibit regulated Thr210 phosphorylation in response to glucose limitation (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Snf1 threonine 210 cannot be the result of autophosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Snf1 kinase on threonine 210 must be catalyzed by a distinct upstream kinase. Studies that examined the involvement of the Snf1 kinase in the response to sodium ion stress have arrived at different conclusions (35Alepuz P.M. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Ganster R.W. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Genetics. 1998; 150: 31-42PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether sodium ion stress resulted in the phosphorylation of threonine 210 by treating cells for 1 h with 0.8 m NaCl. Protein extracts were prepared, and the epitope-tagged Snf1 protein was collected by immunoprecipitation. The level of threonine 210 phosphorylation measured by Western blot with the α-PT210 antibodies is consistently higher in cells that have been subjected to sodium ion stress (Fig. 5A). This experiment has been repeated three times with independent transformants, and in all cases the phosphorylation of Thr210 was detected in sodium-stressed cells but was less prominent than in glucose-stressed cells. We also tested whether sodium ion stress resulted in the phosphorylation of Mig1, a known target of Snf1 kinase in the glucose derepression pathway (7Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 37Smith F.C. Davies S.P. Wilson W.A. Carling D. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that the mobility shift of Mig1 protein is due to phosphorylation (7Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18"

Lack of bre-5 in the intestine led to resistance to the Bt toxin Cry5B. Wild-type but not bre-5 mutant animals were found to uptake toxin into their gut cells, consistent with bre-5 mutants lacking toxin-binding sites on their apical gut. bre-5 mutants displayed resistance to Cry14A, a Bt toxin lethal to both nematodes and insects; this indicates that resistance by loss of carbohydrate modification is relevant to multiple Bt toxins."

Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In addition, some viruses encode RNA species, such as VA RNA or EBER RNA, which have considerable ds structures. Virtually nothing is known about how dsRNA affects viral and cellular gene expression and functions in a virally infected cell, although the role of PKR, the dsRNA-activated protein kinase, in inhibiting protein synthesis has been studied in cells infected with a variety of viruses (2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In the host-virus interaction context, dsRNA is closely associated with the interferon (IFN) system. dsRNA is a potent inducer of type I IFN synthesis and is believed to be the primary viral gene product that causes IFN production by infected cells (3Vilcek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-399Google Scholar). dsRNA has important roles in IFN actions as well. It is the obligatory activator of two classes of IFN-induced enzymes: PKR, the IFN-induced protein kinase, and 2–5(A) synthetases, whose products activate the latent ribonuclease, RNaseL. Moreover, transcription of some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is also induced by dsRNA (4Tiwari R.K. Kusari J. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3373-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). That this induction is direct and not mediated by induced IFN was convincingly demonstrated in IFN unresponsive cells and in cells that are devoid of the IFNgene locus (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Direct induction of some ISGs by dsRNA suggests that the encoded proteins will be induced in virally infected cells without any involvement of IFNs. Thus regulation of viral gene expression by these proteins is relevant for all infected cells, even in the absence of IFN treatment. Several transcription factors such as NFκB, IRF-3, and ATF-1, are known to be activated by dsRNA (7Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Their activation is mediated by protein kinases including PKR, p38, JNK2, and IKK (7Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 8Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) although the pathways of activation are not completely understood. For genes that are induced by either IFN or dsRNA, the same cis-element regulates their induction by both reagents. But entirely different signaling pathways and transcription factors are used by the two inducers (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). There has not been any attempt to systematically define the full repertoire of dsRNA-regulated genes. Identification of these genes is required not only for revealing the nature of all signaling pathways used by dsRNA but also for defining the set of proteins that are induced by dsRNA or virus infection. In the current study, we started this investigation using a cDNA microarray hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from dsRNA-treated and -untreated GRE cells that are devoid of the type I IFN locus and cannot synthesize IFNs. Using this approach, in the current study we have identified more than a hundred DSGs, only a few of which were previously known to be dsRNA-inducible. Furthermore we also identified multiple down-regulated genes. These genes were induced or repressed by dsRNA strongly, rapidly, and transiently. The encoded proteins are involved in a broad range of cellular functions and metabolic pathways. Conditions for culturing GRE cells and treatment with poly(I)·poly(C) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) have been described previously (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with 50 µg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min prior to and during dsRNA treatment. GRE cells were grown in 150-mm plates until 80% confluent, and then cells were treated with poly(I)·poly(C) or cytokines for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated by use of RNAzol reagent (Tel-test, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from total RNA samples using Oligotex poly(A)+ RNA purification kit (Qiagen) with one round of extraction from the oligo(dT)+ spin column. For Northern blot analysis, the total RNA was separated by 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N+(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) nylon membrane by capillary blotting. Hybridization was carried out with 32P-labeled probes prepared from PCR-amplified cDNA of human I.M.A.G.E. clones (Research Genetics). Fluorescent-labeled cDNA probes were generated as described by Geiss et al. (9Geiss G.K. An M.C. Bumgarner R.E. Hammersmark E. Cunningham D. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Human cDNA I.M.A.G.E. clones were purchased from Research Genetics (UG Build 19V5.0, plate 1–48). The cDNA inserts were PCR-amplified and deposited on glass microscope slides as described previously (9Geiss G.K. An M.C. Bumgarner R.E. Hammersmark E. Cunningham D. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions and washing conditions were as described previously. Slides were scanned by Avalanche dual laser scanner (Molecular Dynamics); signals were quantified and analyzed as described previously (9Geiss G.K. An M.C. Bumgarner R.E. Hammersmark E. Cunningham D. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HT1080 cells were co-transfected with CMV-CD20 and CMV-P56 in a ratio of 1:8. Eighteen hours later cells were trypsinized and incubated for 30 min with FITC-conjugated anti-CD20 antibody (BD PharMingen). Cells were washed, resuspended in culture medium, and FACS-sorted for FITC. For undertaking a systematic analysis of human DRGs, we chose to use the glioma cell line, GRE (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These cells lack the type I IFN locus and hence cannot synthesize IFN-β or any of the multiple IFN-α species in response to dsRNA or other stimuli. Because dsRNA treatment of GRE cells cannot induce IFNs, the possibility of secondary induction of the IFN-stimulated genes by autocrine actions of IFNs was eliminated. This consideration was highly pertinent because dsRNA is known to be a potent inducer of IFNs, and several DSGs are known to be induced by IFN as well. GRE cells were treated with the dsRNA, poly(I)·poly(C), for 6 h and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from treated and untreated cells. We chose the length of treatment to be 6 h, because our previous studies have shown that this is the optimum time for induction of 561 mRNA that encodes the 56 kDa protein, P56 (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The two sets of RNA from dsRNA-treated and untreated cells were then used for microarray analysis. The microarray consisted of 4600 human cDNAs and ESTs. Each slide contained duplicate sets of samples, and the colors of the two cDNA probes were reversed in duplicate assays. Two selected fields are shown in Fig. 1,A and B. The same four stimulated genes scored red in Fig. 1 A and green in Fig. 1 B. The mRNAs whose levels were similar in the two samples are depicted as yellow signals in both sets. The entire screen was carried out twice so that four independent values were obtained for each spot. Quantitation of the signals produced two kinds of information: the intensity of the signal was proportional to the abundance of the corresponding mRNA, and the degree of redness or greenness indicated the fold induction or repression of mRNA by dsRNA treatment of the cells. Our analyses revealed that 175 mRNAs were induced by 2-fold or more and 95 mRNAs were repressed by 2-fold or more (with minimum threshold of intensity of 400). Eight dsRNA-stimulated genes and two dsRNA-repressed genes were selected for further characterization. These genes includeIFIT1 (P56), which as a known DSG serves as a positive control. The others were chosen because of interesting properties of the encoded proteins. For example, ELF-3 (10Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and ATF-3 (11Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) are transcription factors, TNF AIP3 is a DNA-binding protein (12Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TFPI2 (13Miyagi Y. Yasumitsu H. Mizushima H. Koshikawa N. Matsuda Y. Itoh H. Hori T.A. Aoki I. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and PLAU (14Riccio A. Grimaldi G. Verde P. Sebastio G. Boast S. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2759-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) are modulators of proteolytic pathways. Another consideration for choosing these genes was that they represented the whole spectrum of genes from the very strongly induced (IFIT1: 52-fold) to weakly induced (ATF3: 2.6-fold). For independent validation of our screen, the levels of the mRNAs of the selected genes in dsRNA-treated and untreated cells were quantitated by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 C, all of the eight candidate DSGs were strongly induced by dsRNA, although the level of actin mRNA was unchanged. Similarly, the steady-state levels of two candidate dsRNA-repressed genes were lower in the treated cells. Quantitation of the Northern signals revealed that the fold changes observed in the microarray analysis were in general underestimates. Thus, even a relatively small difference noted in the array analysis could be physiologically significant. Many extracellular stimuli are known to activate multiple and independent signaling pathways leading to transcriptional activation of different families of genes. Members of such different families can often be initially identified by noting differences in their induction kinetics and dependence on ongoing protein synthesis. Such analyses revealed that the identified DSGs can indeed be classified into distinct subsets, each of which is probably induced by a distinct dsRNA-elicited signaling pathway. For example, TNFAIP3 mRNA was strongly induced within 1 h of dsRNA treatment whereas the maximum level of TNFAIP2 mRNA was attained only after 6 h (Fig.2). Thus, these two mRNAs represent the early and late response genes whose inductions are most likely mediated by two different pathways. It is curious to note that the levels of both mRNAs were down to almost undetectable levels after 12–24 h of dsRNA treatment, indicating that the induction process is transient, and the mRNAs turn over rapidly. For the repressed genes Notch 3 (Fig. 2) and PLAU (data not shown), the reduction in the mRNA levels had slow kinetics. Interestingly, even after 24 h of dsRNA treatment, the levels of these mRNAs were very low, indicating that the repressing effects lasted longer than the gene induction effects. The levels of actin mRNA remained unchanged during the 24 h treatment with dsRNA (not shown). Another indication of the activation of multiple dsRNA signaling pathways came from the experiment shown in Fig.3. When protein synthesis was inhibited by pretreating cells with 50 µg/ml of cycloheximide, dsRNA could still induce TNFAIP3 mRNA effectively. In contrast, BTN3A3 mRNA induction by dsRNA was completely blocked in the presence of cycloheximide, although the basal level of BTN3A3 mRNA was maintained. These results demonstrated that a set of DSGs represented by TNFAIP3 is induced by signaling pathways that can use pre-existing cellular proteins, whereas the induction of another set of DSGs, represented by BTN3A3, requires new protein synthesis. The second set of genes is probably induced by the secondary effects of proteins encoded by specific DSGs induced in the first wave of induction. The observed low level of induction of the BTN3A3 mRNA after 6 h of dsRNA treatment (Fig. 1 C) is consistent with the notion that it is the product of a secondary cascade. For the repressed gene Notch 3, blocking new protein synthesis had no effect (Fig. 3); dsRNA still decreased the cellular level of this mRNA. Thus, Notch 3 repression is a direct effect of dsRNA treatment. The characteristics of the underlying dsRNA signaling pathways were further explored by testing the response of DSGs to selected cytokines. Because dsRNA is viewed as an initiator of stress-response resulting from virus infection of mammalian cells, we wondered whether some of the DSGs are also induced by inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-β, TNF-α, and IL-1, all of which are known to mediate host response to various types of tissue injury and inflammation. Results shown in Fig.4 demonstrated that DSGs can be divided into at least four families according to their induction patterns. Genes, such as IFIT1, were induced by dsRNA or IFN-β but not by TNF-α or IL-1. BTN3A3 was induced by all inducers, and TNFAIP3 was induced by dsRNA, TNF-α, and IL-1 but not by IFN-β. In contrast, TFPI2 was induced only by dsRNA. Similarly, only dsRNA repressed the Notch 3 gene; the three cytokines had no effect. These results suggest that dsRNA and different inflammatory cytokines may activate partially overlapping signaling pathways, thus providing opportunities for positive or negative cross-talks. The partial overlaps between dsRNA, IFN, and viral signaling pathways are further illustrated by the comparison made in Fig.5. In this analysis, induction profiles of several relevant genes were compared using primary data from this report and the literature. Four groups of genes were identified. Those in Group A are induced by dsRNA, IFN, or several viruses; genes in Group B are induced by IFN and viral infection; those in Group C are induced by dsRNA and viruses; and the Group D genes are induced by dsRNA and IFN. In addition, in cells transformed with HPV, expression of some of the same genes is repressed. These results indicate that different subsets of the same cellular genes are induced by the diverse signaling pathways activated by dsRNA, IFN, and virus infection. Cellular functions of many but not all of the dsRNA-regulated genes identified by our screen are known. In Table I, the proteins encoded by these genes are grouped according to their functions. Several proteins known to be involved in IFN, TNF, and other cytokine and growth factor signaling processes were induced by dsRNA. These proteins may mediate possible cross-talks between virus infection and cytokine actions. In addition, dsRNA induced a large number of cellular regulatory proteins affecting RNA and protein synthesis and processing, metabolism, transport, and cell structure. The abundance of several mRNAs encoding highly significant proteins was reduced as well (Table II). The repressed mRNA included those for VCAM1, TP53, PCK2, and STAM. Thus, it is clear that a short exposure of cells to dsRNA profoundly changes the cellular abundance of a large number of mRNAs whose products are essential to every aspect of cell physiology.Table IPartial list of cellular genes induced by dsRNA treatmentFunctional classHUGO symbolGene productFold inductionStandard deviationInterferon-stimulated genesIFIT1interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (p56)52.532.4GBP1guanylate-binding protein 1, interferon-inducible, 67kD5.52.5NMIN-myc (and STAT) interactor4.01.8IRF1interferon regulatory factor 13.82.3ADARadenosine deaminase, RNA-specific3.52.2TNF-induced signaling/apoptosisTNFAIP2tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 2 (B94)19.12.8TRAF1TNF receptor-associated factor 113.312.2TNFAIP6tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 66.92.9BIRC2baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 26.05.0TNFAIP3tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3 (A20)4.81.4CFLARCASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator4.32.7BNIP3BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kD-interacting protein 32.40.6Cytokine and Growth FactorsIGFBP6insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 64.90.5SCYA4small inducible cytokine A4 (homologous to mouse Mip-1b)4.11.2FGF2fibroblast growth factor 2 (basic)3.32.5SCYA2small inducible cytokine A2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1)2.30.3RNA synthesisELF3E74-like factor 3 (ets domain transcription factor, epithelial-specific)4.52.7ATF3activating transcription factor 32.61.0KLF4Kruppel-like factor 4 (gut)2.60.8NFKBIAnuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, α2.30.3HMG2high-mobility group (nonhistone chromosomal) protein 22.20.3Extracellular matrix/cell adhesionTFPI2tissue factor pathway inhibitor 216.911.9BTN3A3butyrophilin, subfamily 3, member A35.43.9PLAURplasminogen activator, urokinase receptor4.81.4PRG1proteoglycan 1, secretory granule3.60.7ANXA1annexin A12.60.8CD44CD44 antigen (homing function and Indian blood group system)2.40.6Protein synthesis and degradationEIF2S3eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, subunit 3 (gamma, 52kD)4.03.3PSMA3proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, alpha type, 32.40.6UBQLN1ubiquilin 13.22.2Metabolism and biosynthesisFACL3fatty-acid-Coenzyme A ligase, long-chain 39.36.6GCH1GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (dopa-responsive dystonia)6.00.9SUOXsulfite oxidase2.30.1TransportersABCB2ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 23.00.6SATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase2.81.4XPO1exportin 1 (CRM1, yeast, homolog)2.20.4Cytoskeletal organizationIQGAP2IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 22.81.5CHN1chimerin (chimaerin) 12.81.2AFAPactin filament-associated protein5.31.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIPartial list of cellular gene repressed by dsRNA treatmentFunctional classHUGO symbolGene productFold repressionStandard deviationExtracellular matrix/Cell AdhesionVCAM1vascular cell adhesion molecule 1−3.31.6MMP1matrix metalloproteinase 1 (interstitial collagenase)−3.01.5KIAA0246KIAA0246 gene product, similar to murine Notch 3−2.50.8EFNB3ephrin-B3−2.40.4PLAUplasminogen activator, urokinase−2.10.2MetabolismPIG3quinone oxidoreductase homolog−3.62.9PRKAR1Bprotein kinase, cAMP-dependent, regulatory, type 1, beta−3.61.6PCK2phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (mitochondrial)−3.41.8PARGpoly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase−3.11.5Cell CycleCDC14ACDC14 (cell division cycle 14, S. cerevisiae) homolog A−2.60.9TP53tumor protein p53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome)−2.30.2Other Cellular GenesWASF1WAS protein family, member 1−3.72.4TOMM70Atranslocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (yeast) homolog A−3.11.9MEIS1Meis1 (mouse) homolog−2.90.8STAMsignal transducing adaptor molecule (SH3 domain and ITAM motif) 1−2.91.5DNMT3ADNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha−2.81.1 Open table in a new tab Because IFIT1 was identified as the most strongly induced gene in response to treatment with dsRNA (Fig. 1) or IFN (15Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), we selected it for further functional studies. Cells were co-transfected with an expression vector for P56, the product of the IFIT1gene and an expression vector for the cell-surface protein CD20. Cells expressing CD20 were isolated by FACS and cultured for determining their doubling time. Cells expressing only CD20 and isolated in the same fashion served as controls. As shown in Fig.6, cell growth was retarded in P56-expressing cells. The amount of P56 expressed in these cells was equivalent to that induced by 200 units/ml of IFN-β. It should be pointed out, however, that P56 was continuously expressed in the transfected cells whereas its expression in IFN or dsRNA-treated cells is transient. These results demonstrated that a major protein product of dsRNA signaling has a strong negative effect on the rate of cell proliferation. We report here the results of the first systematic attempt for identifying genes regulated by double-stranded RNA. The most unexpected observation was that the expression of a large number of cellular genes was affected by dsRNA. Selected members of the set of DSGs identified here will be valuable tools for dissecting dsRNA signaling pathways. In this context, we are interested not only in the mechanisms regulating the transcriptional induction of these genes, but also in those that eventually shut off that process. The signaling pathways used by IFN, dsRNA, and viruses overlap partially because many genes are induced by two or three of these inducers (Fig. 5; Ref. 9Geiss G.K. An M.C. Bumgarner R.E.

Two dsRNA signaling pathways, although not fully characterized, are already known. One leads to NFκB activation and its binding to κB sites of genes and the other to activation of specific members of the IRF family, such as IRF-3 and IRF-7, and their binding to ISRE sites of genes (3Vilcek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-399Google Scholar, 5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Results presented here strongly indicate that additional pathways must exist because of non-coordinate up-regulation of different DSGs both kinetically and with respect to alternative inducers. For example, TFPI2 was not induced by TNF-α or IL-1, although both of these cytokines activate NFκB. The same gene was also not induced by IFN-β, which activates transcription factors that induce transcription of ISRE-containing genes. Thus, further analysis of the promoter region of this gene will most likely reveal a new dsRNA signaling pathway that is mediated neither by κB elements nor by ISRE elements. The current study also revealed that many genes are down-regulated by dsRNA. This novel observation is quite exciting, because nothing in the literature suggests such an effect of dsRNA. Because dsRNA is often produced in virus-infected cells, the protein products of the dsRNA-regulated genes identified in our study are expected to play important functional roles in host-virus interaction. The dsRNA-induced transcription factors may directly affect virus gene transcription. On the opposite side, these gene products are certainly involved in the host response to virus infection. In the context of the equilibrium maintained between a virus and its host cells, some of these proteins may contribute to the host defense mechanisms whereas others may be used by the virus to evade the host defense. For example, P56, the product of the most strongly induced DSG IFIT1, is known to bind to the translation initiation factor eIF-3 and inhibit protein synthesis (20Guo J. Peters K. Sen G.C. Virology. 2000; 267: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Guo J. Hui D. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 24: 6891-6899Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that as a consequence, cell growth was inhibited (Fig. 6), which may, in turn, affect virus replication. Similarly, the efficacy of the spreading of viral infection in vivo may be affected by DSGs by altering the recognition pattern of the infected cell by cells of the immune system and modulating the synthesis of and response to antiviral cytokines such as IFN and TNF. One of the DSGs identified here encodes the DNA-binding zinc-finger protein TNFAIP3, which is known to block the NFκB signaling pathway activated by TNF (12Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the null cells fail to down-regulate NFκB activation by TNF, and the corresponding mice die prematurely because of hypersensitivity to TNF and lipopolysaccharides (22Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In the opposite scenario presented here, if TNFAIP3 is highly induced in virus-infected cells, these cells will be resistant to the apoptotic effects of TNF and LPS. Functions of the DSGs are also relevant to the emerging field of RNAi that uses gene-specific functional ablation by dsRNA. In bacteria, lower eukaryotes, plants and mice, expression of specific genes can be silenced by administering to the cells short dsRNAs corresponding to the genes (23Parrish S. Fleenor J. Xu S. Mello C. Fire A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1077-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Thus, this strategy of gene ablation may soon become a major investigative and therapeutic tool for manipulating selective gene expression. In that context, the results presented here should alert us to the fact that any dsRNA, irrespective of its sequence content, will have additional global effects on cells by inducing the expression of a large number of cellular genes. Similar considerations are also warranted for cells treated with antisense RNAs that are introduced by transfection or viral vectors. We thank Kristi Peters and Theresa Rowe for helpful discussion and Karen Toil for secretarial assistance."

Although the neocortex could be composed of scores of precise circuits, an alternative possibility is that local connectivity is probabilistic or even random. To examine the precision and degree of determinism in the neocortical microcircuitry, we used optical probing to reconstruct microcircuits in layer 5 from mouse primary visual cortex. We stimulated ""trigger"" cells, isolated from a homogenous population of corticotectal pyramidal neurons, while optically detecting ""follower"" neurons directly driven by the triggers. Followers belonged to a few selective anatomical classes with stereotyped physiological and synaptic responses. Moreover, even the position of the followers appeared determined across animals.

https://openalex.org/W1535042563,"The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in tumor cell lines, whereas normal cells appear to be protected from its cytotoxic effects. Therefore TRAIL holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent against cancer. To elucidate some of the critical factors that contribute to TRAIL resistance, we performed a genetic screen in the human colon carcinoma cell line SW480 by infecting this TRAIL-sensitive cell line with a human placental cDNA retroviral library and isolating TRAIL-resistant clones. Characterization of the resulting clones for inhibitors of TRAIL-induced death (ITIDs) led to the isolation of c-FLIP(S), Bax inhibitor 1, and Bcl-XL as candidate suppressors of TRAIL signaling. We have demonstrated that c-FLIP(S) and Bcl-XL are sufficient when overexpressed to convey resistance to TRAIL treatment in previously sensitive cell lines. Furthermore both c-FLIP(S) and Bcl-XL protected against overexpression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 and KILLER/DR5. When c-FLIP(S) and Bcl-XL were overexpressed together in SW480 and HCT 116, an additive inhibitory effect was observed after TRAIL treatment suggesting that these two molecules function in the same pathway in the cell lines tested. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, Bax, is required for TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in HCT 116 cells. Surprisingly, we have found that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, which is an upstream regulator of both c-FLIP(S) and Bcl-XL, is not sufficient when overexpressed to protect against TRAIL in the cell lines tested. These results suggest a key role for c-FLIP(S), Bcl-XL, and Bax in determining tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL."

Acquisition of anoikis resistance is now thought to be a prerequisite for the progression of carcinomas. Colorectal cancer cells frequently secrete epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, which are known to have anti-apoptotic activity. However, whether these ligands have the ability to inhibit anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells is unclear, since at least in some cell types efficient EGFR signaling requires cell-ECM adhesion. Here we report that transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), an EGFR ligand that is frequently secreted by colorectal cancer cells, strongly inhibits anoikis of the non-malignant rat intestinal epithelial cell lines, IEC-18 and RIE-1. TGF-α exerts its anti-anoikis effect by preventing detachment-induced inhibition of c-Src kinase activity. We also show that Fas activation, a molecular event known to play a critical role in anoikis, is not suppressed by TGF-α. On the other hand, this growth factor strongly inhibits the detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL, another change that is involved in the induction of anoikis. We further demonstrate that this inhibition occurs in a c-Src-dependent manner. We conclude that TGF-α has the ability to suppress anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells, at least in part, by reverting the loss of c-Src activity and Bcl-XL expression induced by detachment from the ECM.

Solid tumors grow in vivo as multicellular masses in which at least a proportion of cells is deprived of normal contacts with the basement membrane and is anoikis-resistant.

In principle, these EGFR ligands could, at least in part, exert their oncogenic effect through the induction of resistance to anoikis, since their anti-apoptotic activity is well established (14Karnes W.E.

For example, in fibroblasts the capacity of EGF to induce EGFR phosphorylation, or trigger the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, strongly depends on integrin engagement (17Miyamoto S.

In addition, it has been demonstrated that EGF-induced activation of protein kinase B, another well established anti-apoptotic event, notably decreases upon detachment of kidney epithelial cells (5Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear at the present time whether EGFR ligands have the capacity to inhibit anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells. We show here that TGF-α, one of the members of the EGF family frequently secreted by colorectal tumors (10Ciardiello F. Kim N. Saeki T. Dono R. Persico M.G. Plowman G.D. Garrigues J. Radke S.

It has been reported that the capacity of the EGFR, which is the receptor for this growth factor, to induce various signaling events is strongly reduced in the absence of cell-ECM attachment (5Khwaja A.

Thus, it is possible that certain components of the TGF-α-driven signaling system are not activated at optimal levels in intestinal epithelial cells when they are not attached to the ECM. However, our data clearly demonstrate that this growth factor is capable of triggering at least one anti-apoptotic pathway that is sufficient for significant inhibition of anoikis of these cells.We have demonstrated here that detachment of IEC-18 cells does not result in a reduction of the levels of EGFR phosphorylation, indicating that changes in the activity of the receptor per se are not involved in the induction of anoikis. Thus, these data suggest that TGF-α-induced activation of the EGFR leads to the inhibition of this form of cell death by triggering signals that override detachment-induced pro-apoptotic events initiated in an EGFR-independent manner. Our results indicate that one of these events is the inhibition of c-Src kinase activity. This kinase is known to be independently regulated by both EGFR and integrin-ECM interactions (23Abram C.L.

These results are also consistent with the finding demonstrating that v-Src, a constitutively active form of Src, is capable of inhibiting anoikis of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (2Frisch S.M.

The potential involvement of these two mechanisms in the anti-anoikis effect of TGF-α is the subject of our ongoing research.Our data indicate that detachment of intestinal epithelial cells results in the activation of at least two pro-apoptotic molecular pathways. One of these pathways is triggered by the activation of Fas, and the other by the down-regulation of Bcl-XL. Caspases-8 and -10, which are the initiator caspases in the Fas-induced cell death pathway, can each directly activate caspase-3, one of the key effector caspases (40Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 47Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A.

Since caspase-3 is known to be inhibited in the presence of high Bcl-XL levels (through both cytochromec-dependent and -independent events) (38Hengartner H.

Certainly, the involvement of other effector caspases in this process is also likely. The cooperative effect of these signaling events on caspase-3 could then elevate its activity beyond the threshold level required for the induction of apoptosis. If, however, one of the caspase-3-inducing molecular events is inhibited, as it occurs in response to the TGF-α-triggered increase in Bcl-XL expression, caspase-3 activity can drop below anoikis-permissive levels. Naturally, the possibility that TGF-α has the ability to inhibit anoikis through alternative, Bcl-XL-independent, mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, anoikis of mammary epithelial cells has been shown to occur as a result of the insertion of Bax into the mitochondria (50Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Whether this molecular event can be regulated by TGF-α remains to be investigated.TGF-α is frequently secreted by human colorectal tumor cells (9Anzano M.A. Rieman D. Prichett W. Bowen-Pope D.F.

In addition, development and progression of this type of cancer are often associated with an increased c-Src activity and enhanced Bcl-XL expression (52Cartwright C.A. Meisler A.I. Eckhart W. Proc.

Based on our data, it is tempting to speculate that TGF-α contributes to colorectal cancer progression, at least in part, by inhibiting anoikis through a c-Src-dependent induction of Bcl-XL expression. It is also important to note that the role of EGF family members in tumor progression is not limited to colorectal cancer (57Derynck R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 27-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 58Yoshida K. Kyo E. Tsuda T. Tsujino T. Ito M. Niimoto M. Tahara E. Int. J.

In addition, TGF-α transgenic mice are known to be prone to neoplastic transformation in several tissues (60Matsui Y. Halter S.A. Holt J.T. Hogan B.L.M. Coffey R.J.

Downward J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 63Jost M. Huggett T.M. Kari C. Rodeck U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were published demonstrating that, similar to what was observed here for intestinal epithelium, EGF family members can inhibit anoikis of normal breast and skin cells. Collectively, these data suggest that the ability to contribute to tumor progression through the inhibition of anoikis may represent a general property of the members of this family of growth factors. Most epithelia rest upon and are tightly bound to a thin extracellular matrix (ECM)1called basement membrane. Detachment of epithelial cells from the basement membrane results in apoptosis, a phenomenon termed anoikis (1Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar, 2Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar, 3Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Solid tumors grow in vivo as multicellular masses in which at least a proportion of cells is deprived of normal contacts with the basement membrane and is anoikis-resistant. Acquisition of such resistance is, therefore, an essential prerequisite for invasion and metastases in most cancers of epithelial origin. Some of the molecular mechanisms by which epithelial cells become resistant to anoikis during tumor progression have been uncovered during the last few years (4Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V.

Our laboratory, in particular, has investigated the mechanisms of anoikis resistance in the context of colorectal cancer, and we have demonstrated that one such mechanism is based on the mutation and activation of the rasproto-oncogene (4Rak J.

A majority of colorectal cancers and cell lines established from these tumors express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and overproduce one or more of its ligands (9Anzano M.A. Rieman D. Prichett W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Greig R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2898-2904PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ciardiello F. Kim N. Saeki T. Dono R. Persico M.G. Plowman G.D. Garrigues J. Radke S. Todaro G.J.

In addition, blockade of such ligands inhibits growth of human colorectal carcinoma xenografts (13De Luca A. Arra C. D'antonio A. Casmassimi A. Losito S. Ferraro P. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In principle, these EGFR ligands could, at least in part, exert their oncogenic effect through the induction of resistance to anoikis, since their anti-apoptotic activity is well established (14Karnes W.E.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown in several cell systems that efficient EGFR signaling requires cell-ECM attachment. For example, in fibroblasts the capacity of EGF to induce EGFR phosphorylation, or trigger the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, strongly depends on integrin engagement (17Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 18Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that EGF-induced activation of protein kinase B, another well established anti-apoptotic event, notably decreases upon detachment of kidney epithelial cells (5Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear at the present time whether EGFR ligands have the capacity to inhibit anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells. We show here that TGF-α, one of the members of the EGF family frequently secreted by colorectal tumors (10Ciardiello F. Kim N. Saeki T. Dono R. Persico M.G. Plowman G.D. Garrigues J. Radke S. Todaro G.J. Salomon D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7792-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), is capable of suppressing anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells and that this growth factor exerts its anti-anoikis effect, at least in part, through the inhibition of detachment-induced down-regulation of c-Src kinase activity and Bcl-XL expression. DISCUSSIONWe have shown in this study that TGF-α has the ability to inhibit anoikis of normal intestinal epithelial cells. It has been reported that the capacity of the EGFR, which is the receptor for this growth factor, to induce various signaling events is strongly reduced in the absence of cell-ECM attachment (5Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J.

In addition, development and progression of this type of cancer are often associated with an increased c-Src activity and enhanced Bcl-XL expression (52Cartwright C.A. Meisler A.I. Eckhart W. Proc.

Based on our data, it is tempting to speculate that TGF-α contributes to colorectal cancer progression, at least in part, by inhibiting anoikis through a c-Src-dependent induction of Bcl-XL expression. It is also important to note that the role of EGF family members in tumor progression is not limited to colorectal cancer (57Derynck R. Adv.

In addition, TGF-α transgenic mice are known to be prone to neoplastic transformation in several tissues (60Matsui Y. Halter S.A. Holt J.T. Hogan B.L.M. Coffey R.J.

Downward J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 63Jost M. Huggett T.M. Kari C. Rodeck U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were published demonstrating that, similar to what was observed here for intestinal epithelium, EGF family members can inhibit anoikis of normal breast and skin cells. Collectively, these data suggest that the ability to contribute to tumor progression through the inhibition of anoikis may represent a general property of the members of this family of growth factors. We have shown in this study that TGF-α has the ability to inhibit anoikis of normal intestinal epithelial cells. It has been reported that the capacity of the EGFR, which is the receptor for this growth factor, to induce various signaling events is strongly reduced in the absence of cell-ECM attachment (5Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that certain components of the TGF-α-driven signaling system are not activated at optimal levels in intestinal epithelial cells when they are not attached to the ECM. However, our data clearly demonstrate that this growth factor is capable of triggering at least one anti-apoptotic pathway that is sufficient for significant inhibition of anoikis of these cells. We have demonstrated here that detachment of IEC-18 cells does not result in a reduction of the levels of EGFR phosphorylation, indicating that changes in the activity of the receptor per se are not involved in the induction of anoikis. Thus, these data suggest that TGF-α-induced activation of the EGFR leads to the inhibition of this form of cell death by triggering signals that override detachment-induced pro-apoptotic events initiated in an EGFR-independent manner. Our results indicate that one of these events is the inhibition of c-Src kinase activity. This kinase is known to be independently regulated by both EGFR and integrin-ECM interactions (23Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Biscardi, J. S., Tice, D. A., and Parsons, S. J. (1999)Adv. Cancer Res. 61–119Google Scholar, 25Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The activation of c-Src by integrins can be mediated by focal adhesion kinase, a cytoplasmic enzyme that is known to be regulated by integrin engagement (25Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We have also shown here that TGF-α suppresses anoikis, at least in part, by preventing detachment-induced inhibition of c-Src kinase. These data are consistent with the fact that both EGFR and c-Src have a well established ability to inhibit apoptosis in adherent cells (26Karni R. Jove R. Levitzki A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results are also consistent with the finding demonstrating that v-Src, a constitutively active form of Src, is capable of inhibiting anoikis of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (2Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar, 5Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). We have shown that TGF-α and c-Src prevent anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells by inhibiting detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL. This is in agreement with reports indicating that Bcl-XL expression is dependent on the activities of the EGFR and c-Src in adherent keratinocytes and fibroblasts (26Karni R. Jove R. Levitzki A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Rodeck U. Jost M. DuHadaway J. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Risse B. Ewert D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(1998) Oncogene 1493–1499Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of this anti-apoptotic molecule has been shown to be induced by v-Src (45Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). c-Src itself is known to induce the activities of several signaling molecules including mitogen-activated protein kinase and STAT-3 (23Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 46Olayioye M. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both have the ability to stimulate Bcl-XL expression (43Jost M. Hugget T.M. Kari C. Boise L.H. Rodeck U. J. Biol.

The potential involvement of these two mechanisms in the anti-anoikis effect of TGF-α is the subject of our ongoing research. Our data indicate that detachment of intestinal epithelial cells results in the activation of at least two pro-apoptotic molecular pathways. One of these pathways is triggered by the activation of Fas, and the other by the down-regulation of Bcl-XL. Caspases-8 and -10, which are the initiator caspases in the Fas-induced cell death pathway, can each directly activate caspase-3, one of the key effector caspases (40Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 47Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Since caspase-3 is known to be inhibited in the presence of high Bcl-XL levels (through both cytochromec-dependent and -independent events) (38Hengartner H. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6207) Google Scholar, 48Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to speculate that both the activation of Fas and the down-regulation of Bcl-XL ultimately converge on the activation of caspase-3. Certainly, the involvement of other effector caspases in this process is also likely. The cooperative effect of these signaling events on caspase-3 could then elevate its activity beyond the threshold level required for the induction of apoptosis. If, however, one of the caspase-3-inducing molecular events is inhibited, as it occurs in response to the TGF-α-triggered increase in Bcl-XL expression, caspase-3 activity can drop below anoikis-permissive levels. Naturally, the possibility that TGF-α has the ability to inhibit anoikis through alternative, Bcl-XL-independent, mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, anoikis of mammary epithelial cells has been shown to occur as a result of the insertion of Bax into the mitochondria (50Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Whether this molecular event can be regulated by TGF-α remains to be investigated.

The importance of StAR in steroidogenesis is underscored by studies of mutations in humans and StAR gene ablation in mice. Humans carrying mutations that inactivate StAR exhibit markedly reduced gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis, a condition that leads to accumulation of cholesterol in lipid droplets and a disease named congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (18Lin D.

Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 355: 1870-1878Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Ablation of StAR gene in mice also results in a phenotype of impaired steroidogenesis and adrenal lipid accumulation (20Caron K.M. Soo S.C. Wetsel W.C. Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Parker K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11540-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).The mechanism whereby StAR mediates cholesterol transfer from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane remains elusive. An early hypothesis favored stimulation of cholesterol movement as a result of StAR being physically transported through the outer to the inner mitochondrial membranes (for review, see Ref. 11Stocco D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this model the StAR translocation process was envisioned to promote formation of contact sites between outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, thereby allowing cholesterol to flow down a chemical gradient from the outer to the inner membranes. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunoelectron microscopy localized StAR in the intermembranous space and the intermembranous face of the inner mitochondrial membrane (21King S.R. Ronen-Fuhrmann T. Timberg R. Clark B.J. Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas immunoblotting of isolated mitochondrial membrane contact sites revealed the presence of StAR (22Cherradi N. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Timberg R. Friedberg I. Orly J. Wang X.J. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7899-7907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, recent studies from our laboratories favor another mechanism whereby StAR acts like most other typical lipid transfer proteins (23Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E.

This model is based on observations that StAR is a cholesterol transfer protein (23Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss I.J.F. J. Biol.

StAR molecules lacking a mitochondrial targeting sequence that were shown to be incapable of mitochondrial importation were able to stimulate conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones in intact cells and isolated mitochondria (24Arakane F.

A third hypothesis has emerged from the characterization of a StAR-related lipid-transfer (START) domain found in a related protein, MLN64 (35% identity with the StAR START domain) (25Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 130-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 27Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravid L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43: 134-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling revealed a hydrophobic tunnel in the MLN64 START domain capable of accommodating a cholesterol molecule (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These data suggested that StAR could be a cholesterol carrier from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane.To explore the properties of StAR and its action on mitochondria predicted by the existing models of StAR function, we performed experiments to address the following questions. Does StAR bind cholesterol? Do interactions with sterol affect StAR structure? Does StAR enhance mitochondrial sterol transfer by altering mitochondrial cholesterol domain dynamics? The data presented herein yielded the following new insights. (i) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrated the close molecular interaction between StAR and bound sterol. (ii) A fluorescent sterol binding assay established that StAR has two sterol binding sites with high affinity (nmKd values). A functionally inactive StAR mutant had much lower affinity for cholesterol. (iii) By application of a fluorescent sterol transfer assay, it was shown that StAR dramatically enhanced mitochondrial sterol transfer and altered the sterol domain structure of the mitochondrial membranes.DISCUSSIONSignificant advances in the molecular biology of StAR have greatly contributed to our understanding of the role that this protein plays in acute regulation of gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis. In contrast, much less is known regarding the nature of putative ligand binding sites and the mechanism(s) of action of this intriguing protein. The full-length StAR protein is comprised of at least two functional regions, an N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence encompassed within the 62 N-terminal amino acid portion of the protein and an N-62 portion of StAR comprising the cholesterol transfer component. The data presented herein provide several novel insights concerning the ligand binding site of StAR and mechanism whereby StAR enhances sterol transfer from mitochondrial membranes.First, the results showed for the first time the close molecular interaction of StAR with a fluorescent cholesterol derivative. This represents a major advance over the use of cholesterol for ligand binding assays. Cholesterol has a very low CMC, near 20–45 nm (48Haberland M.E. Reynolds J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2313-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This extremely poor aqueous solubility makes it difficult to use standard radioligand binding assays (requiring separation of bound from free cholesterol) to distinguish true cholesterol binding to a protein from cholesterol aggregation/coaggregation with the protein. In contrast, the NBD-cholesterol-based fluorescence binding assays used herein did not require separation of bound from free sterol and, because of the much greater sensitivity of the photon-counting based fluorescence assay, were performed at very low concentrations of NBD-cholesterol (below the CMC). Two types of experiments demonstrated a close molecular interaction between StAR and NBD-cholesterol. (i) The emission maximum of NBD-cholesterol was 32-nm blue-shifted in the presence of StAR but not in the presence of the inactive A218V mutant StAR. When compared with a standard curve of NBD-group emission wavelengthversus solvent dielectric constant (54Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the blue-shifted NBD spectrum in the presence of active StAR was consistent with a shift of the NBD group from an aqueous to a more hydrophobic environment with a dielectric constant near 2. Consistent with the relatively hydrophobic nature of the StAR ligand binding pocket, computer models of the x-ray crystal structure of the MLN64 START domain showed the presence of a hydrophobic tunnel thought to be the cholesterol binding site (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggested that the NBD group of NBD-cholesterol was buried deep in a putative “hydrophobic tunnel,” assuming a similar structure of StAR as for MLN64. It should be noted that the proposed orientation of NBD-cholesterol or cholesterol in StAR or MLN64, respectively, differs significantly from that of sterol in the binding pocket of SCP-2, a totally unrelated cholesterol binding/transfer protein. NBD-cholesterol binding to SCP-2 did not result in significant shift of the NBD emission spectrum, thereby suggesting that the NBD group of NBD-cholesterol bound to SCP-2 was localized near the surface opening of the SCP-2 protein binding pocket (51Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.H. Schroeder F. Wood W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). NMR data confirmed that SCP-2-bound 3-[13C]cholesterol was oriented with the polar 3β-OH of the sterol oriented near the surface opening of the SCP-2 binding pocket (34Stolowich N.J. Frolov A. Petrescu A.D. Scott A.I. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35425-35433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). (ii) FRET from StAR Trp to bound NBD-cholesterol was detected as decreased StAR Trp emission and appearance of sensitized NBD-cholesterol emission. Calculation of the energy transfer distances from either the decrease in StAR Trp emission or the appearance of sensitized NBD-cholesterol emission revealed that the StAR Trp and NBD-cholesterol were within 33 Å. This distance was in the range of those reported for other lipid-binding proteins (38Frolov A. Miller K. Billheimer J.T. Cho T.-C. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 55Frolov A.A. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11049-11055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data could not be accounted for by coaggregation of NBD-cholesterol with StAR.Second, the cholesterol binding affinity of StAR was calculated for the first time, establishing that StAR binds sterol with high affinity,Kd near 32 nm. This conclusion was based on data obtained from direct binding of fluorescent sterols (NBD-cholesterol with Kd near 32 nm; dehydroergosterol with Kd near 76 nm), FRET from StAR Trp to bound NBD-cholesterol (decreased StAR Trp emission), and FRET-induced sensitized emission from StAR-bound NBD-cholesterol. Native N-62 StAR bound sterol with 7.3-fold higher affinity than did the functionally inactive A218V N-62 StAR mutant. It should be noted that earlier preliminary data from this laboratory suggested that the full-length StAR protein binds NBD-cholesterol, but solubility problems with this protein preparation precluded accurate determination of binding parameters (56Liu Z. Frolov A. Schroeder F. Stocco D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54 (abstr. 549): 154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Likewise, the use of micromolar concentrations of radiolabeled cholesterol resulted in cholesterol aggregates that precluded determination ofKd of StAR for cholesterol (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).Third, it was shown for the first time that StAR has two ligand binding sites for cholesterol with similar low nanomolar Kdvalues. A direct NBD-cholesterol binding assay determined both cholesterol binding sites, whereas FRET-based binding assays detected only one of these sites. The basis for the latter observation was probably due to only one of these sites containing a Trp residue. The structure of the MLN64 START domain (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) suggests that this site is likely to be adjacent to Trp-241, which directly contributes to the hydrophobic tunnel and is in close proximity/orientation within the binding site for efficient FRET to bound NBD-cholesterol. Computer modeling of the MLN64 START domain (analogous to N-62 StAR) revealed a hydrophobic tunnel whose volume was estimated near 1900 Å3(26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This tunnel was postulated to be the ligand binding site. Because the volume occupied by cholesterol is about 741 Å3 (57Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Powell D. Incerpi S. Woodford J.K. Colles S.M. Myers-Payne S. Emge T. Hubbell T. Moncecchi D. Prows D.R. Heyliger C.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the 1900 Å3 hydrophobic tunnel in the MLN64 START domain (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) is sufficient to accommodate at least one or easily two cholesterol molecules. In addition, the MLN64 START hydrophobic tunnel contains two buried polar residues, Asp and Arg, each of which could provide an interaction site for a 3β-OH of each of two bound cholesterol molecules. The close sequence homology (35% identity) of N-62 StAR to the START domain of MLN64 as well as similar function in mediating cholesterol transfer for steroidogenesis (albeit in different types of tissues) (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) suggests that N-62 StAR may structurally adopt a similar hydrophobic tunnel/ligand binding cavity that may accommodate up to two cholesterol molecules. It should be noted that these observations showing two sterol binding sites in N-62 StAR were at variance with an earlier report wherein StAR bound radiolabeled cholesterol at a single sterol binding site (26Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It may be that problems with cholesterol solubility experienced in the latter work precluded accurate measurements of the number of binding sites therein.What is the functional significance of high affinity, low affinity sterol binding to StAR? High affinity, low capacity sterol binding is a general property of proteins that are capable of transferring sterols, SCP-2 (1Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P.

This binding activity appears to be critical for StAR action on mitochondrial membranes because a point mutation (A218V) that dramatically reduces affinity and capacity for sterol binding ablates the steroidogenic activity of StAR. Likewise, abolition of ligand binding to SCP-2 and liver fatty acid-binding protein also inhibits their ability to enhance membrane sterol transfer (60Woodford J.K. Colles S.M. Myers-Payne S. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 76: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 61Woodford J.K. Behnke W.D. Schroeder F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 152: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the hydrophobic tunnel of the START domain can accommodate two cholesterol molecules and possibly other hydrophobic molecules in addition to sterols. This high affinity hydrophobic ligand binding domain may well be the catalyst for membrane perturbation, forcing sterol ejection from the outer mitochondrial membrane.Fourth, cholesterol binding elicits a structural change in StAR. This observation was supported by circular dichroism and by the sigmoidal shape of the NBD-cholesterol binding curve (Fig. 3A). Circular dichroic data showed for the first time that cholesterol binding to StAR altered the secondary structure of StAR to reduce the proportion of α-helix. Furthermore, the sigmoidal shape of the NBD-cholesterol binding curve and the presence of two binding sites was consistent with a conformational/allosteric effect wherein binding of the first sterol altered the conformation of StAR to allow binding of a second sterol. The functional significance of these ligand-induced alterations in StAR secondary structure and conformation is not yet clear but may be related to the fact that sensitized emission of StAR-bound NBD-cholesterol occurred from only one ligand binding site. In addition, the ligand-induced change in StAR structure may play a role in altering the cholesterol domain structure of the mitochondrial membrane, thereby induce formation of rapidly transferable sterol domains as observed with mitochondria isolated from steroidogenic MA-10 cells.Fifth, StAR dramatically enhanced the initial rate of sterol transfer from the outer mitochondrial membrane. Our assay for sterol transfer detects the movement of probe (dehydroergosterol) from donor mitochondria to acceptor mitochondria, presumably the transfer of dehydroergosterol from the outer membrane of the donor to the outer membrane of the acceptor mitochondria. This assumption is predicated upon the fact that StAR did not cause a change in dehydroergosterol polarization when added to donor mitochondria in the absence of acceptor mitochondria. A change in polarization under these circumstances might be anticipated if StAR enhanced dehydroergosterol transfer from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Because the mitochondria were not incubated under conditions (i.e.incubation with an energy source for generation of required reducing equivalents) that support steroidogenesis (MA-10 cell mitochondria) or cholesterol side chain 27-hydroxylation (human fibroblast mitochondria), it is likely that the inner membrane substrate pool of cholesterol was occupied, limiting flux of dehydroergosterol to the inner membrane. This would be expected given the observation that a “back-up” of cholesterol resulting in cholesterol loading of the endoplasmic reticulum and, subsequently, conversion of free cholesterol into cholesteryl esters occurs when steroidogenic cells are incubated with an inhibitor of the mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme, aminoglutethimide (62Rosenblum M.F.

The relationship between MYPT1 isoform expression and smooth muscle responses to cGMP signaling in vivo has not been explored. MYPT1 isoforms that contain or lack a C-terminal leucine zipper are generated in birds and mammals by cassette-type alternative splicing of a 31-nucleotide exon. The avian and mammalian C-terminal isoforms are highly conserved and expressed in a tissue-specific fashion. In the mature chicken the tonic contracting aorta and phasic contracting gizzard exclusively express the leucine zipper positive and negative MYPT1 isoforms, respectively. Expression of the MYPT1 isoforms is also developmentally regulated in the gizzard, which switches from leucine zipper positive to negative isoforms around the time of hatching. This switch coincides with the development in the gizzard of a cGMP-resistant phenotype, i.e. inability to dephosphorylate myosin and relax in response to 8-bromo-cGMP after calcium activation. Furthermore, association of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I with MYPT1 is detected by immunoprecipitation only in the tissue that expresses the leucine zipper positive isoform of MYPT1.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5063-5068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Calcium desensitization is one of several proposed mechanisms by which the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI) effects smooth muscle relaxation (reviewed in Refs. 21Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 22Lincoln T.M. Komalavilias P. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 401-425Google Scholar). SMMP was recently suggested to be one of the final mediators of this calcium desensitization signaling pathway. SMMP activity is enhanced in vitro by dimerization of MYPT1 with the cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (cGKIα) via leucine zipper motifs present in the C terminus of MYPT1 and the N terminus of cGKIα (23Surks H.K.

It has long been appreciated that smooth muscle tissues display considerable diversity with respect to both their basic contractile properties as well as their responses to modulating signals (reviewed in Ref. 3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). As the NO/cGMP-mediated relaxation pathway was elucidated, it was also appreciated that smooth muscle tissues differ in their sensitivity to this pathway (24Diamond J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 225: 422-426PubMed Google Scholar, 25Miller V.M. Komori K. Burnett Jr., J.C. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1127-H1131PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pfitzer G. Merkel L. Ruegg J.C.

The molecular basis of this smooth muscle functional diversity is not well understood. Since SMMP is a target of signaling pathways that modulate smooth muscle tone, we hypothesized that SMMP isoform differences may play an important role in the variable response of smooth muscle tissues to this signal. In mammals isoforms of the MYPT1 subunit of SMMP have been identified that either contain or lack the C-terminal leucine zipper (8Johnson D. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D. Campbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the C-terminal leucine zipper motif has not been identified previously in chicken MYPT1, yet it is highly conserved in mammals and the worm (reviewed in Ref. 29Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that chicken MYPT1 isoforms that contain or lack the C-terminal leucine zipper are generated by cassette-type alternative splicing of a 31-nucleotide (nt) alternative exon. The MYPT1 isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Tissues that express MYPT1 isoforms that lack the C-terminal leucine zipper fail to calcium desensitize in response to cGMP, and the phenotypic switch of the gizzard at hatching from MYPT1 leucine zipper positive to negative coincides with a switch from sensitivity to resistance to cGMP-mediated calcium desensitization. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the differential sensitivity of smooth muscle tissues to the calcium-desensitizing (relaxing) effect of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway. Fertile White Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs were obtained from Squire Valleevue Farm (Cleveland, OH) and incubated at 38 °C in humidified air. Organs were harvested (after decapitation) from embryonic chicks from 8 to 21 days of incubation (hatching is 21 days) and from chicks 1–12 days after hatching. Organs from Harlan Sprague-Dawley adult rats (Rattus norvegicus) were harvested after lethal CO2 inhalation. After organs were stripped of adventitia, the smooth muscle tissues were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA isolated as described previously (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of MYPT1 and M21 isoform splice variants was performed by RT-PCR using total RNA as described previously (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Oligonucleotide primer sets were designed with the PRIMER SELECT program (DNASTAR) to bracket the alternative exons and thus amplify alternative exon included and excluded transcripts in a single reaction. The following sets of primers, listed 5′–3′, were used in these RT-PCR reactions: to chicken MYPT1 at +2888 TAGAAAAAGAAGATAGCACTG and +3203 CATTTTCATCTTTTAGCCTCTGG that generated 347- and 316-bp DNA fragments; to rat MYPT1 at +2470 GARAAAMGRMGRTCTACWGGA and +2968 GCCTCTGGTTGTCTGCYTTYA that generated 530- and 499-bp DNA fragments; and to chicken M21 at +729 GCTCGAGCTGGCAGACATCAA and +1028 GCGTGGGGCAGGAGGAAG that generated 367- and 300-nt fragments. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through a 2% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and images captured with a GelDoc 1000 (Bio-Rad). Bands were quantified directly using MultiAnalyst/MacIntosh software (Bio-Rad). Omission of RT in PCRs yielded no product (data not shown). The accuracy of the measured isoform ratios was determined by varying the amount of input RNA and observing a constant ratio, as described previously (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F.V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Selected products of the RT-PCR were cloned and sequenced by standard techniques (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine their identity. Total DNA was isolated from chicken liver tissue using the Puregene DNA Isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.). A PCR-amplified genomic fragment of theMYPT1 gene was generated using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the oligonucleotide primers listed above. The ∼4.6-kilobase fragment was subcloned and sequenced by standard methods. Greater than 95% of the genomic clone was sequenced in both directions, with the remainder sequenced in one direction. The sequence of the exon splice sites was confirmed by sequencing these portions from a second, independent PCR clone. Chicken gizzard and aorta strips (250–1000 × 80–150 × 20–150 μm) were prepared as described previously (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strips were mounted between two aluminum foil T clips and permeabilized (skinned) at room temperature for 15 (gizzard) or 30 min (aorta) in relaxing solution (pCa 9 (in mm), 60 potassium methane sulfonate (KMS), 5 EGTA, 0.02 CaCl2, 9.26 MgCl2, 5.2 ATP, 25 creatine phosphate, 25 BES, final pH to 7.1 with 1 n KOH) containing 400 μmβ-escin. Following skinning, the tissues were mounted onto the stage of a computer-controlled mechanics work station. One end of the tissue strip was hooked to a length driver (Physik Instrumente, Waldbron, Germany) and the other to a force transducer (Akers AE 801 Sensor, Horten, Norway). The strips were stretched to the optimum length for force production (1.3 times their resting length) and allowed to equilibrate in a well of relaxing solution (pCa 9) for 30 min. Contractions were initiated by transferring the strips to a well containing activating solution (pCa 4 (in mm),58.33 KMS, 5 EGTA, 5.19 CaCl2, 4.43 MgCl2, 5.27 ATP, 25 creatine phosphate, 25 BES, final pH to 7.1 with 1n KOHm or pCa 6 (in mm), 61 KMS, 5 EGTA, 3.92 CaCl2, 8.94 MgCl2, 5.20 ATP, 25 creatine phosphate, 25 BES, final pH to 7.1 with 1 n KOH). After force reached steady state, the strips were transferred to wells containing activating solution (pCa 4/pCa 6) as well as progressively increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP (Sigma) (10−7–10−4 m). Finally, strips were transferred to relaxing solution (pCa 9) to demonstrate complete relaxation. A force versus time tracing was recorded on a digital oscilloscope (Nicolet). This tracing was used to calculate the mean percent force reduction in response to 8-Br-cGMP from maximal (pCa 4) and submaximal (pCa 6) activation. Results are reported as the mean force reduction ± S.D. Additional activated strips were transferred to a well containing activating solution (pCa 4) and 1-(5-chloronaphthalenesulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine (ML-9, 200 μm), a selective MLCK inhibitor (32Saitoh M. Ishikawa T. Matsushima S. Naka M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cGMP (10−4 m). A force versus time tracing was used to determine the rate of relaxation. Results are reported as the mean t½for relaxation ± S.D. To determine the extent of phosphorylation of MLC20, a glycerol/urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis procedure (33Hathaway D.R. Haeberle J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C345-C351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was adapted to resolve the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of MLC20 using a mini-gel apparatus (Hoeffer). Chicken aortic and gizzard strips were prepared and mounted as described above. To measure the effects of calcium concentration and 8-Br-cGMP on MLC20 phosphorylation, strips were incubated inpCa 9, 4, or 4 with 8-Br-cGMP (10−4m) until steady state force was achieved as indicated by force versus time tracings. Strips were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled acetone containing 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) over 5 min followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were washed in acetone containing 10 mm DTT three times to remove excess trichloroacetic acid and air-dried for 30 min after the final wash. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized, placed in 50 μl of sample buffer (8 m urea, 10 mmDTT, glycerol (5% v/v), bromphenol blue (0.1% w/v)), and allowed to extract for 1 h, with frequent vortexing, at room temperature. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), 40% glycerol (v/v) gel (20 mm Tris, pH 8.6; 22 mm glycine) for 3 h at 400 V. Resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in transfer buffer (25 mmTris, pH 8.2; 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol (v/v)) at 220 mA for 20 min. Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) for 1 h, incubated with a monoclonal antibody against MLC20 (mouse IgM clone MY-21, Sigma) for 1 h, washed for 1 h, and incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, Sigma) for 1 h. Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:3000 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (v/v) in wash buffer. After final washing, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of MLC20 were detected by developing the membrane in alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 9.5; 650 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 400 mmnitro blue tetrazolium). Membranes were digitally scanned (UMAX), and bands were subsequently quantified using Scion Image Beta 4.0.2 software (Scion Corp.). The percentage of MLC20phosphorylated was calculated by determining the ratio of the phosphorylated MLC20 band versus the total MLC20 (phosphorylated + unphosphorylated species) identified by the monoclonal antibody. Results are reported as mean phosphorylated MLC20 ± S.D. Chicken aortic and gizzard strips were harvested and permeabilized as described above and subsequently incubated in pCa 4 activating solution treated with 8-Br-cGMP (10−4 m) or an equal volume of vehicle alone (PSS) for 15 min. In addition, aortas were harvested from Harlan Sprague-Dawley adult rats (R. norvegicus) after lethal CO2 inhalation. Vessels were quickly removed, rinsed in PSS containing 1.6 mmCaCl2 (PSS-Ca), stripped of fat and adventitia, and dissected into small smooth muscle strips (∼5 × 2 × 2 mm). Rat strips were activated by incubation in PSS-Ca containing KCl (80 mm) substituted isotonically for NaCl in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cGMP (10−4 m) for 15 min. Both rat and chicken strips were homogenized in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl, Triton X (1% v/v), protease inhibitor mixture (10% v/v, Sigma)) on ice. Lysates were sonicated for 10 s on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Total protein of the clarified lysates was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). A 100-μg aliquot of lysate was precleared with 10% v/v protein G-agarose bead solution (Sigma, 50% v/v in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and supernatant was collected. Precleared lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either a monoclonal antibody against chicken MYPT1 (mouse IgG1/κ clone ASC.M130, Babco, 1:1000) or a polyclonal antibody against the common C terminus of cGKI (rabbit IgG clone anti-PKG CT, Stressgen, 1:100). A 10% v/v protein G-agarose bead solution was added to the lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the pellet washed twice with lysis buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 50 mm DTT, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by electrophoresis through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) for 1 h at 25 mA. Resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in transfer buffer (25 mmTris, pH 8.2; 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol (v/v)) at 230 mA for 45 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in wash buffer for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed for 30 min, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. Blots of lysates immunoprecipitated with ASC.MI30 were probed with primary antibody anti-PKG CT (1:800) followed by secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cappel, 1:15,000). Blots of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-PKG CT were probed with primary antibody ASC.M130 (1:1000) followed by secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad, 1:1600). After the final washing, the signals were visualized with a chemiluminescent reaction (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). To characterize the MYPT1 isoforms, we cloned a chicken MYPT1 3′ genomic fragment. Comparison with cDNA obtained by RT-PCR of transcripts from chicken smooth muscle tissues indicated that cassette-type alternative splicing of a 31-nt exon gave rise to MYPT1 leucine zipper positive and negative isoforms (Fig. 1). Skipping of the 3′ alternative exon coded for the leucine zipper positive isoform of MYPT1. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal leucine zipper was identical in birds and mammals and shared 75% identity (18/24 residues) with the worm homologue mel-11 (34Wissmann A. Ingles J. McGhee J.D. Mains P.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Inclusion of the 31-nt alternative exon shifted the reading frame and introduced a premature stop codon, resulting in an MYPT1 C terminus lacking a leucine zipper. This amino acid sequence showed 85% identity (17:20 residues) between birds and mammals and was not found in the worm. The M21 subunit of SMMP appears to have a similar scheme for the generation of C-terminal leucine zipper positive and negative isoforms (35Mabuchi K. Gong B.J. Langsetmo K. Ito M. Nakano T. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The M21 leucine zipper amino acid sequences were identical in birds and mammals (Fig. 1) and were highly similar to the MYPT1 leucine zipper sequence (96% identity, 23:24 residues). A gene homologous to M21 has not been identified in the worm. We examined the expression of C-terminal variant MYPT1 and M21 isoforms in the mature and developing chicken as a first step in determining the relationship between SMMP isoform expression and sensitivity to cGMP-mediated signaling. We demonstrated previously that 1) the mature tonic aorta and phasic gizzard tissues are the most pure and distinct with respect to the expression of contractile protein isoforms and 2) developmental changes in gene expression in these tissues correlate with their contractile properties (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F.V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1722-C1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus providing a dynamic model for examining the functional significance of contractile protein isoform expression. In the adult chicken the aorta, a tonic smooth muscle tissue, expressed exon-excluded transcripts (coding for the leucine zipper) of MYPT1 and M21 nearly exclusively (Fig. 2). The phasic gizzard smooth muscle expressed exon-included transcripts (coding for absence of the leucine zipper) almost exclusively. Other smooth muscle-containing tissues, such as intestine and lung, contained combinations of exon-included and exon-excluded transcripts. This pattern of expression was conserved in mammalian smooth muscle tissues. The rat aorta (tonic) expressed predominantly exon-excluded MYPT1 transcripts, and other tissues such as the portal vein, uterus, and intestine contained combinations of exon-included and exon-excluded transcripts (Fig. 3).Figure 3Expression of rat MYPT1 leucine zipper variable isoforms is similar to that of the chicken. RT-PCR products from various smooth muscle tissues were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide.

PV, portal vein; UTER, uterus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Throughout chick aorta development the expression of the exon-excluded, leucine zipper positive MYPT1 and M21 isoforms was invariant (Fig.4 and data not shown). In contrast the gizzard MYPT1 and M21 transcripts switched from exon exclusion to exon inclusion (leucine zipper negative) around the time of hatching (21 days) (Fig. 4). During this transition an intermediate sized isoform was evident in MYPT1 that arose from a cryptic splice site within the alternative exon (Fig. 1). The isoform switch in the gizzard was synchronous with an opposite switch in splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon but much later than transitions in myosin heavy and light chain isoforms (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously (30Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that there is a corresponding transition in the gizzard MYPT1 protein from the larger to the smaller isoform, whereas in the developing aorta only the larger isoform is detected. The difference in the isoforms of 66 amino acids when the central alternative exon is included and the 3′ alternative exon is excluded is consistent with their estimated size difference of 7 kDa by electrophoretic separation (37Okubo S. Ito M. Takashiba Y. Ichikawa K. Miyahara M. Shimizu H. Konishi T. Shima H. Nagao M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This differs from the widely quoted M133/130 isoforms in the chicken due to a lack of appreciation of the presence of the C-terminal leucine zipper in the chicken MYPT1 (reviewed in Ref. 29Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of proteins derived from MYPT1 plasmid expression vectors showed that M137 and M130 arise from the translation of exon in/out and out/in (central/C terminus alternative exons) transcripts (data not shown). The MYPT1 isoform switching was recapitulated by a growth stimulusin vitro (data not shown). Gizzard smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture skipped the 3′ alternative exon when processing the MYPT1 transcript, resulting in the MYPT1 leucine zipper positive isoform. Aortic SMCs in culture also skipped the alternative exon, as they do in vivo. Thus, as in the case of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain, and the MYPT1 central alternative ex"

However, reports were divergent with regard to thein vivo interaction between this polymorphism and postprandial lipemia. We therefore determined the influence of this intestinal fatty acid-binding protein polymorphism on intestinal fat transport using the human jejunal organ culture model, thus avoiding the interference of various circulating factors capable of metabolizingin vivo postprandial lipids. Analysis of DNA samples from 32 fetal intestines revealed 22 homozygotes for the wild-type Ala-54/Ala-54 genotype (0.83) and 10 heterozygotes for the polymorphic Thr-54/Ala-54 genotype (0.17). The Thr-encoding allele was associated with increased secretion of newly esterified triglycerides, augmented de novo apolipoprotein B synthesis, and elevated chylomicron output. On the other hand, no alterations were found in very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein production, apolipoprotein A-I biogenesis, or microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mass and activity. Similarly, the alanine to threonine substitution at residue 54 did not result in changes in brush border hydrolytic activities (sucrase, glucoamylase, lactase, and alkaline phosphatase) or in glucose uptake or oxidation. Our data clearly document that the A54T polymorphism of FABP2 specifically influences small intestinal lipid absorption without modifying glucose uptake or metabolism. It is proposed that, in the absence of confounding factors such as environmental and genetic variables, the FABP2 polymorphism has an important effect on postprandial lipids in vivo, potentially influencing plasma levels of lipids and atherogenesis.

After the digestive phase, the lipolytic products are absorbed by the enterocyte, in which a complex series of sequential events result in their packaging as chylomicrons (1Davidson N.O. Magun A.M.

Nutr. 1987; 7: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, its specific function remains unclear. It is encoded by the FABP2 gene, located in the long arm of chromosome 4 (8Lowe J.B. Sacchettini J.C. Laposata M. McQuillam J.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5931-5937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cohn S.M. Simon T.C. Roth K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The G to A polymorphism of codon 54 of the FABP2 gene results in the substitution of a Thr (mutated-type) in I-FABP (10Baier L.J. Sacchettini J.C. Knowler W.C. Eads J. Paolisso G. Tataranni P.A. Hisayoshi M. Bennett P.H. Bogardus C. Prochazka M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This Thr variant exhibits a 2-fold greater affinity for long-chain FA compared with Ala-containing I-FABP (wild-type) in vitro (10Baier L.J. Sacchettini J.C. Knowler W.C. Eads J. Paolisso G. Tataranni P.A. Hisayoshi M. Bennett P.H. Bogardus C. Prochazka M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vivo studies reveal that the Thr-encoding allele is associated with insulin resistance and enhanced fat oxidation rates among Pima Indians, a group known to have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (10Baier L.J. Sacchettini J.C. Knowler W.C. Eads J. Paolisso G. Tataranni P.A. Hisayoshi M. Bennett P.H. Bogardus C. Prochazka M. J. Clin.

Rev. 1990; 6: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A similar association observed among aboriginal Canadians between the Thr-54 I-FABP allele and elevated plasma triglycerides supports the hypothesis that this polymorphism is related to an increased affinity to dietary long-chain FA and enhanced intestinal lipid uptake (12Hegele R.A. Connelly P.W. Hanley A.J.G. Sun F. Harris S.B. Zinman B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This same polymorphism was further associated with increased fat transport in Caco-2 cells (13Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10892-10896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and postprandial lipemic response (14Agren J.J. Valve R. Vidgren H. Laakso M. Uusitupa M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other reports did not confirm the role of the Thr-54 allele in lipid and glucose metabolism. The same mutation in a Finnish population had no impact on the FA composition of plasma lipids, the basal metabolic rate, or the insulin, glucose, and lipid levels (15Sipiläinen R. Uusitupa M.

Clin. Invest. 1997; 27: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, the increased lipid oxidation and postprandial response associated with the Thr-54 allele may be due to various confounding in vivofactors, including insulin resistance, fasting triglyceride concentrations, and various polymorphisms of apo-E, apo-C-II, lipoprotein lipase, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (16Jeppesen J. Holleebeck C.B. Zhou M.-Y. Coulston A.M. Jones C. Chen Y.-D.I. Reaven G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,18Berg K. Acta Genet. Med.

Additionally, the Ala-to-Thr shift in I-FABP may alter the amount of absorbed FA transported by the portal route to the liver (21Mansbach C.M., II Dowell R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G1082-G1089PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, recent experimental studies in mice and studies using Caco-2 cells have suggested that I-FABP is not essential for dietary fat absorption (22Vassileva G. Huwyler L. Poirier K. Agellon L.B. Toth M.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Darimont C. Gradoux N. Persohn E. Cumin F. De Pover A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 84-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms of I-FABP and intracellular lipid transport in the human intestine. We also sought to determine how the Thr-encoding allele influences lipid esterification, de novo synthesis of apolipoproteins A-I and B, and the secretion of lipoproteins, as well as glucose uptake and metabolism. To address these issues in vitro, we utilized an organ culture of human intestine with fetal explants. This represents a unique experimental model to further our understanding of the complex biosynthetic molecular events essential to the formation and secretion of lipoproteins in the human intestine (24Levy E. Ménard D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 49: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Levy E. Thibault L. Ménard D. J.

Thus, the intestine organ culture model affords the opportunity to investigate the functional role of polymorphisms of I-FABP while minimizing the influence of the many confounding factors seen in the in vivo situation, thus facilitating the interpretation of data. Intestinal tissue was obtained from 32 normal fetuses at 17–20 weeks of gestation after elective pregnancy terminations. No specimens were collected from cases associated with any congenital abnormalities or fetal deaths. Studies were approved by the institutional Human Subject Review Board. The entire small intestine was immersed in Leibovitz L-15 medium containing garamycin (40 µg/ml) and transported immediately to the laboratory at room temperature. The proximal half of the intestine excluding the first 3 cm was used and defined as jejunum. The jejunum was cleansed of mesentery, split longitudinally, washed in culture medium, and cut into explants (3 × 7 mm). An average of 10–15 explants were randomly transferred onto a lens paper and placed mucosal side up into each organ culture dish (Falcon Plastics, Los Angeles, CA). Six dishes were used for each experimental condition. 0.8 ml of Leibovitz L-15 medium was added to the central well of each culture dish, a volume sufficient to dampen the tissue without immersing it (29Ménard D. Arsenault P. Gastroenterology. 1985; 88: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Explants were cultured in serum-free L-15 medium as described previously (25Levy E.

After an initial 3-h stabilization period, the medium was refreshed with a final concentration of 1.0 µmol/ml unlabeled oleic acid with 0.3 µCi of [14C]oleic acid (specific activity, 53.9 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (25Levy E.

Explants originating from each fetus were genotyped for the FABP2 A54T polymorphism (10Baier L.J. Sacchettini J.C. Knowler W.C. Eads J. Paolisso G. Tataranni P.A. Hisayoshi M. Bennett P.H. Bogardus C. Prochazka M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Lipid analyses were carried out on both the tissue and culture media. The morphological integrity of the jejunal explants was confirmed at the onset and after 5 days of culture, as described previously (31Ménard D. Arsenault P. Pothier P. Gastroenterology. 1988; 53: 319-326Google Scholar). To provide a carrier for lipoproteins synthesized in vitro, postprandial plasma was obtained from healthy volunteers 3 h after the ingestion of fat (50 g/1.73 m2), as described previously (25Levy E. Thibault L. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1607-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Levy E. Thibault L. Delvin E. Ménard D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

After incubation, the explants were homogenized in isotonic saline containing antibacterial and antiprotease agents (0.01% sodium azide, 0.1% EDTA, and 10,000 (kallitrein inactivating units (kiu)/ml Trasylol). The medium was mixed with the plasma lipid carrier (2:1) (v/v), and the lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation using a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc., Montreal, Canada), as described previously (25Levy E. Thibault L. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1607-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Loirdighi N. Ménard D. Delvin D. Levy E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the removal of the 0.97 g/ml density fraction by centrifugation using a TLS 55 rotor (20,000 rpm for 20 min), lipoproteins with density < 1.006 g/ml were separated by spinning at 100,000 × gfor 2.26 h with a TL 100.3 rotor at 5 °C. The high density fraction was obtained by adjusting the infranatant to a density of 1.21 g/ml and by centrifugation for 6.5 h at 100,000 rpm. Each lipoprotein fraction was exhaustively dialyzed against 0.15m NaCl and 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.0, at 4 °C for 24 h. After the incubation period in the presence of unlabeled oleic acid to stimulate the synthesis of lipids and apoproteins, jejunal explants were washed twice with methionine-free Leibovitz medium. They were then incubated in the same medium containing unlabeled oleic acid for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine (300 µCi/ml; specific activity, 1062 Ci/mmol) (27Levy E.

Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1263-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the labeling period, explants were washed three times and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate and 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm methionine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzemidine. Aliquots of tissue homogenates were then treated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the protein precipitates were washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The radioactivity was then determined using a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman Instruments Inc.). Another aliquot of the homogenate was also centrifuged (4 °C) at 105,000 ×g for 60 min in a 50-Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.) to determine apolipoprotein levels. The immunoprecipitation of apo-A-I and apo-B was then carried out on supernatants with excess specific monoclonal antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Pansorbin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was then added, and the mixture was reincubated at 20 °C for 60 min. The immunoprecipitate was washed extensively and analyzed by a linear 4–20% acrylamide gradient preceded by a 3% stacking gel, as described previously (27Levy E. Loirdighi N. Thibault L. Nguyen T.D.

Gels were sectioned into 4-mm slices and counted after an overnight incubation at 20 °C with 1 ml of BTS-450 (Beckman Instruments Inc.) in 10 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Ready solvent; Beckman Instruments Inc.). DNA from intestinal explants was isolated (34Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17972) Google Scholar), and genotyping was performed using the solid-phase minisequencing method (35Syvänen A.C. Sajantila A. Lukka M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 46-59PubMed Google Scholar). Three different primers were used. First, exon 2 of FABP2 was amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-ACAGGTGTTAATATAGTGAAAAGG-3′ and reverse biotinylated primer 5′-TACCCTGAGTTCAGTTCCGTCTGC-3′. The product was analyzed using detection primer 5′-TCACAGTCAAAGAATCAAGC-3′ in a single-step extension reaction in avidine-coated wells with a radiolabeled nucleotide (either G or A). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturing at 95 °C, annealing at 60 °C, and extension at 72 °C, each for 30 s for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR reaction volume was 40 µl. The reaction temperature for detection was 50 °C. After incubating explants in the presence of unlabeled oleic acid, RNA was extracted and amplified by PCR to determine apo-B and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. All these techniques were described in detail previously (28Levy E. Sinnett D. Thibault L. Nguyen T.D. Delvin E. Ménard D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Aliquots of explant homogenates and their respective incubation media were lipid-extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) (v/v) (36Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small amounts of lipid standards were added to the samples before separation of individual lipid classes by one-dimensional silica gel TLC (Eastman Kodak Co.), as described previously (25Levy E. Thibault L. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1607-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Levy E. Beaulieu J.-F. Delvin E. Seidman E. Yotov W. Basque J.-R. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 12-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nonpolar solvent system was hexane:diethylether:glacial acetic acid (80:20:3) (v/v/v). The radioactivity of the separated fractions was measured using a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Quenching was corrected using computerized curves generated with external standards. An aliquot of the tissue homogenate was used for protein determinations (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolytic activities of sucrase, glucoamylase, lactase, and alkaline phosphatase of cultured explants were assayed as described by Ménard et al. (31Ménard D. Arsenault P. Pothier P. Gastroenterology. 1988; 53: 319-326Google Scholar). Glucose oxidation was measured by incubating jejunal explants with d-[U-14C]glucose (specific activity) and collecting 14CO2 by soaking paper rolls in hyamine hydroxyde (39Kalderon B. Gutman A. Levy E. Shafrir E. Adler J.H. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The activity and mass of intestinal microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) were evaluated as described previously (40Levy E. Stan S. Garofalo S. Delvin E.E. Seidman E.G. Ménard D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G563-G571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of I-FABP polymorphisms among the 32 intestinal specimens revealed 22 homozygotes for the FABP2 Ala-54/Ala-54 genotype, 1 homozygote for the Thr/Thr genotype, and 9 heterozygotes for the FABP2 Thr-54/Ala-54 genotype. Thus, the frequencies of the alanine-encoding (Ala-54) and threonine-encoding (Thr-54) FABP2 alleles were determined to be 0.83 and 0.17, respectively. Similar prevalences were observed in Caucasians and among Pima Indians (10Baier L.J. Sacchettini J.C. Knowler W.C. Eads J. Paolisso G. Tataranni P.A. Hisayoshi M. Bennett P.H. Bogardus C. Prochazka M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 14Agren J.J. Valve R. Vidgren H. Laakso M. Uusitupa M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Metab. 1997; 82: 2629-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because only one subject was found to be homozygous for the Thr-54 allele, his data were pooled with those of the Thr-54/Ala-54 heterozygotes. Subsequent experiments were carried out to determine whether the alanine to threonine substitution in the FABP2 gene product results in altered intestinal lipid transport. The incorporation of labeled oleic acid by intestinal explants was used to quantify the rate of synthesis of total lipids as well as that of the specific lipid classes. As shown in Fig.1, lipid synthesis was significantly greater in explants expressing the Thr-54 I-FABP variant. Analysis of the different lipid classes by TLC revealed that triglyceride and phospholipid esterification was significantly augmented (∼16% and 35%, respectively) in jejunal explants with the Thr-54-containing I-FABP compared with wild-type jejunal explants (Fig.2A). Similarly, the secretion of labeled triglycerides was higher (∼41%) in the medium of the heterozygous I-FABP tissue (Fig. 2 B). No significant variations were noted in phospholipid and cholesteryl ester export. When lipid composition was assessed as a percentage of total lipid distribution, no significant differences were noted between the two groups (Table I). Overall, our findings suggest that the expression of Thr/Ala I-FABP is characterized primarily by an increased synthesis and secretion of triglycerides, the major class of dietary lipids.Figure 2Incorporation of [14C]oleic acid substrate into lipid classes.

Lipid classes in tissue homogenates and their media were then extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1), isolated by TLC, and quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results represent the percentage of total 14C-lipid distribution. Experiments were also conducted to examine the impact of the I-FABP polymorphism on the transport of newly synthesized lipids by lipoproteins. Culture supernatants were collected and immediately ultracentrifuged to separate chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, and high density lipoproteins. As expected from the aforementioned lipid data, alterations in lipoprotein exocytosis were found in association with the Thr-encoding allele (Fig.3). The secretion of chylomicrons, the predominant lipoprotein fraction incorporating [14C]oleic acid, was greater in jejunal explants with Thr-containing I-FABP than in those with Ala-containing I-FABP. Very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein production was not significantly different between tissues with the Thr-encoding allele of the FABP2 gene and tissues with the Ala-encoding allele of the FABP2 gene. Our data thus suggest that chylomicrons are the predominant lipoprotein particles, which are influenced by the I-FABP polymorphism. The next set of experiments was designed to examine the effect of I-FABP polymorphism on the process of apolipoprotein biogenesis. Their synthesis was estimated by the incorporation of [35S]methionine, with subsequent immunoprecipitation and separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incubation of jejunal I-FABP polymorphic explants with [35S]methionine resulted in increased apolipoprotein synthesis and secretion of apo-B-48 and apo-B-100, whereas the magnitude of apo-A-I production was not modified by the Ala to Thr shift in I-FABP (TableII). To determine whether the increase in apo-B synthesis associated with FABP2 gene polymorphism was related to augmented apo-B mRNA expression, reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed. No significant effect of the I-FABP polymorphism was noted on the abundance of apo-B mRNA (Fig.4) because the relative apo-B mRNA levels (expressed as average ratio values of apo mRNA:glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA) in three experiments were similar between Thr-54 carriers and Ala-54 homozygotes (0.96 ± 0.11 versus 1.07 ± 0.13, respectively). This suggests that co-translational or posttranslational mechanisms may be responsible for the regulation of apo-B formation in the presence of Thr-containing I-FABP. An extensive body of literature suggests that apo-B mRNA levels are relatively stable and generally do not change under conditions that alter extracellular apo-B secretion (27Levy E. Loirdighi N."

We show that transposition of an axin-binding site can confer β-catenin regulatory activity to a fragment of APC normally lacking this activity. The fragment containing the axin-binding site also underwent hyperphosphorylation when coexpressed with axin. The phosphorylation did not require glycogen synthase kinase 3β but instead required casein kinase 1ε, which bound directly to axin. Mutation of conserved serine residues in the β-catenin regulatory motifs of APC interfered with both axin-dependent phosphorylation and phosphorylation by CKIε and impaired the ability of APC to regulate β-catenin. These results suggest that the axin-dependent phosphorylation of APC is mediated in part by CKIε and is involved in the regulation of APC function.

Mutation of conserved serine residues in the β-catenin regulatory motifs of APC interfered with both axin-dependent phosphorylation and phosphorylation by CKIε and impaired the ability of APC to regulate β-catenin. These results suggest that the axin-dependent phosphorylation of APC is mediated in part by CKIε and is involved in the regulation of APC function. adenomatous polyposis coli glycogen synthase kinase 3β casein kinase 1ε N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide Mutations that interfere with the ability of cells to regulate β-catenin have been identified in a wide variety of human cancers (reviewed in Ref. 1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases the mutations occur in the β-catenin gene (CTNNb1) itself, affecting specific amino acids that are integral to the ubiquitin-dependent targeted degradation of the protein. In other cases, proteins that facilitate the process of β-catenin degradation are instead mutated, and the wild type β-catenin protein assumes a prolonged half-life. In either scenario the outcome is aberrant transcription of genes that are activated by β-catenin signaling. Two of the proteins that facilitate the turnover of β-catenin are axin and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)1 protein, both of which bind directly to β-catenin (2Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M.

The APC tumor suppressor was identified as the gene responsible for a heritable predisposition to colorectal cancer, referred to as familial polyposis coli, and is also mutated in most sporadic colorectal cancers (7Miyoshi Y.

Axin was shown to regulate negatively wnt-1 signaling, and its direct association with APC, β-catenin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is consistent with its involvement in the wnt-1pathway (2Behrens J.

Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Recently, mutations that inactivate axin were identified in a subset of human hepatocellular cancers and cancer cell lines (15Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Thus, APC and axin function in concert to regulate β-catenin, and the inactivation of either of these genes, or the mutational activation of β-catenin, contributes to the oncogenic state of transformed cells. A multiprotein complex consisting minimally of APC, Dishevelled, GSK3β, and protein phosphatase PP2A, all of which bind directly to independent sites on axin (16Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), regulates the stability of β-catenin. β-Catenin binds directly to both APC and axin, and its phosphorylation by GSK3β leads to its recognition by a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase containing the F box protein β-TRCP (17Marikawa Y. Elinson R.P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Liu C. Kato Y. Zhang Z. Do V.M. Yankner B.A. He X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dev. 1999; 80: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution experiments have demonstrated that the association of axin with APC enhances the binding of β-catenin to axin and consequently facilitates the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β (21Hinoi T. Yamamoto H. Kishida M. Takada S. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34399-34406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). APC is also phosphorylated by GSK3β, which is thought to promote entry of β-catenin into the complex by increasing the binding affinity of β-catenin for APC (22Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of APC by GSK3β is also enhanced by the binding of β-catenin to axin. Although this multiprotein complex has the capacity to promote the degradation of β-catenin, it might also serve as a nexus for incoming signals that stabilize β-catenin, thereby activating gene transcription. The stabilization of β-catenin occurs in response to stimulation of the Wnt-1 receptor, which signals through Dishevelled to inhibit GSK3β. It is not clear how the Wnt receptors communicate with Dishevelled, but the subsequent inactivation of GSK3β might involve the GSK3β-binding protein GBP/FRAT, which binds to Dishevelled (23Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 24Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H.R. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Additional regulatory molecules are likely involved, and recent work has implicated casein kinase 1ε (CKIε) in the propagation of the wnt signal (26Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 27Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CKIε in Xenopus embryos resulted in the duplication of the dorsal axis, a phenotype typically observed following overexpression of wnt-1. Additional experiments demonstrated that CKIε associated with and phosphorylated Dishevelled, and expression of a kinase-inactive mutant interfered with the activation of β-catenin signaling by wnt-1. These results implicated CKIε as a positive mediator of wnt signaling. We have investigated the interaction between APC and axin, and we show this is necessary for the down-regulation of β-catenin by APC in mammalian cells. APC was also phosphorylated in response to binding axin, in a manner that did not require the association of GSK3β with axin. Our results suggest that APC is a substrate for CKIε, which binds directly to axin, and that the sites phosphorylated by it are involved in the regulation of β-catenin. SW480 cells were derived from a human colorectal cancer (ATCC reference CCL228); 293 cells are an immortalized embryonic kidney cell line (ATCC reference CRL1573), and SNU475 is a human hepatocellular cancer cell line (ATCC CRL2236). Growth conditions were according to ATCC guidelines. The construct APC f2-7 (28Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar) codes for amino acids 1342–2075 of the full-length APC sequence and was previously designated APC25 (4Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The fbc1,2 construct used in Fig. 1 codes for amino acids 1121–1476 of the full-length APC sequence and in all other experiments codes for amino acids 1121–1409. For the generation of AxBs constructs the original fbc1,2 construct was digested with Van91I/NotI and annealed to linkers containing the individual axin-binding sites consisting of the following sequences followed by a stop codon: AxBs1,1571DIEILEECIISAMPTKS1587; AxBs2,1720EGDILAECINSAMPKGK1736; AxBs3,2035EDDLLQECISSAMPKK- K2051. All serine mutations were introduced by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChangeTM, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were confirmed using an ABI sequencer. FRAT 1 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Sheelagh Frame) was subcloned into a modified version of pcDNA3 (PCAN) as anEcoRI fragment. Full-length human axin and fragments thereof have been described previously (11Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, they have been renumbered with reference to the first methionine as it occurs in the published cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF009674). Axin fragments 513–713, 513–900, 320–749, 749–900, and 320–900, as reported previously (11Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been renumbered as 475–756, 475–827, 284–712, 712–827, and 284–827, respectively. Full-length human axin was used as a template to introduce L396P substitution by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNAs coding for β-catenin and GSK3β have been described previously (22Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The cDNA for casein kinase Iε was subcloned from human EST clone 741211 (GenBankTM accession number AA402705) as anEcoRV/NotI fragment into PCAN Myc. This clone was lacking the first 22 amino acids that were regenerated by annealing synthetic linkers to include amino acids 1–22. The kinase-dead version of casein kinase Iε was generated by in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis to change the catalytic lysine at amino acid 38 to an arginine. Wild type and kinase dead-CKIε was subcloned as anNco/Xba fragment into theNco/Nhe sites of pGBT8, a yeast two-hybrid vector containing the GAL4-binding domain. The polyclonal antibodies raised against the central region of APC (APC2) have been described previously (6Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.C. Masiarz F. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody to β-catenin was described previously (22Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar), and monoclonal antibody to β-catenin was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies to GSK3β and CKIε were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and polyclonal antibodies to axin were raised in rabbits as described previously (11Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to the Myc epitope have been described elsewhere (29Evan G. Lewis G. Ramsey G. Bishop J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) and were partially purified on DE52 cellulose for use in our studies. For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0% Triton X-100, 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 µg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin), and ∼300 µl of lysate containing 2 mg of total protein each was incubated with the appropriate antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were recovered using protein A- or G-Sepharose, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml each of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and finally eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For Western blotting, polyclonal sera were used at 1:1000 dilution, affinity-purified anti-APC2 at 0.2 µg/ml, and anti-Myc at 1 µg/ml. Blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunofluorescent detection of β-catenin in fixed whole cells was carried out as described previously (4Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The transfected SW480 cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in methanol, and stained using mouse monoclonal antibodies to β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories). The cells were costained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei. SW480 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with 0.75 µg of pTopflash (provided by H. Clevers), 0.25 µg of Renillaluciferase (pRL SV40), and 1–3 µg of indicated plasmid using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Media were changed at 24 h post-transfection, and cells were lysed after an additional 24 h in 300 µl of lysis buffer as described above. Duplicate 10-µl aliquots were assayed using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). An aliquot of each sample was frozen in sample buffer for Western analysis for the indicated transfected constructs. 293 cells (10-cm dishes) were transfected with 3 µg of plasmid encoding Myc epitope-tagged axin or axin L396P using Effectene (Qiagen) and harvested as described above. Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitated protein complex was washed twice in buffer B and then twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol). Washed immunoprecipitates were split into 4 tubes and incubated in 20 µl of kinase buffer with either GSK3β phosphopeptide substrate, CKI phosphopeptide substrate, CKII peptide substrate (New England Biolabs), or no peptide plus 50 µm[γ-32P]ATP (∼10,000 cpm/pmol). Assays were performed for 20 min at 30 °C and then a 10-µl aliquot was spotted onto P81 paper (Whatman) which was then washed and subjected to scintillation counting. All SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed using precasted gels according to the manufacturer's instructions (NOVEX). For treatment of cells withN-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide (CKI-7, Toronto Research Chemicals), cells were transfected, and media were changed at 24 h post-transfection and incubated for an additional 20–24 h in 150 µm CKI-7. Yeast two-hybrid analysis of protein interactions was carried out as described previously (11Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the APC gene that are associated with colorectal cancer progression typically result in truncated proteins lacking all three of the axin-binding sites (30Behrens J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 31Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The selection against the presence of axin-binding sites on APC strongly implies that the direct interaction of these two proteins is important for the regulation of β-catenin. Here we have employed a small fragment of APC, fbc1,2, that is incapable of regulating β-catenin, and we asked whether the transposition of an axin-binding site to it would restore this function (Fig. 1A). The fbc1,2 fragment contains the second and third 15-amino acid β-catenin-binding sites and the first two 20-amino acid repeat motifs (28Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar). The APC fragments containing each of the three axin-binding sites, but not the control fragment fbc1,2, associated with endogenous axin when expressed in SW480 cells (Fig. 1B). In this figure, differences in gel mobility between the control and AxBs fragments are attributed to a stop codon introduced 3′ to the axin-binding sites that was not present in fbc1,2. All subsequent experiments were performed with an fbc1,2 construct containing a stop codon equivalent in position to that in the AxBs constructs. The APC fragment containing the third axin-binding site (AxBs3) exhibited the highest level of axin binding and was selected for further studies on the regulation of β-catenin. Expression of this fragment, as well as the f2-7 APC fragment, in SW480 cells resulted in the down-regulation of β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig.1C). Thus the AxBs3 fragment is functional in this assay, although it is less active than the larger f2-7 fragment that was expressed at lower levels than AxBs3. To determine whether AxBs3 affected β-catenin protein levels, SW480 cells were transiently transfected with either AxBs3 or fbc1,2, and fixed cells were stained with antibody specific to β-catenin and the nuclei visualized by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The presence of dark blue nuclei in the merged image indicates a loss of nuclear β-catenin staining, whereas blue-green color is indicative of nuclei that retain β-catenin. The transfection efficiency under these conditions is 50–75% (4Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Approximately half of the cells transfected with AxBs3 exhibited a loss of nuclear β-catenin that was not evident in cells transfected with vector control or fbc1,2 control fragment (Fig.1D). Thus, small fragments of APC that associate with β-catenin are able to regulate its stability provided they possess an axin-binding site. In the course of carrying out experiments on the regulation of β-catenin, we noted a difference in mobility on SDS gels between the AxBs3 and fbc1,2 APC fragments that was accentuated on coexpression with axin (Fig. 2A). The mobility shift was eliminated by treating the immunoprecipitates with phosphatase prior to electrophoresis, demonstrating phosphorylation of the APC fragment (data not shown). The association of axin with GSK3β implicates this kinase as a likely candidate for mediating the axin-dependent phosphorylation of AxBs3 (2Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 3Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 11Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr.

A. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To examine this, we overexpressed the GSK3β-binding protein FRAT together with AxBs3 and axin. Although FRAT is known to interact with GSK3β in a manner that precludes its association with axin (25Farr III, G.H. Ferkey D.M. Yost C. Pierce S.B. Weaver C. Kimelman D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 32Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), it did not affect the electrophoretic mobility of AxBs3 (Fig. 2,B and C). The RGS domain fragment of axin would be expected to bind APC and thereby compete with its ability to interact with full-length axin. Accordingly, overexpression of the axin RGS domain, at levels comparable to that of FRAT, completely abrogated the ability of axin to promote the phosphorylation of AxBs3. RapGAP was expressed as a functionally irrelevant control and had no effect on AxBs3 phosphorylation. It was possible that FRAT was not expressed at levels sufficient to inhibit GSK3β in our assay. To address this, we introduced the mutation L396P into axin, which completely eliminated GSK3β binding (33Webster M.T. Rozycka M. Sara E. Davis E. Smalley M. Young N. Dale T.C. Wooster R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 28: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). GSK3β was detected in the immunoprecipitates of wild type but not the mutant axin, whereas β-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with both wild type and mutant axins (Fig.3A). Despite the lack of association with GSK3β, coexpression of the axin L396P mutant with AxBs3 promoted its phosphorylation to a degree comparable with that observed with wild type axin (Fig. 3B). Axin associates with itself through a C-terminal oligomerization domain (34Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and it was therefore possible that the axin mutant recruited endogenous wild type axin along with GSK3β into the APC complex. To rule this out, we tested the human hepatocellular cancer cell line SNU 475 that does not express wild type axin (15Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). AxBs3 was still phosphorylated in this cell line when coexpressed with the axin L396P mutant (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Axin-dependent phosphorylation does not require the association of GSK3β.A, wild type or the L396P missense mutant of axin was transiently expressed in SW480 cells, immunoprecipitated with antibody to the Myc epitope tag and the immune complexes analyzed for axin, β-catenin (β-cat.), and GSK3β by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to the Myc epitope, β-catenin, or GSK3β, respectively. B, AxBs3 was transiently cotransfected with either wild type (wt) or the L396P mutant of axin into SW480 or SNU475 cells, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to APC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results obtained with axin L396P suggested that a kinase other than GSK3β was in part responsible for the axin-dependent phosphorylation of APC. We therefore tested CKIε, which has also been implicated in the wnt-1 signaling pathway (26Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 27Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Coexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of CKIε (kinase dead-CKIε) with AxBs3 partially inhibited the ability of axin to promote the phosphorylation of AxBs3 (Fig.4A). Moreover, expression of wild type CKIε produced a mobility shift on SDS gels similar to that observed following coexpression of AxBs3 with axin (Fig.4B). Despite higher levels of expression, GSK3β promoted mobility shifts that were far less pronounced than those seen with CKIε. We also tested the effect of CKI-7, a compound known to inhibit casein kinase catalytic activity (36Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with CKI-7 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of AxBs3 induced on coexpression with axin (Fig. 4C). As expected, the inhibitor also interfered with the phosphorylation of AxBs3 that occurred in response to coexpression with CKIε. The mobility of the larger fragment of APC, f2-7, was also increased by treatment of cells with CKI-7 (Fig. 4D). Casein kinase 1ε was reported to associate with the PDZ domain of Dishevelled in vitro and with the axin-Dishevelled complex in cultured mammalian cells (26Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 27Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We sought to map the site of interaction of CKIε with axin and to determine whether CKIε binding occurred independent of GSK3β binding. To examine this we expressed wild type and the L396P axin mutant, and we analyzed the immunoprecipitates for kinase activity (Fig.5A). In the absence of peptide substrate, background levels of activity were detected with the immunoprecipitates. The GSK3β-specific substrate was highly phosphorylated by the wild type axin immunoprecipitate but not by the L396P mutant. By contrast, a peptide substrate specific for CKIε was phosphorylated by immunoprecipitates of both the wild type and mutant axins. As an additional control we used a substrate specific for casein kinase II, and we were unable to detect any activity above background levels. The binding site for CK1ε on axin also mapped to a region distinct from that which associates with GSK3β. Axin fragments were expressed in 293 cells and assayed for CKIε activity following their recovery by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, B andC). Casein kinase activity was specifically associated with axin sequence residing between the β-catenin-binding site and the DIX domain. That CKIε associated with axin independent of GSK3β was confirmed by immunoblotting for these two kinases following immunoprecipitation of various axin fragments expressed in 293 cells (Fig.6A). Endogenous GSK3β and CKIε associated with independent fragments of axin, and the CKIε binding was again localized to a region contained between the β-catenin-binding site and the DIX domain. This region of axin has been reported to bind to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) and to Dishevelled (34Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell.

To identify components of BLNK-associated signaling pathways, we performed a phosphorylation-dependent yeast two-hybrid analysis using BLNK probes. Here we report that the serine/threonine kinase hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), which is activated upon antigen-receptor stimulation and which has been implicated in the regulation of MAP kinase pathways, interacts physically and functionally with BLNK in B cells and with SLP-76 in T cells. This interaction requires Tyr379 of HPK1 and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of BLNK/SLP-76. Via homology modeling, we defined a consensus binding site within ligands for SLP family SH2 domains. We further demonstrate that the SH2 domain of SLP-76 participates in the regulation of AP-1 and NFAT activation in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and that HPK1 inhibits AP-1 activation in a manner partially dependent on its interaction with SLP-76. Our data are consistent with a model in which full activation of HPK1 requires its own phosphorylation on tyrosine and subsequent interaction with adaptors of the SLP family, providing a mechanistic basis for the integration of this kinase into antigen receptor signaling cascades.

For example, the reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues creates transient binding surfaces for SH2 or PTB domains (7Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, phosphotyrosine interactions allow the dynamic modulation of signaling complexes. In T cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the palmitoylated transmembrane protein LAT is critical for signaling from the TCR, because it allows the SH2/PTB domain-mediated recruitment of signal transducers like PLCγ1, Shb, and Grb2 adaptors (Gads, Grb2 and Grap) (3Norian L.A.

These interactions are required for activation of the Ras pathway and the elevation of intracellular calcium, ultimately leading to the activation of transcription factors like AP-1 and NFAT. In particular, gene disruption studies demonstrate that SLP-76 is essential for T cell development and assists in linking TCR signaling to activation of PLCγ1, Ras, and Erk (13Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R.

While most cytoplasmic components implicated in TCR signaling have direct counterparts in B cells, no functional analog of LAT has been identified in B cells, and the mechanism mediating recruitment of Grb2-family members to the B cell receptor (BCR) complex remains enigmatic.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), B lymphocytes do contain a relative of SLP-76, BLNK/SLP-65/BASH (hereafter referred to as BLNK; Fig. 1 A) (22Fu C. Turck C.W.

BLNK undergoes Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and is recruited into glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains upon BCR stimulation (1Campbell K.S. Curr. Opin.

Kurosaki M. Inabe K. Chan A.C. Sugamura K. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Following its tyrosine phosphorylation, the N-terminal domain of BLNK binds to the SH2 domains of Vav, Nck, Btk (the B cell Itk homolog), PLCγ2, and Cbl (22Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C.

Med. 2000; 191: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). BLNK also contains proline-rich regions that recruit Grb2 adaptors. While these interactions explain some of the functions of BLNK, it is still unknown how BLNK connects the BCR to activation of JNK and p38. BLNK harbors an SH2 domain at its C terminus, for which no functional ligands have been identified (3Norian L.A. Koretzky G.A. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To explore the functions of the BLNK SH2 domain, we employed a Syk-driven yeast two-hybrid screen, which could identify novel phosphotyrosine-dependent binding partners for BLNK in B cells. Such molecules could provide links between BLNK and the JNK or p38 pathways. We isolated multiple interactors for BLNK baits, including Gads, Vav, and the serine/threonine kinase HPK1 (35Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HPK1 has been shown to be activated upon antigen receptor stimulation, whereupon it acts as a regulator of MAP kinase pathways (9Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We show that HPK1 and SLP-76 can be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of TCR-stimulated, but not unstimulated, Jurkat cells. This interaction requires Tyr379 of HPK1 and the SLP-76 SH2 domain in cotransfected J14 cells. Moreover, full activation of HPK1 is dependent on both Tyr379 of HPK1 and an intact SLP-76 SH2 domain. In cotransfection experiments with SLP-76-deficient J14 cells (13Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the SLP-76 SH2 domain participates in the regulation of AP-1 and NFAT activation in response to TCR stimulation. Finally, HPK1 acts as a dose-dependent inhibitor of AP-1 activation, and full inhibitor activity is dependent on Tyr379 of HPK1 and an intact SLP-76 SH2 domain. Our results suggest that full activation of HPK1 in response to antigen receptor stimulation requires both tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 and its subsequent interaction with the SH2 domains of SLP-76 (in T cells) or BLNK (in B cells). Thus, HPK1 acts in part to connect SLP family adaptors to mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and the negative regulation of AP-1 activation in lymphocytes. We based our Syk-driven yeast two-hybrid system on the MATCHMAKER LexA Two-hybrid System (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). To generate a bait vector that allows coexpression of a bait and Syk as a driver kinase, we inserted a cDNA fragment encoding murine Syk into the Gal-inducible expression cassette of pYES2 (NT 1–876; Invitrogen, Inc., San Diego, CA) and subcloned the Syk expression cassette into the unique NruI site of pLexA, generating pLexASyk. Grb2 SH2(R85K) was generated via PCR mutagenesis. Full-length murine BLNK was obtained via reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse spleen poly(A+) RNA. The R373K mutation was introduced via PCR mutagenesis. Identity and sequence of all constructs were confirmed via automated DNA sequence analysis. Target cDNA libraries in pB42AD were constructed using the Two-hybrid cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH) following the user manual. We used double oligo(dT)-purified mouse spleen or human bone marrow poly(A+) RNA (CLONTECH), or prepared our own triple oligo(dT)-purified poly(A+) RNA from thymocytes of 6–9-week-old C57BL/6 mice using FastTrack 2.0 kits (Invitrogen). 50% of each cDNA were random- or oligo(dT)-primed, pooled, and size-selected to exclude cDNAs of less than 500 base pairs. Each library represents >1.4 × 106independent clones and contains at least 76% recombinant clones with average insert sizes of 0.7–0.8 kb. pEF-BOS, pEF/flag/SLP-76 WT, pEF/flag/SLP-76 R448K, and pCDEF-HPK1:HA have been described (9Liou J.

Yeast handling, analyses, and plasmid DNA isolation were carried out as described in the MATCHMAKER LexA Two-hybrid System user manual or theCLONTECH yeast protocols handbook. Yeast transformations were performed with the Yeastmaker yeast transformation system (CLONTECH). Yeast cell protein extracts were analyzed via immunoblotting with mα-LexA, mα-BLNK, or 4G10 antibodies for the presence and abundance of bait proteins or Syk or Syk activity. Two-hybrid screens were performed on inducing selection agar containing X-gal (-H-U-T-L/GR/X) for up to 10 days, and single candidate positive colonies were restreaked onto the same medium for further purification and propagation. For restriction endonuclease mapping, inserts of isolated target cDNA clones were amplified via PCR. Representatives for each class, defined by a unique restriction pattern, were sequenced and subjected to further analysis. Homology models for the SH2 segments were based on the sequence alignment shown in Fig.7 A. Various SLP adaptor sequences were modeled into the SH2 domain taken from the crystal structure of full-length Src, with ligand peptides modeled into the Src C-terminal peptide bound to the Src SH2 domain (38Xu W.

For co-immunoprecipitation studies, antibodies were prebound to protein A + G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblot analyses were performed using ECL or ECF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with quantification on a STORM system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Jurkat or J14 cells were kept in phosphate-buffered saline (154 mm NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4) or stimulated either with C305 (anti-Jurkat Ti β-chain monoclonal antibody) as described in Ref. 9Liou J.

J14 lines stably reconstituted with various SLP-76 mutants (described in detail in Ref. 40Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Cells were stimulated with C305 or stimulated with UCHT1 alone or in combination with OKT4 ascites fluid and CD28.2 (BD Pharmingen) followed by cross-linking with goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). We employed a modified yeast two-hybrid screen strategy to search for novel phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent interactors that bind full-length BLNK (Fig.1 A). BLNK was co-expressed with murine Syk and used to screen various cDNA-libraries. We isolated 116 reproducibly positive clones from 1.6 × 108 colony-forming units of an amplified murine spleen cDNA library representing ∼1.9 × 106independent clones. The isolates represented three classes of cDNAs. Class 1 (111 clones) encodes the C-terminal SH3 domain of murine Gads (Fig. 1 B). Class 2 (two clones) represents a Vav cDNA fragment including the SH2 and C-SH3 domains (Fig.1 B, clone 37) (41Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Class 3 (three clones) represents two distinct but overlapping cDNA fragments encoding internal regions of murine HPK1 (Fig. 1 B, clones 82 and 103). Both fragments include Tyr379, a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site, and one (clone 103) or three (clone 82) of the proline-rich stretches flanking Tyr379 (35Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Representatives of all classes were subsequently tested for interactions with positive or negative control baits (Fig.1 C). While the Gads isolate showed a strong, constitutive, Syk-independent interaction with BLNK, mHPK1 isolates interacted strongly with BLNK only in the presence of Syk. The BLNK R373K mutant, which is expected to have a reduced phosphotyrosine binding capability based on its analogy to the SLP-76 R448K mutant (37Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), interacted only weakly with HPK1 clones 82 and 103. Moreover, no interaction occurred when a mutant HPK1 construct was used, in which Tyr379 was replaced by phenylalanine. Likewise, the interaction was abrogated in the absence of Syk. In control analyses, BLNK baits did not interact with LAT or Grb2 SH2 domain targets, and Lck SH2 domain or Lamin baits did not interact with any target (data not shown). These results suggest that HPK1 and BLNK can interact when coexpressed in the presence of Syk and that this interaction requires an intact BLNK SH2 domain and Tyr379 of HPK1. Therefore, further study focused on HPK1 as a potential mediator of SLP adaptor signaling. In particular, although the Vav isolates from our screen interacted with wild type BLNK in the presence of Syk, interactions of varying intensities were also observed in the absence of Syk (data not shown). The variability of this interaction in yeast most likely reflects its overall low avidity and in any case rendered further studies impossible. HPK1 has recently been implicated in signal transduction from antigen receptors (9Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Engagement of BCR or TCR results in activation of HPK1. This activation was strongly reduced in B cells lacking BLNK or in T cells lacking SLP-76 (9Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A possible explanation would be that molecular interactions with SLP adaptors are required for full activation of HPK1 in both B cells and T cells. To test if HPK1 associates with SLP-76 in T cells, we immunoprecipitated SLP-76 from lysates of unstimulated or anti-TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells, or SLP-76-deficient J14 cells as specificity controls, and visualized co-precipitating proteins on immunoblots (Fig. 2 A). HPK1 could readily be detected in SLP-76 immunoprecipitates from anti-TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells but not in precipitates from unstimulated cells containing equal amounts of SLP-76 or in precipitates from J14 cells. Prolonged exposure of the blot permitted visualization of a weak HPK1 signal in anti-SLP-76 precipitates from unstimulated Jurkat cells, probably reflecting a weak basal association between HPK1 and SLP-76, which could be mediated by Grb2/Gads (data not shown). Stripping and reprobing of the completely stripped blot with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that the SLP-76-associated HPK1 was possibly tyrosine-phosphorylated. In addition, a protein most likely representing tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (pp36–38) co-precipitated with SLP-76. No co-precipitation of LAT was found in lysates from SLP-76-deficient cells. The presence of a weak band in precipitates from unstimulated cells (lane 3) could reflect a participation of LAT in basal interactions with SLP-76. The presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with similar mobility as SLP-76 and LAT could be demonstrated, albeit at low intensity, in HPK1 precipitates from lysates of ConA-stimulated Jurkat cells and normal murine thymocytes (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TCR stimulation induces the molecular interaction of SLP-76 and HPK1 in a complex that may also include tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT. We next investigated which regions of HPK1 and SLP-76 are required for their interaction. J14 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild type or Y379F mutant HPK1 in combination with FLAG-tagged wild type or SH2 R448K mutant SLP-76, which is incapable of binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (37Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B, immunoprecipitation of similar amounts of SLP-76 permitted significant co-precipitation of HA-HPK1 only in cells that express wild type HA-HPK1 and wild type FLAG-SLP-76 (lanes 3 and 4). In all other cases, no significant interaction was observed. The only slightly weaker interaction in unstimulated cells (lane 3) may result from the high expression levels of exogenous SLP-76 and HPK1 in combination with significant levels of basal tyrosine kinase activity in these cells as revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine probing of the lysate blots (data not shown). Moreover, basal interactions between SLP-76 and HPK1 could be mediated by Grb2/Gads or other adaptors. This notwithstanding, our findings suggest that both Tyr379 of HPK1 and the SLP-76 SH2 domain are required for the HPK1/SLP-76 interaction in T cells, which is augmented by TCR stimulation, particularly in the case of endogenous proteins (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3and 4). We have previously observed that full activation of HPK1 in response to antigen receptor stimulation is dependent on SLP-76 in T cells and BLNK/SLP-65 in B cells (9Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our current finding, that HPK1 is recruited into SLP adaptor complexes, provides a"

However, since Galili et al. reported that the Galα1–3Galβ1–4 GlcNAc-R (α-Gal)1 is the major antigen to human xenotransplantation in pig, genetic approaches to modify this glycoantigen have been the focus of xenotransplantation studies. This antigen was first described as an internal type 1 chain but was later corrected as a linear type 2 oligosaccharide, the α-Gal that is synthesized by α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT) (9Eto T.

The human sequence, however, has suffered a deletion of a single nucleotide at two separate positions, which disrupts the translational reading frame (14Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K.

As a result, humans produce a natural antibody that comprises as much as 1% of the circulating IgG and which is also found in significant amounts as an IgM antibody (16Galili U. Clark M.R.

The most reliable approach for the elimination of α-Gal from pig tissue is to disrupt the pig α1,3GT gene via homologus recombination and/or gene transfer. However, gene targeting is not feasible at the present time. Another strategy for down-regulating the α-Gal involves taking advantage of enzymatic competition involving terminal glycosylation between α1,3GT and other glycosyltransferases for the common acceptor substrate in the trans-Golgi stack and network. Several glycosyltransferases, such as α1,2-fucosyltransferase (α1,2FT) (17Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the introduction of the GnT-III gene significantly suppresses xenoantigens is not fully understood, but its suppression could, in part, be caused by the inhibition of further branching of the carbohydrate moieties and/or a lack of maturation in processing; that is, once a bisecting GlcNAc residue is added to the core mannose by GnT-III, competitive enzymes, including α-3-d-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GnT-IV) and α-6-d-mannoside β-1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), are prevented from introducing any further tri-structures in the Golgi stack (24Taniguchi N. Yoshimura M. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our previous structural analysis of N-linked sugars of the pig endothelial cell (PEC) transfectant with GnT-III revealed that the complex type oligosaccharides with bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary structures, which contained α-Gal, decreased markedly with a parallel increase in bisected structures that contained no α-galactosyl residues (24Taniguchi N.

In the present study, transgenic mouse and pig lines carrying GnT-III were produced, and the expression levels of GnT-III, as well as changes in antigenicity in the various tissues, were analyzed. A cDNA of human GnT-III was subcloned into the pCX vector; a β-actin promoter and a cytomegalovirus enhancer (26Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). The plasmid was separately transformed into Escherichia coli C600 and then amplified using standard techniques. B6C3F1 female mice were induced to superovulate and then crossed with B6C3F1 males. Microinjection and embryo transfer were performed by standard methods to generate transgenic mice. The DNA fragments for microinjection were prepared by digesting the plasmids with SalI and HindIII to remove the vector sequences. DNA fragments were microinjected into mouse ova (C57BL/6 ×C3H), resulting in transgenic mice. Genomic DNA from the tail tips of newborn mice was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blots to identify the produced transgenic animals. Mice carrying these pCX-GnT-III plasmids were crossed with B6 to obtain offspring. The pCX-GnT-III gene was also used to produce transgenic pigs. Prepubertal cross-bred gilts (Large White/LandraceXDuroc) were used as embryo donors and recipients. Methods used in the superovulation for gilts have been presented previously (27Murakami H. Nagashima H. Takahagi Y. Fujimura T. Miyagawa S. Okabe M. Seya T. Shigehisa T. Taniguchi N. Shirakura R. Kinoshita T. Transplant. Proc. 2000; 32: 2505-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Embryo donors were artificially inseminated, and embryos were collected 50–54 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection. Embryos were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 8 min to visualize the pronuclei and microinjected with several thousand copies of the hybrid gene. Microinjected embryos were then transferred to unmated synchronized recipients or the embryo donors (donor-recipients). Transgenic pigs were identified by polymerase chain reaction and/or Southern blot analysis with genomic DNA extracted from the tail tips of the newborn pigs. Founder transgenic pigs were bred with nontransgenic boars or gilts to obtain the second generation. For the assay of enzyme activity, tissues were sonicated and lysed in PBS. The enzyme activities of GnT-III, GnT-IV (28Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fuji S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and GnT-V (29Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were determined using the pyridylaminated biantennary sugar chain GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6 (GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA as a substrate (30Nishikawa A.

The reaction buffer for the GnT-III assay consisted of 125 mm MES buffer, pH 6.25, containing 40 mmUDP-GlcNAc, 20 mm MnCl2, 400 mmGlcNAc, and 1% Triton X-100. The reaction mixture for GnT-IV contained 250 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.3, 80 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 15 mm MnCl2, 400 mm GlcNAc, and 1.0% (W/V) Triton X-100. Assayed GnT-V activity employed, pH 6.25, 250 mm MES buffer, containing 80 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 20 mm EDTA, 400 mm GlcNAc, and 1.0% (W/V) Triton X-100. It should be noted that Mn2+ is not essential for GnT-V activity. 20 mm EDTA, contained in the reaction mixture, completely inhibited GnT-III activity. To 25 µl of these solutions 10 µl of 100 µm substrate was added followed by 15 µl of cell lysate. The assay mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h (28Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fuji S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The acceptor substrate, pyridylaminated lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA) at a final concentration of 10 µm was employed in the α1,3GT activity assays. Lacto-N-neotetraose was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan) and pyridylaminated according to the method of Kondoet al. (32Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). α1,3GT activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 10 µm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mmUDP-galactose, 10 mm MnCl2, 33 mmNaCl, and 3 mm KCl. 10 µl of 50 µmsubstrate and 15 µl of cell lysate were added to this mixture, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h (19Tanemura M.

The enzyme reactions were quenched by boiling for 5 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and an aliquot of each supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis, using a TSK-gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 250 mm). The reaction products were eluted with 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containingn-butyl alcohol at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 55 °C and were monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model RF-10AXL, Tokyo) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The specific activity of the enzyme is expressed as mol of product produced per h of incubation per mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Various organs were excised from transgenic mice and pigs. A portion of each organ was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and Dulbecco's PBS for 30 min. The fixed sections were incubated with blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin and Dulbecco's PBS) for 1 h and then reacted with normal human pooled serum (NHS) of blood type O or a mouse mAb anti-α-Gal, M86 (a generous gift from Dr. U. Galili) (33Galili U. LaTemple D.C. Radic M.Z. Transplantation. 1998; 65: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After removal of excess antibody, the sections were reacted with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Ig (Cappel, West Chester, PA), or FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM (Cappel ICN, Aurora, OH), respectively. Each section was also reacted FITC-conjugated Griffonia simplicifolia I (GS-IB4) lectin, which binds the α-Gal (Honen, Tokyo). Double staining of pancreas islets was also carried out using anti-GnT-III mAb (Fujirevio, Tokyo) and anti-pig insulin polyclonal Ab (DAKO Japan, Kyoto), and subsequently stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Cappel ICN) and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands), respectively. For the detection of monkey C3 and C5b-9 deposition, mouse anti-human C3 mAb and mouse anti-human C5b-9 mAb (DAKO Japan) were used as the first antibody and subsequently stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel ICN). The slides were viewed by means of a Zeiss Axioplan 2 universal microscope (Jena, Germany). The PEC from transgenic pigs with or without human GnT-III was removed from the aorta and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum withl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) and penicillin/streptomycin (Meiji, Tokyo) (34Miyagawa S.

The PECs were incubated with various dilutions of NHS at 4 °C for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with 1.25 µg of FITC-conjugated anti-human Ig (Cappel) as a second antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell surface carbohydrate epitopes were also examined with an FITC-conjugated GS-IB4 lectin (Honen) and chicken anti-Hanganutziu-Deicher (H-D) antigen polyclonal Ab (a gift from Dr. N. Wakamiya, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Cappel). The stained cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Nippon Becton Dickinson, Tokyo). This assay was performed according to the manufacture's recommended protocol, using an MTX LDH kit (Kyokuto, Tokyo). The PEC from transgenic pigs was plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in flat bottomed gelatin-coated 96-well trays 1 day prior to assay. Fifteen hours after plating the cells, the wells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove the LDH, which is present in fetal calf serum, and incubated with several concentrations of NHS that had been diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and the released LDH was then measured. The percent cytotoxicity was calculated using Equation 1 Cytotoxicity=(E−N−S)/(M−N−S)×100Equation 1 where E is the experimentally observed release of LDH activity from the target PEC, N the LDH activity in each concentration of NHS, S the spontaneous release of LDH activity from target PEC incubated in the absence of NHS, and M the maximal release of LDH activity, as determined by sonication. The spontaneous release of LDH activity from PEC was less than 5%, compared with the maximal release obtained by sonication (34Miyagawa S. Shirakura R. Iwata K. Nakata S. Matsumiya G. Izutani H. Matsuda H. Terado A. Matsumoto M. Nagasawa S. Seya T. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The PEC from transgenic pigs were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in a flat bottomed gelatin-coated 96-well plate. Fifteen hours after plating the cells, the plates were incubated with effector cells, an NK-like cell line, YT cells, which were kindly provided by Drs. Junji Yodoi and Keisuke Teshigawara (University of Kyoto) (35Yodoi J. Teshigawara K. Nikaido T. Fukui K. Noma T. Honjo T. Takigawa M. Sasaki M. Minato N. Tsudo M. Uchiyama T. Maeda M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar), at various effector:target ratios. Each assay was performed in triplicate. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the released LDH was measured using an MTX LDH kit (Kyokuto). The spontaneous release of LDH activity from effector cells and target cells were less than 10 and 5%, respectively. The results are expressed as the percent of specific lyses (36Miyagawa S. Nakai R. Yamada M. Tanemura M. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. Shirakura R. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 1067-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Examinations were carried out for according to the guidelines for the handling of animals from the Research Institute of the HAMRI Co., Ltd. (Ibaraki, Japan). The heterozygous transgenic pigs with GnT-III and wild-type controls, either sex (18–22 days old, 2.5–6.0 kg), were used as donors for all experiments. Cynomolgus monkeys, Macaca fascicularis, obtained from HAMRI Co., Ltd., weighing 2.5–7.0 kg, were used as recipients. Preoperative serum from all monkeys was assayed for the anti-pig endothelial cell antibody titer and complement hemolytic activity (CH50 unit) (37Mayer M.M. Experimental Immunochemistry. 2nd Ed. Charles C Thomas Publisher, Springfield, IL1961: 133Google Scholar). The anti-PEC antibodies, IgG and IgM, were checked, using PEC as a target. The PECs from control pigs were incubated with 10% serum from each recipient monkey at 4 °C for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with 1.25 µg of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG or IgM (Cappel) as a second antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Stained cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibure flow cytometer. CH50 was determined by a microtiter method, according to the methodology described by Mayer (37Mayer M.M. Experimental Immunochemistry. 2nd Ed. Charles C Thomas Publisher, Springfield, IL1961: 133Google Scholar, 38Miyagawa S. Hirose H. Shirakura S. Naka Y. Nakata S. Kawashima Y. Seya T. Matsumoto M. Uenaka A. Kitamura H. Transplantation. 1988; 46: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In this procedure, CH50 was assayed in gelatin Veronal buffer by using sensitized sheep erythrocytes. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, 50 µl of the same buffer was added, and the mixtures were centrifuged. The hemoglobin content of each supernatant was estimated spectrophotometerically. The CH50 unit was defined as the serum volume sufficient to lyse 50% of the erythrocytes added to each well, and the complement activity in a test serum was then calculated as the number of CH50 units. After the donor pigs had been anesthetized with thiopental sodium (20 mg/kg) and Stresnil (2 mg/kg), a median sternotomy was performed. The inferior vena cava was divided above the diaphragm, and 200 ml of glucose-potassium cardioplegic solution with heparin (1,000 IU) (39Sawa Y. Matsuda H. Shimazaki Y. Kadoba K. Ohtake S. Takami H. Onishi S. Kawashima Y. Circulation. 1988; 78: 191-197Google Scholar) was then infused from the ascending aorta. The heart was excised under topical cooling with PBS (4 °C) after division of the superior vena cava, the pulmonary aorta and veins, and the ascending aorta. Recipient cynomolgus monkeys were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and xylazin (1 mg/kg). A heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in the abdomen, according to the Ono-Lindsey method (40Ono K. Lindsey E.S. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1969; 57: 225-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A midline abdominal incision was used to expose the aorta and inferior vena cava below the renal vessels. The donor heart was placed in the abdomen of the recipient monkey, the end-to-side anastomosis being donor aorta to recipient abdominal aorta and donor pulmonary aorta to recipient inferior vena cava. No immunosuppression nor anticoagulants was administered before or after the procedure. The rejection of the cardiac transplants was defined based on the cessation of beating. The following time was 4 h after the operation. Samples of graft tissue were removed at the time of rejection or 4 h after transplantation for immunohistochemical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to ascertain the significance of differences within groups. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. The pCX promoter was used for the ubiquitous expression of GnT-III in transgenic mouse. Eight founder pCX-GnT-III transgenic mice were obtained from 73 live pups from 576 microinjected oocytes. A founder that was determined to express high levels of human GnT-III was mated with B6 mice to propagate transgenic offspring for the analysis of transgene expression in various tissues. Transgenic pigs were also obtained by means of the pCX-GnT-III construct. Five founders of pCX-GnT-III transgenic pigs were obtained from 59 live pups from 583 microinjected oocytes. Of the founder pigs, one was stillborn, and another died shortly after birth. Two founders, Gx-1 and Gx-2, showed GnT-III enzyme activity in their tails, and the other, Gx-3, had only a very low level of GnT-III activity. The transgenic pig, Gx-1, was successfully bred, and three offspring, 3 weeks (pig 1), 3 months (pig 2), and 6 months (pig 3), with the transgene were examined for in vitrostudy. Two, 3 weeks, were used in the transplantation experiments. The copy number of transgenes in hemizygous offsprings (F1) of transgenic mouse and pig lines was examined by Southern hybridization. The copy number of transgenic mouse, line 2, which was used in this study, had seven copies of pCX-GnT-III constructs, and the pig lines GX-1 and GX-2 had three and two copies, respectively. The level of activity of GnT-III in each animal was not correlated with the copy numbers of the transgene. The profiles of the GnT-III activities of each organ in wild-type and the GnT-III transgenic animals were investigated. Although the wild-type mouse showed GnT-III activity only in kidney tissue, GnT-III was expressed ubiquitously in the GnT-III transgenic mice (Fig.1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the wild-type pigs showed very low levels of GnT-III activity in the kidney, but a slightly higher level in the brain. The CAG promoter led to the nearly ubiquitous expression of GnT-III in the organs of the transgenic pig. To analyze the alteration of antigenicity in the transgenic mouse, immunostaining of each organ was performed using NHS and GS-IB4 lectin and M86 monoclonal antibody (Table I). Characteristic of the transgenic mouse, changes of antigenicity were found in most organs except for the kidney, which has endogenous GnT-III activity (Fig. 2, c and d). In particular, the antigenicity of the liver from the GnT-III transgenic mouse is clearly down-regulated despite its relatively lower expression of GnT-III activity (Fig. 2, e andf).Table IImmunohistochemical analysisAnimalNHSGS-IB4M86Wild-typeTransgenicWild-typeTransgenicWild-typeTransgenicTransgenic miceHeart1+++∼±++±+++2++++++∼±+++Kidney1++++++2+++±++Liver1+±∼−+±∼−+±∼−2++±++−+±∼−Lung1+−+±∼−+−2+−±−±±∼−Pancreas1±∼−−±−±∼−−2+∼±−+−+−Muscle1+∼±−+±+±∼−2+++∼±++±+++∼±Transgenic pigsHeart1++±+±+−2+±+±+±3++±+±+−Kidney1++∼+±+±++∼+±2+±+++∼±+∼±−3++±∼−++±∼−+−Liver1++++±++±2++±+±∼−+++∼±3+++++++±Lung1+±±±+±∼−2+−+±+±3+±+∼±±+±∼−Pancreas1+−+±+−2ND1-aND, not determined.NDNDNDNDND3±−±−−−Spleen1+±+±±−2+++−+±3+±+±+±Muscle1+±±±++∼+±2±−+−+∼±±3++∼+++±+±∼−Skin1±−−−±±2−−±−−−3+±−−±−Brain1−−−−−−2−−±−−−3±−−−−−Aorta1++++++±2NDND+++++∼+±3+++++±++++∼+Grading scale: −, not stained; ±, stained equivocally or weakly; +, stained moderately; ++, stained intensely.1-a ND, not determined.

In the case of pigs, compared with wild-type pig, GnT-III transgenic pigs indicated a lower susceptibility to NHS, GS-IB4 lectin, and M86 mAb in many organs except brain, which also had GnT-III endogenous enzyme activity (Fig. 2, m and n). To determine whether the pancreatic islets from the transgenic pig have elevated GnT-III activity, double staining with anti-GnT-III Ab and anti-insulin Ab was carried out. Double staining of the pancreas revealed that the islets from the transgenic pig have a high level of expression of the GnT-III enzyme (Fig. 3). The α1,3GT and GnT-IV, and GnT-V enzyme activity in the control animals and the influences of an excess of GnT-III over the enzymes in each organ were measured. The average GnT-IV activities in many organs of the transgenic mouse and pig were lower than those in wild, but the differences were not significant (Fig. 4, A andD). It was not possible to predict changes in GnT-V and α1,3GT activities in both mice and pigs. GnT-III and α1,3GT activities in the PEC from transgenic piglets were examined by HPLC, and the amelioration of antigenicity of the PEC was also analyzed by flow cytometry, using NHS, GS-IB4 lectin, and M86 (Fig.5, A–E).Figure 5Features of the PEC from transgenic pigs. Enzyme activities, GnT-III (panel A) and α1,3GT (panel B) of PECs from transgenic pigs were measured by HPLC. Each value is expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three to four independent experiments. Xenoantigenicity of transgenics to NHS (panel C), GS-IB4 (panel D), and M86 (panel E) were investigated by flow cytometry. PECs from control and transgenic pigs were treated with 10 or 20% NHS as the first antibody and anti-human immmunoglobulin second antibodies. The reduction of α-Gal on the cell surface was also analyzed using GS-IB4 lectin and M86 mAb.

It converts electromagnetic energy into chemical energy by using photons to drive electron transfer between electron carriers on opposite sides of the membrane. The core of PS1 is a heterodimer of two subunits, PsaA and PsaB. These polypeptides are related to each other, sharing 45–50% identical residues, and each contains 11 transmembrane α-helices (1Fish L.E. Kück U. Bogorad L.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first six transmembrane helices bind chlorophyll (Chl) molecules of the core antenna, and the last five helices form a framework holding the cofactors involved in transmembrane electron transfer (Refs. 3Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 4Bock C.H. Van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 91-96Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). In order, the cofactors are: P700 (pair of Chla molecules), A0 (Chl a), A1 (phylloquinone), and FX(Fe4S4 cluster). The terminal electron acceptors, FA and FB(Fe4S4 clusters), are bound by the PsaC subunit. Upon excitation of P700, an electron is transferred to A0, subsequently to A1, through the iron-sulfur clusters, and ultimately to ferredoxin. The function of phylloquinone in electron transfer in PS1 is based, among others, on the observation of a transient optical difference spectrum with features similar to that of the phyllosemiquinone-phylloquinone difference spectrum. This optical feature decays with a half-time of 200 ns (3Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is in line with measurements of A1− reoxidation by time-resolved EPR (4Bock C.H. Van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D.

Recentin vivo optical studies in green algae led to the suggestion that the two phases of A1− reoxidation reflect the existence of two parallel, but kinetically distinct, electron transfer pathways from P700 to FX (11Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11130-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), in line with the presence of two phylloquinone molecules in PS1 (12Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). The singly reduced phyllosemiquinone is a radical and thus accessible to EPR spectroscopy. Two methods have been used to observe the normally transient A1− radical: time-resolved spectroscopy and photo-accumulation. Charge separation produces a spin-polarized EPR signal that decays in the nanosecond to microsecond time scales, depending upon the temperature (4Bock C.H. Van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8030-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An EPR signal can also be accumulated by illumination at low temperature after reduction of the Fe-S clusters. Its mean g-value (2.0045) and ∼10-G width were similar to that of semiquinones, and it was assigned to A1− (see Ref. 14Heathcote P. Hanley J.A. Evans M.C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 54-61Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar and references therein). Spin quantification in cyanobacterial PS1 after photo-accumulation produced a maximum of 1 A0− and 1 A1− per P700 (15MacMillan F. Hanley J. van der Weerd L. Knuepling M. Un S. Rutherford A.W.

Moreover, the conformity of the hyperfine couplings measured in both the photo-accumulated and transient A1− radicals has allowed the conclusion that they arise from the same molecule on the same side of PS1 (19Bittl R. Zech S.G. Teutloff C. Krabben L. Lubitz W. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanism and Effects, Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of Photosynthesis. 1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 509-514Google Scholar). Advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques and x-ray crystallography have provided information on the environment of the quinones. A combination of 15N labeling and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy of photo-accumulated A1−indicated that a tryptophan (Trp) and perhaps one other nitrogen-containing aromatic side chain were nearby (20Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. MacMillan F. Bottin H. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11543-11549Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6651-6656Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although strong H-bonding would be difficult to reconcile with A1's low redox potential and the ability of different quinone compounds to insert into the A1 site in alternate orientations (21Zech S.G. van der Est A.J.

Zech S.G. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Lubitz W.

These sites are in an area where the 10th transmembrane α-helices of PsaA and PsaB are linked to an α-helix parallel to the membrane plane (Fig.1). Here we describe the analysis of a series of mutations guided by this information. Conserved histidines and tryptophans were targeted in a region most likely to be close to the phylloquinones. A tryptophan in PsaA has been identified that appears to be near A1, because of the effect of its mutation upon the A1− EPR signal. After submission of this paper, the three-dimensional structure of cyanobacterial PS1 at 2.5-Å resolution was published (12Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). The tryptophan shown here to affect the A1− EPR signal turned out to be π-stacked with the phylloquinone bound to PsaA. The phylloquinone bound to PsaB is similarly stacked with the analogous tryptophan (12Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar), but we observed no modification of the A1− EPR signal upon mutation of this residue. These results speak to the inherent asymmetry of PS1. Site-directed mutations were introduced by the three-stage polymerase chain reaction method (24Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), utilizing a system designed for site-directed mutagenesis ofChlamydomonas PsaA and PsaB (25Redding K. MacMillan F.

All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. At least two independent subclones of each plasmid were introduced into the appropriate null mutant strains by particle bombardment and selection on spectinomycin-containing medium. Double mutants were created by simultaneously bombarding a strain lacking psaA-3 and psaB with a mixture of two plasmids containing mutations in the same site of psaA-3 andpsaB; spectinomycin-resistant transformants were subjected to light (20–50 microeinsteins (μE)/m2/s) to select for double transformants, as single transformants would lack PS1 and be light-sensitive. Two different genetic backgrounds were used in the creation of mutant strains. A wild-type (WT) background was used forin vivo characterization, whereas a background lacking Chlb and photosystem II (PS2) was used to simplify PS1 purification for biophysical analyses. Homoplasmicity was assessed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the affected locus using isolated DNA as template. At least two independent transformants of each plasmid subclone were characterized to ensure that the observed phenotypes were due to the point mutation and not to any secondary mutations. Tris acetate-phosphate and high salt minimal media were prepared according to Harris (26Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). Algae were grown heterotrophically at 25 °C in liquid Tris acetate-phosphate medium under low illumination. Growth tests were initiated by spotting 10 μl of log phase cultures onto agar plates. These plates were incubated at 25 °C under low (<1 μE/m2/s), medium (40 μE/m2/s), or high (200 μE/m2/s) light fluxes. Anaerobiosis was imposed using the BBL GasPak pouch system (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems). Fluorescence induction kinetics were captured with a Plant Efficiency Analyzer (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, United Kingdom). Oxygen evolution was measured with a Hansatech Oxygraph system using a black acetal water-jacketed chamber (maintained at 25 °C) and illuminated by two red LED arrays (650 ± 50 nm; 2700 μE/m2/s maximum total intensity) at opposite ends of the chamber. Cells were resuspended at 30 μg of Chl/ml in 12.5 mmNaHCO3 (pH 7.5) and introduced into the chamber. Dark O2 uptake and light-saturated O2 evolution rates were measured before and after addition of 250 μmp-benzoquinone to remove limitations of electron transport beyond PS2. Crude membrane fractions were prepared as described (27Ohad I. Adir N. Koike H. Kyle D.J. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1972-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoids and PS1 particles were prepared as described (28Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Chl concentration was calculated as described (29Porra R. Thompson W. Kriedemann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). PS1 activity in crude membranes was measured using ascorbate and 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol as donors and methyl viologen as a mediator to oxygen (30Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Soen S.Y. Franzen L.G. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The rate of oxygen reduction was monitored at various light intensities. The PS1-dependent rates of oxygen uptake were determined by subtracting the oxygen uptake level of a sample lacking PS1, and the maximum rates of oxygen uptake were determined by a double-reciprocal plot. Immunoblotting was performed according to a standard protocol using rabbit antisera against PsaA, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, and PsaF (31Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Extracts of pigments from purified PS1 samples were prepared as described (32Patzlaff J.S. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that PS1 particles were used instead of PS2. Separation of phylloquinone was achieved with a Hewlett-Packard series 1050 liquid chromatograph and detected by a PE-Sciex API 3 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure electrospray source. A full scan mass spectrum of a phylloquinone standard (Sigma) was obtained in the positive ion mode by injection into a 25 μl/min flow of 10 mm ammonium acetate in methanol. MS/MS data of phylloquinone were then obtained by selecting the parent ion peak with the first quadrupole for entry into the second quadrupole. Upon impact with argon there, the parent ions gave rise to fragments that were scanned by the third quadrupole to give the MS/MS spectrum, which formed the basis for the multiple reaction monitoring protocol. Three parent-daughter ion combinations were chosen to detect phylloquinone. Samples were injected onto a 2.1 × 100-mm Aquapore RP-300 reversed phase column (Applied Biosystems) using a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The gradient was 30–80% 10 mm ammonium acetate/methanol in 5 min, and then 80% methanol for 10 min, giving a retention time of 12.8 min for the phylloquinone standard. Samples were prepared for photo-accumulation of A1− as described previously (15MacMillan F. Hanley J. van der Weerd L. Knuepling M. Un S. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9297-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). X-band (9.44 GHz) cw-EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer using a standard rectangular Bruker EPR cavity (ER4102T). Q-band (34.0 GHz) cw-EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker E-500 spectrometer using a standard Bruker resonator (ER 5106QT-W1). Both instruments were equipped with an Oxford helium cryostat (ESR900 and CF935 respectively). The microwave frequency was measured using a Systron Donner 6054D (X-band) or a Hewlett Packard HP5352b (Q-band) frequency counter. The magnetic field was measured using a Bruker gaussmeter (ER035M). The measured g-values were corrected for an offset against a known g standard ((2,2′)diphenyl-β-picryl hydroxyl using g = 2.00351). The simulated spectrum of A1− was generated with Bruker SimFonia (version 1.25) using theg-tensor components from the high field EPR spectrum (15MacMillan F. Hanley J. van der Weerd L. Knuepling M. Un S. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9297-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), methyl hyperfine coupling taken from the ENDOR spectrum (18Teutloff C. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Lendzian F. Lubitz W. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanism and Effects, Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of Photosynthesis. 1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 607-610Google Scholar), and linewidths of 4 G. The simulated spectrum of A0− was generated assuming an isotropicg-value of 2.0035 and linewidth of 13 G. The set-up for time-resolved EPR has been described (33Bittl R. Zech S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 1429-1436Crossref Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the out-of-phase ESEEM experiment described therein, weak selective 90° and 180° pulses were used to record the echo-detected spectra. Briefly, spectra were recorded as field-swept echo spectra using the following sequence: laser flash, t1, 90° microwave pulse,t2, 180° pulse, t2, echo. After signal accumulation over several laser shots at a fixed magnetic field, the field was shifted and signal acquisition was repeated in order to construct the EPR spectrum of the transient P700+ A1− state. Flash-induced absorption changes on a nanosecond time scale were measured as described previously (34Kusumoto N. Setif P. Brettel K. Seo D. Sakurai H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12124-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except that a laser diode emitting at 820 nm (SDL-5411-G1 from Spectra Diode Laboratories) was used as measuring light source. Excitation flashes at 532 nm were provided by a neodymium/yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser from Quantel (pulse duration, 300 ps; pulse energy, ∼200 μJ/cm2; repetition rate, 1 Hz). The electronic bandwidth of the detection system (photodiode FND100 from EG&G, AC-coupled amplifier IV72A from the Hahn Meitner Institut (Berlin, Germany), and digital oscilloscope DSA602A with plug-in 11A52 from Tektronix) was 100–500 MHz. For measurements on a millisecond time scale, the photodiode was loaded with a 1-kiloohm resistor and coupled directly to the 11A33 plug-in of the digital oscilloscope. PS1 particles were diluted in 10 mm Tricine (pH 8) and supplemented with 10 mm sodium ascorbate and 10 μm phenazine methosulfate (PMS). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to survey the primary structure of the PsaA and PsaB polypeptides for residues that form part of the phylloquinone-binding sites. An extended region from the middle of helix 10 to the middle of helix 11 (Fig.1) was targeted, as this region would be nearest to the electron densities assigned to phylloquinones in the 4-Å crystal structure (23Klukas O. Schubert W.D. Jordan P. Krau N. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7361-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and it is analogous to the position in the polypeptides of the bacterial type 2 reaction center where its quinones are bound (35Deisenhofer J. Michel H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2149-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Only residues that are conserved among all species and between all PsaA and PsaB polypeptides were mutated, given that both polypeptides must provide a niche for a phylloquinone. Based upon the results of ESEEM spectroscopy (20Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. MacMillan F. Bottin H. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11543-11549Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), nitrogen-containing aromatic residues were converted to phenylalanines. In this region there are two tryptophans and two histidines that are conserved between PsaA and PsaB (see Fig. 1). The more drastic change to leucine was made in the case of the second pair of histidines, because these mutations had already been made in a previous study (31Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, we constructed double mutants in which homologous residues were both mutated. In the interests of brevity, we have used the following nomenclature for double mutants: “W693F/W673F” refers to the PsaA-W693F/PsaB-W673F double substitution mutant, and the others likewise. Mutant genes were introduced into strains lacking the corresponding gene (psaA, psaB, or both) in order to eliminate the possibility of contaminating wild-type sequences. For biophysical analyses, the mutant PS1s were expressed in strains lacking PS2 and Chlb, which causes a significant drop in the accumulation of antenna complexes (36Allen K.D. Staehelin L.A. Planta. 1994; 194: 42-54Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This allowed the EPR analyses to be performed with purified thylakoid membranes, avoiding potential complications caused by detergent extraction of reaction centers. Growth of the double mutants was tested under several different conditions (Fig.2). All were capable of heterotrophic growth on acetate media, but under high illumination the W702F/W682F mutant grew poorly. The phenomenon of light sensitivity in PS1 mutants requires the presence of oxygen (37Rochaix J. Fischer N. Hippler M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If grown phototrophically in microaerobic conditions, all the double mutants grew as well as the WT strain, indicating that the mutant PS1s were functional. The mutants W693F/W673F and H704F/H684F could grow under medium light but died under high light, whereas W702F/W682F was killed by even moderate illumination. These defects are likely due to lowered accumulation of PS1 in the mutant strains (Fig. 2), and only in the most demanding conditions, when PS1 function is needed for both photosynthesis and light resistance, does it become limiting. The H730L/H714L mutation caused no observable growth defects (Fig. 2). The single mutants PsaA-W693F and PsaB-W673F were also capable of growth in all conditions (data not shown). The drop in variable fluorescence after the peak during the first seconds of illumination can be used as an indicator for the ability of PS1 (in concert with cytochrome b6f) to oxidize the plastoquinone pool (38Bennoun P. Delepelaire P. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 25-38Google Scholar). The extent and speed to which the fluorescence level fell in the double mutants was intermediate between the null mutant and the WT and correlated with their phototrophic growth capability (data not shown). It therefore seems likely that deficiencies in photosynthetic growth are due to the decreased efficiency of electron throughput through cytochromeb6f and PS1. The maximum efficiency of PS2 in vivo was assayed directly by suspending cells in bicarbonate buffer and measuring light-driven O2 evolution using a Clarke-type oxygen electrode. All O2 evolution was inhibited by addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (data not shown). In order to see if O2 evolution was limited by activities downstream of PS2, p-benzoquinone was added to serve as a PS2 acceptor. The mutants were not drastically affected in their ability to photo-oxidize the plastoquinone pool by this test (Table I and data not shown).Table INormalized in vivo O2 evolution rates and in vitro O2consumption ratesMutationIn vivo O2 evolution rate1-aThe maximum light-dependent O2 evolution rates of whole cells were measured in 12.5 mm bicarbonate before and after addition of 250 μm p-benzoquinone (+ pBQ).

https://openalex.org/W2078970200,"We have examined the role of the small GTPase Rho and its downstream effector, the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), in the control of the adhesive and signaling function of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin in human T-lymphocytes. Inhibition of Rho (either by treatment with C3-exoenzyme or transfection with a dominant-negative form of Rho (N19Rho)) or ROCK (by treatment with Y-27632) results in the following: (a) partial disorganization and aggregation of cortical filamentous actin (F-actin); (b) induction of LFA-1-mediated cellular adhesion to the LFA-1 ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) through a mechanism involving clustering of LFA-1 molecules, rather than alterations in the level of expression or in the affinity state of this integrin; and (c) induction of cellular polarization and activation of the tyrosine kinase PYK2. Transfection of T-cells with a constitutively active form of Rho (V14Rho) blocks the clustering of LFA-1 on the membrane and the LFA-1-mediated activation of PYK2. Importantly, the activation of PYK2 caused by inhibition of Rho or ROCK takes place only when the T-cells are plated onto ICAM-1 but not when they are either prevented from interacting with ICAM-1 with anti-LFA-1 blocking antibodies or when they are plated on the nonspecific poly-l-lysine substrate. These results indicate that the small GTPase Rho regulates the tyrosine kinase PYK2 in T-cells through the F-actin-mediated control of the activity of the integrin LFA-1.

This molecule mediates important adhesive phenomena through interaction with its ligands intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, -2, or -3) (1Gahmberg C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23409-23412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits of LFA-1 are both composed of a large extracellular amino-terminal domain, involved in the recognition of ligands, a transmembrane segment, and a small cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal region that can potentially bind cytoskeletal and signaling components (3Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23409-23412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Resting leukocytes that circulate in the bloodstream are mainly rounded-shaped cells that express an inactive form of LFA-1, which is functionally unable to bind its ligands. However, stimulation of different leukocyte receptors, including the TcR-CD3 complex and cytokine receptors, results in the generation of intracellular signals that lead to activation of LFA-1 and thereby the acquisition of the ability to bind its ligands (3Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23409-23412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As to the mechanism of activation of LFA-1, a variety of experimental results indicates that under physiological conditions the ligand binding activity of LFA-1 correlates mostly with the organization of this integrin into clusters on the membrane of T-cells and not with conformational changes of individual integrin molecules, which are characterized by increased affinity for ligands (4Van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the LFA-1 receptor that is expressed on the surface of resting T-cells is maintained in an inactive form due to the interactions of its cytoplasmic region with the network of actin fibers assembled beneath the plasma membrane (4Van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26869-26877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). According to this model, molecules that regulate the organization of this membrane-anchored actin cytoskeleton are potentially able to regulate the activity of LFA-1 because they could release the constraints on this integrin and allow the formation of clusters of LFA-1 with increased binding avidity for ligands (4Van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26869-26877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this regard, the small GTPase Rho, a well known regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (6Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 7Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 1999; 348: 241-255Crossref Google Scholar), may potentially perform this function as an indirect modulator of LFA-1. Rho GTPase molecules cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound state. The cycling between these two forms is regulated in vivo by guanidine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (6Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 7Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 1999; 348: 241-255Crossref Google Scholar). Two different approaches have been used to inhibit the function of Rho. The first is the use of the C3-exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, an agent that ADP-ribosylates and specifically inactivates this small GTPase (8Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second approach is based on the use of N19Rho, a dominant-negative form of this small GTPase (9Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Through the use of both approaches, it has been shown that Rho participates in a number of leukocyte functions, including the regulation of T-cell activation and pseudopodial extension (10Woodside D.G.

Some of the downstream effects of the GTP-bound Rho are exerted through the serine/threonine kinase Rho-associated kinase (Rho kinase/ROK/ROCK, hereafter referred as ROCK) (20Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). ROCK phosphorylates and inhibits the enzyme myosin light chain phosphatase and also directly phosphorylates the myosin light chain (MLC), which altogether results in an increase in phosphorylated MLC and formation of actin-myosin contractile fibers (6Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 7Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 1999; 348: 241-255Crossref Google Scholar, 20Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp.

Another target of ROCK is LIM kinase (LIMK), which phosphorylates and inhibits the protein cofilin, leading to the stabilization of F-actin (20Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 21Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

The study of the cell functions controlled by ROCK has been significantly advanced with the use of Y-27632, a specific competitive inhibitor of this kinase (22Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Uehata M.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with this inhibitor have shown that ROCK, acting on the targets mentioned above, is able to regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton (20Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Upon activation of LFA-1, this integrin binds ICAM-1, which subsequently leads to the polarization of T-cells (25Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L. Gómez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sánchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1891-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vivo, such polarization is observed following the interaction of the lymphocytes with antigen-presenting cells or during chemokine-directed transendothelial migration, processes where LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions play a key role (26Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar). Following ligand engagement, LFA-1 induces a variety of intracellular signals that are thought to be involved in the process of polarization induced by this integrin. Intracellular signals induced from LFA-1 include phospholipid hydrolysis, mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, activation of different isoenzymes of protein kinase C, phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 and the linker protein p130CAS, and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases FAK and PYK2 (25Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L.

Following activation/autophosphorylation of this enzyme, PYK2 may bind cytoskeletal proteins (like paxillin), linkers (like p130Cas), or other tyrosine kinases (including Src family members), which may potentially impinge PYK2 in a variety of signal transduction pathways (35Avraham H.

In this study we show that inhibition of the small GTPase Rho, or its downstream effector ROCK, leads on T-cells to clustering and activation of the LFA-1 integrin and the enhancement of the tyrosine kinase activity of PYK2. Such activation of PYK2 requires engagement of LFA-1, strongly suggesting that Rho and ROCK can regulate the tyrosine kinase PYK2 through modulation of LFA-1 activity. Human T-lymphoblasts were prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by treatment with 0.5% phytohemagglutinin for 48 h (37Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Barrett J. Hogg N. J.

Y-27632 was a generous gift of Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries. All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. Cell adhesion assays, either on ICAM-1 (5 µg/ml) or on PLL (20 µg/ml)-coated dishes, were performed as described (25Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L. Gómez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sánchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1891-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of α-tubulin and actin was performed on round glass coverslips and have been described previously (25Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L. Gómez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sánchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1891-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of the organization of LFA-1 on the membrane was performed as described (49Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 669-707Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and pretreated cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 before plating them on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (150 × 103 cells/coverslip), in the presence of appropriate stimuli and/or anti-LFA-1 mAbs at 10 µg/ml. Unbound cells were removed by gently washing them in warm RPMI 1640. To prevent antibody-induced clustering, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature before performing a second incubation for 25 min at 4 °C with 10 µg/ml of either FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or with TRITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (for immunofluorescence analysis of the GFP-transfected cells). Before mounting the samples for fluorescence microscopy, they were washed again with PBS and distilled water. Confocal microscopy was performed using a MRC-1000 Confocal Laser Scanning System (Bio-Rad) connected to a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope. Images of 20 serial vertical cellular sections were acquired every 0.4 µm with the Bio-Rad COMOS graphical user interface and software. Flow cytometry analysis of cells stained with anti-LFA-1 antibodies (mAbs 24 and 38) was performed as described previously (46Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,50Cabañas C. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated controls or T-cells pretreated with the C3-exoenzyme or Y-27632 inhibitors were washed twice in Hepes/NaCl buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mg/mld-glucose, pH 7.4) containing 2 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2. The control cells that were stimulated with MnCl2 were washed in Hepes/NaCl buffer containing 0.5 mm EGTA to chelate residual calcium ions before they were incubated for 1 h in Hepes/NaCl buffer that contained 200 µmMnCl2. After the treatments, the T-cells (5 × 105 cells) were added to a 96-well round-bottom plate, where they were incubated with 10 µg/ml of the 24 or the 38 mAbs for 15 min at 37 °C in 100 µl of PBS. After this first incubation, T-cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated for an additional period of 30 min at 4 °C with FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody in PBS. Finally, after 3 washes with PBS, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, and their fluorescence was measured using a FACScan® flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Flow cytometry and measurement of the binding of soluble recombinant ICAM-Fc to cells was performed as described (38Stewart M.P. Cabañas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 51Leitinger B. Hogg N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), maintaining in all steps the cation concentrations as described above in the flow cytometry analysis of LFA-1. Soluble ICAM-1 Fc binding was detected using FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Fc-specific) (38Stewart M.P. Cabañas C. Hogg N. J.

The pEGFP-C1 (green fluorescent protein (GFP)) expression vector was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), and the pEGFP-C1-N19Rho, pEGFP-C1-V14Rho, and pEGFP-C1-N17Rac expression plasmids have been described previously (11Del Pozo M.A. Vicente-Manzanares M. Tejedor R. Serrador J.M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For the transient transfection experiments, HSB-2 cells (2 × 107) were washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in 500 µl of cold Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) before being placed in 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). DNA (15 µg) was added, and transfections were conducted at 1200 microfarads/280 V using a Gene Pulser II electroporation system and the Capacitance Extender Plus module (Bio-Rad). After the electroporation burst, the cells were transferred to plastic dishes and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and antibiotics (Flow Laboratories). 24 h after electroporation the transfection efficiency was estimated by flow cytometry, and cells with high level of GFP expression were selected by sorting on a FACS Vantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). Untreated or inhibitor-pretreated T-lymphoblasts and untransfected or transfected HSB-2 cells were washed twice with RPMI, plated on dishes coated with BSA, PLL, or ICAM-1 (2.5 × 106 cells/35 mm dish), as specified in the legends of the figures, and kept for 15 min on ice. The dishes were then transferred to a 37 °C incubator for an additional 40 (T-lymphoblasts) or 90 min (HSB-2 cells). Parallel dishes of T-lymphoblasts or HSB-2 cells, which were used as positive controls, were stimulated also with 10 µg/ml mAb KIM-127 for the same period. After these incubation periods on the dishes, all plated cells (both attached and in suspension) were solubilized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.65, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, 50 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellets discarded. After centrifugation, supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and PYK2 was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with protein G-agarose-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-PYK2 antibody (C-19). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and either used for in vitro kinase reactions (see below) or extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) by boiling 5 min, fractionated by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and further analyzed as described under “Results” and the figure legends. PYK2 kinase assays were performed as described (25Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L. Gómez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sánchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, PYK2 immunoprecipitates were washed and pelleted (2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) three times in lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 3 mmMnCl2, pH 7.35). Pellets were dissolved in 40 µl of kinase buffer, and reactions were started by adding 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped on ice by adding 10 mm EDTA. After the kinase reactions, pellets were washed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, extracted for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After fixing and drying the gels, autoradiography was performed at −80 °C. Autoradiographs were analyzed using an AGFA (Mortsel, Belgium) Studio Scan IIsi scanner, and bands were quantified using the Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst software. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad SD transblot system and blocked for 2 h using 3% non-fat dry milk in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with the anti-PYK2 antibody (C-19), the anti-P-MLC20 anti-phospho-myosin light chain (P-MLC20), or the anti-MLC (clone MY-21), anti-actin (AC-40), or anti-RhoA antibodies, in all cases diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 3% non-fat dry milk. After incubating the membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL reagents. To inhibit Rho, lymphocytes were incubated for 16 h in 10% FCS in RPMI plus 50 µg/ml C3-exoenzyme (dissolved in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5). This long treatment was required to allow efficient entry of C3-exoenzyme into the cells (41Morii N. Narumiya S.

We measured the degree of ADP-ribosylation of Rho after the C3 treatment as described (54Barth H. Olenik C. Sehr P. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Meyer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27407-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal numbers (2.5 × 106) of control and C3-treated cells were washed with cold PBS, harvested in 400 µl of cold buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and sonicated. Aliquots (100 µg) of these lysates were incubated with 32P-NAD and 25 ng of C3-exoenzyme at 37 °C for 30 min. 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and run on SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Ribosylated Rho is clearly identified in the autoradiographs as an apparent 21–23-kDa band (41Morii N. Narumiya S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To inhibit ROCK and consequently the phosphorylation of the MLC, T-lymphocytes were incubated with 20 µm Y-27632 (stock solution in water) for 1 h (22Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Uehata M.

Distortion product otoacoustic emissions are sounds that emanate from the ear and are believed to be produced by the interaction of actively amplified traveling waves on the basilar membrane (7Zurek P.M. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1985; 78: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Probst R. Lonsbury-Martin B.L. Martin G.K.A. J. Acoust. Soc.

The tectorial membrane plays a crucial role in this active process, because it couples transverse, sound-induced, basilar membrane motion to a radial deflection of the sensory hair bundles. In former studies with rodents (10Deol M. J. Med. Genet. 1973; 10: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Uziel A. Acta Otolaryngol. 1981; 92: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) it has been observed that the tectorial membrane is distorted as a result of constant hypothyroidism. The major non-collagenous components of the tectorial membrane, α- and β-tectorin, were identified recently as the products of single copy genes (12Legan P.K. Rau A. Keen J.N. Richardson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 28: 8791-8801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Missense mutations in the α-tectorin gene were found in five families with non-syndromic hearing impairment (13Verhoeven K. van Laer L. Kirschhofer K. Legan P.K. Hughes D.C. Schatteman I.

As yet it is not known whether β-tectorin is essential for the development of normal hearing. To investigate whether animals with transient TH deficiency prior to hearing function have defects in tectorin expression that cause hearing impairment and the loss of active cochlear mechanics, we analyzed the TH dependence of tectorin mRNA and protein expression in the rat cochlea of animals constantly deprived of TH in comparison to animals that had been subjected to only a short period of TH deficiency prior to the onset of hearing and had thereby lost their active cochlear function (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The effects on the structure of the tectorial membrane were investigated also. Wistar rats were purchased from Interfauna (Tuttlingen, Germany). The anti-thyroid drug methylmercaptoimidazol (MMI; 0.02%), described to safely suppress plasma-TH levels in both animals and humans (17Becks G.P. Burrow G.N. Med. Clin. N. Am. 1991; 75: 121-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Lind P. Acta Med. Austriaca. 1997; 24: 157-158PubMed Google Scholar), was administered in the drinking water of the dams prior to E17 after conception. This ensures that TH levels were suppressed to <0.5 µg/dl T4 and <15 ng/dl T3 from the onset of fetal thyroid gland function onwards (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K.

Endocrinol. 1995; 133: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The treatment was continued after birth until sacrifice of the animal and dissection of the cochlea (constant hypothyroid group) or stopped at various time points between P3 and P12 (transient hypothyroid group). After discontinuation of MMI treatment, plasma levels of T4 and T3returned to normal (>5 ng/dl T4 and >75 ng/dl T3) within 2–4 days, and the pups developed under standard conditions (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Blood from the pups was collected when the animals were sacrificed for isolation of the cochlea, whereas blood from pregnant dams was collected upon retrobulbar puncture. Serum was collected, and T4 or T3 levels were determined as described (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cochleae of postnatal or adult offspring of untreated (control) and MMI-treated dams were isolated, dissected, decalcified, and cryosectioned as described previously (21Knipper M. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Köpke A.K.E. Bonk I. Zimmermann U. Zenner H.P. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 1: 23-42Google Scholar, 22Knipper M. Bandtlow C. Gestwa L. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Wiechers B. Zenner H.P.

Bandtlow C. Gestwa L. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Wiechers B. Zenner H.P. Zimmermann U. Development. 1998; 125: 3709-3718PubMed Google Scholar). Chick β-tectorin and the α1-subunit of chick α-tectorin were purified by preparative gel electrophoresis and used to produce polyclonal sera in rabbits. In brief, tectorial membranes were dissected from cochlear ducts of 2-day posthatch chicks, collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and frozen at −80 °C for storage until sufficient tissue had been collected for each immunization. Tectorial membrane samples were thawed, washed sequentially by resuspension and centrifugation (15000g × 5 min) in high salt (1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), low salt (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100), and non-ionic detergent (1% Triton X-100/10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) buffers, and then solubilized by boiling in non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Solubilized tectorial membrane proteins were separated on preparative 7.5% minigels. Strips of the gels containing the α-tectorin (Mr 196,000) and β-tectorin (Mr 41,000) bands were cut out, and the proteins were eluted with 0.1% SDS in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. After dialysis against water the samples were lyophilized. Protein from the α-tectorin band was subsequently solubilized in reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to a second round of gel electrophoresis, and protein was eluted and recovered from the region of the gel containing the α1-tectorin band (Mr 146,000). Rabbits were immunized with gel-purified tectorins that were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant for the first injection and Freund's incomplete adjuvant for the subsequent boosts. Protein from 400 tectorial membranes was used for each injection. Rabbit antiserum to chick β-tectorin (R7) was obtained from a rabbit that was immunized with protein obtained from ∼2000 tectorial membranes. Rabbit antiserum to chick α1-tectorin subunit (R9) was obtained from a rabbit that was immunized with protein obtained from a total of 1200 tectorial membranes. For immunohistochemistry, rat cochlear sections from control or hypothyroid rats, respectively, from the offspring of untreated (control) or MMI-treated dams were stained as described (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For double labeling studies, both antibodies were incubated simultaneously for the same time period. α- and β-tectorin antibodies were prepared as described above. Antibodies to the microvilli marker ezrin (23Niggli V. Andreoli C. Roy C. Mangeat P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) were purchased from Lab Vision Corp. (Ezrin/p81/80K/Cytovillin). Primary antibodies were visualized with either Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) or with Alexa Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed as described (25Wiechers B. Gestwa G. Mack A. Carroll P. Zenner H.P. Knipper M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cochleae were rapidly dissected in phosphate-buffered saline. A hole was made in the bony capsule at the apex of each cochlea, the oval and round windows were removed, and fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, containing 1% tannic acid) was perfused through the openings. The cochleae were then immersion-fixed for another 2 h in the same fixative, washed three times with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, for 1 h. The samples were washed with buffer, washed briefly with water, and decalcified in 0.5m EDTA for 5 days at 4 °C. Following decalcification, samples were dehydrated through a series of ascending concentrations of ethanol, equilibrated with propylene oxide, and finally imbedded in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin section were cut with a diamond knife, mounted on copper-mesh grids, stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and viewed in a Hitachi transmission electron microscope. The organs of Corti were collected from postnatal or adult offspring from untreated (control), or MMI-treated dams. The equivalent of four organs of Corti were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (22Knipper M. Bandtlow C. Gestwa L. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Wiechers B. Zenner H.P. Zimmermann U. Development. 1998; 125: 3709-3718PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride transfer membranes as described (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Protein transfer, antibody detection, and visualization were performed as described (22Knipper M. Bandtlow C. Gestwa L. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Wiechers B. Zenner H.P. Zimmermann U. Development. 1998; 125: 3709-3718PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA for α- and β-tectorin was prepared by Legan et al. (12Legan P.K. Rau A. Keen J.N. Richardson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 28: 8791-8801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Templates for in vitro transcription were a nearly full-length cDNA plasmid clone for mouse α-tectorin constructed by ligating a NarI to XhoI fragment of clone A2 into NarI/XhoI double digested clone A3 (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and an almost full-length β-tectorin clone (clone B3) (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized with EcoRI for in vitro transcription of antisense probes and with XhoI for in vitrotranscription of sense probes. Complementary strands for sense and antisense probes were transcribed either from T3 or T7 promoter sites in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was purchased from CLONTECH. Labeled antisense RNA probes were prepared as described by the manufacturer. Cochleae were dissected, fixed, and sectioned as described for immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization was performed as described (22Knipper M. Bandtlow C. Gestwa L. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Wiechers B. Zenner H.P. Zimmermann U. Development. 1998; 125: 3709-3718PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wiechers B. Gestwa G. Mack A. Carroll P. Zenner H.P. Knipper M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described recently (6Knipper M. Gestwa L. Ten Cate W.-J. Lautermann J. Brugger H. Maier H.

Neurol. 1999; 414: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The effect of TH on mRNA levels was evaluated and semiquantified using mRNAs isolated from a similar number of cochleae as described previously (22Knipper M. Bandtlow C. Gestwa L. Köpschall I. Rohbock K. Wiechers B. Zenner H.P. Zimmermann U. Development. 1998; 125: 3709-3718PubMed Google Scholar). Using the ImageMaster VDS system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Northern blots were digitized, and relative intensities were calculated using the ImageMaster 1D prime software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The care and use of the animals during the course of this study were in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The structure of the organ of Corti of animals that were analyzed for tectorin expression in the present study is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The organ of Corti of constant hypothyroid adult animals, in which TH levels were suppressed from the onset of fetal thyroid gland function onwards, persists at least until the 3rd or 4thpostnatal week at an immature developmental stage resembling a P5 organ of Corti. Here, the multicellular layer of the greater epithelia ridge (GER) persists, and the tectorial membrane remains attached to the GER and the inner sulcus does not form (Fig. 1A). In analogy, the organ of Corti of a transient hypothyroid animal also persists at the immature developmental stage of a P5 organ of Corti until the day of the stop of goitrogen, in the present study until P10 or P12 (Fig. 1B). After stop of the goitrogen, the organ of Corti recovers within few days and shows in adults no obvious structural abnormalities from untreated control animals; despite the temporal delay the multicellular epithelial layer of the GER transforms to a monocellular layer leading to a detached tectorial membrane and typical inner sulcus formation (Fig. 1C). The distribution of α- and β-tectorin mRNA in sections of the early postnatal rat cochlea was revealed using non-radioactivein situ hybridization. For α-tectorin at P5, a broad band of expression was observed in the greater epithelial ridge (Fig.2A, GER), and a narrower band was seen in the supporting cells that lie alongside the outer hair cells and are probably Hensen's cells (Fig. 2A,open arrow, H). Low levels of α-tectorin mRNA were also found in the phalangeal processes of Deiters' cells (Fig. 2A, open arrow, D) and in the pillar cells (Fig. 2A, closed arrow,P). β-Tectorin mRNA was found in a more restricted region of the greater epithelial ridge than a region in which α-tectorin was expressed (Fig. 2B, GER), as well as in a row of supporting cells, which is probably the third row of Deiters' cells (Fig. 2B, open arrow,D). The digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were also used for Northern blotting. In the rat cochlea the α-tectorin probe detected a 7.5-kb mRNA, whereas the β-tectorin probe hybridized to two mRNA bands of 2.9 and 2.6 kb (Fig. 3). Significant levels of α-tectorin mRNA were found in the rat cochlea even at birth. The expression of α-tectorin and β-tectorin mRNA peaked around P8 and declined to undetectable levels between P10 and P20 (Fig. 3). Using in situ hybridization, we analyzed α- and β-tectorin mRNA expression in control and constant hypothyroid animals. In control cochleae, α-tectorin mRNA was observed in the GER at P1 and P8 (Fig. 4A,Control, P1, P8) with an expression pattern as illustrated in Fig. 2. Hybridization signals declined toward P10 (not shown) and were not detectable in sections from later stages at P42 (Fig. 4A, Control, P42). In the complete absence of TH, no significant change in the expression profile was observed until P8 (Fig. 4A, Hypo,P1, P8). In contrast to the subsequent decline of α-tectorin mRNA levels observed in the cochleae of untreated control animals, in the complete hypothyroid group mRNA levels at P8 appeared to be slightly enhanced in comparison to controls (Fig.4A, Hypo, P8) before they declined only slowly. Low hybridization signals were even detectable in the apical turn of the cochleae of 6-week-old rats (Fig. 4A,Hypo, P42). In contrast to controls, in which β-tectorin mRNA was rapidly up-regulated between P1 and P8 and down-regulated after this time (Fig. 4B,Control), β-tectorin mRNA levels remained low in the GER of complete hypothyroid animals throughout the time period analyzed (P1-P42) (Fig. 4B, Hypo). However, like α-tectorin mRNA, β-tectorin mRNA remained detectable, with low hybridization signals being visible in the apical turn of cochleae of 6-week-old rats (Fig. 4B, Hypo,P42). Semiquantification of tectorin mRNA using Northern blots confirmed the effect of the absence of TH on α- and β-tectorin mRNA expression. Blots were probed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to ensure a similar amount of mRNA was loaded for each stage of development. Probes for both α- and β-tectorin were applied to the same blot. In similarity to results obtained uponin situ hybridization studies, the absence of TH led to a slight enhancement of the 7.5-kb α-tectorin mRNA at P8. In further similarity α-tectorin mRNA remained elevated after P12, whereas in controls mRNA levels were undetectable by P12 (Fig.5, compare Control andHypo for α-tectorin). The typically rapid developmental increase in the 2.9-kb β-tectorin mRNA observed normally between P2 and P8 was reduced significantly in the absence of TH. As expected from the relative abundance of the two distinct β-tectorin mRNAs, the 2.6-kb band was reduced at most time points to hardly detectable levels under hypothyroid conditions (Fig. 5, β-Tec 2.6kb). Low β-tectorin mRNA levels persisted beyond P10 (Fig.5, α-Tec, β-Tec, P12,H; P15, H; and P22,H), consistent with data from in situhybridization (Fig. 5). To analyze the consequences of altered tectorin mRNA expression caused by a reduction in TH supply, we examined the distribution of tectorin protein in the tectorial membrane of control and hypothyroid animals using antibodies specific to α- and β-tectorin. The microvillal marker ezrin was used to visualize the interface between the surface of the greater epithelial ridge and the matrix of the tectorial membrane. A severe reduction of β-tectorin protein in the tectorial membrane of hypothyroid animals was observed using laser scanning confocal microscopy as shown for the midbasal cochlear turn at P6 (Fig. 6, Control andHypo), whereas the tectorial membrane was stained in a similar manner in control and hypothyroid rats by antibodies to α-tectorin (not shown). These findings suggested that a reduction in β-tectorin mRNA expression should be considered as a cause of hearing loss in animals transiently deprived of TH (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We therefore first followed the expression of β-tectorin mRNA after a period of transient TH deficiency lasting from E17 until P10, a condition known to lead to hearing impairment in these animals (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As in previous studies we stopped the hypothyroid condition in young rats by withdrawing MMI treatment at P10. Prior to this stage, low levels of β-tectorin mRNA were noted in the GER (Fig. 4B, Hypo,P8), and low levels of β-tectorin protein were detected in the tectorial membrane (Fig. 6, Hypo P6). Within 5 days of withdrawing MMI treatment, the cochlear epithelium invaginated rapidly to form an inner sulcus (Fig.7A, Hypo P10 + 5,I Sulc) leading to the detachment of the tectorial membrane from the cells of the GER (Fig. 7B, Hypo P10 + 5,Tec). β-Tectorin mRNA levels rose rapidly as inner sulcus formation recovered, peaked within 5 days (Fig. 7A,Hypo P10 + 5, GER), and then declined completely within the next 3 days when the adult morphology was nearly reached (Fig. 7A, Hypo P10 + 8). Although β-tectorin antibodies (R7) did not typically recognize newly synthesized intracellular β-tectorin proteins in the cochlear epithelium and only β-tectorin in the tectorial membrane, the decalcification of cochlear bones required for sectioning at stages later than P10 enabled the β-tectorin antigen to be visualized in the cochlear epithelium. Thus, it became evident that within a short time period after the cessation of hypothyroid conditions, β-tectorin protein could also be visualized in the cochlear epithelium (Fig. 7B, Hypo P10 + 5, GER). However, the β-tectorin protein level in the tectorial membrane stayed at a reduced level at both 5 (Fig.7B, Hypo P10 + 5, Tec) and 8 days after cessation of hypothyroid conditions (Fig. 7B,Hypo P10 + 8, Tec). The functional importance of this finding was analyzed in animals 1 year after they had endured a transient hypothyroid period from the normal onset of thyroid gland function (at E17) until P10. β-Tectorin protein levels were detected in the cochleae using scanning confocal microscopy (Fig.8). Again, ezrin was used as a marker protein to indicate the apical surface of the epithelium (Fig. 8). We observed a strongly reduced β-tectorin protein level in the tectorial membrane of transiently TH-deprived animals (Fig. 8, Hypo P10 + 1 year) in contrast to that in the tectorial membrane of untreated controls of similar age (Fig. 8A, Control (1 year)). Semiquantification of the β-tectorin protein level in the tectorial membrane of 1-year-old transiently TH-deprived animals was performed using Western blots (Fig. 9). As in recent studies we stopped hypothyroid conditions in young rats by halting MMI treatment of the dams at P8, P10, and P12 (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Additionally, we used untreated animals (controls) or offspring of dams treated with MMI until P3, P4, or P6 (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3101-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Following hearing analysis (2Knipper M. Zinn C. Maier H. Praetorius M. Rohbock K. Köpschall I. Zimmermann U. J.

Kv1.4 exhibited a 70%trans-Golgi glycosylation conversion, whereas Kv1.1 showed none, and Kv1.4 exhibited a ∼20-fold higher cell surface expression level as compared with Kv1.1. Chimeras between Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 and site-directed mutants were constructed to identify amino acid determinants that affected these processes. Truncating the cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv1.4 inhibited its trans-Golgi glycosylation and high cell surface expression (as shown by Li, D., Takimoto, K., and Levitan, E. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 11597–11602), whereas truncating this region on Kv1.1 did not affect either of these events, indicating that its C terminus is not a negative determinant for these processes. Exchanging the C terminus between these channels showed that there are other regions of the protein that exert a positive or negative effect on these processes. Chimeric constructs between Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 identified their outer pore regions as major positive and negative determinants, respectively, for both trans-Golgi glycosylation and cell surface expression. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a number of amino acids in the pore region that are involved in these processes. These data suggest that there are multiple positive and negative determinants on both Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 that affect channel folding,trans-Golgi glycosylation conversion, and cell surface expression.

These data suggest that there are multiple positive and negative determinants on both Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 that affect channel folding,trans-Golgi glycosylation conversion, and cell surface expression. endoplasmic reticulum wild type Chinese hamster ovary Cath-a-differentiated polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein antibody Potassium (K+) channels are expressed by most cells and play important roles in cell physiology, including setting the resting membrane potential and repolarizing/modulating action potential waveforms in excitable tissues (1Rudy B.

These glycoproteins contain 20–25 kDa of carbohydrate per denatured monomer that was PNGase F-sensitive but Endo H glycosidase-insensitive, and they were also sialidase-sensitive (10Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Endo H cleaves only high mannose-type immature N-linkages found on ER1 glycoproteins and some plasma membrane proteins, whereas PNGase F cleaves allN-linkages (high mannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type linkages) (14Thotakura N.T. Bahl O.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings imply that these glycoproteins were efficiently processed and sialidated in the trans-Golgi in native brain tissue. Glycosylation is a common posttranslational modification of membrane proteins and is thought to aid in their proper folding/oligomerization and, in some cases, targeting and function. Studies have suggested that glycosylation modified the expression or function of some channels (15Thornhil W.B. Wu M.B. Jiang X. Wu X. Morgan P. Margiotta J.F. J. Biol.

The amino acid determinants responsible for the efficient oligomerization, glycosylation, processing, and targeting of K+ channels to the cell surface are not well understood (25Papazian D.M.

Tetramers appear to oligomerize in the ER, and motifs involved in this include the amino acid regions of the distal N terminus and the S1 and the S2 membrane-spanning domains (25Papazian D.M.

A number of studies using cell lines transfected with Kv1 subfamily cDNAs have noted some differences in the extent of glycosylation of the expressed homomeric channel proteinsversus those in native brain tissue, where the channels are all expressed as mature glycoproteins (7Scott V.E.S.

Other work indicates that glycosylation and/or cell surface expression of some Kvα-subunits may be governed by a cytoplasmic C terminus VXXSL motif (28Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), that various Kvα-subunits may be differentially glycosylated and expressed on the cell surface (10Shi G.

Hammond S. Schechter L.E. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned findings imply that for both efficient trans-Golgi glycosylation and high surface expression of heteromeric Kv1 subfamily channel members, there must be a favorable heteromeric subunit composition and/or stoichiometry. A recent report has identified regions on Kir-type K+channels that appear to be possible ER export signals (32Ma D. Serangue N. Lin Y. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan U. Jan L. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Ion channel trafficking defects associated with human disorders have been summarized and point to the importance of correct protein folding, oligomerization, and targeting to the cell surface for normal function (33Ashcroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). Given the above-mentioned findings, the aims of this report were to use Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 chimeras and site-directed mutants to map amino acid determinants involved in their proper folding in the ER, efficienttrans-Golgi glycosylation conversion, and high cell surface expression. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) pro5 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or in α-minimum Eagle's medium, supplemented with 0.35 mm proline, with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cath-a-differentiated (CAD) cells were obtained from Dr. J. Wang (34Qi Y. Wang J.K.T. McMilliam M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a subclone from these cells was used. CAD cells are a subclone of Cath-a cells that were derived from mouse central nervous system catecholaminergic brain stem neurons by SV40 large T immortalization. CAD cells have lost the expression of large T antigen but remain immortalized and neuronal-like. Undifferentiated CAD cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum as described above for CHO cells. Rat brain Kv1 cDNAs (6Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) were engineered using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to contain a 5′ Kozak enhanced ribosomal binding sequence (CCACC) before the start methionine and no endogenous 5′-untranslated regions or 3′-untranslated regions. C terminus truncation mutants were constructed by PCR by engineering a stop codon and a unique restriction enzyme site on the 3′ end of the cDNAs. Chimeras were constructed by PCR by using sense and antisense oligonucleotides. As an example, the strategy to exchange the C terminus of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 will be described. The identical amino acid sequence NYFYH (just past the C terminus end of the S6 transmembrane segment) in both Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 has an identical nucleotide sequence for both channels (the oligonucleotide pairs used were AACTATTTCTACCAC/SP6 and GTGGTAGAAATAGTT/T7. Appropriate fragments from the first PCR reaction were then gel-isolated/purified and used in a second PCR reaction to construct the Kv1.4-C terminal Kv1.1 and Kv1.1-C terminal Kv1.4 chimeras. Other chimeras were constructed using a similar approach. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using sense and antisense oligonucleotides by standard methods. cDNAs were subcloned into eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, and the integrity of constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's protocol on cells plated in a 35-mm dish, using 0.5 µg of cDNA/dish unless otherwise stated. The different mRNAs produced from these cDNAs in cell lines would have identical 5′-untranslated regions and 3′-untranslated regions derived from only the vector; therefore, their mRNA stabilities and translation abilities would be predicted to be similar. Membrane proteins from rat brain were prepared as described previously (15Thornhil W.B. Wu M.B. Jiang X. Wu X. Morgan P. Margiotta J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19093-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cell lines were processed 20–24 h after transfection. Cells were scraped and homogenized in ice-cold hypotonic media containing protease inhibitors (K+ phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm pepstatin A, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged (16,000 × g) at 5 °C for 1 h to pellet membranes, which were stored at −85 °C. Endo H and PNGase F glycosidases (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used per the manufacturer's protocol, with the final concentration of glycosidases at 0.16 unit/ml and 13 units/ml, respectively, for 20–24 h at 37 °C. ∼25% of the membranes recovered from a 35-mm well were used to run SDS-9% gels (∼20 µg of crude membrane protein/gel lane). The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and the filter was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS and then incubated in primary antibody overnight (Kv1.1 rabbit polyclonal N terminus Ab (to amino acids 4–27; dilution, 1:1000) or Kv1.4 mouse monoclonal N terminus Ab (to amino acids 13–37; dilution; 1:1000) (Upstate Biotechnology)). Specificities have been shown for the monoclonal (Trimmer laboratory, Ref. 35Bekel-Acruri Z. Matos M.F. Manganas L. Strassle B.W. Monaghan M.M. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S.

After washing, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary or anti-mouse secondary antibodies were added, and the bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak XAR5 film. Filters were exposed to preflashed x-ray film for various lengths of time. Densitometry analysis of signals was performed as outlined under “Cell Surface Biotinylation.” The trans-Golgi glycosylation conversion percentage equaled the upper band signal/total band signal (upper + lower band). Cells in 35-mm wells were transfected with 0.5 µg of plasmid containing channel cDNA and 0.1 µg of plasmid containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as described above. After a 20-h incubation, the cells were prepared for biotinylation of membrane proteins that contained carbohydrates following the Pierce protocol. All procedures were carried out at 5 °C unless stated otherwise. Cells were washed in PBS+ (PBS with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2) and incubated in 10 mm NaIO4 in PBS+ in the dark for 20 min to oxidize cell surface carbohydrates. After washing in PBS+, the cells were incubated with 2 mmhydrazide-LC-biotin (Pierce) in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) for 20 min in the dark, followed by washing in PBS+. The cells were incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and the protease inhibitors listed in the previous section) for 30 min and then centrifuged to pellet any insoluble material. The supernatants were transferred to another tube, an aliquot was saved for actin and GFP immunoblotting, 75 µl of streptavidin-agarose beads (1:1 slurry; Pierce) were added, and the tube was rocked overnight. The beads were washed, eluted with SDS buffer, and run on SDS gels for immunoblotting/detection with Kv1.1 N terminus Ab or Kv1.4 N terminus Ab as described above. Aliquots of the original lysis supernatant were run on SDS gels for immunoblotting with actin Abs (Sigma) or GFP Abs (CLONTECH) to normalize Kv1 signals to control for possible cell density differences or transfection efficiency differences, respectively. A film image was captured with a microtex 8700 scanmaker (dynamic range of 0–3.5), and densitometry analysis of the differences among lanes from the same film was performed with National Institutes of Health Image 1.6 software that had its own internal calibration. In addition, further external calibration was performed from a scan of an external Kodak 21-step optical density tablet. A standard curve using different dilutions of cell membranes from transfected cells indicated that immunoblot signals were linear over at least a 1–10-fold concentration range. Values are expressed normalized to the Kv1.4 signal taken as 100.0. CHO cell lines were plated on glass coverslips and cotransfected with a plasmid containing channel cDNA (0.5 µg) and a plasmid containing GFP cDNA (0.1 µg) for viewing with a fluorescence microscope. Cells with the most intense fluorescence were used for recordings. Our standard recording solution contained 150.0 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mmCaCl2, 5.0 mm glucose,and 10.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.3; NaOH). Patch pipettes were fashioned from 8161 corning glass (Warner Instruments) and had tip resistances of 1.5–2.5 megaohms when filled with an intracellular solution containing 70.0 mm KCl, 65.0 mm KF, 5.0 mm Na, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10.0 mmEGTA, 5.0 mm glucose, and 10.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.3; KOH). Whole cell currents were recorded and analyzed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and the pclamp8/Digidata 1200 data acquisition/analysis system (Axon Instruments) 20–30 h after transfection at room temperature (23 °C to 25 °C) (37Hamill O.P. Marty A. Hneher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar). Cells were held at −80 mV and depolarized to a maximum activating voltage of 50–80 mV. Nontransfected CHO pro5 cells showed either no or at most 100 pA of endogenous K+ current at maximum activating voltages of 50 mV (15Thornhil W.B. Wu M.B. Jiang X. Wu X. Morgan P. Margiotta J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19093-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because Kv1.4 shows accumulative inactivation (38Bertoli A. Moran O. Conti F. Exp. Brain Res. 1996; 110: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the −80 mV holding potential duration was >30 s before a test potential was applied. Mean linear membrane leak current was subtracted by the P/4 protocol. Membrane capacitance and series resistance (Rs) were estimated by the pclampex software from a transient capacitance current elicited by a 10-mV hyperpolarizing voltage step from −80 mV. Membrane capacitance was compensated using the amplifier controls, and Rs was compensated by patch clamp circuitry by 85–95%. The voltage-induced currents were filtered at 5 kHz (−3dB cutoff) and digitized at 50 µs. Maximum peak conductance values (G) were obtained from the mean value of the peak leak-subtracted current (I) using Ohm's law (G = I/(Vp − EK)) and a predicted Nernst K+ equilibrium potential (EK) of −83 mV. A test voltage value was corrected for the change of V introduced by the residue uncompensated Rs (change of V = I Rs; I is the net voltage-gated current). An unpaired t test was used to assess statistical differences of a control value compared with another one.p < 0.05 was considered significant. In rat brain, Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 are expressed as mature glycoproteins of 110 kDa (appears to be a doublet) and 80 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 1and 6, respectively). Both p110 and p80 were Endo H-insensitive glycoproteins that contained 20–25 kDa of Endo F-sensitive carbohydrate (data not shown), which implied they were efficiently processed and glycosylated in the Golgi/trans-Golgi at their one extracellularN-glycosylation site (Fig. 2,A and C). cDNA analysis showed that Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 have high amino acid identity (79% identical from their cytoplasmic N terminus T1 region through their S6 transmembrane domain), and their calculated core protein molecular masses are 73.5 kDa (655 amino acids) and 56.4 kDa (495 amino acids), respectively (6Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Kv1.4 has a longer cytoplasmic N terminus than Kv1.1. When the homotetramers were expressed in CHO cells, Kv1.4 exhibited efficienttrans-Golgi glycosylation with significantly more mature p110 glycoprotein band than the immature p85 glycoprotein band, whereas Kv1.1 predominantly expressed an immature p60 glycoprotein band that was Endo H-sensitive (data not shown), indicating ER processing, and there was little indication of a mature p80 band (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 7, respectively). Evidence suggests that these differences are due to properties of the Kv1 channel core proteins and that cotransfection with Kvβ-subunit cDNAs did not promote theirtrans-Golgi glycosylation (29Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemisty. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Kv1.4 homomers expressed in CHO cells also exhibited higher cell surface expression than Kv1.1 homomers as assayed by patch clamping (Fig. 5A,representative whole cell current traces; Fig. 5B, maximum conductance per capacitance). Because Kv1.4 has a smaller single channel conductance (Kv1.4 = 4 picosiemens and Kv1.1 = 10 picosiemens), fast N-type inactivation, and fast C-type inactivation compared with Kv1.1 (6Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), we predict that the ∼10-fold higher difference for Kv1.4 versus Kv1.1 recorded in Fig.5B was more likely closer to ∼20-fold difference in surface protein expression, and biotinylation of surface glycoproteins suggests that this is the case (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 exhibited very different degrees of efficienttrans-Golgi glycosylation and high cell surface expression when expressed as homomers in cell lines, and for both processes, Kv1.4 showed a higher level of glycosylation conversion and surface expression as compared with Kv1.1. Therefore, they are ideal candidates to be used to examine which regions of each protein contain positive or negative determinants for these two processes.Figure 2Schematic of the different chimeric constructs between Kv1.4 and Kv1.1.A, schematic of a monomeric Kv1 channel with its six transmembrane domains depicted asboxes and the N and C terminus located intracellularly.

https://openalex.org/W2018818470,"The small GTPase protein Rac1 is involved in a wide range of biological processes, yet its role in cell differentiation is mostly unknown. Here we show that Rac1 activity is high in proliferating myoblasts and decreases during the differentiation process. To analyze the involvement of Rac1 in muscle differentiation, different forms of the protein were expressed in muscle cells. A constitutively activated form of Rac1 (Rac1Q61L) inhibited the activity of MyoD in promoting muscle differentiation, whereas a dominant negative form of Rac1 (Rac1T17N) induced the activity of MyoD in promoting muscle differentiation. Expression of Rac1T17N imposed myogenic differentiation on myoblasts growing under mitogenic conditions. In inquiring whether Rac1 affected the withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, we analyzed the expression of cyclin D1 and p21WAF1 and the phosphorylation state of the retinoblastoma protein. According to these markers and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, C2 myoblasts expressing Rac1T17N exited the cell cycle earlier than control C2 cells. Myoblasts expressing Rac1Q61L did not permanently withdraw from the cell cycle. An indication of the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in Rac1-mediated myoblast proliferation was obtained by the use of MAPK kinase inhibitors U0126 and PD098059. These inhibitors arrested C2-Rac1Q61L cell cycling. Taken together, our results show that Rac1 activation interferes with myoblast exit from the cell cycle via or in concert with the MAPK pathway.

In mammalian cells, Rac functions by generating the actin-rich lamellipodial protrusions and membrane ruffling that are thought to be a major part of the driving force for cell movement (3Ridley A.J.

Independent of this effect of cytoskeletal rearrangements, Rac1 and CDC42 induce the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Some reports suggest that Rac1 and CDC42 activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 and the p38 MAPK (4Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Rac and CDC42 can synergize with Raf1 or MEK1 to promote ERK activation (8Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It turns out that p21-activated kinase (PAK), which is a CDC42 and Rac target, positively regulates Raf1 and MEK1 activities through phosphorylation of specific serine residues (9King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 10Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K.

These functions of Rac and CDC42 in cytoskeletal reorganization and the induction of MAPK signaling pathways may explain their role in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes in development and morphogenesis (11Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The differentiation of skeletal muscle cells involves two major stages: (a) withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, and (b) subsequent expression of myotube-specific genes. Proliferating myoblasts express two myogenic transcription factors from the basic helix-loop-helix family, MyoD and Myf5, before the onset of muscle differentiation (12Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 13Lassar A.B.

Once activated, MyoD and Myf5 induce the withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle and the expression of another myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor, myogenin, as well as transcription factors from the MEF2 family. Together, myogenin and MEF2 family members cooperate in the activation of many muscle structural genes (15Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 16Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms controlling myogenesis at the transcriptional level are well characterized, the signaling molecules that mediate the transduction of extracellular cues and affect the muscle regulatory factors are only partially uncovered. The role of Rho GTPases, particularly that of Rac proteins in skeletal muscle differentiation, is controversial. Ramocki et al. (17Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggested that the Rho family did not affect the ability of MyoD to convert 10T1/2 fibroblasts to myoblasts. A study by Takano et al. (18Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) indicated that the different members of the Rho family played a positive role in the differentiation of C2 myoblasts. In their study, the expression of dominant negative forms of Rho family members suppressed transcription of muscle-specific genes, whereas constitutively activated forms induced their transcription (18Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A more recent work by Gallo et al. (19Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that studied avian myoblasts suggested that constitutively active Rac1 and Cdc42 caused inhibition of myogenin expression and blocked myogenic differentiation. This inhibition was mainly a consequence of posttranscriptional block to the expression of muscle-specific proteins. The study also indicated that cells expressing constitutively active Rac1 failed to assemble ordered sarcomeres, whereas the expression of dominant negative Rac1 accelerated sarcomere maturation. In view of the disputed and diverse roles of Rho members in myogenesis, we investigated the involvement of Rac1 in muscle cell differentiation. The activity of Rac1 was high in proliferating myoblasts and decreased during their differentiation to myotubes. We generated stable myoblast cell lines expressing the different forms of Rac1 and found that constitutively activated Rac1 prevented withdrawal from the cell cycle and muscle differentiation, whereas dominant negative Rac1 induced growth arrest and differentiation. The activity of Rac1 induced the expression of cyclin D1 and repressed the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Consequently, pRb remained hyperphosphorylated, and myoblasts did not withdraw properly from the cell cycle. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway rescued the withdrawal of activated Rac1-expressing myoblasts from the cell cycle. This study therefore indicates that the activity of Rac1 has to be blocked in order for myoblasts to exit the cell cycle and differentiate into mature myotubes.

Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% calf serum (Hyclone), penicillin, and streptomycin (growth medium (GM)). To induce differentiation, we used Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin (differentiation medium (DM)). Differentiation of 10T1/2 cells that expressed MyoD-ER protein was induced by the addition of DM that contained 10−7 m estradiol. C2 cells were transfected with pCEFL-AU5 plasmids encoding for Rac1 proteins, and after 48 h, cells were selected with G418 (1000 μg/ml). Two weeks later, resistant clones were pooled together, propagated, and further studied. Clones were ring-isolated from the pools of C2 Rac1Q61L and C2 Rac1T17N. Two clones from each pool were selected for further study by the levels of exogenous Rac1 expression. The 10T1/2 MyoD-ER cells were infected with replication-defective viruses carrying pBABE-Puro and pBABE-Puro Rac1T17N vectors. Forty-eight h later, cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml); resistant clones were pooled together a week later. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (26Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) or using the TransFast reagent of Promega according to the recommended protocol. Cells in 6-cm Tissue Culture dishes (Corning) were transfected with a total amount of 10 μg (or 5 μg, using TransFast) of the following plasmid DNA: 1 μg of pCMV-LacZ or pMSV-LacZ, 3 μg of CAT reporter gene, and 3 μg of the various expression vectors. The empty vector of pCEFL KZ AU5 containing the EF1α promoter was added to equalize the promoter content in each transfection experiment. After transfection, the medium was replaced with either GM or DM for another 24–48 h. Transfection efficiencies were tested in soluble 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assays, and the amounts of extracts used for the CAT assays were adjusted accordingly (27Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed and immunostained as described previously (28Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The primary antibody used was a monoclonal anti-MHC antibody (MF-20). In some experiments, the fixated cells were incubated with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin to label the actin filaments. The immunochemically stained and phalloidin-labeled cells were viewed in a fluorescence microscope (model BX50; Olympus) at a magnification of ×200 and photographed. Specific isolation of Rac1-GTP was performed as described previously (29Ku G.M. Yablonski D. Manser E. Lim L. Weiss A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Manser E.

Cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 4% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. After 10 min at 4 °C, the lysates were clarified in a microfuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with 30 μg of glutathione S-transferase-PAK cdc42/Rac interactive binding for 15 min at 4 °C with rotation. The pellets were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and resuspended with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. After gel separation and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, Rac1 was analyzed by Western blotting. RNA was extracted using TRI REAGENTTM (MRC Inc.) and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (28Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with probes for Rac1 (pCEFL AU5 Rac1WT), myogenin (pEMSV-Myogenin), MLC2 (PVZLC2), p21 (pCDNA-Waf1), and GAPDH (pMGAP). Cells were lysed, and whole cell extracts were collected as described previously (28Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracted proteins (30–100 μg) were loaded and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect the different forms of pRb, proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before being transferred to membranes. Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and then incubated with the same buffer with the first and secondary antibodies. Between the second and third incubations, membranes were washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 and 1× Tris-buffered saline (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl). Immunoblotting was conducted with the following antibodies: anti-ERK and anti-phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs; 1:1000), anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma; 1:1000), and anti-pRb (PharMingen; 1:1000). Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit by Pierce. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the media of growing cells at 10 μm for 2–3 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol (10 min), and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (10 min). After a phosphate-buffered saline wash, the cells were incubated in 2n HCl solution for 1 h. Solution was neutralized by washing the cells three times in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 8.5). Subsequently, cells were incubated with 6 μg/ml anti-BrdUrd antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. The remainder of the procedure was identical to the immunohistochemical staining of cells described previously (28Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To study the activity of endogenous Rac1 during differentiation of C2 myoblasts, GTP-bound Rac1 was specifically precipitated using glutathione S-transferase fused to the G-protein-binding domain of PAK1 (30Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and then detected with a Rac1-specific antibody (Fig. 1A). The amount of GTP-bound Rac1 was high in proliferating myoblasts and was significantly reduced after myoblasts were grown in DM (Fig.1A). This pattern of activity suggested that Rac1 was necessary for myoblast proliferation, but not for the differentiation to myotubes. To study how the small GTPase Rac1 affects the differentiation of myoblasts, we generated several C2 cell lines expressing wild type (WT-Rac1), constitutively active (Rac1Q61L and Act-Rac1), and dominant negative (Rac1T17N and DN-Rac1) forms of Rac1 and a control C2 cell line containing integrated copies of the empty expression vector (Neo). Cells were drug-selected, and surviving colonies were pooled together. Myoblasts transfected with Rac1Q61L appeared flat and enlarged, whereas those transfected with Rac1T17N showed reduced cellular dimensions (data not shown). The amount of GTP-bound Rac1 in C2- Rac1Q61L cells (Act-Rac1 cells) was high and remained high after 24 h in DM, whereas the amount of GTP-bound Rac1 in C2-Rac1T17N cells (DN-Rac1 cells) was almost undetectable (Fig.1B). To study the morphology and organization of the actin filaments, cells were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Control myoblasts and cells transfected with Rac1T17N were characterized by parallel well-organized actin filaments, whereas cells transfected with Rac1Q61L frequently appeared with a poor complement of stress fibers but pronounced lamellipodia and ruffles (Fig.1C). Next we analyzed how the expression of different forms of Rac1 affected the differentiation process. Myoblasts were induced to differentiate in DM, and the expression of several genes was analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1D). The differentiation state of cells can be represented by the expression levels of MLC2. The expression of MLC2 was induced in all cell lines as a result of their growth in DM; however, we observed differences in its levels of expression. MLC2 expression was induced to similar levels in the C2 control cell line (Neo) and in myoblasts expressing the wild type form of Rac1 (WT-Rac1) (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1–4and 13–16). The expression of MLC2 in cells expressing Rac1Q61L (Act-Rac1) was initially induced, but it was reduced to very low levels after 72 h in DM (Fig. 1D, lanes 9–12). Expression of MLC2 in cells expressing Rac1T17N (DN-Rac1) was induced to levels higher than those seen in all other cell lines (Fig.1D, lanes 5–8). Transcripts of the transfected Rac1 were of a different size than the endogenous transcript and were identified in cell lines transfected with plasmids encoding for the different forms of Rac1, but not in the control cell line (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). We conclude that expression of dominant negative Rac1 stimulates the expression of MLC2, whereas constitutively active Rac1 inhibits the expression of the myogenic marker MLC2. To further substantiate these results and find out whether the above-mentioned effect of Rac1 proteins is quantitative, single cell colonies were isolated from each cell line. These colonies were expanded, and levels of transfected Rac1 were analyzed. We chose to analyze two colonies expressing different levels of either dominant negative or activated Rac1. The expression of MLC2 was compared with that in a clone of myoblasts that did not express significant levels of the exogenous gene. Induction of MLC2 was proportional to the transcript levels of the dominant negative Rac1 (Fig.2, DN-Rac#1 and DN-Rac #2). In cells expressing the dominant negative form of Rac1, transcripts of MLC2 were accumulated earlier and to higher levels than those in control cells. In contrast, induction of MLC2 decreased proportionally to the increasing levels of constitutively activated Rac1 (Fig. 2, Act-Rac#1 and Act-Rac#2). High expression levels of activated Rac1 completely abolished any accumulation of MLC2 (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Therefore, these results suggest a quantitative effect of Rac1 mutants on the expression of MLC2. Next we analyzed whether the expression of Rac1 mutants affected the morphology of multinucleated myotubes. We hypothesized that Rac1 could affect the morphology of myotubes via its function on the organization of actin filaments and stress fibers that control cell motility and cell-cell interactions (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Under a light microscope, we could see that the cell line expressing Rac1Q61L did not develop typical myotubes (data not shown). Immunostaining of the different Rac1-expressing cell lines at 48 h in DM allowed a closer inspection of myotube morphology. We found that cells expressing activated Rac1 formed very few myotubes, which were, on average, much larger in size and contained significantly more nuclei/cell than did the control C2 cells (Neo) (Fig.3). These myotubes also differed in their shape, which was wide rather than elongated. In contrast, the cells expressing dominant negative Rac1 developed multiple elongated myotubes that were significantly smaller in size and contained fewer nuclei/cell compared with the control C2 cells (Fig. 3). The differences in cell size and fusion rates between cell lines do not appear to be due to differences in the density of cells, as can be seen by the nuclear staining of the same microscopic field (Fig. 3, right panels). In addition, we were able to observe differences in the intensity of myosin staining between the different cell lines. Intensive myosin staining was observed in dominant negative Rac1-expressing cells (DN-Rac1), whereas the staining of myotubes expressing activated Rac1 (Act-Rac1) was the weakest (Fig. 3). The effects of Rac1 on muscle-specific transcription observed in Fig.1D prompted us to analyze whether the activity of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD was also affected. To that end, 10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression vectors of MyoD and the different forms of Rac1. By immunostaining of these cells, we found that transfected MyoD induced the expression of endogenous MHC in about 50% of the transfected cells (Fig.4A, lane 1). Under the same conditions, cells that were cotransfected with the activated allele of Rac1 exhibited a significantly lower proportion of MHC staining in the cytoplasm of MyoD-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lane 2), whereas cells cotransfected with the dominant negative Rac1 showed higher MHC staining (Fig. 4A, lane 3). These results suggest that Rac1 affected MyoD activity in inducing muscle differentiation. The results also indicate that the different forms of Rac1 affected muscle differentiation in a similar way, regardless of whether they were transiently or stably expressed following a selective pressure. To further analyze the transcriptional activity of MyoD, the same expression vectors were cotransfected with two MyoD-responsive reporter genes. One reporter contained the enhancer element of the muscle creatine kinase gene (pe+AT-CAT), and the other was a minimal promoter that contained several MyoD binding sites (4R-tk-CAT). Transfection of the activated form of Rac1 inhibited MyoD-mediated transcription of both reporter genes (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and6). Wild-type Rac1 inhibited the transcriptional activity of MyoD to a lesser extent (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and8). Transfection of the dominant negative form of Rac1 did not significantly affect MyoD-mediated transcription (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 7). A different approach for analyzing the regulation of MyoD by Rac1 used a fibroblast cell line that stably expressed a conditional MyoD protein (25Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The protein is a MyoD-estrogen receptor chimera whose activity is induced by the addition of β-estradiol to the medium. Induction of myogenesis in this cell line follows a very precise timetable because it depends on the activation of the MyoD-ER protein. We infected dominant negative Rac1 to these cells and selected for cells that stably expressed the transcript of exogenous Rac1 (Fig.5A, lanes 3 and 4). When the MyoD protein was activated under conditions that promoted differentiation (DM), the expression of MLC2 was higher in the cell line expressing dominant negative Rac1 (pBABE-D.N.-Rac) as compared with the control cell line (pBABE-puro). The differences between these cell lines were much more significant when the MyoD-ER protein was activated during the growth of cells in serum-rich medium (GM) that usually prevented the activity of the MyoD protein. The activation of MyoD-ER protein induced the transcription of p21, myogenin, and MLC2 in the cell line expressing dominant negative Rac1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 4–6), but it did not affect the transcription of these genes in the control cell line (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–3). The activation of p21 and myogenin, two direct target genes of MyoD, suggests that inactivation of Rac1 in growth-promoting conditions (GM) allows transcriptional activity of the MyoD protein that is otherwise repressed.Figure 510T1/2 MyoD-ER cells expressing dominant negative Rac1 can undergo myogenic differentiation in serum-rich medium. A, 10T1/2 cells expressing a fusion protein of MyoD and the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor were infected with either a replication-defective retrovirus coding for the dominant negative Rac1 (pBABE-D.N.-Rac1) or a control empty retrovirus (pBABE-puro). Infected cells were selected, and resistant polyclones were expanded. The two lines were grown in GM and then grown in DM supplemented with β-estradiol for an additional 48 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting. Membrane was sequentially hybridized with probes for MLC2, Rac1, and GAPDH.B, the two cell lines were grown in GM, and β-estradiol was added when cells were about 70% confluent. Total RNA was extracted when β-estradiol was added to the cells (0 h) and at the indicated time periods (24 and 48 h) after the addition of β-estradiol. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting. The membrane was sequentially hybridized with probes for MLC2, myogenin, p21, and GAPDH.View Large Image"

In the present study, we investigated this cell death pathway by stably transfecting the p53-null H358 cell line with a tetracycline-dependent wild type p53-expressing vector. Restoration of p53 triggered a G2/M cell cycle arrest and enhanced BAX protein expression, without inducing apoptosis or potentiating the cytotoxic effect of etoposide, vincristine, and cis-platinum. Accordingly, overexpression of BAX in H358 cells, through stable transfection of a tetracycline-regulated expression vector, did not induce cell death. Interestingly, the methylxanthine caffeine (4 mm) promoted the translocation of BAX from the cytosol to the mitochondria. In the setting of an overexpression of BAX, caffeine induced a conformational change of the protein and apoptosis. The consequences of caffeine were independent of its cell cycle-related activities. All together, caffeine synergizes with p53 for inducing cell death through a cell cycle-independent mechanism, involving mitochondrial translocation and conformational change of BAX protein.

In turn, p53 regulates the cellular response to DNA damage by mediating cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and/or cell death, which is essential for preventing the accumulation of genetic alterations (1Rich T.

To further investigate the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway, we used the p53-null non-small cell lung carcinoma H358 cell line transfected with a tetracycline-inducible wild type p53-expressing vector. We show that wild type p53 expression triggers G2/M cell cycle arrest without inducing apoptosis, although a marked increase in BAX expression is observed. Interestingly, the methylxanthine caffeine is able to promote the translocation of BAX from the cytosol to the mitochondria and to trigger apoptosis in a cell cycle-independent manner. pTRE-p53 and pTRE-BAX plasmids were constructed by subcloning, respectively, the wild type p53 cDNA or influenza hemagglutinin (HA)1 protein epitope-tagged BAX cDNA downstream of the Tet-regulated promoter into pTRE plasmid. Construction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). The human non-small lung adenocarcinoma cell line H358 of bronchioloalveolar origin (ATCC CRL5807) has a homozygous deletion of p53. H358/TetON/p53, H358/TetON/BAX, and H358/TetON control clones were obtained by stable transfection of parental H358 cells using a modified tetracycline-regulated inducible expression system (Tet-ON system,CLONTECH). H358 cells were transfected with the pTet-ON plasmid that contained the reverse tetracycline repressor expression cassette and the neomycin resistance gene (neor), using TFX-50 (Promega, Charbonnières, France), and transferrin (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France). Resulting H358 Tet-ON cells were then cotransfected using liposome-mediated transfection method (TFX-50 and transferrin) with both pTK-Hyg plasmids containing hygromycin resistance gene and either pTRE-p53 or pTRE-HA-BAX or empty pTRE. Double transfectants were selected in the presence of hygromycin (200 µg/ml) and Geneticin (100 µg/ml) (both from Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). H358 cells were cultured as adherent monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All products were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). H358/TetON/p53, H358/TetON/BAX, and H358/TetON control cells were maintained in medium as described above, supplemented with hygromycin (50 µg/ml) and Geneticin (G418: 100 µg/ml) (both from Life Technologies, Inc.). To induce p53 or HA-BAX expression, doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 µg/ml, which is non-toxic for the cells. Caffeine, etoposide, vincristin, and cis-platinum were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stock solutions of etoposide, vincristin and cis-platinum in Me2SO were stored at −20 °C. Control cells received Me2SO solvent alone. The final concentration of Me2SO solvent in the culture medium never exceeded 1%, which is non-toxic for the cells. Caffeine was dissolved in fresh medium just before use. For serum deprivation, cells were rinsed once in PBS and cultured for at least 8 h in fetal calf serum-free medium. Medium was then changed and culture continued in serum-free medium for the indicated time. Drug treatments and serum deprivation were performed 24 h after p53 or BAX induction by diluting drug in fresh medium in the presence or absence of doxycycline (1 µg/ml). The morphological changes related to apoptosis were assessed by fluorescence microscopy after staining of cells with Hoechst 33342 (5 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and the percentage of apoptosis was scored after counting at least 200 cells. For cytotoxicity assay, cells were plated at the initial density of 104 cells/well in 96 wells plate in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C. After 96 h of drug treatment, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 100% ethanol for 15 min, and stained with methylene blue (1% in borate buffer 0.01 m, pH = 8.5). Plates were washed with water, and methylene blue was eluted by 0.1 n HCl. The absorbance measurements were performed at 630 nm. Each determination was performed in triplicate. Cell survival was calculated as follows: Cell survival(%)=Mean absorbance in drug­treated wellsMean absorbance in untreated wells×100Equation 1 Cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min on ice. Protein content was assessed by the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad S.A., Ivry sur Seine, France). Cell lysates (20–40 µg of proteins) were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Saint Quentin Yvelines, France). After blocking nonspecific binding sites for 30 min with 5% nonfat milk in TPBS (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature, the membrane was incubated overnight at +4 °C with primary antibody diluted in TPBS. The used primary antibodies were anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (1/1000) (DO7; Dako S.A., Trappes, France), anti-BAX rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/5000) (PharMingen, Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France), anti-p21Waf1/CIP1mouse monoclonal antibody (1/1000) (Oncogen Research Product, Fontenay sous bois, France), anti-BAK monoclonal antibody (1/1000) (Calbiochem, Fontenay sous bois, France), anti-survivin monoclonal antibody (1/1000) (PharMingen), or anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (1/3000) (PharMingen). To ensure equal loading and transfer, membranes were reprobed for actin using anti-actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/3000) (Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) diluted 1/5000 in TPBS and enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For cell cycle analysis, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min, and incubated for 15 min in the presence of RNase A (20 µg/ml). Cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide (10 µg/ml in PBS) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France). For immunostaining analysis, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (0.5%) for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of anti-BAX rabbit polyclonal antibody (diluted 1/100) (PharMingen) or anti-BAX rabbit polyclonal antibody (diluted 1/100) (Santa Cruz), both raised against the peptide sequence amino acids of N terminus BAX protein, anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (1/750) (Babco, Eurogentec, Angers, France), or mouse or rabbit irrelevant IgG (PharMingen). All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Interchim) diluted 1/100 in PBS plus 1% BSA, washed again in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) using Cellquest software. Green fluorescence (fluorescein isothiocyanate, FL-1) was detected at 530 nm and red fluorescence (propidium iodide, Fl-2) at 575 nm. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then resuspended at 5 × 107/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin). Cells were broken down by passing through a 25-gauge needle fitted on a 2-ml syringe, and the suspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 7 min at +4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet containing heavy membrane (designated as heavy membrane fraction (HMF)) was washed once in lysis buffer and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet remaining membranes, and the resulting supernatant was termed cytosolic fraction. HMF and cytosolic fraction were assessed for protein content using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit, and 20 µg of proteins were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting for BAX content. The relative purity of fractions was ascertained by Western blotting using the mouse monoclonal anti-mitochondrial-HSP70 (Affinity Bioreagent, Interchim) as a marker of mitochondria. The equal proteins loading and transfer were ensured by reprobing the membranes using anti-actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). At different times after p53 or BAX induction, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (0.5%) for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of anti-BAX rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/100) (N-20; Santa Cruz) or anti-BAX rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/100) (PharMingen) both raised against the peptide sequence amino acids of N terminus BAX protein or anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (1/1000) (Babco, Eurogentec, Angers, France) and/or anti-mitochondrial-HSP70 mouse monoclonal antibody (1/100) (Affinity Bioreagent, Interchim, Montluçon, France) or mouse or rabbit irrelevant immunoglobulins (PharMingen). Antibobies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% BSA. For cytochrome c staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, then washed twice in PBS and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. After saturation of nonspecific binding with a 5% milk solution in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1/200) (PharMingen) and anti-BAX polyclonal antibody (1/100) (Santa Cruz) diluted in PBS plus 1% milk. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated for 30 min with 488-Alexa (green) goat anti-rabbit and 568-Alexa (red) goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes, Interchim) diluted 1/1000 in PBS plus 1% BSA. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were suspended in mounting medium (moeviol), pipetted dropwise onto a glass slide, and observed using an Olympus microscope (Olympus, Rungis, France), The images were captured by a Coolview CCD camera (Photonic Science), digitally saved using Visilog software, and further processed using Photoshop software (Adobe). The p53-null human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma H358 cell line was transfected with a wild type p53 cDNA construct under the positive control of a tetracycline-dependent promoter. Three H358/tetON/p53 clones were selected for subsequent studies. The tetracycline analog doxycycline (1 µg/ml) induced the expression of p53 in H358/tetON/p53 cells within 24 h (Fig. 1A). The biological activity of transfected p53 was assessed by its ability to up-regulate its transcriptional targets p21 and BAX (Fig.1A). As we observed previously (28Coll J.L. Negoescu A. Louis N. Sachs L. Tenaud C. Girardot V. Demeinex B. Brambilla E. Brambilla C. Favrot M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we did not detect any expression of Bcl-2 in these cells (data not shown) and the level of the Bcl-2-related pro-apoptotic protein BAK was not modified after p53 expression (Fig. 1A). Despite the increase in BAX protein level, expression of p53 failed to induce characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis, as observed after staining of cells with the dye Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 1B). In addition, wild type p53 expression did not sensitize H358 cells to the toxic activity ofcis-platinum, vincristine, or etoposide (Fig.1C). Expression of p53 in H358/tetON/p53 cells increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle within 48 h of doxycycline treatment (TableI). In order to bypass this G2/M arrest, cells were either serum-deprived or treated with the methylxanthine caffeine (4 mm). As expected, serum removal from culture medium or exposure to caffeine during 48 h significantly decreased the number of cells in G2/M phase and increased the number of cells in G0/G1phase, both in p53-null and in p53-expressing cells (Table I). Whereas serum deprivation did not induce a significant apoptosis in any condition (Table I), caffeine induced a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in p53-expressing cells that was not observed in p53-null cells (Table I and Fig.2A). Since caffeine-mediated apoptosis was not observed in H358/tetON control cells, we ruled out the possibility of a nonspecific effect of caffeine in the presence of doxycycline. In accordance with these observations, p53 expression was not sufficient to induce the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, caffeine treatment of p53-null cells failed to induce caspase-3 proteolysis. By contrast, caffeine treatment of p53-expressing cells was associated with the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 in a p12 active fragment (Fig. 2B). Caffeine did not influence the level of expression of p53, BAX, and p21 in either p53-null or p53-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). Neither wild type p53 nor caffeine had any influence on the expression of the apoptosis inhibitor protein survivin (Fig. 2B) (29Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C.

To discriminate between the endogenous and induced protein, an influenza hemagglutinin protein epitope (HA) was added to BAX. Doxycycline induced a dose-dependent expression of HA-BAX (Fig.3A). In agreement with the results obtained in H358/tetON/p53 clones after p53 induction, overexpression of BAX did not affect cell survival (Fig.3A), nor did it sensitize the cells to drug-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Even though BAX overexpression did not induce any accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3A), caffeine could induce a dose-dependent apoptosis in BAX-overexpressing cells (Fig.3B). This was associated with the procaspase-3 proteolytic cleavage in its p12 active fragment (Fig. 3B). Caffeine did not influence the level of endogenous BAX or HA-BAX when studied by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). However, it modified the pattern of expression of the HA-tagged protein when studied by immunofluorescence using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3C). In the absence of caffeine, HA-BAX protein exhibited a punctuated as well as diffused staining pattern, whereas, in the presence of caffeine, HA-BAX protein showed a predominantly punctuated staining pattern, suggesting that caffeine induced a change in HA-BAX intracellular distribution. To further analyze the influence of p53 and caffeine on BAX subcellular localization, H358/TetON/p53 cells were fractionated into cytosolic fractions and HMF (Fig. 4). In control, p53-null cells, BAX protein was expressed mainly in the cytosolic fraction and more weakly in the HMF. Induction of p53 expression by doxycycline increased the expression of BAX in both the cytosolic fraction and the HMF, without modifying its subcellular distribution. Caffeine induced a strong decrease in cytosolic BAX expression within 72 h, whereas the protein accumulated in the HMF in both p53-null and p53-expressing cells (Fig. 4). Previous studies have shown that BAX protein underwent a conformational change exposing its N terminus during apoptosis (30Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Bio. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 31Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundress K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Using epitope-specific anti-BAX antibodies that specifically recognize BAX protein with an exposed N-terminal extremity but not the protein in its native conformation, we analyzed the conformational state of BAX protein. A flow cytometry analysis showed that induction of p53 by doxycycline in H358/tetON/p53 had a limited influence on the exposed N terminus BAX-associated immunofluorescence (Fig. 5A, 3). Thus, induction of p53 increased the expression of BAX protein (as detected by Western blotting) in its native conformation with an unexposed N terminus. Caffeine did not modify the level of BAX N terminus staining in p53-null cells (Fig. 5A, 2). By contrast, it induced an exposure of the N terminus of BAX in p53-expressing H358/TetON/p53 cells (Fig. 5A, 4), as revealed by an increase in exposed N terminus BAX-associated fluorescence. Similarly, when examined by microscopy after immunostaining using the same epitope-specific BAX antibody, N terminus BAX was not detected in p53-null cells (Fig. 5B, 1), in H358 cells expressing p53 upon doxycycline treatment (Fig. 5B,3), or in p53-null cells exposed to caffeine (Fig.5B, 2). In p53-expressing cells, caffeine induced an intense punctuated staining of N terminus BAX (Fig. 5B,4) that co-localized with the mitochondrial HSP70 protein (Fig. 5C). In addition, apoptotic cells identified by their fragmented nuclei were positive for N terminus BAX staining and demonstrated a diffuse cytochrome c staining, which contrasted with the punctuated staining observed in non-apoptotic cells (Fig. 5D). This later observation suggested that the exposure of the N terminus of BAX was associated with the cytochromec release from mitochondria. Several pathways have been described to mediate p53-induced apoptosis (5Bates S. Vousden K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). One of these involves BAX, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of protein (13McCurrach M.E. Connor T.M.F. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We show here that expression of wild type p53 in H358 human p53-null cancer cell line induces BAX accumulation in the cytosol without inducing cell death. At least one additional signal is required to modify BAX localization and conformation, thereby inducing cytochrome c release and caspase activation. We demonstrate that the methylxanthine caffeine is able to provide such an additional signal. p53 expression in p53-null cells was shown to lead either to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Several studies brought evidence that the level of p53 expression was critical for its pro-apoptotic activity (32Lassus P. Ferlin M. Piette J. Hibner U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Mukhopadhyay T. Multani A.S. Roth J.A. Pathak S.

J. 2000; 347: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). p53-induced apoptosis was usually observed when p53 is strongly expressed, e.g. through transient transfection or viral infection, whereas the protein expressed at a lower level,e.g. by using a temperature-sensitive mutant or an inducible system, did not trigger cell death (19Merchant A.K.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in our cellular model, we have shown previously that transient transfection of p53 could induce apoptosis. 2Dubrez, L., Coll, J.-L., de Fraipont, F., Hurbin, A., Lantejoul, S., and Favrot, M.-C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276,in press. This was confirmed in the H358/tetON/p53 clone cultured in the absence of doxycycline (data not shown), indicating that the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway was functional in these cells. Thus, the lack of cell death in H358/tetON/p53 cells expressing p53 upon doxycycline exposure may be due to a low level of p53 expression. Another possibility is that cellular stress mediated by transient gene transfer synergizes with p53 to mediate apoptosis. Whatever the mechanism, doxycycline-mediated p53 expression does not trigger H358 cell death while it increases BAX expression. The subcellular localization of BAX plays a central role in its pro-apoptotic activity (20Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Gross A. McDonnel J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar, 41Nomura M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Narita M. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548PubMed Google Scholar). When associated with mitochondria, BAX promotes the cytosolic release of cytochrome c, which in turn, activates caspase-9 and -3 (22Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A.

However, this translocation to the mitochondria remains insufficient to trigger cell death since caffeine induces relocalization of the protein in both p53-null cells, which do not die upon caffeine exposure, and p53-expressing cells, in which caffeine triggers cell death. These results are consistent with the study by Deng and Wu (20Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in mouse embryo fibroblast cells, showing that Peg3/Pw1 protein, which induced BAX translocation from cytosol to mitochondria, did not lead to apoptosis when expressed alone, but greatly enhanced apoptosis induced by BAX overexpression and cooperated with p53 to induce cell death. Two additional events are observed in cells that die upon caffeine treatment; BAX protein is overexpressed, and the protein undergoes conformational changes. In p53-expressing cells, caffeine-induced cell death correlates with exposure of BAX N terminus and cytochrome c release. Exposure of N terminus of BAX and related proteins such as BAK has been shown to be associated with apoptosis in several cell types (30Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Bio. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 31Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundress K. Antonsson B.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This exposure could reflect a conformational change of the proteins that allows a more efficient insertion into mitochondrial membrane to promote the release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c (43Nechuschtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 44Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N.

Caffeine appears to promote BAX translocation, whereas increased expression of the protein may facilitate the conformational change that is required for BAX membrane insertion. The methylxanthine caffeine has been the first reported drug that overrides the G2/M checkpoint. How this abrogation of G2/M cell cycle arrest increases tumor cell sensitivity to ionizing radiations (46Yoa S.L. Akhtar A.J. McKenna K.A. Bedi G.C. Sidransky D. Mabry M. Ravi R. Collector M.I.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) remains poorly understood. Serum deprivation, which induces an accumulation of cells in G0/G1 similar to that observed in caffeine-treated cells, does not induce apoptosis of p53-expressing cells, indicating that caffeine-induced cell death may not be related to G0/G1 accumulation. In addition, caffeine induced apoptosis both in p53-expressing cells that were arrested in G2/M and in cycling BAX-overexpressing cells. Thus, caffeine appears to sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis in a cell cycle-independent manner. Similarly, caffeine-mediated sensitization to ionizing radiations was shown not to depend on the cell cycle effects of the compound (52Ribeiro J.C. Barnetson A.R. Jackson P. Ow K. Links M. Russell P.J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At the concentration used in our study (4 mm), caffeine was shown to inhibit the activity of several related enzymes that include ATM, ATR, and mammalian target to rapamycin kinase (47Sarkaria J.N.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4288-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ATM was shown to modulate p53 activity toward cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis (54Wang S. Guo M. Ouyang H. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. Fuks Z. Ling C.C. Li G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 55Barlow C. Brown K.D. Deng C.X. Tagle D.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We may speculate that caffeine-mediated inhibition of ATM may contribute to induce apoptosis in p53-expressing cells. However, whether inhibition of ATM or related proteins is connected to the observed changes in BAX N terminus expression in p53-expressing cells will require further investigations. Preliminary studies indicate that high concentrations (40 µm) of wortmannin that inhibit ATM (47Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) sensitize H358 cells to apoptosis induced by overexpression of BAX (data not shown). Wortmannin also inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, another enzyme related to ATM. This kinase has been shown to prevent conformational changes in BAX protein in cells detached from their extracellular matrix (39Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, at concentrations that inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (100 nm), wortmannin does not trigger apoptosis in BAX-overexpressing H358 cells (data not shown). In conclusion, we demonstrate that both increased expression of BAX and its translocation to the mitochondria are required to trigger apoptosis in H358 cells. Caffeine relocalizes BAX from the cytosol to the mitochondria. When BAX is overexpressed, e.g. as a consequence of p53 expression, this relocalization is associated with conformational changes of the protein and apoptosis. These results strengthen the interest of caffeine and related molecules as sensitizers in treating human tumors.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For example, YY1 activates or represses the c-fos promoter depending on the orientation of a YY1 recognition element in the promoter (3Natesan S. Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). YY1 switches between an activator or repressor of the human papillomavirus type 18 promoter depending on the integrity of a distinct element upstream in the promoter (4Bauknecht T. Jundt F. Herr I. Oehler T. Delius H. Shi Y. Angel P. Zur Hausen H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YY1 competes with nuclear factor-κB for overlapping binding sites in the serum amyloid A1 promoter, inhibits promoter activity by passive means (5Lu S.Y. Rodriguez M. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can antagonize the interaction of serum response factor to overlapping binding sites in the actin promoter (6Gualberto A. LePage D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). YY1 functionally interacts with a large number of key transcriptional regulators such as Sp1, c-Myc, adenovirus E1A, the cAMP-response element-binding protein-related factor, p300, and components of the general transcriptional apparatus including the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and transcription factor IIB (7Lee J.S.

The capacity of YY1 to bend DNA when it binds the promoter may help facilitate direct contact between regulatory proteins. YY1 can interact with histone deacetylases to repress the activity of certain promoters, including the human immunodeficiency virus, type I long terminal repeat (12Coull J.J. Romerio F. Sun J.-M. Volker J.L. Galvin K.M. Davie J.R. Shi Y. Hansen U. Margolis D.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), thereby modulating histone and chromatin structure. The pathogenesis of common vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after balloon angioplasty is believed to be mediated at least in part by phenotypic changes involving smooth muscle cells of the artery wall. These cells normally adopt a “contractile” phenotype (13Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1985; 42: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) in the vessel wall, but upon activation (such as mechanical injury imparted by angioplasty), these cells become “synthetic” (13Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1985; 42: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and contribute to developing lesions by migrating, proliferating, producing extracellular matrix, and elaborating and responding to myriad growth-regulatory molecules (14Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar, 15Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). YY1 can repress the promoters of a wide spectrum of pro-atherogenic genes, including cytokines, hormones, and growth factors (16Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell.

However, whether YY1 is even expressed in the artery wall or is regulated in the adaptive response to injury is presently not known, nor is it known whether YY1 can influence the growth of smooth muscle cells or other cell types. Primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from Cell Applications, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and cultured in Waymouth's medium, pH 7.4, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 µg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in Waymouth's medium, pH 7.4, containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were not used beyond passage 7 in experiments. Additionally, normal medial vascular smooth muscle cells were derived and characterized from coronary arteries of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and human atherosclerotic plaque vascular smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy specimens of patients with symptomatic carotid disease. Cells were cultured to passage 2–4 before isolation for nuclear extracts. Differential gene expression between injured and uninjured smooth muscle cells was assessed using Atlas cDNA expression arrays (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, total RNA (15 µg) was treated with RNase-free DNase I and then mRNA was isolated using a poly(A) Quik mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNA was generated from equivalent amounts of mRNA, and32P-labeled cDNAs were purified using Chromaspin-200 diethyl pyrocarbonate-water columns provided with the kit. Probes with similar specific activities were hybridized separately to two identical arrays under conditions specified by the manufacturer. Hybridization signals were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was prepared from cells that were injured (22Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) or exposed to FGF-2 with TRIzol in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed using PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the following amplification conditions: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 µm dNTP, 0.5 µm primers, 2 µl of cDNA, and 1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase. For YY1 PCR, cycling conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s; 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. For GAPDH RT-PCR, the same cycling conditions were used except for an annealing temperature of 58 °C and a cycle number of 25. Primer sequences for YY1 were YY1a5 (5′-GAAAACATCTGCACACCCACGGTCC-3′) and YY1a3 (5′-GTCCTCCTGTTGGGACCACAC-3′), whereas those of GAPDH are GAP5 (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′) and GAP3 (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Linearity of gene expression was established by cycle-based RT-PCR in pilot experiments for both YY1 and GAPDH. Lysates of cells injured or exposed to FGF-2 were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 2 h at 100 V. After transfer of proteins to Immobilon P nylon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocking nonspecific binding sites with nonfat skim milk, membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies targeting YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (1:1000) prior to chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Coomassie-stained gels were destained and photographed to confirm equal loading. In FGF-2 antibody preincubation experiments, growth-quiescent smooth muscle cells were incubated with neutralizing rabbit anti-human FGF-2 antibodies or rabbit pre-immune IgG (100 µg/ml) for 1.5 h prior to scraping and assessment of YY1 expression by Western blotting. The FGF-2 antibody (AB-33-NA; R & D Systems) does not cross-react with recombinant human (rh) FGF-4, rhFGF-5, rhFGF-6, rhFGF-7, recombinant murine (rm) FGF-8b, rmFGF-8c, rhFGF-9, rfFGF-10, rmFGF-15, rhFGF-17, or rhFGF-18 and has less than 5% reactivity with FGF-1 (acidic) and rhβ-ECGF, based on direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by the manufacturer (R & D Systems). Nuclear extracts of cells injured (22Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) or exposed to FGF-2 were prepared as described previously (23Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed using 10 µg of nuclear extract in 20 µl containing 1 µg of poly(dI·dC)-poly(dI·dC) (Sigma), 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, and the32P-labeled Oligo MVYY1 (120,000 cpm) or32P-labeled Oligo A for 35 min at 22 °C. In competition or supershift experiments, the indicated molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or 2 µg of anti-peptide antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was included in the binding mixture 10 min prior to addition of the probe. Bound complexes were separated from the unbound probe by non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE running buffer at 100 V. The gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at −80 °C. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (450–550 g) were anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and xylazine (8 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and the left common and external carotid arteries were exposed via a midline neck incision. A 2F Fogarty balloon catheter (Baxter Healthcare) was introduced into the external carotid, advanced into the common carotid, inflated to generate resistance, and withdrawn three times as described previously (24Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). The catheter was withdrawn, and a ligature was applied to the external carotid proximal to the arteriotomy. Animals were sacrificed 4 h after injury by lethal injection of phenobarbitone and perfusion-fixed using 10% (v/v) formaldehyde at 120 mm Hg. The carotids were dissected free, washed with PBS, pH 7.4, placed in OCT (Miles), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections (5 µm) were air-dried, fixed in acetone for 15 min, and then air-dried. The sections were then exposed to 1% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min, rinsed in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with 100 µl of YY1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (diluted 1:100 in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS, pH 7.4) for 45 min. The sections were washed with 0.5% Tween 20/PBS, pH 7.4, followed by PBS, pH 7.4, alone and incubated with 100 µl of biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:300 in 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The sections were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, for 5 min prior to incubation in 100 µl of avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:100 in 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The sections were washed again in Tween and PBS as above, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected in 3 min using the diaminobenzidine system. Sections were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, counterstained with hematoxylin for 20 s, dehydrated, cleared and mounted, and then visualized by light microscopy and photographed. FGF-2 levels in the supernatant were quantitated using the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Quantikine HS human FGF basic immunoassay (R & D Systems). Smooth muscle cells were transiently transfected with 5 µg of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct, (E1)4TK-CAT, using FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FGF-2 was incubated with growth-quiescent cells for 24 h. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was assessed as described previously (23Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and normalized to the concentration of protein in the cell lysates (Bio-Rad protein assay). Smooth muscle cells (rat aortic) or endothelial cells (bovine aortic) were grown to 60% confluence in 96-well plates, incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h, and then transfected with the indicated amounts of either pCB6+-YY1 or pCB6+ using FuGENE6, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and incubated for 3 days in the continuous presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid transfection of endothelial and smooth muscle cells with FuGENE6 is extremely efficient (25Khachigian L.M. Santiago F.S. Rafty L.A. Chan O.L.W. Delbridge G.J. Bobik A. Collins T. Johnson A.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were trypsinized, and suspensions were quantitated by automated Coulter counter. Total RNA was isolated from smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells 24 h after transfection with 10 µg of either pCB6+-YY1 or pCB6+ using FuGENE6 and probed with 32P-labeled YY1 cDNA (generated by PCR using the same primers described above) or [32P]GAPDH cDNA in Northern blot analysis as described previously (22Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar,23Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with antibodies to YY1 (sc-7341, final dilution 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 (DO-1, dilution 1:50; Immunotech), PCNA (PC10, dilution 1:50; Dako), basic FGF (AB-33-NA, dilution 1:200; R & D systems), and smooth muscle α-actin (ASM-1, dilution 1:25; Novocastra) on consecutive paraffin sections of formalin-fixed atherosclerotic carotid artery specimens obtained by endarterectomy at St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia. Prior to staining, deparaffinized sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (peroxidase blocking) and boiled in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, to retrieve antigenicity. The standard avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase technique was used (26Hsu S.-M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13474) Google Scholar). After washing in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, sections were incubated in the primary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (horse anti-mouse, Vector BA-2000 or goat anti-rabbit, Vector BA-1000) for 20 min, and finally with avidin-biotin complex (Elite Vector PK-6100) for 30 min. Immunogenicity was visualized by treatment in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution for 2 min, which produced brown coloration. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. As negative control, the primary antibody was omitted, or the sections were treated with the immunoglobulin fraction of suitable non-immune serum as a substitute for the primary antibody. No positive staining was observed in any of the negative control sections (data not shown). In efforts to identify new genes that are activated following mechanical injury in vascular smooth muscle cells, we reverse-transcribed mRNA isolated from mechanically injured and uninjured growth-quiescent aortic smooth muscle cells and compared the expression of specific genes by hybridization with spatially addressable cDNA arrays. We demonstrated previously that the immediate-early gene and transcription factor early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) is rapidly induced by injury using a well established in vitro scraping model (24Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). YY1 transcript levels, like those of Egr-1, increased severalfold within 1 h of injury (Fig.1A). In contrast, α-tubulin mRNA expression did not change in response to injury. We next performed RT-PCR analysis using primers directed to elements within the coding region to confirm that YY1 mRNA is inducibly expressed following mechanical injury. YY1 was basally expressed in uninjured smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Injury increased YY1 expression within 2 h of injury, and levels remained elevated after 4 h. Western immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies targeting YY1 produced a single protein species with a relative molecular mass of 68 kDa, which corresponds to the expected molecular mass of YY1 (Fig. 1B,lower panel) (21Fang Y. Sheffield L.G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). YY1 protein, like YY1 mRNA (Fig. 1,A and B, upper panel), was basally expressed, and levels were increased upon mechanical injury (Fig.1B, lower panel). To determine whether changes in YY1 mRNA and protein expression after mechanical injury correlate with the binding activity of this transcription factor, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) using 32P-labeled Oligo MVYY1, a double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing consensus binding element for YY1 from the upstream conserved region of the Moloney murine leukemia gene. A major nucleoprotein complex of weak intensity was detected using nuclear extracts of uninjured cells (Fig. 1C,left panel, large arrow). The intensity of this complex increased significantly within 1 h of injury, and levels remained high after 4 h (Fig. 1C, left panel). To confirm the integrity of these extracts, we performed EMSA using 32P-labeled Oligo A, whose sequence derives from the proximal PDGF-A promoter and contains overlapping consensus binding elements for Egr-1. Egr-1 binding activity increased within 1 h of injury (Fig. 1C, right panel), as demonstrated previously in vascular endothelial cells (27Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Day F.L. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and consistent with Fig.1A. To demonstrate the specificity of the nucleoprotein complex obtained using 32P-Oligo MVYY1, we incubated the extracts with increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide. This resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of the inducible complex and virtually complete inhibition at a 25-fold excess (Fig. 1D,arrow). In contrast, the same -fold excess of unlabeled Oligo A had no effect of the intensity of this complex. To elucidate the identity of the protein component of the inducible complex, we performed supershift analysis. Incubation of the nuclear extracts with YY1 antibodies used for Western blot analysis prior to the addition of32P-Oligo MVYY1 eliminated the formation of the complex, instead producing a supershift (Fig. 1E). In contrast, when an identical amount of Egr-1 antibodies was used for preincubation, the complex was completely unaffected. These data provide the first demonstration that YY1 mRNA and protein are increased in vascular smooth muscle cells upon mechanical injury. To determine whether the induction of YY1 by mechanical injury in vitro is also observed following injury to the intact vessel wall, we performed balloon angioplasty to the left common carotid arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats. Immunohistochemical analysis with YY1 antibodies revealed that YY1 is weakly expressed by smooth muscle cells in the medial compartment of the artery wall (Fig.1F, top panel). The intensity of staining increased significantly in the media within 4 h of balloon injury (Fig. 1F, middle panel). The specificity of staining is evident by our inability to observe YY1 signal when primary (YY1) antibody was omitted from the protocol (Fig.1F, bottom panel). These data demonstrate for the first time the induction of YY1 in the injured artery wall. We hypothesized that the activation of YY1 following injury is regulated by endogenous factors released from the cells themselves. We focused on FGF-2, because FGF-2 mRNA and protein are basally expressed in vascular smooth cells in culture, as well as in the intact artery wall (28Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We measured levels of FGF-2 in the supernatant of cultured growth-quiescent smooth muscle cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after scraping. Immunoreactive FGF-2 was barely detectable in the culture medium or supernatant of undisturbed smooth muscle cells (Fig.2A). However, FGF-2 levels increased dramatically within 2 min of injury (Fig. 2A). This led us to explore the possibility that FGF-2 may regulate the expression of YY1, hitherto unreported in any cell type. YY1 mRNA expression increased in vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to FGF-2. RT-PCR analysis revealed that YY1 transcript levels increased within 1 h of exposure to the growth factor and remained elevated even after 24 h (Fig. 2B). Western immunoblot analysis confirmed these findings of inducible YY1 expression at the level of protein (Fig. 2C). To address the spatial distribution of inducible YY1 protein expression we performed in situ immunofluorescence analysis using YY1 antibodies as the primary antibody with secondary antibodies tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate. YY1 immunoreactivity was preferentially detected in the nuclei of a small proportion of smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2D). After 1 or 4 h of exposure to FGF-2, a considerably greater proportion of cell nuclei showed immunofluorescence for YY1 protein. The specificity of the system was confirmed by the inability to detect immunofluorescence when the YY1 antibody was omitted (Fig. 2D). We next used EMSA to demonstrate whether FGF-2-inducible YY1 expression protein produced increased DNA binding activity. FGF-2 increased YY1 DNA binding activity within 1 h, and levels remained elevated after 4 h (Fig. 2E, left panel), similar to our earlier observations using nuclear extracts of cells that had been injured (Fig. 1C, left panel). Unlike the rapid transient induction of Egr-1 after injury (Fig. 1C,right panel), however, Egr-1 binding activity was more sustained in cells exposed to FGF-2 (Fig. 2E, right panel). To demonstrate that YY1 binding activity induced by FGF-2 was functionally significant, we exposed smooth muscle cells transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-based reporter construct (E1)4TK-CAT, which contains four copies of a high affinity YY1 binding site upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (24Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar), to FGF-2. This construct has previously been used to gauge YY1 binding activity in an overexpression setting in fibroblasts (24Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 stimulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter expression within 24 h in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that FGF-2 induces YY1 mRNA and protein expression, DNA-binding activity, and can transactivate gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Because injury causes the rapid release of FGF-2 from smooth muscle cells, and injury and recombinant FGF-2 each stimulate YY1 expression in this cell type, we finally determined whether the inducible expression of YY1 following injury is mediated by the local effect of endogenous FGF-2. We therefore incubated growth-quiescent smooth muscle cells with neutralizing FGF-2 antibodies prior to scraping and then assessed YY1 levels by Western immunoblot analysis. Injury increased YY1 protein levels within 2 h (Fig. 3). Interestingly, levels of the transcription factor were significantly reduced in the lysates of cells preincubated with antibodies to FGF-2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, isotype- and species-matched immunoglobulin has no appreciable effect on injury-inducible YY1 protein expression (Fig.3). These findings demonstrate the paracrine effect of endogenous FGF-2 in the increased expression of YY1 in smooth muscle cells following mechanical injury. Because YY1 can repress the expression of growth factor genes, we determined whether YY1 could influence smooth muscle cell replication. Incubation of sub-confluent growth-quiescent smooth muscle cells in medium containing serum, as expected, stimulated proliferation in this population. Cells transfected with 0.5 or 1 µg of a cytomegalovirus-driven YY1 expression vector, pCB6+-YY1, strongly inhibited proliferation relative to its empty vector (pCB6+) control (Fig.4). We used Northern blot analysis to demonstrate that YY1 was indeed expressed in the smooth muscle cells following pCB6+-YY1 transfection. This showed strong expression of the exogenous YY1 mRNA within 24 h of transfection (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that YY1 is a potent inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. In contrast, proliferation of vascular endothelial cells was not influenced as a consequence of transfection with identical amounts of YY1 (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), thus indicating the cell-specific nature of inhibition by YY1. To date, YY1 has not been directly linked to cell replication in any cell type.Figure 5Overexpression ofYY1mRNA in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells transfected with YY1-pCB6+. Subconfluent growth-quiescent rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) or bovine aortic endothelial cells (EC) in 100-mm plates were transfected with 10 µg of pCB6+-YY1 or pCB6+ using FuGENE6. Northern blot analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from the cells 24 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because FGF-2 positively regulates YY1 expression, we hypothesized that YY1 and FGF-2 would colocalize in the arterial wall. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that YY1 was strongly expressed by α-actin-positive smooth muscle cells in the arterial media compared with weak expression in the intima (Fig.6). YY1 staining in the media was distributed mosaically and was exclusively nuclear. In contrast, p53 was expressed in the intima. FGF-2 immunoreactivity was detected in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of medial smooth muscle cells, consistent with previous observations in fibrous lesions (29Hughes S.E. Crossman D. Hall P.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1214-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Brogi E. Winkles J.A. Underwood R. Clinton S.K. Alberts G.F. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2408-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). FGF-2 immunoreactivity was coincident with YY1 expression (Fig. 6). Finally, we reasoned that because YY1 inhibits smooth muscle cell replication (Fig. 4), YY1 expression in the artery wall would inversely correlate with mitogenicity. PCNA staining was accordingly confined to smooth muscle cells and occasional macrophages in the intima, with few PCNA-expressing cells detected in the media (Fig. 6). The mechanisms governing the activation of the YY1 gene expression are presently unknown. In smooth muscle cells, YY1 has been found to physically associate with (31Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Paracek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and activate the smooth muscle cell-specific SMC22-α promoter (32Jain M. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E.S. Hseih C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but has not yet been reported to be induced by defined extracellular stimuli in this cell type. YY1 repressor activity is induced in cardiac myocytes exposed to interleukin-1 (33Patten M. Wang W. Aminololama-Shakeri S. Burson M. Long C.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1341-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in osteosarcoma cells incubated with vitamin D (11Guo B. Aslam F. van Wijnen A.J. Roberts S.G. Frenkel B. Green M.R. DeLuca H. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The human YY1 promoter sequence cloned from a liver genomic library contains a single transcriptional initiation site located 478 base pairs upstream of the AUG translational start motif (34Yao Y.-L. DuPont B.R. Ghosh S. Fang Y. Leach R.J. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3776-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among several putative nucleotide recognition elements for known transcriptional regulators is a consensus site for cAMP-response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor and three tandem sites for Myb. cAMP-response element-binding protein can mediate transcriptional activation by FGF-2 (35Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Similarly, FGF-2 can stimulate the expression of Myb factors (36Marhamati D.J. Bellas R.E. Arsura M. Kypreos K.E. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2448-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which can potentiate FGF-inducible proliferation (37Turque N. Plaza S. Klemphauer K.-H. Saule S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9778-9781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our present demonstration of increased YY1 expression in smooth muscle cells exposed to FGF-2 may be because of the activity of these positive regulatory transcription factors. The spatial relationship established between FGF-2 and YY1 in lesions in this paper may be representative of other settings. Interestingly, FGF-2 and other members of the FGF family are expressed in the early stages of embryonic development (38Jung J. Zheng M. Goldfarb M. Zaret K.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), consistent with peri-implantation lethality in mice deficient in YY1 gene (39Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We observed approximately a 3-fold increase in YY1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as DNA binding and transcriptional activity with FGF-2. This magnitude induction may be sufficient to influence gene expression at local sites of FGF-2 release in the vasculature. Indeed, as little as a 2-fold induction in endogenous YY1 expression can lead to significant transcriptional repression in cardiac myocytes, which is entirely dependent on the integrity of the zinc finger structure of YY1 (33Patten M. Wang W. Aminololama-Shakeri S. Burson M. Long C.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1341-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In other contexts, minor changes in DNA binding activity can have profound effects on the transcriptional activity of dependent genes (40Hahn C.N. Kerry D.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that local FGF-2 release can facilitate both positive and negative influences at the level of transcription. We demonstrated previously that FGF-2 induces the expression of Egr-1, which activates the expression of many genes implicated in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis (22Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells, the induction of Egr-1 after injury is blocked by antibodies targeting FGF-2 (27Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Day F.L. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, FGF-2 can stimulate the expression of two very different kinds of transcription factors, namely YY1 (the repressor) and Egr-1 (the activator) in the context of smooth muscle cell injury. It is the complex interplay of transcription factors at promoter elements that dictate gene expression and changes in cell movement, proliferation, and adhesion in the injured vessel wall. We demonstrate here for the first time that YY1 expression and DNA binding activity increase in vascular smooth muscle cells within hours of mechanical injury. We have also shown that FGF-2 is a positive regulator of YY1 expression and moreover that endogenous FGF-2 accounts for the induction of YY1 after injury. The present study demonstrates the yin yang nature of YY1. On the one hand, YY1 expression is under the direct control of FGF-2, which stimulates smooth muscle cell growth. On the other hand, YY1 can inhibit smooth muscle cell growth. That YY1 and FGF-2 are coexpressed in growth-quiescent smooth muscle cells in human arteries suggests that YY1 may restrict pro-atherogenic gene expression and cell growth in the injured vessel wall. Because the adaptive response to arterial cell injury involves a dramatic increase in smooth muscle cell replication, the sustained activation of this enigmatic transcription factor may help restrict what otherwise may result in greater smooth muscle cell mitogenesis in early atherogenesis. Moreover, that YY1 inhibits the growth of smooth muscle cells without influencing endothelial cell proliferation suggests that strategies forcing the expression of exogenous YY1 in the injured vessel wall could be useful to inhibit intimal thickening without affecting re-endothelialization and the re-establishment of a non-thrombogenic surface.

https://openalex.org/W2165501777,"Neelaredoxin is a mononuclear iron protein widespread among prokaryotic anaerobes and facultative aerobes, including human pathogens. It has superoxide scavenging activity, but the exact mechanism by which this process occurs has been controversial. In this report, we present the study of the reaction of superoxide with the reduced form of neelaredoxin from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus by pulse radiolysis. This protein reduces superoxide very efficiently (k = 1.5 × 109m−1s−1), and the dismutation activity is rate-limited, in steady-state conditions, by the much slower superoxide oxidation step. These data show unambiguously that the superfamily of neelaredoxin-like proteins (including desulfoferrodoxin) presents a novel type of reactivity toward superoxide, a result of particular relevance for the understanding of both oxygen stress response mechanisms and, in particular, how pathogens may respond to the oxidative burst produced by the defense cells in eukaryotes. The actual in vivo functioning of these enzymes will depend strongly on the cell redox status. Further insight on the catalytic mechanism was obtained by the detection of a transient intermediate ferric species upon oxidation of neelaredoxin by superoxide, detectable by visible spectroscopy with an absorption maximum at 610 nm, blue-shifted ∼50 nm from the absorption of the resting ferric state.

The role of the iron sixth ligand, glutamate-12, in the reactivity of neelaredoxin toward superoxide was assessed by studying two site-directed mutants: E12Q and E12V. superoxide dismutase neelaredoxin desulfoferrodoxin superoxide reductase The scavenging of superoxide (O⨪2) by living cells is generally performed by superoxide dismutases (SODs)1 of the Mn, Fe, CuZn, or Ni types. However, both biochemical data and the analysis of the entire genomes now available show that numerous prokaryotes do not contain any of those canonical SODs. Instead, they contain genes encoding for members of a novel family of O⨪2 scavengers (1Pianzzola M.J. Soubes M. Touati D. J.

These proteins share an unusual iron center, Fe(His4Cys) (6Moura I. Tavares P. Moura J.J.G. Ravi N. Huynh B.H. Liu M.Y. Le Gall J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), responsible for their reactivity with O⨪2. The Nlr fromArchaeoglobus fulgidus exhibits an apparent bifunctional activity toward O⨪2: a superoxide reductase activity, using a flavoprotein (an NADH:Nlr oxidoreductase) as its electron donor, and a superoxide dismutase activity. The latter characteristic can be used by the organism to detoxify O⨪2 independently of the cell redox status (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This novel family of O⨪2 scavengers is of utmost relevance because it is present in almost all anaerobes for which the complete genome sequence is known, as well as in several facultative aerobes, including human pathogens such as Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis (10Jovanoviè T. Ascenso C. Hazlett K.R.O. Sikkink R. Krebs C. Litwiller R. Benson L.M. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Radolf J.D. Huynh B.H. Naylos S. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28439-28448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In many of these prokaryotes, these are the only types of O⨪2 scavengers present, i.e. the canonical SODs are absent. This observation is most important due to the relevance of O⨪2scavenging as a defense mechanism not only of living cells, in general, but also, in particular, in the response of pathogens to the oxidative burst produced by the host defense cells. To understand this process at the molecular level, it is essential to start by unraveling the catalytic mechanism of these novel enzymes. Toward this goal, the reactivity of reduced Nlr from A. fulgidus with O⨪2 was studied by pulse radiolysis. The active centers in both Dfx and Nlr are very similar, but they behave in some strikingly different fashions. Dfx is isolated with the O⨪2 active iron as Fe2+, whereas Nlr is isolated mainly in the Fe3+ form. In addition, they appear to have different reactivities toward O⨪2 because Dfx is a superoxide reductase (SOR), and A. fulgidus Nlr is a bifunctional enzyme (both a dismutase and a reductase for O⨪2). Recently, a mechanism for the reduction of O⨪2 by Dfx was proposed (11Coulter E.D. Emerson J.P. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cabelli D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11555-11556Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which, together with this study, makes it possible to compare the reactivity of both enzymes toward O⨪2, an essential step for understanding the overall catalytic mechanism of these new types of O⨪2scavengers. In particular, Nlr offers the advantage over Dfx of having a single iron center, allowing probing of the intrinsic reactivity of only that center, without any possible interference from the other center present in Dfx. The three-dimensional structure of Pyrococcus furiosus Nlr (8Yeh A.P. Hu Y. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) suggests that the iron coordination changes with the protein redox state. In the oxidized form, the iron center has an octahedral geometry, with four planar histidine ligands and one cysteine and a glutamate as axial ligands. In the reduced form, the glutamate is not bound to the iron, which becomes five coordinated in a square pyramidal geometry. This coordination is similar to that of center II in Dfx (7Coelho A.V. Matias P. Fülöp V. Thompson A. Gonzalez A. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 680-689Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The binding of the sixth ligand (E14, in P. furiosus) to the oxidized form was suggested to limit access of the O⨪2 to this redox state of the metal (8Yeh A.P. Hu Y. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, Nlr from A. fulgidusshows superoxide dismutase activity (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and this reactivity implies access of O⨪2 to both the reduced and oxidized forms of the iron. It is possible that the glutamate is somehow controlling the reactivity of Nlr, but it can also be argued that the oxidation of O⨪2 can be accomplished by an outer sphere electron transfer.A. fulgidus Nlr has a glutamate residue (E12) in an equivalent position to the E14 from P. furiosus Nlr. Moreover, this is a conserved residue in all known Nlrs and Dfxs (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional role for this residue. To assess the role of the glutamate, a sixth ligand of the ferric state of the iron center, two mutants were also analyzed in which this residue was substituted by either a valine (E12V) or a glutamine (E12Q). A pT7-7 plasmid containing the Nlr gene (pT7AfNlr) (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used as a template in a site-directed mutagenesis assay to create an E12V and an E12Q mutation in Nlr (plasmids pT7AfNlrE12V and pT7AfNlrE12Q), using the QuikChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The generated nicked vector DNA incorporating the desired mutations was then repaired by transformation in E. coli XL-2 Blue (Stratagene). After plasmid isolation, the plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any unwanted one. Samples were prepared using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions and run in an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencer. For the expression experiments, plasmids pT7AfNlr, pT7AfNlrE12V, and pT7AfNlrE12Q were introduced in E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene). Recombinant E. coli cells were aerobically grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml−1 ampicillin in a 3L fermentor. When the culture reached a cell density of A600 = 0.5, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and after 9 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The cells were broken in a French Press at 9000 p.s.i. The broken cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g to separate the cell debris, thus obtaining the crude extract. The crude extract was ultracentrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant (soluble extract) was decanted. The supernatant was heated at 80 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. This treatment does not affect Nlr integrity or activity (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The effects on Nlr mutants were tested, and the same results were obtained (this work; data not shown). The heat-treated soluble extracts were purified in a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl and eluted with a 0–0.5m NaCl linear gradient in the same buffer. The fraction containing Nlr was then loaded in a HTP-ceramic column equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer and eluted with a 0–0.5 m potassium phosphate linear gradient. All purification steps were performed at pH 7.1 and 4 °C. The purity of the resulting Nlr was tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) was used to determine protein concentration (13Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Total iron content was determined by the 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine method as described previously (14Fisher D.S. Price D.C. Clin. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Pye-Unicam atomic absorption instrument. Zinc content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Measurements were made in triplicate with an experimental error of <5%. Iron and zinc content was determined for all proteins. Throughout the text, the recombinant protein will be designated wild type Nlr, and the mutant proteins will be called NlrE12V and NlrE12Q. All activities are reported in relation to the iron content because zinc is not reactive with O⨪2. All kinetic data obtained are consistently proportional to the iron content of the samples, thus showing that there is no effect due to the presence of zinc. Moreover, the data now obtained are fully consistent with our previous preliminary kinetic study with fully iron-loaded enzyme (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Room temperature UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1603 spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESP 380 spectrometer equipped with a continuous flow Oxford Instruments helium cryostat. Redox titrations were performed under aerobic conditions and monitored by visible spectroscopy (400–820 nm), using a protein concentration sufficient to have a 660 nm band with at least 0.2 of absorbance. Nlr has a tendency to become re-reduced under anaerobic conditions, leading to redox titrations with a bad equilibrium. For this reason, we repeated all titrations under aerobic conditions, and as compared with our previously determined values (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this does not affect the determination of the redox potential. The reaction mixture also contains a 2 µm final concentration of the following mediators:N-N-dimethyl-p-phenyldiamine (+340 mV), 1,2-naphtoquinone-4-sulfonic acid (+215 mV), 1,2-naphtoquinone (+180 mV), phenazine methosulfate (+80 mV), and 1,4-napthoquinone (+60 mV). The protein was mixed with the mediators and left under an argon atmosphere until fully reduced. The redox titration was then performed using potassium persulfate as oxidant. The redox potential measurements were done with a combined silver/silver chloride electrode calibrated with a quinhydrone-saturated solution at pH 7.0. The redox potentials are quoted against the standard hydrogen electrode. SOD activity was tested on nitro blue tetrazolium-stained gels, as described in Ref. 15McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The Nlr SOD activity was quantified by the standard xanthine/xanthine oxidase method, where 1 activity unit is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to inhibit 50% of the reduction of cytochrome c by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system (15McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out using the 2 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator as described previously (16Rush J.D. Bielski B.H.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1985; 89: 5062-5066Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Dosimetry was measured using the (SCN)2− dosimeter (16Rush J.D. Bielski B.H.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1985; 89: 5062-5066Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The radiolysis of water, either by electrons or γ-rays, yields the species described in Reaction 1, where the numbers in parentheses are G values, that is the number of molecules/100 eV of energy absorbed by the medium (17Schwarz H.A. J. Chem. Ed. 1981; 58: 101-105Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The species can be converted to secondary radicals, depending on the presence of adequate scavengers. In aerated solutions containing formate (HCO⨪2), primary radicals are converted to O⨪2by Reactions 2–R4 (18Buxton G.V. Greenstock C.L. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref.

EDTA and sodium formate were of the highest purity commercially available and were used as purchased. Reduced enzyme was obtained by the addition of stoichiometric quantities of ascorbate to a solution of Nlr. An additional method for preparation of reduced enzyme involved using a 1800 Curie60Co γ-ray source. The solution of Nlr was prepared in a N2O atmosphere and in the presence of formate as ·OH scavenger, as described in Reactions 5 and 6. Stoichiometric amounts of CO⨪2 radicals were generated at a rate of ∼1 µmol/s. The very high identity between the sequences of A. fulgidus and P. furiosus Nlr (67% sequence identity) is an indication that the structural model of A. fulgidusNlr obtained on the basis of the structure of the protein from P. furiosus will be close to the real structure. It is considered (19Sali A. Kuriyan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: M20-M24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Sánchez R. Pieper U. Melo F. Eswar N. Martı́-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Mirkovic N. Sali A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7, (Suppl.): 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) that, for sequence identities above 60%, the modeled structure may be as good as a medium resolution NMR structure or a low resolution x-ray structure. For highly conserved zones, such as the metal site of Nlr, this quality can be even higher. The program Modeller version 4 (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) was used to derive the tetramer models for the oxidized and reduced forms of A. fulgidus Nlr from the corresponding structures of P. furiosus Nlr (8Yeh A.P. Hu Y. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank codes 1DQI and 1DQK). The initial sequence alignment was optimized to yield structural models with correct conformational characteristics; these were checked using PROCHECK (22Laskowski A. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thorton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Using the final optimized alignment, 40 structures were generated by Modeller (for the oxidized and reduced states). The structure with the lowest value of the objective function was chosen. In the case of the oxidized structure model, the zone of K10 (W9-K10-K11) was optimized further (loop modeling in Modeller) in the framework of the rest of the structure to generate a conformation outside of the main chain forbidden zones. The final models of the oxidized and reduced states had 90% and 89% of the residues, respectively, in most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. None had residues in disallowed regions. The mutant structures were obtained using the wild type structures and by mutation of the E12 residue using Sybyl 6.2 from TRIPOS. The resulting structures were minimized by considering residues 11–12-13 as flexible and considering the rest of the protein as rigid. The potential sixth ligand for Nlr iron center (E12) was mutated to a glutamine (E12Q) and to a valine (E12V) by site-directed mutagenesis. Overexpression inE. coli produced stable proteins that were purified with comparable yields in the case of wild type Nlr and NlrE12Q (27 and 29 mg/liter−1, respectively). The yield of NlrE12V was approximately one-third smaller (18 mg/liter−1). The protein purity was confirmed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) (Fig.1A). On a native gel electrophoresis, the proteins show a single band that corresponds to the SOD activity band obtained for nitro blue tetrazolium-stained gels (Fig. 1B). The proteins contain ∼0.45 iron atom/monomer and roughly an equivalent amount of zinc. The rate data are reported in relation to the iron content. Both mutants are as stable as the wild type protein. The wild type Nlr has a characteristic UV-visible spectrum in the ferric state (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Chen L. Sharma P. LeGall J. Mariano A.M. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with a broad band at ∼660 nm that gives the enzyme its blue color in solution, and a shoulder at ∼325 nm (Fig.2, trace a). The mutants show similar spectra, with a blue-shift of the 660 nm band to 617 nm in the case of NlrE12V and 620 nm in the case of NlrE12Q (Fig. 2, traces b and c). The EPR spectra of the proteins do not show any differences between the mutants and the wild type Nlr (data not shown). Redox titrations monitored by visible spectroscopy were performed at pH 7.0, following the increase in absorbance at 660 nm in the wild-type enzyme and at 620 nm in the mutant enzymes. The data were adjusted to a Nernst equation (n = 1) with a reduction potential of +250 mV (Fig. 3, a) for the wild-type enzyme, +298 mV for NlrE12Q (Fig. 3, b), and +302 mV for NlrE12V (Fig. 3, c). This increase in reduction potential is in agreement with the removal of an anionic ligand, the glutamate, that stabilizes the ferric state. The structure of theP. furiosus protein suggests that Nlr is a tetramer with four iron centers (one iron center/monomer). Although equal, these centers can in theory feel the influence of each other and, as a consequence, produce a perturbation in the their redox behavior. However, given the large distances between the centers (about 25 Å) and their high solvent exposure, direct electrostatic influences will be small (due to their fast decay with distance in solvent environments), and therefore the mutual influence in microscopic redox potentials will be very reduced. The result is that all four iron centers are equivalent, and when being titrated, the experimental values can be fitted to a single Nernst equation. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay shows a 47% and 29% increase in the activities of the NlrE12V and NlrE12Q, respectively, relative to the activity of the wild type enzyme (TableI). This increase suggests a role for the glutamate residue in the regulation of SOD activity in Nlr.Table IRate constants for the SOD activity determined with the xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay and for the reduction and oxidation steps, determined by pulse radiolysis of Nlr and neelaredoxin mutants (NlrE12Q and NlrE12V)SampleSOD activityReduction with CO⨪2Oxidation with O⨪2k(Nlr-Fe3+ + CO⨪2 → Nlr-Fe2+)k1(Nlr-Fe2+ + O⨪2 → T1)k2(T1 → Nlr-Fe3+)(units/mg−1)(×108/m−1s−1)(×109/m−1s−1)(×104/s−1)Nlr78 ± 85.9 ± 0.71.5 ± 0.5NlrE12Q101 ± 134.0 ± 1.81.5 ± 0.3∼2NlrE12V115 ± 281.9 ± 0.50.4 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out under conditions in which the primary radicals are mainly converted to CO⨪2(Reactions 5 and 6), leading to the reduction of Nlr's iron center. The disappearance of the Fe3+ band was followed at a range of wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm on the microsecond time scale, and a difference spectrum was generated. The extinction coefficients were calculated assuming that 100% of the CO⨪2 reacts to reduce Nlr-Fe3+ to Nlr-Fe2+; CO⨪2 is known not to absorb in this spectral region. The experimental data were fitted to a simple first-order kinetic process (Fig.4B). Using 10–300 µm Fe3+-protein and generating 1–2 µm CO⨪2 by pulse radiolysis, the wild type and the mutant enzymes react with CO⨪2 at ∼108m−1 s−1, although NlrE12V has a slightly slower reactivity when compared with the other proteins (TableI). The wild type Nlr has a difference spectrum with a maximum at ∼660 nm (Fig. 4), and the mutant proteins have spectra with maxima at ∼620 nm, as expected from the respective absorption spectra (Fig.2). The proteins were reduced to 99% using the steady-state generation of CO⨪2 in a 60Co source, with formate as a OH· scavenger and N2O as the electron scavenger. The reduced samples were then saturated with O2 and pulsed to generate O⨪2. The re-oxidation of Fe2+ in the proteins by O⨪2 is not a simple process (Fig. 4A). The change in absorbance with time was fitted to two first-order processes, where the initial process occurred at a rate that was proportional to the initial Fe2+ concentration, and the subsequent process occurred at a rate that was independent of both O⨪2 and Nlr concentration. This indicates the existence of a transient intermediate. The calculated rate constants for both processes in the wild type enzyme and mutants are presented in Table I. The observed absorption changes are consistent with a mechanism where O⨪2 → intermediate → final species; thus, spectra of the intermediate and final species can be calculated for the three proteins. The intermediate species detected for both the wild type Nlr (Fig. 5) and NlrE12Q have spectra with absorption maxima at ∼610 nm and show an increase in extinction coefficient. The spectrum of the intermediate is not so well defined in NlrE12V, but the kinetic evidence for its presence comes from studies of the re-oxidation process in which the kinetic traces can only be fitted by two consecutive first-order processes. The final species in all three proteins have spectra similar to that of the ferric state in the corresponding protein. Experiments analogous to those described above were carried out on solutions in which the proteins were initially reduced by a 2:1 concentration of ascorbate. The results obtained were identical using both ascorbate and CO⨪2 as reductants. The rates for the reduction by CO⨪2 and re-oxidation by O⨪2 of the Fe center were measured using several concentrations of protein. In Fig. 6, the observed rates are plotted as a function of iron concentration. The rates for reduction of the oxidized iron by CO⨪2 and the initial reaction in the oxidation of the reduced iron by O⨪2 are directly proportional to the iron concentration, as would be expected (vox = kox × [Fe3+] × [CO⨪2] andvred1 = kred1 × [Fe2+] × [O⨪2], respectively). These measurements confirm that NlrE12Q has a behavior similar to the wild type enzyme, whereas NlrE12V shows a slower rate for both processes. The rate constant for the disappearance of the intermediate is, as expected, independent of the iron concentration (vred2 = kred2 × [T1]) (data not shown). Neelaredoxin and desulfoferrodoxin belong to a family of proteins with the capacity of eliminating O⨪2. Their role is particularly important in anaerobes because they are present in all the known genomes from these organisms that lack canonical SODs. Their physiological relevance in the scavenging of O⨪2 is confirmed with the demonstration of their capacity to complement E. coli sodA−sodB− (1Pianzzola M.J. Soubes M. Touati D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Silva G. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Rodrigues-Pousada C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Having a single iron center, Nlr allows probing of the intrinsic reactivity of only that center, without any possible interference from the Fe(Cys4) center present in Dfx. In this sense, it is possible to study the oxidation and reduction of O⨪2 together or as independent reactions. The kinetic study of the SOR activity of A. fulgidus Nlr reported here shows the existence of a transient species during the reduction of O⨪2 by Nlr-Fe2+, leading us to propose the following general mechanism for the reactivity of Nlr with O⨪2. O⨪2+2H++Nlr­Fe2+→k1T→k2Nlr­Fe3++H2O2Equation 7 O⨪2+Nlr­Fe3+→k3Nlr­Fe2++O2Equation 8 –>In the presence of NADH and a NADH:Nlr oxidoreductase to reduce Nlr, the enzyme can eliminate O⨪2 through Reaction 7, acting as a SOR. This will be very effective if a transient concentration of O⨪2 is present in the cell upon oxidative stress. However, if the oxygen stress continues, the NAD+:NADH ratio will rapidly increase (25Wimpenny J.W.T. Firth A. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 111: 24-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Nlr will be oxidized by O⨪2. This oxidation, however, will not be complete because the enzyme will continue eliminating O⨪2 by acting as a SOD (Reactions 7 and 8), albeit with a reduced rate constant (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nlr may not be the only bifunctional enzyme in its reactivity toward O⨪2 because it was suggested that even canonical CuZn-SODs may act as SORs (26Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38482-38485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, the reduction of O⨪2 by the SORs (Dfxs) fromDesulfoarculus baarsii and Desulfovibrio vulgaris was studied (11Coulter E.D. Emerson J.P. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cabelli D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11555-11556Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Lombard M. Houee-Levin C. Touati D. Fontecave M. Nivière V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5032-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and in both cases, the oxidation of the Fe(Cys,His4) center by O⨪2proceeded via formation of intermediate transient(s). We detect an analogous transient here, suggesting that oxidation of the iron center by O⨪2 is independent of the presence of the Fe(Cys4) center in the SORs. Both the spectroscopic and kinetic data are unequivocal in establishing the presence of an intermediate, showing a transient species with a blue-shifted visible absorption and a dependence of the rate constants on the reactant concentrations that establishes the presence of an at least two-step reaction following re-oxidation of Nlr by O⨪2. The nature of the transient species for the reduction of O⨪2 remains to be established. Its electronic properties (the absorbance band at 610 nm) indicate that the iron is in the ferric form and are similar to the oxidized state of the NlrE12 mutants (band at ∼620 nm). The intermediate has been proposed to be a (hydro)peroxide-bound ferric iron (11Coulter E.D. Emerson J.P. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cabelli D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11555-11556Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although apparently sharing a common intermediate species during the reduction of O⨪2, Nlrs and Dfxs still exhibit important differences, namely, the rate constants for the various steps and the resting oxidation state of the enzyme when isolated in vitro. The initial reduction of O⨪2 by the reduced enzyme (k1 in Reaction 7) is, in all cases, ∼109m−1 s−1, but the rate of disappearance of the transient formed in that reaction (k2 in Reaction 7) is 3 orders of magnitude higher for Nlr than forD. vulgaris Dfx (2 × 104 s−1and 40 s−1 (11Coulter E.D. Emerson J.P. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cabelli D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11555-11556Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), respectively). Recently, a second intermediate, which is apparently not present in Nlr or D. vulgaris Dfx, was reported for D. baarsii Dfx (27Lombard M. Houee-Levin C. Touati D. Fontecave M. Nivière V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5032-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this protein, the first intermediate disappears at a rate of 500 s−1, and the second intermediate disappears at a rate of 25 s−1. Another significant difference between the mechanisms of Nlr and Dfx is in the O⨪2 oxidation step. No SOD activity can be detected in pulse radiolysis studies of Dfx (11Coulter E.D. Emerson J.P. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cabelli D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11555-11556Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar): when a considerable percentage of the Dfx Fe(Cys,His4) center is reduced, only a stoichiometric reaction with O⨪2 is observed, which disappears upon its oxidation (11Coulter E.D. Emerson J.P. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Cabelli D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11555-11556Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and no SOD activity is observed under catalytic conditions (where [Dfx] < [O⨪2]). Under the same conditions with Nlr, depending on the amount of reduced Fe(Cys,His4) center, an initial fast reaction with O⨪2 is observed. However, after the oxidation of the stoichiometric amount of reduced enzyme, there is a consistent rate constant of reaction with O⨪2 that is the SOD activity of the enzyme (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Under catalytic conditions, this rate is limited by that for the oxidation of O⨪2 to O2. The data now gathered also show that the Dfx Fe(Cys4) center has no effect on the O⨪2 reduction step, although by keeping the Fe(Cys,His4) center reduced, it may have a role in promoting the O⨪2 reduction reaction and thus eliminating the need for the O⨪2 oxidation step. The mutated Nlrs were designed to assess the influence of the binding of a sixth ligand (glutamate) to the iron, the influence of its negative charge, and the formation of H-bonds by the glutamate. Thus, this residue was replaced by glutamine, a neutral amino acid with the capacity of forming H-bonds, and a valine, with neither capacity to form H-bonds nor capacity to act as a sixth ligand. The UV-visible spectra of the mutated proteins show an equal blue-shift in the 660 nm band to ∼620 nm, indicating that glutamate was replaced by a weaker ligand, possibly a water molecule. With regard to the O⨪2reduction step, the formation of the transient species and rate constants are similar for the wild type and NlrE12Q, but in the reduced form, NlrE12V reacts slower with O⨪2 (Table I). In contrast, the SOD activity of the mutants increases (Table I). These results point to a role of the glutamate in the reaction mechanism of Nlr, as recently proposed (8Yeh A.P. Hu Y. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and can be discussed by analyzing the redox potentials of the proteins, their electrostatic characteristics, and the role of the H-bonds in determining the conformation of the active site groove in the reduced state. The increase in the reduction potential of the mutants may explain, in part, the higher activity of the O⨪2 oxidation step. Also, because valine is not a ligand to the iron, the sixth position will be empty or occupied by a water molecule. Displacement of this weaker ligand will be easier than that of the glutamate ligand. The movement of the glutamate is essential to maintain the positive electrostatic potential at the iron center in both the oxidized (Fig. 7, II) and reduced (Fig. 7, VII) protein. The reduction of the iron without the conformational change induced by the unbinding of the glutamate gives a species (Fig. 7, III) with almost no positive electrostatic potential to direct the O⨪2 to the center. Species VIII, obtained by modeling a Fe3+ center in the reduced form of the protein, is also less favorable to direct O⨪2 to the iron than the oxidized protein, due to the dipole created by the glutamate side-chain. In the oxidized state, both mutants (Fig. 7, IV and V) have a more positive electrostatic surface around the iron because an anionic amino acid is substituted by neutral ones, which also contributes to the higher SOD activity of the mutants. The differences observed in the SOR activities may be explained by considering a differential conformation of the reduced state: the open conformation of the reduced center is fixed in both the wild type and E12Q proteins by H-bonds established by the sixth ligand with the H14, but this is not possible when glutamate is substituted by valine (Fig.8). This would explain the decrease in the SOR activity for only the E12V mutant and not for E12Q. In this sense, the role of a sixth ligand with this capacity is important because it assures the accessibility of the O⨪2 to the reduced iron center (Fig. 9).Figure 9Catalytic cycle of superoxide reduction to hydrogen peroxide by neelaredoxin. In the oxidized form of the protein (I), the glutamate (E12) is acting as a sixth ligand to the center, limiting the accessibility of superoxide to the iron. In these conditions, the oxidized center reacts slowly with superoxide, and this rate can be increased if the glutamate is substituted for a residue with less capability or no capability to bind the iron (NlrE12Q and NlrE12V, respectively). Upon reduction (II), the glutamate unbinds and establishes H-bonds to H14, determining the conformation of the active site groove. Superoxide can now react with the reduced iron in a rate diffusion-controlled manner because the center is exposed to the solvent. This rate is decreased if the glutamate is substituted for a residue without the capability of forming H-bonds (NlrE12V) because the right conformation of the reduced form of the center is not accomplished, but it is not affected when glutamate is substituted for a glutamine. The reduction of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide follows through the formation of a transient species (T1), and the center becomes oxidized (I). The reduction of the iron center in vivowill be done through a Nlr:NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (9Abreu I.A. Saraiva L.M. Carita J. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Cabelli D. Teixeira M. Mol.

Since the heme in CooA plays an important role for sensing its effector and for regulating its activity, spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies have been done to elucidate the coordination structure of the heme in CooA. The crystal structure of ferrous CooA has recently been reported, which shows that the N-terminal Pro2 and His77 are the axial ligands of the ferrous heme in CooA and that the Pro2 of one subunit provides one ligand to the heme of the other subunit in the CooA homodimer (12Lanzilotta W.N.

The release of Pro2 from the heme iron upon the CO binding triggers the activation of CooA by CO and will cause a conformational change of CooA.

These results indicate a unique characteristic for the coordination structure of the heme in CooA that the ligand switching takes place between Cys75 and His77 during the change in the oxidation state of the heme iron (10Aono S.

The redox-controlled ligand exchange between Cys75 and His77 causes a hysteresis in electrochemical redox titration in which the apparent reduction and oxidation potentials are −320 mV and −260 mV, respectively (16Nakajima H.

Lett. 1999; : 1233-1234Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of the ligand exchange between Cys75 and His77 is not clear yet, it would be responsible for the regulation of the reduction and oxidation potentials of the heme in CooA (16Nakajima H.

Reduction and oxidation of the heme in CooA is thought to be responsible for the activation and deactivation of CooA, respectively. Because only the CO-bound CooA is active as a transcriptional activator, CO must be dissociated from the heme for the deactivation of CooA. In vitro, CO is easily dissociated from the heme by oxidation of the CO-bound heme (14Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results suggest that oxidation of CO-bound CooA is responsible for the deactivation of CooAin vivo. Once the heme is oxidized, it must be reduced before reactivation by CO because CO can bind only to the ferrous heme. Reduction and oxidation potentials of the heme in CooA will be tuned to the appropriate values for an efficient proceeding of the redox reactions. Roberts and co-workers have reported that CooA goes through redox change in vivo and that M124R CooA is active in both ferric and CO-bound forms while WT1 CooA is active only in the CO-bound form (22Thorsteinsson M.V.

These results also show that the redox change in the heme is responsible for the regulation of CooA activity. Electrochemical redox titrations of CooA have suggested the formation of the reaction intermediates in the ligand exchange, the ferrous heme with the Cys75/Pro2 coordination, and the ferric heme with the His77/Pro2 coordination for the intermediates in reduction and oxidation of CooA, respectively (16Nakajima H.

Although the observation of these intermediates was tried by means of stopped flow method, it was unsuccessful probably because the reaction had been completed within an instrumental dead time. Here, we applied pulse radiolysis to study the kinetics and reaction intermediates for the ligand exchange reaction of CooA. Hydrated electron (eaq−) generated by pulse radiolysis is a powerful reducing agent and reduces rapidly the ferric heme of various heme proteins (23Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Arch. Biochem.

The concentration of hydrated electrons generated by a pulse in the sample solution was about 1 μm under these conditions.

Samples for pulse radiolysis were prepared as follows. The concentrated sample was diluted with water by 2- to 3-fold. The concentration of CooA was adjusted to attain an efficient and rapid reaction between the hydrated electrons and CooA.

The cell-free crude extract was prepared by sonication to measure in vivo CooA activity, which was determined by the activity of β-galactosidase, the reporter gene product (9Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The in vivo CooA activity with CO was 17.0 and 15.7 units/mg protein in the presence and absence of 0.1mtert-butylalcohol, respectively. These results show that 0.1 mtert-butylalcohol does not affect in vivo CooA activity. Adding 0.1 mtert-butylalcohol did not affect the optical absorption spectra of CooA. Optical absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-3500 spectrophotometer. In this work, the reduction of ferric CooA was carried out by pulse radiolysis, and then the spectral change in the Soret region and the absorbance change at a fixed wavelength were observed in a time-dependent manner. eaq− generated by pulse radiolysis were able to directly react with the heme in CooA within 1 μs. Fig. 1Ashows the kinetic difference spectra in the Soret region at 10 μs, 50 μs, 500 μs, and 10 ms after pulse radiolysis of ferric WT CooA. The kinetic difference spectrum at 10 μs, at which no measurable eaq− remained, showed an absorption maximum at 440 nm and a minimum at 420 nm. The time constants for the faster phase were 40 and 44 μs in the case of WT and H77G CooA, respectively, as described below. These results show that about 20% of the absorbance changes already occurred during the initial 10 μs. The intensity of the absorption at 440 and 420 nm decreased and increased with time, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1A. At 10 ms after pulse radiolysis, another transient absorption spectrum with a positive and negative absorption maxima at 420 nm and 445/450 nm, respectively, was observed. The difference spectrum observed at 10 ms after pulse radiolysis was similar to the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum for WT CooA (Fig.2A), suggesting that the reduction of ferric CooA by pulse radiolysis gave ferrous CooA identical to that produced by chemical reduction with sodium dithionite. The concentration of the reduced heme formed by pulse radiolysis was estimated to be 0.8 μm for WT CooA.Figure 2The reduced minus oxidized difference spectra of WT CooA (A) and H77G CooA (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of H77G CooA in which His77 is replaced by Gly, similar transient absorption spectra were obtained after pulse radiolysis, as shown in Fig. 1B. A transient absorption spectrum with a positive peak at 440 nm was observed initially, and then the absorbance at 440 nm decreased in intensity with time. The spectrum observed at 5 ms after pulse radiolysis was similar to the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum for H77G CooA (Fig. 2B), as was the case for WT CooA. The concentration of the reduced heme formed by pulse radiolysis was estimated to be 1.0 μm for H77G CooA. Each data points with different wavelength in Fig. 1 were obtained by separate measurements. The concentration of hydrated electrons formed in the sample solution varies slightly between pulses due to the fluctuations of the pulse energy. This may be a reason why the kinetic difference spectra in Fig. 1 do not match perfectly with the static difference spectra. For both WT and H77G CooA, the first intermediate (intermediate1) was initially formed by reduction of the heme iron with eaq−. The most characteristic feature of the intermediate 1 is the absorption maximum at ∼440 nm in the Soret region. The Soret peak at 440 nm suggests the formation of a six-coordinate ferrous heme with a thiolate axial ligand. A six-coordinate ferrous heme with a thiolate axial ligand such as cystathionine β-synthase, for example, has been reported to show the Soret peak at ∼450 nm (32Hasegawa T. Sadano H. Omura T. J.

WT and H77G CooA have a six-coordinate heme with a thiolate derived from Cys75 and a nitrogen atom from Pro2 as the axial ligands in their ferric forms (10Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J.

Taken together, the intermediate1 formed by reduction of the ferric heme iron with eaq− is thought to have the ferrous heme with a thiolate derived from Cys75 and a nitrogen atom from Pro2 as the axial ligands. The intermediate1 was converted into the final product through another intermediate, as described below. We studied the ligand exchange of CooA kinetically by analyzing the time-dependent decay curves observed at 420 nm. The kinetic traces observed at 420 nm could be fitted by a sum of two exponential functions with time constants of 40 μs (k = 2.5 × 104 s−1) and 2.9 ms (k = 3.5 × 102 s−1), and with those of 44 μs (k = 2.3 × 104 s−1) and 1.1 ms (k = 8.9 × 102s−1) for WT and H77G CooA, respectively, as shown in Figs.3 and 4. These kinetic parameters were independent of the concentration of CooA (data not shown), indicating that intramolecular first order reactions were observed in these cases.Figure 4Absorption changes after pulse radiolysis of H77G CooA monitored at 420 nm. The smooth solid linesare the fitting curves by a sum of two exponential functions with the time constants of 44 μs and 1.1 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic traces shown in Figs. 3 and 4 correspond to the decay of the intermediate 1 and the formation of the product(s). If the intermediate 1 is directly converted into the final product, the kinetic trace will be a single exponential curve. However, it was not the case for both WT and H77G CooA. For WT and H77G CooA, the kinetic traces could be fitted by a sum of two exponential functions, as described above, suggesting that the conversion of the intermediate 1 into the final product proceeded via another intermediate (intermediate 2). The rate constant for the faster process of WT CooA (k= 2.5 × 104 s−) is almost the same as that of H77G CooA (k = 2.3 × 104s−1), suggesting that a common reaction takes place to form the intermediate 2 in the faster phase reaction. The faster phase reaction would correspond to the conversion of the intermediate 1 into a common intermediate 2 for WT and H77G CooA. The intermediate 2 showed the Soret peak at 440 nm no longer, as shown in Fig. 1. It has been reported that the occurrence of the Soret peak at about 450 nm is caused by the coordination of a thiolate axial ligand to a ferrous heme with another axial ligand and that the protonation of the thiolate and/or the elongation of the bond length between the heme iron and the sulfur atom result in the shift of the Soret peak from 450 to 420 nm (35Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13637-13645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jung C. Chem. Phys.

Therefore, the protonation of the thiolate from Cys75and/or the elongation of the Fe–S bond are thought to take place to form the intermediate 2. Electrostatic repulsion between the ferrous heme iron and the thiolate anion may be a driving force for the conversion of the intermediate 1 to the intermediate2. For some artificial mutant heme proteins in which a histidine of an axial ligand is replaced with a cysteine, the dissociation of the thiolate ligand takes place upon the reduction of the heme iron, though a stable Fe–S bond is observed in the ferric state (38Adachi S. Nagano S. Watanabe Y. Ishimura K. Morishima I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Adachi S. Nagano S. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I.

Soc. 1991; 113: 1038-1040Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The intermediate 2 was converted into the final product, reduced WT or H77G CooA. This process corresponds to the slower phase of the kinetic traces observed in Figs. 3 and 4. In the case of WT CooA, therefore, the ligand exchange between Cys75 and His77 proceeds with the time constant of 2.9 ms (k = 3.5 × 102 s−1) during the conversion of the intermediate 2 to reduced CooA. The relatively slow rate suggests that a large structural change is required for the conversion of the intermediate 2 to reduced CooA. This is consistent with x-ray crystallographic analysis of ferrous CooA (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The distance between the heme iron and the sulfur atom in Cys75 is 4.8 Å in ferrous CooA, and it has been proposed that the ligand change requires considerable movement of the protein and/or heme (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the occurrence of the slower phase corresponding to the decay of the intermediate 2 for H77G CooA was unexpected because the ligand exchange between Cys75 and His77 does not take place due to the lack of His77 in this mutant. Though H77G CooA lacks His77, which is one of the axial ligands of the ferrous heme, ferrous H77G CooA shows an optical absorption spectrum typical for a six-coordinate heme protein (16Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S-Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The resonance Raman spectrum of ferrous H77G CooA shows the ν2 and ν3 bands at 1583 and 1493 cm−1, respectively. 2T. Uchida, S. Takahashi, K. Ishimori, I. Morishima, H. Nakajima, and S. Aono, unpublished results. These values are almost the same as those of ferrous WT CooA (ν2 = 1579 cm−1, ν3 = 1491 cm−1) (13Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K.

Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating that the heme in ferrous H77G CooA is six-coordinated, not five-coordinated. Electrochemical redox titrations reveal that the ligand switching during the change in the oxidation state of the heme iron does not take place in the case of H77G CooA (16Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S-Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ferrous CooA reveals that Cys75, Met76, and His77 exist in the proximal heme pocket and that the position of the side chain of Met76 is unable to bind to the heme iron (12Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the proximal side of the ferrous heme in CooA, no other candidate is found for the axial ligand of the heme except for Cys75, Met76, and His77. These results suggest that Cys75 is coordinated to the ferrous heme in H77G CooA. Because reduced H77G CooA shows the Soret peak at 422 nm, not at about 450 nm, the thiolate from Cys75 is thought to be protonated, and/or the Fe–S bond is thought to be elongated, just as the postulated structure of the intermediate 2. For H77G CooA, therefore, the conversion of the intermediate 2 into the final product is not thought to be accompanied with a ligand exchange. Rather, the conversion of the intermediate 2 with the time constant of 1.1 ms for H77G CooA will correspond to a conformational relaxation of the polypeptide at the proximal side without the change in the coordination structure of the heme. Protonation of Cys75 and/or the elongation of the Fe–S bond would facilitate the dissociation of Cys75 from the ferrous heme in the case of H77G CooA. However, the ferrous heme in H77G CooA is retained to be six-coordinated as described above. These results suggest the following scenario for the ligand exchange. A conformational relaxation of the polypeptide at the proximal side would take place in both WT and H77G CooA during the conversion of the intermediate 2 into the final product. In the case of WT CooA, the orientation of His77 will be adjusted to be appropriate for the ligand exchange by a conformational relaxation at the proximal side, and the ligand exchange will take place concertedly with a conformational relaxation during the conversion of the intermediate 2. His77 with a proper orientation to the heme will assist the ligand exchange, i.e. the ligand exchange during the conversion of the intermediate 2 is thought to proceed by the reaction between the intermediate2 and His77 with an “Sn2-like” mechanism. In the case of H77G CooA, the coordination of the protonated Cys75 to the ferrous heme and/or the elongated Fe–S bond seems to be retained due to the lack of His77. Although the ligand exchange does not take place in H77G CooA, the conformational relaxation at the proximal side of the heme is observed also in this mutant. These results clearly show that the conformational relaxation at the proximal side proceeds even in the absence of His77, once the oxidation state of the heme iron in CooA is changed. The Fe–S bond will be elongated upon the reduction of the heme, which may start the conformational relaxation of the polypeptide at the proximal side of the heme in CooA. In conclusion, the proposed reaction schemes for the ligand exchange induced by the reduction with pulse radiolysis are summarized in Fig.5. The ligand exchange at the proximal side proceeds via two intermediates, 1 and 2 in the scheme, for WT CooA. The rate determining step for the ligand exchange induced by reduction of the heme iron is the conversion of the intermediate 2 into the final product. This step involves a conformational relaxation of the polypeptide in the proximal heme pocket. The proper orientation of the side chain of His77for the ligand exchange is achieved during this conformational relaxation. In the case of H77G CooA, though the same intermediates as those for WT CooA are formed, the final reaction step is a conformational relaxation at the proximal side without ligand exchange. The ligand exchange reveals flexibility of the polypeptide around the heme in CooA, which will be responsible for the signal transduction induced by the binding of CO to the heme in CooA. The number of hydrogen bonds around the proximal heme pocket will reflect the flexibility of the polypeptide around the heme in CooA. Only one hydrogen bond (the hydrogen bond between the oxygen of Gly43 and the nitrogen of Met76) exists within 10 Å from the heme iron in the proximal heme pocket for CooA, while 6–10 hydrogen bonds exist within 10 Å from the heme iron in the proximal heme pocket for other heme proteins, as summarized in TableI. Increasing the number of hydrogen bonds may make a polypeptide chain rigid. Therefore, a smaller number of the hydrogen bond in the proximal heme pocket in CooA compared with other heme proteins will show the flexibility of the polypeptide chain in the proximal heme pocket.Table IThe number of hydrogen bond within 10 Å from the heme iron in the proximal heme pocketHeme proteinsNumber of hydrogen bondsCooA (1FT9)1Cyt. f (1EWH)10Cyt. c2 (1CO6)6Cyt. c′ (1BBH)9Mb (1A6M)6The PDB accession numbers are shown in parentheses.

In the absence of ligand the dioxin receptor is commonly found evenly distributed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of target cells in a complex with hsp90 and several hsp90-associated proteins.

Previous studies have identified both nuclear localization and nuclear export (NES) sequence motifs in the bHLH domain of the dioxin receptor (15Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The role of the NES motif located in the bHLH domain is poorly characterized. Mutation of this motif does not affect the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor in the absence of ligand (16Pollenz R.S. Barbour E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (104): 6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nuclear export of the receptor following ligand removal appears to be negatively influenced by alterations of this NES motif (16Pollenz R.S. Barbour E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (104): 6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a C216W mutation in the PAS domain of the mouse dioxin receptor has previously been reported to impair transcriptional activation (17Sun W.M. Zhang J.Z. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that a novel NES motif is present in the PAS domain of the dioxin receptor, centered at cysteine 216. A C216S mutation yielded a constitutively active NES, resulting in exclusive cytoplasmic localization of the receptor. The mutant form of the receptor was unable to initiate transcription of a reporter gene construct in transient transfection assays. We show that nuclear localization of the dioxin receptor is differentially regulated via the two NES motifs. The inactive form of the dioxin receptor is actively exported from the nucleus via the NES motif in the PAS domain. In contrast, nuclear export of the ligand-activated dioxin receptor is mediated by the NES motif present in the bHLH domain. In conclusion, we have identified a novel function of the PAS domain in modulating intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor via nuclear export. The pCMVmDR (13McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L.

Typically, 500 ng of a luciferase reporter plasmid (pTX1X1) and 100 ng of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter as internal control were transfected together with appropriate dioxin receptor expression vectors. The expression vector concentrations ranged between 1 and 50 ng. Following transfection, the cells were washed and maintained for 48 h in the presence or absence of 10 nm TCDD. Luciferase and β-galactosidose activities were subsequently measured using the Gene Glow system (BioTema) or Galacto Light system (Tropics) according to the recommendations of the suppliers. To determine intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor or chimeric dioxin receptor constructs, HeLa cells were grown on 20 × 20-mm glass coverslips in 30-mm dishes. Transfections were performed by introducing 0.5–1 μg of plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged dioxin receptor or dioxin-glucocorticoid receptor chimeric constructs into cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following transfection, cells were treated as detailed in the figure legends and examined by using a Nikon LABOPHOT microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set and a photocamera. Quantitative evaluations of the intracellular distribution of GFP-tagged proteins were performed as described before (21Okamoto K. Tanaka H. Ogawa H. Makino Y. Eguchi H. Hayashi S. Yoshikawa N. Poellinger L. Umesono K. Makino I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10363-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, green fluorescent cells were classified into five categories according to the subcellular distribution of the GFP fusion proteins: C for exclusive cytoplasmic localization; C > N, for predominantly cytoplasmic fluorescence; C = N, for fluorescence equally distributed both in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus; N < C, for nuclear dominant fluorescence; and N, for exclusive nuclear fluorescence. On average, 200 fluorescing cells (∼20 fields with 5–20 fluorescing cells/field) were evaluated per transfection. The experiments were repeated three times, and representative fields are presented. Co-immunoprecipitation procedures have been presented in detail elsewhere (14Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13519-13524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In short, dioxin receptor was in vitro translated in a transcription-translation coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following translation, the dioxin receptor and Arnt were co-incubated in the presence of 10 nm TCDD or vehicle alone for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, the protein mixture was incubated with hsp90, dioxin receptor, or p23 antibodies for 45 min at 0–4 °C. Antibody-protein complexes were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of a 50% phosphate-buffered saline-protein A-Sepharose slurry. The precipitated complex was washed extensively and removed from the protein A-Sepharose resin by elution with SDS-running buffer. The proteins were resolved in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the gel was dried and visualized overnight on intensifying films. A single amino acid substitution within the PAS domain, C216W, has been reported to inhibit dioxin receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, without affecting the ligand binding activity of the receptor (17Sun W.M. Zhang J.Z. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To gain additional information regarding the role of the PAS domain, we examined why a single point mutation in the PAS domain abrogated receptor function. Since the described mutation may induce a rather drastic change in dioxin receptor structure given the large degree of structural differences between Cys and Trp residues, we introduced a more conservative point mutation where the original Cys residue was replaced with a Ser residue. Compared with a Cys-Trp mutation, a substitution of a Cys for a Ser residue would be expected to have only a mild effect on the structural organization of the dioxin receptor. During the initial characterization of the functional properties of the mutant C216S receptor form, we observed that the C216S dioxin receptor mutant interacted efficiently with the hsp90 complex or with in vitro translated Arnt, similar to the wild type receptor (data not shown). These experiments suggest that there are no gross differences in structure between the different receptor forms, which would explain the severe impairment of the dioxin receptor to transactivate properly. Close examination of sequences surrounding the critical Cys216 residue revealed a substantial similarity to an NES motif: LX2–3LX2–3LXL (22Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1 A, this sequence motif of the mouse dioxin receptor is conserved between several species and shows similarity to nuclear export sequences identified in proteins such as the protein kinase inhibitor PKI (23Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) and the human immunodeficiency virus regulator REV (24Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In PKI and REV, the corresponding motif has been shown to mediate interaction with the export protein CRM-1, which actively export of these proteins from the cell nucleus (23Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the putative NES motif in regulation of dioxin receptor function, we transiently co-transfected human 293 kidney cells with a dioxin receptor-regulated luciferase reporter gene construct. In the presence of increasing concentrations of transiently expressed wild-type dioxin receptor, we observed a robust dose- and ligand-dependent activation of reporter gene activity. In contrast, the C216S mutant receptor was unable to activate XRE-dependent reporter gene transcription (Fig.1 B). We then examined whether the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor was affected by the C216S mutation. We fused both the wild-type and C216S mutant forms of the dioxin receptor to GFP and monitored intracellular localization of the proteins following transient transfection of HeLa cells. For quantitative purposes, no fewer than 200 cells where arranged into five different categories as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the absence of ligand, the wild-type dioxin receptor, GFP-DR, was detected evenly distributed both in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, whereas upon ligand treatment, 75% of the cells showed a complete or predominant nuclear localization (Fig.2 A). Remarkably, in the absence of ligand the C216S mutant dioxin receptor, GFP-DRC216S, was present almost exclusively in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell, with very low levels of nuclear fluorescence. Moreover, in the presence of ligand, the mutant C216S receptor failed to accumulate in the cell nucleus (Fig. 2 B). NES motifs have been shown to mediate export from the cell nucleus of a large number of different proteins by recruiting the nuclear export receptor CRM-1 (22Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). This CRM-1-dependent nuclear export activity has been shown to be selectively inhibited by leptomycin B, a compound that binds specifically to CRM-1 (25Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the wild-type dioxin receptor accumulates in the nucleus in response to leptomycin B treatment in the absence of ligand (19Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggesting that the receptor interacts with the export protein CRM-1. We next tested the effect of leptomycin B on the intracellular localization pattern of the C216S receptor. For this purpose, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP-DR or GFP-DRC216S expression vectors and incubated for 2 h with 50 nmleptomycin B, 10 nm TCDD, or a combination of both, prior to analysis of the intracellular localization patterns of the proteins. In the absence of ligand, the wild-type dioxin receptor-GFP fusion protein was redistributed to a predominantly nuclear localization by leptomycin B treatment. In the presence of both ligand and leptomycin B, similar levels of the GFP-dioxin receptor were observed in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the ligand-free GFP-DRC216S fusion protein failed to accumulate in the nucleus in the presence of leptomycin B or TCDD alone (Fig. 2 B). However, in cells incubated with both 10 nm TCDD and 50 nmleptomycin B, we observed a clear translocation of the mutant protein GFP-DRC216S to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the dioxin receptor is actively exported out of the cell nucleus in a CRM-1-dependent fashion both in the presence and absence of ligand. Mutation of the C216S residue in the PAS domain of the receptor generates a constitutively active export sequence, which drives the receptor toward the cell cytoplasm. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild type receptor, nuclear redistribution of the C216S mutant form of the receptor required both inhibition of the CRM-1 export protein and presence of TCDD. We investigated whether the NES motif present in the PAS A domain was able to function independently of the NES motif present in the bHLH domain. To this end, we generated a dioxin receptor chimeric construct where we replaced the bHLH domain of the dioxin receptor with the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. Recent studies show that the glucocorticoid receptor is insensitive to the effects of leptomycin B treatment and is probably not a CRM-1-regulated protein (26Liu J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 14: 40-51Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric construct, GR-DBD/DR83–805, resembles the wild-type dioxin receptor in that it also contains a strong N-terminal nuclear localization signal motif. To determine the intracellular localization of this chimeric construct HeLa cells were transiently transfected using the same protocol as employed above. Following transfection, HeLa cells were treated with vehicle alone, 10 nm TCDD, or 10 nm leptomycin B. Interestingly, in the absence of ligand, GR-DBD/DR83–805 showed virtually the same intracellular localization pattern as the wild-type dioxin receptor (Fig. 3 A). In analogy to the effects on the intracellular localization of the wild-type dioxin receptor, the addition of leptomycin B or TCDD induced nuclear accumulation of the GR-DBD/DR83–805 chimeric construct. These observations suggest that deletion of the bHLH domain does not alter the shuttling properties of the dioxin receptor contrasting the current model of intracellular transport of the dioxin receptor, which postulates that nuclear export is mediated by a NES motif present in the bHLH domain (15Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Watanabe J. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of the GR-DBD/DR83–805 construct to shuttle clearly demonstrates that additional export sequences are present in the dioxin receptor. Moreover, the sensitivity displayed by the GR-DBD/DR83–805 fusion protein to leptomycin B reiterates that CRM-1 is involved in the intracellular redistribution of the dioxin receptor through sequences outside the bHLH domain. To generate further evidence that the putative NES motif in the PAS domain is functional, we mutated four hydrophobic residues (Phe214, Leu218, Leu221, and Leu222) to alanine (the 4 Ala mutant). In other proteins, these four conserved residues have been shown to represent critical determinants for the interaction between CRM-1 and different CRM-1 target factors (24Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We fused the 4 Ala mutant form of the dioxin receptor to GFP and analyzed its intracellular localization pattern following transient expression in HeLa cells. Interestingly, mutation of the four conserved hydrophobic residues resulted in a dioxin receptor form that was predominantly nuclear in the absence of ligand (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, the addition of leptomycin B did not significantly alter the dominant nuclear localization of this mutant form of the dioxin receptor. These results indicate that exchange of the hydrophobic residues compromises the interaction between CRM-1 and the PAS domain of the receptor. The addition of TCDD to cells transfected with the 4 Ala-GFP form of the receptor resulted in a modest increase in nuclear accumulation, suggesting that these mutations do not alter the ability of this protein to bind TCDD. These experiments support our hypothesis that the PAS domain contains a functional NES motif that mediates nuclear export of the dioxin receptor in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, the activity of this NES can be enhanced by replacements of Cys216 with Ser or conversely inhibited by mutating the hydrophobic residues as indicated. We have recently demonstrated that deletion of the PAS B subdomain of the dioxin receptor results in formation of a constitutively nuclear protein, presumably due to its inability to interact with hsp90 and the immunophilin-like protein XAP-2. XAP-2 has been shown to possess an important role in mediating cytoplasmic retention of the dioxin receptor (20Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To bypass the effects of the hsp90-XAP-2 complex on the intracellular localization of the receptor, we decided to investigate the effect of deletion of the PAS B subdomain within the C216S mutant dioxin receptor with regard to both intracellular localization and the transcriptional activity of the protein. We monitored the intracellular localization pattern of dioxin receptor-GFP fusion proteins following transient transfection in HeLa cells. As expected, the dioxin receptor lacking the PAS B subdomain, DRΔ287–421 (GFP-wt-ΔPASB), demonstrated a clear nuclear localization pattern (Fig.4 A). A corresponding deletion of the PAS B subdomain in the GFP-DRC216S (GFP-C216SΔPASB) mutant form of the receptor induced a dramatic shift in intracellular localization of the protein toward the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig.4 A). These results suggest that despite its seemingly nuclear appearance, the GFP-wt-ΔPASB protein is actively being exported from the nucleus. However, mutation of Cys216 to Ser generates a strong NES with enhanced export function. This enhanced NES is therefore able to drive the GFP-C216SΔPASB receptor from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In agreement with this model, the addition of leptomycin B to cells transfected with GFP-C216SΔPASB shifted the localization of the protein toward the nuclear compartment (Fig.4 A). The fact that deletion of the PAS B domain results in a receptor protein that constitutively accumulates in the nucleus provided the possibility of analyzing whether the C216S mutation would affect the transcription activation potential of the DRΔPASB receptor forms. In transient transfection experiments, C216SΔPASB displayed ∼50% of the ligand-independent (constitutive) transcriptional activation function that was obtained by the wt-ΔPASB protein lacking the C216S mutation (Fig. 4 B), in excellent agreement with the less pronounced constitutive nuclear localization of the GFP-C216S-ΔPASB protein (Fig. 4 A). The ability of this construct to induce XRE-mediated reporter gene expression suggests that XRE binding activity remains unaffected. In conclusion, these results indicate that the C216S mutation within the PAS A subdomain generates an NES motif that is functionally more active than the corresponding NES motif within the wild-type receptor. Our results indicate that the NES motif within the PAS domain of the dioxin receptor plays an important role in regulation of the intracellular localization of the receptor in the absence of ligand. To assess regulation of dioxin receptor function by nuclear export in the presence of ligand, we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors for GFP-DR, GFP-DR C216S, or GFP-GR-DBD/DR 83–805 and incubated the cells with a combination of 10 nm TCDD and 50 nm leptomycin B to induce nuclear accumulation. The cells were then extensively washed, and the medium was replaced with medium containing vehicle alone or leptomycin B (Fig.5 A). The cells where then further incubated for 4 h, in the absence of ligand, and the intracellular localization pattern of the GFP-DR construct was determined. Under these conditions, we observed a clear shift of the GFP-DR construct from the nucleus toward the cytoplasmic compartment, where ∼50% of the cells displayed an equal distribution between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, cells expressing the GFP-DR C216S protein displayed only a minor increase in cytoplasmic localization compared with the wild-type dioxin receptor (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, substitution of the bHLH domain of the wild-type dioxin receptor with the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor generated a protein that maintained a predominantly nuclear localization even after ligand withdrawal. These results suggest that export of the activated form of the dioxin receptor is predominantly mediated by the bHLH domain. Moreover, treatment of cells with leptomycin B, after ligand withdrawal, inhibited cytoplasmic redistribution (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the NES motif present in the bHLH domain of the dioxin receptor mediates export of the ligand-activated receptor, whereas the NES motif within the PAS domain is responsible for nuclear export of the nonactivated receptor. Dioxin receptor stability has been shown to be regulated by ligand, hsp90-associated factors (20Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and intracellular localization of the receptor (16Pollenz R.S. Barbour E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (104): 6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, degradation of the receptor involves both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent pathways (1Gu Y.-Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that proteasome-mediated degradation of the dioxin receptor occurs predominantly in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell (16Pollenz R.S. Barbour E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (104): 6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Considering that the C216S mutant form of the dioxin receptor showed a pronounced increase in cytoplasmic localization (Fig.2 B), we examined if the DR C216S mutant was more sensitive to proteolytic degradation than the wild-type receptor. Using immunoblot analysis, we monitored the expression levels of the wild-type dioxin receptor or the C216S mutant form in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, TCDD, or a combination of both compounds. Since prolonged treatment of cells with TCDD results in an increase in dioxin receptor degradation, we treated cells for a limited period of time (2 h) when only modest degradation or no degradation of the wild type receptor can be detected. Under these conditions, treatment of the cells with MG132, TCDD, or a combination of both compounds did not affect wild-type dioxin receptor expression levels (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2–5). In contrast, in cells transfected with the C216S mutant form of the receptor, we failed to detect any expression of the ligand-free C216S mutant protein unless cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (compare lanes 6 and7). MG132, however, failed to stabilize the C216S mutant protein when the cells were treated with TCDD (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 8 and 9). Introduction of the different GFP fusion constructs into cells resulted in clear stabilization of the mutant form of the dioxin receptor protein. Interestingly, we were able to detect the mutant protein in the absence of MG132 treatment. Moreover, the addition of MG132 had little effect on GFP-dioxin receptor protein levels in the absence of ligand. However, treatment of cells with 10 nm TCDD resulted in a clear reduction of the levels of the GFP-tagged mutant receptor fusion protein (Fig. 6 C, compare lanes 1 and8). These results show that the C216S mutant is rapidly turned over by proteolysis and that several proteolytic pathways act on the dioxin receptor. It appears that, in the absence of ligand, the main degradation system that targets the dioxin receptor is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, since inhibition of this system with MG132 is sufficient to stabilize the dioxin receptor. However, the addition of ligand results in a dioxin receptor form that can be degraded by additional pathways that are insensitive to the effects of MG132. Given the critical role of the hsp90-associated immunophilin XAP-2 in protecting the dioxin receptor against degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (20Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we examined if overexpression of XAP-2 would increase the stability of the C216S dioxin receptor. In control co-immunoprecipitation assays, using in vitrotranslated proteins, we observed that both wild-type and C216S dioxin receptors interacted with XAP-2 with similar affinity (data not shown). Next we used the same experimental conditions as described above, where cells were exposed for 2 h to TCDD. For this purpose, COS cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding the mutant C216S dioxin receptor, XAP-2, or with the empty vector as a negative control. Interestingly, we observed that in the presence of XAP-2 the C216S dioxin receptor was stabilized in the absence of ligand (Fig.6 C, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, the addition of 10 nm TCDD to the transfected cell destabilized the C216S dioxin receptor, and XAP-2 was not able to fully protect the ligand-activated form against degradation (Fig. 6 C, compare lanes 1 and 2 withlanes 3 and 4). A single amino acid substitution (C216W) in the PAS A domain has been shown to inhibit the ability of the dioxin receptor to activate XRE-dependent gene expression (17Sun W.M. Zhang J.Z. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility of structural rearrangements that would inhibit receptor function, we engineered a more conservative exchange, where the original Cys was changed to Ser. Interestingly, the C216S mutation greatly diminished the ability of the receptor to activate transcription. However, the C216S receptor form retained important functional features such as the ability to interact with the hsp90 chaperone complex, ligand binding, and dimerization with Arnt, ruling out major structural rearrangements as the reason for loss of transcriptional activity. Our data show that the C216S mutation affects the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor. Interestingly, the C216S mutation resulted in a dioxin receptor form that displayed a predominant cytoplasmic localization. We have previously shown that the latent form of the dioxin receptor is being actively shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nuclear export of the latent form of the receptor is sensitive to leptomycin B (19Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export protein CRM-1 (22Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Close examination of the primary amino acid sequence surrounding the C216S mutation revealed several interesting features. First, this region of the dioxin receptor shows large degree of similarity to a bona fide NES sequence, the target interaction sequence for the nuclear export receptor protein CRM-1 (22Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C216S mutation resembles a mutation in the Schizosacharomyces pombe AP-1 homologue PAP-1. The interaction between PAP-1 and CRM-1 is regulated by the redox regulatory factor REF-1 which modulates the activity of PAP-1 by regulating the redox status of a critical cysteine residue in the PAP-1 NES sequence. Enhanced interaction between PAP-1 and CRM-1 reduces PAP-1 transcriptional activity. The C216S mutation in the dioxin receptor displays a large degree of functional similarities to PAP-1. The original cysteine is flanked by two arginine residues, as observed in recognition sequences for the redox regulatory factor REF-1 (28Powis G. Briehl M. Oblong J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 68: 149-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mutation of this Cys to Ser may generate a “constitutively reduced” cysteine, where the interaction with CRM-1 would elude redox regulation. Although it is not known whether the activity of the dioxin receptor is modulated by REF-1, XRE-mediated transcriptional activation has been observed in cells treated with chemicals that induce oxidative stress (29Yoo H.Y. Chang M.S. Rho H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the PAS A domain of the dioxin receptor harbors a functional NES motif that regulates dioxin receptor function. Furthermore, exchange of Cys216 to Ser generates a constitutively active NES that directs the receptor to the cytoplasm. The present experiments suggest that the NES motif in the PAS domain regulates intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor in the absence of ligand (see model in Fig. 7). Thus, the cytoplasmic localization of the receptor is regulated, at multiple levels, both by CRM-1 and the immunophilin-like protein XAP2 (19Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclear export of the ligand-activated form of the receptor appears to be mediated by the NES motif present in the bHLH domain (Fig. 7). Replacement of the bHLH domain with the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor, which lacks functional nuclear export activity (26Liu J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 14: 40-51Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), generated a fusion protein that fails to be exported from the cell nucleus following ligand withdrawal. Moreover, the nuclear export kinetics of the ligand-activated wild-type and C216S dioxin receptors displayed similar rates, suggesting that the C216S mutation did not affect the export rate of the ligand-activated receptor. These experiments suggest that nuclear export of the ligand-activated dioxin receptor requires the bHLH domain and the export factor CRM-1. In addition, the similar kinetics of nuclear export of the wild-type and C216S forms of the dioxin receptor argue that the NES of the receptor present in the PAS domain is inactive in the presence of ligand. Intriguingly, we observed that cytoplasmic localization of the dioxin receptor leads to enhanced proteolytic turnover. It is interesting to note that co-expression of XAP-2 together with the C216S mutant receptor protein was able to prevent degradation of the receptor in the absence of ligand and, to some extent, in the presence of ligand. XAP-2 has been shown to inhibit degradation of the dioxin receptor by interfering with receptor ubiquitination. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that XAP-2 (and possibly other chaperone-associated proteins) can protect the dioxin receptor against degradation via ubiquitin-independent pathways. In conclusion, our results show that the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor is determined by multiple regulatory pathways. In the absence of ligand, the receptor is actively being transported between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. While the molecular mechanism that regulates nuclear import in the absence of ligand remains unknown, nuclear export of the nonactivated receptor is mediated by the NES motif present in the PAS domain of the receptor. We show that modifications that alter the activity of this motif have profound functional consequences for the stability and activity of the receptor. Furthermore, the activity of the individual NES motifs appears to be closely linked to the functional status of the receptor. It appears that, in the absence of ligand, nuclear export of the receptor is mediated by the PAS domain, while export of the active receptor, following ligand removal, is mediated by the bHLH domain. Clearly, additional studies are required to clarify the complex interplay of mechanisms that regulate the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor.

Rapid photochemical methods have been employed to study the rate of folding of reduced cytochromec. In this protein, the iron of the covalently bound heme binds a His and a Met, proximal and distal. Unfolding by guanidine or urea weakens the Fe–Met bond, and the reduced unfolded cytochromec easily binds CO and other heme ligands, which would react slowly or not at all with the native protein. Therefore in the presence of CO, reduced cytochrome c unfolds at lower denaturant concentrations than in the absence of this ligand, and rapid photochemical removal of CO from unfolded cytochrome c, is expected to trigger at least an incomplete refolding. This approach is complicated by the breakage of the proximal His–Fe bond that may occur as a consequence of CO photodissociation in the unfolded cytochromec because of the so-called base elimination mechanism. Rebinding of CO to the four-coordinate heme yields kinetic intermediates unrelated to folding. Our hypothesis is supported by parallel observations carried out with protoheme and microperoxidase.

Therefore in the presence of CO, reduced cytochrome c unfolds at lower denaturant concentrations than in the absence of this ligand, and rapid photochemical removal of CO from unfolded cytochrome c, is expected to trigger at least an incomplete refolding. This approach is complicated by the breakage of the proximal His–Fe bond that may occur as a consequence of CO photodissociation in the unfolded cytochromec because of the so-called base elimination mechanism. Rebinding of CO to the four-coordinate heme yields kinetic intermediates unrelated to folding. Our hypothesis is supported by parallel observations carried out with protoheme and microperoxidase. cytochrome c guanidine hydrochloride imidazole 2-methyl imidazole microperoxidase cytochrome c551 charge-coupled devices circular dichroism Cytochrome c(cyt-c)1 has been widely used as a model system to study the kinetics and mechanism of protein folding (1Rumbley J.

In native cyt-c, the heme iron is six-coordinate because the polypeptide chain provides two axial ligands, namely a His (His-18, the proximal His; numbering is for the sequence of horse heart cyt-c) and a Met (Met-80) (5Takano T. Kallai O.B. Swanson R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5234-5255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bushnell G.W. Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The distal Fe–Met bond contributes to a significant extent to the overall thermodynamic stability of native cyt-c (7Taler G. Schejter A. Navon G. Vig I. Margoliash E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14209-14212Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Saleem M.M.M. Wilson M.T. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1988; 153: 99-104Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (in the unfolding process this bond is weakened), and the unfolded cyt-c is a mixture of the five-coordinate and several six-coordinate states, the sixth ligand being provided either by Met-80 or by other His or Met residues of the polypeptide chain (a phenomenon called miscoordination) (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 4Yeh S.R. Takahashi S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12535-12541Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)). Because of the weakening of the Fe–Met bond, external heme ligands, such as CO, induce unfolding at lower denaturant concentrations by competing with Met-80 for the sixth coordination position. The native state of reduced cyt-c is more stable than the oxidized one; thus, under appropriate experimental conditions, reduction promotes refolding (Ref. 11Pascher T. Chesick J.P. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1996; 271: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar and references therein). Moreover, since CO destabilizes reduced cyt-c, it is possible to select experimental conditions where the protein is mostly unfolded in the presence of CO and mostly folded in its absence (e.g. 40 °C and 4.6 m Gdn (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) for horse heart cyt-c). Under these conditions, rapid photochemical removal of CO from unfolded, reduced cyt-c may promote refolding with transient rebinding of Met-80 to the heme iron. Indeed at selected wavelengths a characteristic “raise and fall” optical density change was observed, and, if complete absorbance spectra are collected as a function of time, several kinetic intermediates may be seen to build up and then decay (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). With horse heart cyt-c the time course is actually more complex than outlined above because of the possible miscoordination events by residues other than Met-80. This experiment, pioneered by Eaton and co-workers (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), has been interpreted according to a coordination/miscoordination kinetic mechanism shown in Scheme 1. In Scheme 1, X indicates the proximal His while Y indicates Met-80 or any other residue capable of coordinating to the heme iron (His-26, His-33, and Met-65 for horse heart cyt-c). To investigate the folding mechanism for this class of proteins in the absence of miscoordinations, we studied a simpler cytochrome c, cyt-c551 from P. aeruginosa, whose amino acid sequence allows coordination only with the proximal His (His-16) and the distal Met (Met-61); the additional Met (Met-18) is too close to the proximal His to bind to the distal coordination position of the heme iron (13Detlefsen D.J. Thanabal V. Pecoraro V.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9040-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As the probe of this photochemical experiment is the heme, the picture may be considerably more complex if any of its characteristic reactions were to occur. The heme can be dissolved in organic solvents or dispersed in micelles of detergents, and its reactivity with ligands can be studied in the absence of the protein moiety. It is known that in the presence of imidazole (Im) or 2-methyl imidazole (MeIm), the heme binds CO more strongly than in the absence of these bases and readily forms a six-coordinate state of the type (Im or MeIm)–Fe–CO; conversely, when CO is present the organic base in trans is bound with higher affinity (14Rougee M. Brault D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4100-4105Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Momentau M. Rougée M. Loock B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). If the (Im or MeIm)–Fe–CO complex is submitted to a short and bright flash of light, the photolabile Fe–CO bond is broken and, in the dark, CO recombination proceeds largely via a mechanism called base elimination (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in Scheme 2. X−Fe−CO→←hνX−Fe+CO↑↓↑↓X+Fe−CO←→X+Fe+CO SCHEME2In Scheme 2, X indicates the proximal base, either Im or MeIm, and is formally analogous to the proximal His of Scheme 1. Because of the lower affinity for the proximal base, the five-coordinate photoproduct X–Fe easily dissociates X and converts to a four-coordinate species, which first rebinds CO and then X. The base elimination kinetic mechanism (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) populates three intermediates, i.e. one four-coordinate and two five-coordinate (Fe–CO and Im–Fe) states; if it operates also in the case of unfolded CO-bound cyt-c, it is expected to complicate considerably the interpretation of the observed time course. The four-coordinate species is less stable than either of the five-coordinate, hence it remains scarcely populated throughout; however, it equilibrates quickly with both of them, because of its high reactivity, and the prevailing path to recover the equilibrium six-coordinate is via the CO-bound intermediate rather than the base-bound one. In this paper we present evidence that a base elimination mechanism occurs in photochemical experiments on CO-bound unfolded cyt-c. Indeed, at least one of the main kinetic intermediates populated during the time course, which was assigned to a partially folded or collapsed species, is also observed in detergent-dissolved protoheme and in the heme-containing oligopeptide microperoxidase (17Harbury H.A. Loach P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3640-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that intermediate species populated after photolysis of CO include those originally postulated by Eaton and co-workers (Scheme 1) as well as those of the base elimination mechanism (Scheme 2); therefore interpretation of photochemical experiments on unfolded, CO-bound cytochromes is considerably more complex than hitherto anticipated, and part of the observed kinetics probably bears no relationship to folding. Horse heart cyt-c, microperoxidase (MP-11) and heme were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; all other reagents were of analytical grade. P. aeruginosacyt-c551 was purified as described (18Cutruzzolà F. Ciabatti I. Rolli G. Falcinelli S. Arese M. Ranghino G. Anselmino A. Zennaro E. Silvestrini M.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The instrument used for photolysis experiments was described elsewhere (19Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Liberti S. Arese M. Grasso S. Cutruzzolà F. Brunori M. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7556-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly the 5-ns pulse of Nd-YAG solid-state laser (Quanta System HIL 101, second harmonic λ = 532 nm, E = 80 mJ/pulse) was focused onto an optical Thunberg tube containing the desired solution. The transmittance of the sample can be monitored using two separate recording devices, differently oriented with respect to the laser light pulse: a photo multiplier tube and a CCD solid state camera. The photo multiplier monitoring line is orthogonal to the laser beam; it consists of a 50-W lamp, a Spex 1681 monochromator, a Hamamatsu R1398 photo multiplier tube and a digital Tektronix TDS 360 oscilloscope equipped with either an amplifier Comlinear Corporation Model E203 or the preamplifier Tektronix ADA400. The CCD optical line is arranged at 15° from the laser beam; it consists of a 300-W lamp (ILC technology), an Acton-Princeton 320 PI spectrometer (Princeton Instruments), and a pulsed CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) capable of time resolution down to 3.5 ns. The delay between the laser pulse and the action of recording a transmittance spectrum is controlled either by the Princeton FG100 pulse generator necessary to operate the CCD camera or, for longer time delays, by a Tektronix AFG 310 function generator. The experimental data thus collected are either time courses at single wavelength or a series of spectra; they are stored as MS-DOS files on an Intel Pentium-based PC and converted to absorbencies by means of the package MATLAB (the Math Works Inc., Natick, MA). Single wavelength time courses are fitted to the desired kinetic model using the non-linear least squares routines provided by MATLAB; spectra are arranged into matrices, submitted to the singular value decomposition (20Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and the significant columns of the V matrix are treated as time courses at a single wavelength. Unfolding of c-type cytochromes in Gdn or urea is associated to spectroscopic changes of the covalently bound heme group. Surprisingly, in the reduced unfolded cyt-c it is difficult to obtain the spectrum of a pure five-coordinate heme characterized by a single peak in the visible region. Even when fluorescence and CD spectra are indicative of a fully unfolded protein, the visible spectrum indicates a significant amount of some derivative(s) displaying two peaks. Since in this region both the four- and six-coordinate states have two maxima, all the three coordination states may be populated under these conditions. The reasons we believe that all coordination states are populated under denaturing conditions are as follows: i) in the unfolded hemeprotein the affinity of the iron for its physiological ligands is reduced due to loss of the stereochemical fit imposed by the native three-dimensional architecture; ii) the five-coordinate state of unfolded cyt-c may react with the amino acid residues of the polypeptide chain (mostly His) able to form a stable coordination bond with the heme iron; indeed non-physiological bis-His six-coordinate states are described for the ferric unfolded horse heart cyt-c (1Rumbley J. Hoang L. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Telford J.R. Wittung-Stafshede P. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 755-763Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Yeh S.R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); and iii) therefore, in view of the high cooperativity of binding of the axial ligands, the five-coordinate heme iron in unfolded cyt-c is likely to equilibrate with a minor fraction of the four-coordinate state and a significant fraction of the six-coordinate one (14Rougee M. Brault D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4100-4105Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Momentau M. Rougée M. Loock B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Even reduced MP-11, the 11-residue heme-binding peptide obtained by proteolytic digestion of horse heart cyt-c (17Harbury H.A. Loach P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3640-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has the spectrum of a six-coordinate complex. Since in this case the proximal His is present but other His or Met are absent, it was postulated that the sixth ligand might be provided by the terminal amino groups of the same molecule or via aggregation of different molecules (21Jehanly A.M. Stotter D.A. Wilson M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,22Laberge M. Vreugdenhil A.J. Vanderkooi J.M. Butler I.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1998; 15: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To obtain model spectra for the four-, five- and six-coordinate protoheme in the reduced state, the prosthetic group was dissolved in 5% SDS in the presence of different types of ligands (Fig.1). CO is a strong ligand of the reduced heme iron; moreover, it strengthens the bond of the reduced iron with the ligand on the opposite side (trans) of the heme, i.e. the proximal His in hemeproteins (14Rougee M. Brault D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4100-4105Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Momentau M. Rougée M. Loock B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since a significant contribution to the overall stability of the folded state of c-type cytochromes is due to the distal coordination of the heme iron with a Met residue (5Takano T. Kallai O.B. Swanson R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5234-5255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bushnell G.W. Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), unfolding occurs at lower denaturant concentrations in the presence of CO, which competes with Met. As a consequence, upon rapid photochemical removal of bound CO, cyt-c is expected to populate the very initial folding intermediates by coordinating suitable residues of the polypeptide chain before CO can rebind to restore the initial (dark) state. Indeed it has been shown that, in denatured horse heart cyt-c, photolysis of bound CO is followed by a complex array of reactions involving several intermediates (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We carried out this experiment not only on horse heart cyt-c, but also on cytochrome c551 from P. aeruginosa(cyt-c551) that seems interesting since it cannot give miscoordinations (13Detlefsen D.J. Thanabal V. Pecoraro V.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9040-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Staniforth R.A. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The time evolution observed upon photolysis of CO from unfolded, reduced horse cyt-c (at pH 7, 25–40 °C, [CO] = 1 atm and [Gdn] = 4.6 m) has been described by four main kinetic processes with τ = 2, 60, and 500 µs, and 7 ms, respectively (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Since the effect of temperature on the population of the intermediates is small, from now on we refer mostly to the values determined at 25 °C. To better characterize the fast kinetic processes, we collected full spectra of the reaction mixture at various time delays after the laser pulse (not shown). The experiment was run as a function of CO concentration, and the results obtained on horse cyt-c and on P. aeruginosa cyt-c551 are reported in Fig.2, A and B,respectively. It is clear that lowering CO concentration slows down the formation of the 500-µs transient, which is therefore assigned to the bimolecular rebinding of CO with an apparent second order rate constant of ≈2 × 106m−1s−1. The same experiments were carried out on microperoxidase and on free heme in the presence of MeIm, a good model for the proximal His; the results, shown in Fig. 2, C andD, demonstrate that also in these simpler systems rebinding of CO proceeds through an intermediate whose formation is second order. The coordination/miscoordination model (Scheme 1 and Refs. 3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Pascher T. Chesick J.P. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1996; 271: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,24Chan C.K. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Science. 1996; 274: 628-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Hagen S.J. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 2352-2365Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) assigns the slow spectroscopic changes (τ > 1 ms) to the CO recombination of partially folded or collapsed species. This explanation is inconsistent with these processes being observed at very high [Gdn] or in free heme and MP; in fact, in these cases no folding occurs, and the model predicts that one single second order CO recombination process should be observed and should return the protein to its pre-flash condition. Therefore these experiments suggest that also the decay of the photoproduct of cyt-c involves species bearing no relationship to folding. Since in the case of free heme, the complex MeIm–Fe–CO populates at least one of the kinetic intermediates observed starting from unfolded cyt-c, we investigated in parallel protoheme varying the concentration of both CO and MeIm. This system had been already described in great detail by White et al. (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and our only point here is to verify whether the base elimination pathway proposed for the MeIm–Fe–CO complex may also apply to the case of unfolded cyt-c. In the absence of a base (Im or MeIm), the heme iron coordinates CO and a water molecule; upon photolysis of the Fe–CO bond, over 95% of the absorbance change recorded corresponds to the rebinding of CO in a simple second order process with a rate constant 2.8 × 108m−1s−1 (Fig. 3A). This value is in good agreement with that reported for the four-coordinate heme (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar); more important in the present context, almost no intermediate is seen in this reaction. Addition of 28 mm MeIm, a low concentration vis à vis the affinity of this ligand, results in the reaction becoming slower and populating an intermediate (Fig. 3B). At higher MeIm concentration (100 mm) less of the intermediate is formed (Fig. 3C), but to make it to disappear altogether, the higher affinity base (Im) is required (Fig. 3D). It is relevant that the apparent second order rate constant for CO combination becomes smaller and smaller as the MeIm or Im concentration is raised, till it plateaus (not shown). It is difficult to compare the rate constants of CO recombination in the presence of Im and MeIm; the former mimics the “in-plane” heme iron typical of R-state Hb, whereas the latter favors the “out-of-plane” domed configuration of T-state Hb (26Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 327-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Typically kCO for MeIm–Fe approaches 1 × 106m−1s−1, while for Im–Fe it is one order of magnitude faster (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The population of the kinetic intermediate associated to binding of CO is a function of MeIm concentration, being maximal at intermediate values (∼10–50 mm MeIm) and negligible or zero both in the absence of the base and at saturating concentrations (Fig. 3). According to White et al. (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), this is explained because at high concentrations of the base the heme remains five-coordinate after photolysis and CO rebinds slowly, whereas in the absence of the base the four-coordinate species is largely populated and CO rebinding is very fast (see “Discussion”). At intermediate base concentrations, photolysis of CO is associated to partial dissociation of either Im or MeIm; subsequent CO rebinding involves largely the quickly reacting four-coordinate species, and a five coordinate CO intermediate is transiently populated. Control experiments were carried out to exclude artifacts that may interfere with this interpretation of the photochemical intermediate. We checked the extent of photolysis of the Im–Fe bond in the six-coordinate derivative (Im–Fe–Im). A laser pulse dissociates Im with lower quantum yield than CO, but even for this complex recombination is dominated by the base elimination mechanism since it populates distinguishable kinetic intermediates (data not shown); the rate constant for the rebinding of Im to the five-coordinate heme iron was estimated at 3.9 × 106m−1 s−1 under our experimental conditions. MeIm does not form the six-coordinate complex MeIm–Fe–MeIm, but only the five-coordinate MeIm–Fe one. When a solution of MeIm (20–100 mm) and heme reduced by dithionite in the absence of CO was submitted to flash photolysis, only a very small absorbance change was observed; the recovery of the pre-flash absorbance occurred in a pseudo first order process with rate constant 2 × 105m−1s−1. We take this as the rebinding of MeIm to the four-coordinate heme iron. The model system of protoheme dissolved in detergent in the presence of MeIm and CO is a good candidate to mimic the intrinsic heme properties of reduced unfolded cyt-cbound to CO. By changing the MeIm concentration from 0 to 100 mm while keeping constant that of CO at 1 mm, we have been able to assign the kind of spectroscopic changes associated to the different steps of the base elimination mechanism; this experiment is reported in Fig. 4. It will be observed that during the time course two distinct intermediates, with time constants and fractional populations varying with [MeIm], are populated. At 20 mm MeIm both of them are evident and their τ are 300 ns and 6 µs, respectively. The faster process is attributed to the equilibration of the four- and five-coordinate derivatives, whereas the slower one is second order with respect to CO and is thus assigned to the formation of (H2O)-Fe–CO complex (Scheme 2). In view of the above results, we tested the effect of MeIm on unfolded, CO-bound horse heart cyt-c. Consistently with the results obtained on free heme, the intermediate, which in the absence of MeIm is formed with τ = 500 µs, disappears if photolysis is carried out in the presence of 5 m Gdn and 20 mm or more MeIm (Fig. 5). Lower concentrations of MeIm allow the formation of the 500-µs intermediate, and its maximal population was obtained in the absence of MeIm; thus a clear titration can be obtained. As observed with free heme, addition of MeIm not only reduces the population of the kinetic intermediate but also slows down the rate constant of CO recombination. Moreover, high concentration of MeIm (250 mm) interferes also with the population of the fast intermediates. For the purposes of the present discussion we first outline the interpretation of the slow kinetic processes defined, for any given set of conditions, as those corresponding to, or slower than, the bimolecular rebinding of CO (i.e. τ ≥ 500 µs for horse cyt-c at pH 7, 25 °C, [Gdn] = 4–5 m,and CO = 1 atm). According to the coordination/miscoordination model (Scheme 1), the formation of the slow intermediates is due to the transient binding of an amino acid side chain to the heme iron in a partially folded or collapsed protein (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and their decay to the replacement of this internal ligand by CO. The more “folded” the protein, the slower the replacement of the amino acid acting as distal ligand. Our experiments demonstrate that recombination of CO yields an intermediate rather than the equilibrium species also under experimental conditions in which the protein is completely unfolded even in the absence of CO (e.g. 8 m Gdn, data not shown); moreover, a similar intermediate was seen also in the simpler systems microperoxidase and MeIm–heme. We suggest that the intermediate which forms with τ = 500 µs has CO, but not the proximal His, bound to the heme iron and is populated via a base elimination mechanism as described by White et al. (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar); therefore, the other kinetic intermediates postulated by that mechanism may also be present. This interpretation is consistent with the known and as yet unexplained discrepancy between absorbance data obtained on cyt-c, which may suggest a substantial population of a putative folding intermediate, and the failure to detect a signal from unequivocal markers of collapse and initial folding, such as quenching of Trp fluorescence (24Chan C.K. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Science. 1996; 274: 628-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and far UV circular dichroism (12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, the higher population of the slow intermediate seen at lower pH values (e.g. 5), may be due to the enhanced rupture of the proximal bond due to the protonation of the His (as suggested to us by Prof. Steve Hagen). The decay of this intermediate, with τ = 7 ms, is attributed to rebinding of the proximal His and is still second order with respect to CO being coupled to the binding reaction step. An extended base elimination kinetic scheme, Scheme 3, is shown as follows. SCHEME3The starting equilibrium species (A) is a six-coordinate derivative having the reduced heme iron coordinated with CO and with the proximal His or MeIm or Im (X), depending on the sample (cyt-c, microperoxidase, or heme). The laser pulse promotes the dissociation of bound CO and populates the poorly reactive five-coordinate state X–Fe (B), which would rebind CO slowly (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since removal of CO weakens the bond between X and the Fe in state B, a four-coordinate intermediate (C) is populated; the equilibrium between the four- and five-coordinate species (B ↔ C) is achieved rapidly, due to the high reactivity of the in-plane four-coordinate iron (27Giacometti G.M. Traylor T.G. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. Antonini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7447-7448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). State C, even if present to low levels and therefore difficult to detect, rebinds CO much faster than its five-coordinate partner; for hemes in organic solvents the ratio between the two rate constants is 50–500, depending on the nature of the proximal base (Im or MeIm) (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, the photolysed species are rapidly drained to the species D, which we postulate to have an H2O molecule coordinated in trans; this may be displaced by His, MeIm, or Im restoring the dark equilibrium species (A). The original model proposed by Traylor and co-workers (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) does not allow for water coordination in trans since their experiments were carried out in organic solvents, but it seems plausible that a water molecule may bind under our experimental conditions. This assumption, however, is not crucial to the proposed kinetic scheme. The base elimination mechanism neatly accounts for the slow kinetic intermediate (forming with τ = 500 µs in cyt-c and cyt-c551), which we assume to be mostly species D, and also for its decay (with τ = 7 ms) due to coordination of the proximal His in trans and displacement of the putative H2O (D → A). Moreover it explains why MeIm prevents the appearance of the slow intermediate in horse cyt-c by maintaining the heme iron five-coordinate after photodissociation of CO (Fig. 4). It is relevant to recall that MeIm does not bind to the sixth coordination position of a His five-coordinate derivative (16White D.K. Cannon J.B. Traylor T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2443-2454Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar); hence, whatever its effect, it has to be already bound before the flash. The base elimination hypothesis here presented assigns the 500-µs and 7-ms transients to the build-up and decay of the slow intermediate (our species D) and provides a better explanation for the nature of the slow intermediate than that proposed by the coordination/miscoordination mechanism, namely that CO recombination occurs to a collapsed molecule having a His or a Met coordinated on the distal side since the latter hypothesis does not explain why the intermediate is formed at very high [Gdn] or in MP and the heme-MeIm model systems. However there are good reasons to suggest that some coordination (by His or Met residues) may also occur populating species E since in horse heart cyt-c the slowest process is too complex to be fitted to a single exponential. We now discuss briefly the faster kinetic processes, which are independent of CO concentration and were assigned to the transient coordination of amino acid side chains Met or His (Y, species E in Scheme 3). Chen et al. (12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) explored the effect of CO concentration on the overall time course and recognized that only the two fastest processes (τ = 2 µs and 50–70 µs) are CO independent; therefore they restricted their analysis to these species. Moreover they recognized that most of the CD change is observed before any coordination event, thus pointing to proximal effects. Fast absorbance changes are observed not only in cyt-c–CO but also in MP–CO and in the model system MeIm–Fe–CO; in cyt-c their amplitude grows upon increasing denaturant concentration and is affected by addition of MeIm (Figs. 4 and 5). We suggest that the faster transients may be contributed by two distinct processes, i.e. equilibration between the five- and four-coordinate species (B ↔ C) and distal coordination of amino acid side chains (B ↔ E and C ↔ F). Perhaps equilibration of five- and four-coordinate overlaps with binding of Met in the 2-µs process (25Hagen S.J. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 2352-2365Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and binding of a distal His corresponds to the 40- to 70-µs one (3Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Chan C.K. Luck S.D. Bhuyan A. Roder H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); alternatively it might be suggested that the B ↔ C equilibration is responsible for the fast CD changes observed by Chen et al. (12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Addition of MeIm results in partial substitution for the proximal His, and the higher MeIm concentration the lower the population of four-coordinate iron attainable in the 2-µs process; this is why MeIm affects both the amplitude of the fast process and the rate of CO recombination. The difference in reactivity between the five- and four-coordinate species (B and C, respectively) is so large that binding of CO would occur preferentially to C even if this was the minority species (by two order of magnitude); thus C never accumulates to a significant extent contrary to D. The interpretation of the fast processes is difficult because of the superimposition with intermediate C of the base elimination pathway; nevertheless the 40-µs transient was observed also by Gray and co-workers (9Telford J.R. Tefkan F.A. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1944-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Pascher T. Chesick J.P. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1996; 271: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) using a different approach, namely the photochemical reduction of unfolded oxidized cyt-c. Since the photochemical reduction method is carried out in the absence of CO and exploits the different stability of the oxidized and reduced cyt-c, one would expect that the four-, five-, and six-coordinate species remain at equilibrium throughout the reaction time course; this lends support to the 40- to 70-µs intermediate representing a true folding species, also consistent with ultra-rapid mixing experiments (28Chan C.K. Hu Y. Takahashi S. Rousseau D.L. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with our hypothesis that the experiments carried out by photochemical reduction display a simpler time course (2Telford J.R. Wittung-Stafshede P. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 755-763Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally we may speculate that the four-coordinate species, present together with the five-coordinate one but very reactive toward CO, may play some role in the folding process by coordinating rapidly Met or His on the distal site before the proximal His (species F in Scheme 3). In this respect it is relevant that the five-coordinate heme reacts quite slowly with Im (k = 3.9 × 106m−1 s−1), thus suggesting that the rapid coordination events ascribed to distal residues in cyt-c (Scheme 1) may take advantage of the presence of even a small amount of the highly reactive four-coordinate species. Indeed if it were not so, the reactivity of the imidazole residue of His in the unfolded protein would have to be incredibly high. We conclude that a very significant fraction of the intermediates observed upon photolysis of cyt-c–CO under unfolding conditions (in Gdn or urea), may be accounted for by a six-coordinate species postulated to be: (H2O)-Fe–CO and populatedvia a four-coordinate species. This explains why so little fluorescence or CD evidence for the collapse of the polypeptide chain was recorded after photolysis of CO (12Chen E. Wood M.J. Fink A.L. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Chan C.K. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Science. 1996; 274: 628-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) despite the large absorbance changes and warns against the use of this approach in the absence of accurate controls that take into account the contribution of the intermediates linked to the base elimination CO rebinding pathway. We thank Profs. F. Cutruzzolà, W. A. Eaton, and S. Hagen for critically reading the manuscript and offering relevant suggestions."

Upon starvation, the unicellular amoebae undergo a simple developmental cycle that involves chemotaxis, cell differentiation, the formation of multicellular structures, and the terminal formation of fruiting bodies that carry spores. Growth phase cells very effectively take up bacteria and nutrients from the medium by phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. Actin-binding proteins like coronin, profilin, or motor molecules of the myosin I class have been shown to be involved in both processes (1Noegel A.A. Luna J.E. Experientia (Basel). 1995; 51: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After particles or fluid are ingested by the amoebae, hydrolase-rich lysosomes are fused with the newly formed phagosomes or macropinosomes. The endosomal and phagosomal pathways in D. discoideum have been the object of thorough investigation over the last decade, so many of the key proteins have been identified, e.g. small GTPases (2Seastone D.J.

The lipid and protein composition of several vesicular compartments involved in these pathways have been characterized (6Nolta K.V. Padh H. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

The first characterized Dictyostelium protein with homology to the mammalian CD36/LIMPII superfamily (LIMPII1 for lysosomal integral membrane protein II; Ref. 8Calvo D. Dopazo J. Vega M.A. Genomics. 1995; 25: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was DdLIMP (LmpA; Ref. 9Karakesisoglou I. Janssen K.-P. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This gene family consists of cell adhesion molecules, fatty acid transporters, and scavenger receptors at the cell surface as well as lysosomal membrane proteins; its members are ubiquitously present in the animal kingdom from mammals to nematodes but are apparently missing in yeast. The lmpA gene had been identified in a screen for suppressors of the profilin-minus phenotype in our laboratory. Profilin is a small cytoplasmic protein that can bind to actin monomers (10Carlsson L. Nystrom L.E. Sundkvist I. Markey F. Lindberg U. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 465-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and regulate actin polymerization; it is also believed to play a role in vesicle transport (11Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. DiNardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been well established that rapid actin polymerization and depolymerization is necessary for the endocytic process (12Wendland B. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, profilin-minus mutants showed defects in endosomal trafficking (13Temesvari L. Zhang L. Fodera B. Janssen K.-P. Schleicher M. Cardelli J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2019-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). LmpA was found to be an integral membrane glycoprotein that is localized to the membranes of endolysosomal vesicles and macropinosomes (9Karakesisoglou I. Janssen K.-P. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2019-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The higher eukaryote homologues of the CD36/LIMPII family as well as LmpA share a common “hairpin” topology with two transmembrane domains, one hydrophobic signal anchor near the NH2 terminus and another hydrophobic sequence close to the COOH terminus (8Calvo D. Dopazo J. Vega M.A. Genomics. 1995; 25: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both termini are cytosolic, whereas the central domain in between the transmembrane domains is generally heavily glycosylated and localizes to the lumen of vesicles or to the cell surface.

The class B scavenger receptor SRBI belongs to the same superfamily, it also functions as a lipid receptor; however, the uptake mechanism is fundamentally different from that of CD36. SRBI was identified as the long sought high density lipoprotein receptor by a knock-out approach in mice (22Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SRBI binds to phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine liposomes with a specificity that closely resembles that of CD36 (20Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The CD36 gene from rat, also known as fatty-acid translocase, has been implicated in fatty acid metabolism and insulin resistance (23Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D. Norsworthy P.J. Wahid F.N. Al-Majali K.M. Trembling P.M. Mann C.J. Shoulders C.C. Graf D. St Lezin E. Kurtz T.W. Kren V. Pravenec M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that DdLIMP from Dictyosteliumspecifically binds to the anionic phospholipid PIP2, but not to phosphatidylcholine and only weakly to phosphatidylserine. The binding is thought to be mediated by the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal tail of DdLIMP (9Karakesisoglou I. Janssen K.-P. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The majority of the CD36/LIMPII proteins is localized to the plasma membrane, whereas LIMPII, which is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types tested so far, has been found in vesicles of endolysosomal origin (24Vega M.A. Segui-Real B. Alcalde Garcia J. Calés C. Rodriguez F. Vandekerckhove F.J. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16818-16824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific sorting of LIMPII to lysosomes has been demonstrated to be accomplished by an interaction of its lysosomal sorting signal (di-leucine type) with the adaptor complex AP-3 (25Hoening S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of mammalian LIMPII is still unknown; it has been postulated to be responsible for the uptake of hydrolytic products from the lysosomes to the cytoplasm (24Vega M.A. Segui-Real B. Alcalde Garcia J. Calés C. Rodriguez F. Vandekerckhove F.J. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16818-16824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No physiological ligands have been demonstrated for LIMPII so far; however, it has been shown that LIMPII binds in vitro to peptides derived from the extracellular matrix component thrombospondin-1, and the binding is mediated by a domain that is conserved between CD36 and LIMPII (26Crombie R. Silverstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4855-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The newly discovered CD36/LIMPII homologues that are described in this study show differences in developmental regulation. They exhibit putative sorting signals of the di-leucine or tyrosine type and are located in distinct vesicle populations. D. discoideum strain AX2 (referred to as wild type) and mutant strains were cultivated at 21 °C, either on SM agar plates with Klebsiella aerogenes(27Williams K.L. Newell P.C. Genetics. 1976; 82: 287-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or axenically in liquid nutrient medium (28Claviez M. Pagh K. Maruta H. Baltes W. Fisher P. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) submerged in plastic culture dishes or in shaking suspension at 150 rpm. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, if not stated otherwise. Antibodies against contact site A protein (mAb 33-294-17), α-l-fucosidase (mAb 173-185-1), and golvesin (mAb 275-392-5) were kindly provided by Dr. G. Gerisch (MPI for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Generation of the polyclonal antisera 3416/3417 against DdLIMP (LmpA) is described elsewhere (9Karakesisoglou I. Janssen K.-P. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For studies on the development of D. discoideum, cells were grown to a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml and washed in phosphate buffer (14.6 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.0), and 2 × 108cells were deposited on phosphate agar plates and allowed to develop at 21 °C. The cells were harvested immediately (t0) or at various time points of starvation. Standard techniques were used for cloning, transformation, and screening (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All vectors encoding either cDNA or genomic fragments for both genes were obtained from the Dictyostelium cDNA sequencing project in Tsukuba, Japan, or the German Dictyostelium genome project in Cologne and Jena (www.uni-koeln.de/dictyostelium/and genome.imb-jena.de/dictyostelium/). The inserts were sequenced several times from both sides with vector- and sequence-specific primers. The missing 5′-end of lmpB was identified by screening a size-fractionated cDNA library (2–4 kb) cloned in λ-ZAP (30Graef R. Daunderer C. Schliwa M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1747-1758PubMed Google Scholar). For screening, a Digoxigenin-labeled probe corresponding to the 5′-end of the genomic clone JAX4b23c10 was prepared by PCR. Out of 4 × 105 primary clones that were tested, 8 were found to contain inserts corresponding to the lmpB cDNA. Phagemids were prepared from the lmpB-positive λ-ZAP phages by in vivo excision with helper phages and sequenced from both sides. One phagemid clone composed the start codon and an in-frame stop codon 12 base pairs upstream. In order to identify putative introns in lmpC, the 5′-region of lmpC was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA isolated from AX2 cells as a template. The resulting fragments were subcloned in pUC19 and sequenced from both sides; two introns could be identified. Polyclonal antisera against LmpB (7656 and 7657) and LmpC (7654 and 7655) were raised by immunizing rabbits (Eurogentec, Ougree, Belgium) with bacterially expressed polypeptides consisting of fragments from the central lumenal domain of both proteins between the two transmembrane regions (hislmpB, amino acids 62–210, predicted molecular mass 17.9 kDa; hislmpC. amino acids 472–622, predicted molecular mass 19.2 kDa). The recombinant proteins carrying an NH2-terminal His6 tag were expressed in Escherichia coli M15 cells (LmpB) or E. coli XL1 Blue cells (LmpC) using a pQE30 (LmpB) or a pQE32 (LmpC) vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and purified from inclusion bodies by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen) in the presence of 7 m urea. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were allowed to attach to coverslips for 30 min in liquid nutrient medium, washed with phosphate buffer, fixed with cold methanol (−20 °C, 10 min), air dried, and subsequently labeled and mounted essentially as described (31DeHostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antisera against LmpB and LmpC were used at dilutions of 1:200 to 1:500. Secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence included goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to fluorescein, Alexa-488, or Cy3 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). As a control for the specificity of the antisera, preimmune sera from all rabbits were tested under the same conditions. In addition, the antisera against LmpB and LmpC were tested on D. discoideum RB2 cells that contain no LmpA (9Karakesisoglou I. Janssen K.-P. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mounted cells were observed in an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Nuclei were stained for 1 h with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) in PBS. The cells were washed in 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-free buffer, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted in gelvatol. For labeling of macropinosomes and endosomes, coverslips to be used were washed with 3.6% HCl followed by distilled water. Exponentially growing Dictyostelium cells were allowed to attach to the coverslip for 15 min at room temperature. After this time the medium was replaced by medium containing 5 mg/ml TRITC-dextran (-Mw 155,000, Sigma) for the desired times. After two short washes in phosphate buffer the cells were either chased with normal medium again or fixed immediately. The cells were routinely fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 15% saturated picric acid and 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.0, but 1% formaldehyde in methanol worked as well. To avoid a subsequent major loss of fixed cells from the coverslips, the cells were treated briefly with 70% ethanol, and then washed with PBS/glycine and PBS/bovine serum albumin/gelatin according to routine procedures. Confocal images for detection of TRITC-dextran vesicles and LmpB/C-specific antibodies were taken with an inverted Leica TCS-SP laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon laser. The Alexa488 label was excited at 488 nm, and the TRITC label was excited at 514 nm. To avoid any artificial bleed through, all data were obtained by a sequential scanning procedure. The samples were observed with a 63× oil immersion objective, and the step sizes were usually between 0.15 and 0.25 µm. Axenically grown cells were harvested, washed in phosphate buffer, and lysed by several passages through a 5-µm Nucleopore (Nucloepore/Costar, Tuebingen, Germany) filter. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in TD buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and treated with 200 µg/ml of trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. For the deglycosylation assays, 100,000 × g pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of 10 µl were diluted 10-fold in PBS containing Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and treated with 0.4 units ofN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 12 h. Axenically grown AX2 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested and washed twice with cold phosphate buffer. The cell pellet was resuspended at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in HEPES buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine, pH 7.4, and the cells were opened by a short ultrasonic pulse and several passages through a 5-µm Nucleopore filter. Complete rupture of cells was controlled by light microscopy. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in a small volume of HEPES buffer with a Dounce homogenizer and loaded on top of a discontinuous sucrose step gradient consisting of 2-ml layers of 0.88, 1.02, 1.17, 1.32, 1.47, and 2.49m sucrose in HEPES buffer (33Weiner O.H. Murphy J. Griffiths G. Schleicher M. Noegel A.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The gradient was subsequently ultracentrifuged for 20 h at 110,000 ×g in a SW40 Beckman swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Instruments, Muenchen, Germany). Fractions from the gradient were unloaded from top to bottom and immediately assayed for enzymatic activity. Equal amounts of protein from the different fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with specific antibodies after immunoblotting. Colorimetric assays for acid or alkaline phosphatase activity were carried out according to Loomis and Kuspa (34Loomis W.F. Kuspa A. Dev. Biol. 1984; 102: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or Loomis (35Loomis W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 417-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate and measured with an Ultrospec III spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA and RNA for Southern and Northern blot analysis were prepared according to Noegelet al. (36Noegel A.A. Welker D.L. Metz B.A. Williams K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and incubated with 32P-labeled probes generated using a random prime labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was performed at 37 °C for 12–16 h in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide and 2× SSC. The blots were washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 37 °C and for 60 min in a buffer containing 50% formamide and 2× SSC at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) followed standard procedures. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), and the bound secondary antibodies were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Determination of protein concentration was done according to Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebraugh N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Compilation of DNA or protein sequences was done with the University of Wisconsin GCG program (University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group, see Refl 39Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Searches for similarities to other protein sequences were done with the program BLAST (40Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) using the combined non-redundant entries of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, Swiss-Prot, PIR, and GenBankTM at the NCBI. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the program package PHYLYP (41Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). By sequence comparison of lmpA with the data base of the cDNA-sequencing project at Tsukuba University (Japan), several cDNA clones with significant homology were found. For the generation of the cDNAs, cells from the D. discoideumstrain AX4 in the developmental finger stage (T12-T14) had been used (42Morio T. Urushihara H. Saito T. Ugawa Y. Mizuno H. Yoshida M. Yoshino R. Mitra B.N. Pi M. Sato T. Takemoto K. Yasukawa H. Williams J. Maeda M. Takeuchi I. Ochiai H. Tanaka Y. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Further comparison with the data base of the GermanDictyostelium Genome Sequencing Project resulted in the identification of additional genomic clones with significant homology to the known sequence of lmpA. Careful analysis showed that the sequences of all different clones were derived from three putative genes, two of them were new. According to the order of their discovery, the new genes have been named lmpB and lmpC, and their gene products LmpB and LmpC, respectively. The insert of clone SSD382 was sequenced several times with standard T3 and T7 primers on both strands. An open reading frame of 951 bases was found, and the deduced gene product showed 34% similarity and 24% identity to the COOH-terminal region of LmpA (GAP program, University of Wisconsin GCG package). The open reading frame ended with a TAA stop codon, the most frequently found termination codon in D. discoideum (43Sharp P.M. Devine K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5029-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), followed by a polyadenylation signal and several other stop codons. Whereas the 5′-end was missing in this cDNA clone, it was found to overlap with two genomic clones, JAX4b23c10 and JAX4a28b05. In the genomic clones, a short single intron with canonic splice sequences 5′-GTXXGT( …) AG-3′ was present. The small size (109 bases) of the intron and the extremely high AT content of 95% are typical for Dictyostelium introns. Comparison with homologous proteins showed that a small part of the 5′-coding sequence (including the start codon and the putative first transmembrane domain) was still missing. By screening of a size-fractionated cDNA library (30Graef R. Daunderer C. Schliwa M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1747-1758PubMed Google Scholar) with a probe corresponding to the 5′-end of the genomic clone JAX4b23c10, 8 clones out of 4 × 105 primary clones were found to contain partial inserts of the lmpB cDNA. Phagemids were prepared from thelmpB-positive λ-ZAP phages by in vivo excision with helper phages and sequenced from both sides with T3 and T7 primers as well as lmpB sequence-specific primers. One phagemid clone (E2.1) that showed a complete overlap with the genomic clone JAX4b23c10 was found to consist of the start codon together with an adenine-rich upstream sequence (AAA ATG) that is apparently necessary for stable expression of proteins in D. discoideum (44Kimmel A.R. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as an in-frame stop codon 12 bases upstream of the ATG. The completed open reading frames of lmpB and lmpC encode putative proteins of 756 and 783 amino acids, respectively. Analysis with the transmembrane prediction program TM-Predict (45Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) revealed for both proteins two potential transmembrane domains, one very close to the NH2 terminus and another one close to the COOH terminus. In LmpB, eight consensus sites forN-glycosylation (NX(S/T)) were present, and by computer prediction (46Gupta R. Jung E. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Hansen J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a single putative O-glycosylation site was found in a serine/threonine-rich motif (TSTSSST, at amino acid 223). The predicted cytosolic COOH-terminal tail consists of only 6 amino acids and is considerably shorter than the corresponding region in LmpA. Interestingly, there is an Ile-Ile sequence in this region that resembles the lysosomal sorting signal of the di-leucine type from mammalian LIMPII (Fig. 1A). Complete sequencing of the second lmpA homologous cDNA clone (SSE457) showed that the insert of about 2.5 kb contained a complete open reading frame of 783 amino acids coding for a new protein of the DdLIMP family. It partially overlapped (99% identity on the nucleotide level) with the genomic clone JAX4b12d09. By PCR on genomic DNA, two short introns with the correct 5′-GTXXGT( … )AG-3′-splicing sequences were identified. The location of these introns close to the 5′-end of the gene as well as their small size (155 and 61 bases, respectively) and high AT content (85 and 92%) are typical for Dictyostelium. Two in-frame stop codons were located about 50 bases upstream of the start codon; the TAA stop codon was followed by several polyadenylation signals. In the lmpC sequence, 22 consensus sites for N-glycosylation (NX(S/T)) were found in between the two hydrophobic stretches. The predicted cytosolic carboxyl-terminal tail consists of a putative lysosomal sorting signal of the tyrosine type (GYNII) that resembles the lysosomal sorting signal of LmpA (GYQAI) but differs from the di-leucine-type motif in the corresponding region of LmpB (Fig.1B). Fig. 2Bschematically depicts the domain organization of theDictyostelium Lmp family proteins in comparison to rat LIMPII.Figure 2Phylogenetic analysis of the CD36/LIMPII superfamily.A, the phylogenetic tree was computed using the PHYLYP program package, according to the least squares and Fitch-Margoliash method.

https://openalex.org/W1977308240,"Abstract Interstrand cross-links at T(A/T)4A sites in cellular DNA are associated with hypercytotoxicity of an anticancer drug, bizelesin. Here we evaluated whether these lethal effects reflect targeting critical genomic regions. An in silico analysis of human sequences showed that T(A/T)4A motifs are on average scarce and scattered. However, significantly higher local motif densities were identified in distinct minisatellite regions (200–1000 base pairs of ∼85–100% AT), herein referred to as “AT islands.” Experimentally detected bizelesin lesions agree with these in silico predictions. Actual bizelesin adducts clustered within the model AT island naked DNA, whereas motif-poor sequences were only sparsely adducted. In cancer cells, bizelesin produced high levels of lesions (∼4.7–7.1 lesions/kilobase pair/μm drug) in several prominent AT islands, compared with markedly lower lesion levels in several motif-poor loci and in bulk cellular DNA (∼0.8–1.3 and ∼0.9 lesions/kilobase pair/μm drug, respectively). The identified AT islands exhibit sequence attributes of matrix attachment regions (MARs), domains that organize DNA loops on the nuclear matrix. The computed “MAR potential” and propensity for supercoiling-induced duplex destabilization (both predictive of strong MARs) correlate with the total number of bizelesin binding sites. Hence, MAR-like AT-rich non-coding domains can be regarded as a novel class of critical targets for anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2129693652,"The M13 procoat protein serves as the paradigm for the Sec-independent membrane insertion pathway. This protein is inserted into the inner membrane of Escherichia coli with two hydrophobic regions and a central periplasmic loop region of 20 amino acid residues. Extension of the periplasmic loop region renders M13 procoat membrane insertion Sec-dependent. Loop regions with 118 or more residues required SecA and SecYEG and were efficiently translocated in vivo. Two mutants having loop regions of 80 and 100 residues, respectively, interacted with SecA but failed to activate the membrane translocation ATPase of SecA in vitro. Similarly, a procoat mutant with two additional glutamyl residues in the loop region showed binding to SecA but did not stimulate the ATPase. The three mutants were also defective for precursor-stimulated binding of SecA to the membrane surface. Remarkably, the mutant proteins act as competitive inhibitors of the Sec translocase. This suggests that the region to be translocated is sensed by SecA but the activation of the SecA translocation ATPase is only successful for substrates with a minimum length of the translocated region.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and an integral translocase complex (3Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Economou A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 315-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The energy-utilizing subunit SecA binds the precursor protein in the cytoplasm or at the membrane surface and hands over sequential portions of the precursor protein chain to the SecYEG complex (5Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One question is how SecA recognizes the precursor protein as a protein to translocate. Previous studies have shown that SecA recognizes parts of the leader and the mature sequence of the precursor proOmpA (6Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A region to which preproteins were cross-linked has been localized to the central part of SecA (7Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, during the translocation reaction, the moving preprotein might be bound to additional binding sites within SecA and SecY along the interior of the translocase complex (5Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Small membrane proteins, such as the M13 procoat protein (hereafter “procoat”) of 73 amino acid residues and the Pf3 coat protein of 44 residues, can bypass the preprotein translocase and insert directly into the membrane bilayer (8Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although procoat has a cleavable signal sequence, it neither contacts the signal recognition particle nor SecB in the cytoplasm (10de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mere presence of a signal sequence is not sufficient to control the interaction with the components of the translocation pathway. In addition, membrane insertion and cleavage of procoat is not affected at the nonpermissive temperature in a secAts51 strain (11Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Procoat insertion also occurs in a temperature-sensitive secY tsstrain and in a SecE depletion strain (10de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How do the small coat proteins then insert into the membrane without contacting the translocase? It has been suggested that the small membrane proteins insert into the cytoplasmic membrane spontaneously, because they do this readily in vitro with artificial liposomes (9Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Thiaudiere E. Soekarjo M. Kuchinka E. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12186-12196Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, recent results show that procoat requires the YidC protein for efficient membrane insertion (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Philips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). YidC might therefore operate independently of the Sec translocase to insert small membrane proteins as is the case for Oxa-1, the mitochondrial homologue of YidC (14Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). There have been M13 procoat mutants isolated that use the preprotein translocase pathway. They have an extension in the periplasmic region, the region that is actually translocated (15Kuhn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One additionalsec-dependent mutant was found in which the periplasmic region was extended by only two glutamic acid residues after position +2 in the mature region (16Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Exchange of the hydrophobic anchor region of the M13 procoat region with the more hydrophobic region of leader peptidase also provoked the requirement of translocase (10de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In conclusion, features of the mature region of M13 procoat determine its mode of insertion. How is it then decided whether the preprotein contacts the translocase components and activates the enzymatic function? To address this question we investigated whether thesec-independent mutant proteins actually do not contact SecA or whether they just cannot stimulate the translocation ATPase. Three different phenotypes were observed. First were procoat mutants that bind to SecA and activate the translocation ATPase, representing a Sec-dependent phenotype. Second were mutants that interact with SecA but do not activate the ATPase; these mutants appeared as indecisive between the two translocation modes and were slowly translocated. Third were the Sec-independent proteins that do not bind to SecA at all. We conclude that SecA binds substrates in different modes and that only a subset of the substrates can efficiently start the translocation motor.

Chem. 1980; 255: 27-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were described. Plasmids pJQ8-H5E and pJQ8-H5EE were constructed from pQN8–4PC-lep and pQN8–5PC-lep (16Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), respectively, by ligation of aPstI restriction fragment. The pQN828 derivatives coding for the various procoat-OmpA hybrid proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (16Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cultures of MC4100 with the respective plasmid were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% fructose and 20 μg/ml each amino acid except methionine. The cells were induced with 0.5% arabinose for 5 min, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for the indicated times, and chased with excessl-methionine. For translocation experiments, the cells were converted to spheroplasts and treated with 1 mg/ml protease as described elsewhere (16Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The precursor proteins were expressed in a coupled transcription-translation system as described by Müller and Blobel (37Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with modifications. The cell free extracts were prepared from strain MM66 (secAts) shifted to the nonpermissive temperature for 2 h. Residual SecA was removed from the extract by immunodepletion with SecA antibody coupled toStaphylococcus aureus protein A (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunodepletion of the cell extract was performed for 2 h at 4 °C. For in vitro binding studies, purified SecA was added back to the depleted extracts with a final concentration in the translation mixture of 0.4 μg/ml. Controls received translocation buffer only. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the in vitro samples with SecA antibody coupled to Pierce UltraLink protein A in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),1 0.1% Tween for 15 min at room temperature after translation had been completed. The coupling matrix was washed twice with PBS-Tween and prepared for SDS-PAGE by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Translation products were separated on 22% acrylamide-SDS gels containing urea and visualized on a Fuji phosphorimaging device. Quantitation of the data was performed using AIDA software (Raytest). As a control for nonspecific background, samples were treated with Pierce UltraLink not coupled to an antibody. The respective values were subtracted from the values for SecA antibody-containing samples. Co-immunoprecipitation was evaluated by calculating the percentage of precipitable translation product with respect to the amount of totally synthesized precursor protein. SecA was purified from the overproducing strain E. coli HB101/pMAN (34Kawasaki H. Matsuyama S. Sasaki S. Akita M. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as described previously (35Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by P11 phosphocellulose chromatography and Sephacryl S200 gel filtration. Purified SecA was stored at −80 °C in translocation buffer (50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. C-terminal His-tagged M13 procoat H5, procoat H5E, and procoat H5EE were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The overproducing E. coli HB101 with the respective pJQ plasmid was grown in LB medium induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA600 = 0.6, and the culture was continued for 3 h. The cells were collected and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% sucrose (1 ml/g cells). For lysis 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme was added for 1 h on ice, and 0.2 mg/ml DNase was added with 5 mm MgCl2 for another 30 min on ice. Cell membranes were collected (40 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 10 mm triethanolamine, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. After centrifugation (40 000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C) the pellets were solubilized in 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1% sodiumN-lauroyl sarcosine (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH), 10% glycerol and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (0.25 ml bed volume/liter of culture) for 2 h at 4 °C. After preparing the column for chromatography, the agarose was washed with 6 column volumes of buffer I (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosine (1 ml/min) and equilibrated with 5 column volumes of buffer I containing 5 mm imidazole (Sigma). The proteins were eluted by steps of 2 column volumes of buffer I each containing 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm imidazole, respectively, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The procoat proteins were dialyzed overnight against 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Procoat-OmpA hybrid proteins were isolated from inclusion bodies. The overproducing E. coli HB101 with the respective pQN plasmid was induced with 1% arabinose at A600 = 0.8 for 3 h. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose (1 ml/g cells) and were broken by 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme and sonication. The pH was increased by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.4 mg/ml DNase was added with 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). After centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) the pellet was solubilized in 4 ml/g cells of buffer S (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and homogenized in 4 ml/g cells of buffer S until the supernatant was clear. The pellet was resuspended in ∼10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and centrifuged as before. The inclusion bodies were resuspended in 6 m urea, 2% sodiumN-lauroyl sarcosine, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. For further purification of the preproteins, the proteins were trichloroacetic acid (15%)-precipitated, washed with acetone, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were applied on a preparative SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, 5-cm 15% separating gel). After elution of the dye, 4 ml of fractions were collected and analyzed by 19% SDS-PAGE containing 5 m urea and Western blotting with antibodies to M13 and to OmpA. The procoat-OmpA hybrid proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, washed by acetone, and resolved in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. ProOmpA was isolated from inclusion bodies as described (36Crooke E. Brundage L. Rice M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1831-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and further purified by MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography (19Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a standard. The purity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue R250. ATPase activity reactions (50 μl) contained 1 mm ATP (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml BSA (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 20 μg/ml SecA, 40 μg/ml preprotein, and 100 μg/ml urea-treated inner membrane vesicles (U-INV) in translocation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). INVs were prepared as described elsewhere (37Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) from E. coli strains KM9, HB101/pHASecYEG, or MRE600, respectively. U-INVs were prepared from MRE600 vesicles and treated with 6 m urea (30 min on ice) to remove membrane-bound SecA as described (35Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). After the components were mixed, the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The release of phosphate was measured colorimetrically by the malachite green reaction at A640 nm as described (6Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Resonant mirror spectroscopy was carried out using the IAsys system (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) at 25 °C as described previously (29Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cuvettes (hydroxy surface) were coated with lipids in the presence of 1.25%n-octyl-β-glucoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) in PBS, pH 7.4. The buffer was removed, and 50 μl of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma, 2 mg/ml) inn-octyl-β-glucoside/PBS were applied to the cuvette. After saturation of lipid binding, PBS (3 × 50 μl) was added directly. Binding of the proteins was measured in 100 μl of translocation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA to saturation, and the cuvette was regenerated (by the addition of 5 murea for 1 min and washing several times with translocation buffer). The binding rate was calculated from the response [°arc s] during the first 100 s. To investigate the features of a preprotein that are necessary to interact functionally with the translocase, hybrid proteins between the sec-dependent proOmpA protein and the sec-independent M13 procoat protein were constructed. Between the leader sequence and the mature part of procoat, OmpA sequences of different lengths were inserted (Fig.1). These hybrid proteins were termed pro20coat, pro40coat, pro60coat, pro80coat, and pro98coat, where the number refers to the additional amino acid residues inserted. The previously studied procoat828, which has a 174-residues insertion (15Kuhn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and procoat H5E and H5EE, which have 1 or 2 additional glutamic acid residues in the early mature region, respectively, were also included in this study. Similar mutants to H5E and H5EE, procoat-lep(−4) and (−5), two procoat leader peptidase fusion proteins, have previously been studied (16Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The participation of SecA in the membrane insertion of the procoat mutant proteins was first investigated in a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 2). Prior to pulse labeling (90 s), SecA was inactivated by 2 mm sodium azide for one set of experiments (lanes 6–10). [35S]Methionine was added for 1 min, and the samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation to M13 coat and OmpA followed by SDS-PAGE. Pro60coat (lane 2) was cleaved efficiently by leader peptidase during the pulse period, which indicates a rapid membrane insertion of the protein. If the cells were pretreated with sodium azide, the cleavage to the mature form was strongly inhibited (lane 7). Similar results were observed for the proOmpA protein in each case and also for the mutants procoat828 and pro98coat (data not shown). Pro80coat was cleaved to the mature form inefficiently in the absence of azide (lane 1). In the presence of azide, however, cleavage to the mature form was completely inhibited (lane 6). The mutant pro40coat was membrane-inserted very inefficiently in the absence or presence of azide (lanes 3 and 8). Finally, the pro20coat and the wild type were membrane-inserted and processed by leader peptidase regardless of whether the cells had been treated by sodium azide (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10). To study whether the membrane insertion of the procoat mutants depends on SecB the translocation kinetics were analyzed in thesecBnull strain, CK1953 (Fig.3). The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 s and chased for 1 and 5 min by the addition of 200 μg/ml cold l-methionine. Whereas proOmpA showed a remarkable retardation of processing (Fig.3A), M13 procoat (Fig. 3D) and the procoat-OmpA mutants (Fig. 3, B and C) were not affected by the absence of the SecB protein. In conclusion, membrane targeting of the procoat-proOmpA hybrid proteins does not require SecB. Because some of the hybrid proteins were translocated inefficiently, we suspected that they might be trapped within the translocase. To address this possibility, we investigated the translocation of pro60coat and pro80coat in more detail. E. coli cells bearing the respective plasmid were induced to express the mutant procoat protein and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 s. At that time point, most of either preprotein is still unprocessed. The cells were converted to spheroplasts, and proteinase K was added to detect translocation (Fig.4A). Strikingly, a major portion of the precursor protein was digested by the external protease suggesting that it had been translocated across the inner membrane but was not yet cleaved by leader peptidase. A 6.5-kDa proteolytic peptide, termed F1, was recognized by antibodies specific to the M13 coat periplasmic region. The F1 fragment only appeared after a short pulse; at a later chase time, the F1 fragment was not detectable (data not shown). We conclude that the procoat mutants pro60coat and pro80coat are partially translocated and proteolytically digested in the OmpA-derived portion of the proteins. However, the adjacent hydrophilic portion of the protein, including the region recognized by the M13 antibody, is protected from the protease. In addition, the leader peptidase has no access to the partially translocated intermediate. The F1 peptide of pro80coat was also generated when the cells had been treated with azide prior to labeling (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). In the azide-treated cells, cleavage by leader peptidase was totally inhibited, whereas the formation of the F1 peptide was unaffected. Based on these results, we conclude that the N-terminal part of the precursor protein may be trapped in the translocase and is not released for processing by the leader peptidase, whereas a region C-terminal to the signal sequence is translocated in a Sec-independent manner. To determine the translocation defect of the mutant proteins in more detail, the precursor proteins were purified and their membrane insertion was analyzed in vitro. Binding of SecA to a lipid monolayer is modulated by nucleotides (18Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte-Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We used this feature of SecA to investigate the interaction of the mutant precursor proteins with SecA. Binding of SecA to a dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine surface was analyzed by resonant mirror spectroscopy. Increased binding of SecA to the lipid surface was observed in the presence of proOmpA and ADP (Fig. 5). Similarly, the purifiedsec-dependent pro98coat protein stimulated SecA binding, whereas the sec-independent procoat H5 and the mutant proteins pro60coat and H5EE did not stimulate the binding of SecA to the lipid surface. Procoat mutants H5, H5E, and H5EE have a mutation at −3, Ser to Phe, that prevents cleavage by leader peptidase (17Kuhn A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15907-15913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore allows the isolation of the precursor proteins. H5E and H5EE have a further mutation in the mature region at +2 that codes for one or two additional Glu residues, respectively. The ATPase activity of SecA stimulated by binding of the precursor protein SecYEG and negatively charged lipids is referred to as the translocation ATPase (19Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The various M13 procoat mutants were tested for stimulation of the translocation ATPase activity. Purified SecA protein was preincubated with U-INVs, and purified precursor protein was added. The release of inorganic phosphate was measured photometrically at A640 nm after the addition of the malachite green reagent. ProOmpA, procoat 828, and pro98coat efficiently stimulated the ATPase activity (Fig.6A). Pro80coat and pro60coat showed little stimulation, whereas pro40coat, H5, H5E, and H5EE showed no stimulation. Quantitative evaluation revealed that the translocation ATPase stimulation by proOmpA was considerably higher than for the procoat 828 and pro98coat, with an apparentKm of 0.26 μm (Fig.6C). SecA binding was first examined in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig.7). The precursor proteins were expressedin vitro in a SecA-depleted extract in the absence or presence of purified SecA protein. The amount of precursor bound to SecA was calculated by co-immunoprecipitation with antiserum to SecA. When proOmpA, pro80coat, and pro60coat were expressed, between 25 and 30% of the precursor was found bound to the SecA protein. Procoat H5 did not bind (about 1.5%), but procoat H5EE showed measurable binding (7%) in this assay. To test whether the precursors interact with SecA in a functional way we used a competition assay. Increasing amounts of purified precursor of procoat H5, H5E, H5EE, pro40coat, pro60coat, and pro80coat were added to SecA and proOmpA and assayed for ATPase activity (Fig.8). The addition of procoat H5, H5E, and pro40coat had no inhibitory effect and, therefore, did not compete with proOmpA for the translocation ATPase. However, H5EE, pro60coat, and pro80coat clearly inhibited the translocation ATPase competitively at higher concentrations, suggesting that the precursor proteins bind to SecA at the same site as proOmpA. Newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins can participate in a number of possible interactions with other cellular components. To date, the molecular basis of these interactions is still elusive. In the cytoplasm, molecular chaperones, e.g. SecB, have been shown to bind to precursor proteins and maintain their structural competence for the subsequent translocation event (20Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Alternatively, bacterial membrane proteins use the signal recognition particle complex, SRP, that targets the proteins to SecYEG (2Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). At the membrane, SecA interacts with precursor proteins to sequentially feed them into the SecYEG translocase (5Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To date, it remains unknown as to which features of a precursor protein are recognized by the targeting and translocation components. Early experiments with proOmpA deletion mutants of 68 and 72 amino acids showed an accumulation in the cytoplasm when studied in vivo (21Freudl R. Schwarz H. Degen M. Henning U. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because longer precursor proteins of 123 residues were transported into the periplasm, it was suggested that the precursor protein must have a certain length. To investigate the molecular interactions that direct a preprotein to a Sec-independent or -dependent pathway, we constructed a number of M13 procoat protein mutants that have alterations in the periplasmic region. For mutants that had larger periplasmic regions resulting in loop sizes of more than 80 residues, membrane insertion was inhibited in the presence of azide, a SecA inhibitor (22Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A similar result has been described for inverted leader peptidase (invLep), a protein with a 25-residue periplasmic domain (23von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Extension of the periplasmic loop in this protein to more than 80 residues also clearly led to Sec dependence (24Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, translocation of invLep in a SecE-depleted strain was retarded, suggesting that an interaction with translocase is occurring (10de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, a minimal amount of Sec translocase might be sufficient for invLep membrane insertion, and Sec-translocase may only accelerate the translocation process, but it is not really required for invLep. The requirement of the Sec translocase for protein translocation is analyzed for the most part in deficient mutants or by addition of inhibitors. These systems leading to a loss of function cannot always prove an essential role for a given component. In vitrostudies provide a more direct way to explore the interaction of a precursor protein with components of the translocation pathway. Earlier studies have shown that a 74-amino acid-long proOmpA fragment did not efficiently stimulate the SecA translocation ATPase activity, suggesting that the smaller precursors are no true substrates for SecA (25Bassilana M. Arkowitz R.A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25246-25250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore purified the procoat-OmpA hybrid precursor proteins of different lengths and tested whether they can bind to SecA and activate the translocation ATPase. The M13 procoat mutants that had periplasmic regions extended by 171 or 98 residues, respectively, activated the translocation ATPase in vitro and therefore exhibit a Sec-dependent phenotype. When compared with proOmpA, the apparent Km values of the ATPase were higher, suggesting that the affinity for the translocase increases with the length of the precursor. No activation of the SecA translocase was observed when the periplasmic extension was less than 40 residues. This finding is consistent with the in vivo results that membrane insertion of the mutants pro40coat and pro20coat was not affected by azide. Notably, the efficiency of membrane insertion within this class of mutants was decreased with the increasing length of the periplasmic region. These mutants can be classified as clearly Sec-independent. Surprisingly, we found precursor protein mutants pro60coat, pro80coat, and H5EE that were sensitive to azide for membrane insertion but were incapable of efficiently activating the SecA ATPase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and a competition assay with proOmpA showed that these proteins did actually bind to SecA (Fig. 8). Although effective in binding, these mutants did not induce the enzymatic activity of SecA and were therefore most likely delayed in moving across the membrane. This might also explain their delay in translocation in the presence of azide. Azide has been proposed to inhibit the deinsertion step of SecA (26van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As a result, the translocating protein would remain trapped within the translocase. Analysis of intermediates of pro60coat and pro80coat suggests that these proteins are partially translocated. Whereas a part of the hydrophilic domain was exposed to the periplasm and cleaved by externally added proteinase K, the signal peptide region remained protected from leader peptidase. Also, the part of the hydrophilic region close to the mature anchor was protected from the protease as judged from the size of the proteolytic fragment. Notably, this partial translocation was also observed when the cells had been treated with azide. We conclude that pro80coat, pro60coat, and H5EE bind to SecA but their membrane translocation is retarded because they do not stimulate the translocation ATPase. We anticipate that precursor recognition by SecA is regulated by more than just one recognition site. Additional sites might ensure the coupling of the translocation process with ATP hydrolysis (25Bassilana M. Arkowitz R.A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25246-25250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments with synthetic signal peptides have shown that they bind efficiently to SecA and activate the SecA-ATPase (27Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Wang L. Miller A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10154-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because these substrates have no protein region to translocate, we suspect that for these cases the ATPase activity is uncoupled from protein movement. SecA activation by our substrates with small translocating domains is different. Pro60coat, pro80coat, and also H5EE bind to SecA but do not efficiently activate the ATPase. In contrast to the synthetic signal peptides, they might bind with their mature region, which couples translocation to ATP hydrolysis. Within SecA, a molecular switch regulating the translocation-dependent ATP hydrolysis has been recently localized (IRA1 domain). IRA1 communicates between the N- and C-terminal domains of SecA. Interestingly, mutants in the IRA1 domain uncouple ATP hydrolysis from membrane translocation (29Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We suspect that the mutants H5EE, pro60coat, and pro80coat lack sufficient size to activate the IRA1 domain. Our results also show that the size of the precursor for functional binding to SecA is not critical. The 75-amino acid-long H5EE protein was a very efficient competitive inhibitor of SecA. Previous data had shown that regions for SecA binding are localized in the signal sequence and in the mature region of precursor proteins (19Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In the signal sequence, the hydrophobic character seems important (10de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Wang L. Miller A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10154-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subtle changes in the region close to the leader peptidase cleavage site also affect the interaction with SecA as shown with the procoat mutants H5E and H5EE (Fig. 7). Obviously, specific features of the substrate protein are required for functional interaction with each component. Shortly after synthesis, membrane and secretory proteins interact with SRP (30Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), GroE (31Laminet A.A. Kumamoto C.A. Pluckthun A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 117-122Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), SecB (20Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and/or SecA to reach the membrane surface. Further studies are necessary to understand the molecular details of recognition. M13 procoat mutants have helped to identify some of these features that allow interaction with SRP (10de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and as shown in this work with SecA. Even small changes in procoat, such as two additional glutamate residues, enhance the binding to SecA. Intriguingly, the simple binding to a component may not be sufficient for optimal use of the respective pathway efficiently. A functional activation is often also necessary. These events impose a multistep quality control to select specific substrates for each pathway. We thank Ross Dalbey and Heng-Yi Zhu for providing the clones of the procoat-OmpA hybrid mutants."

As with other members of theParamyxoviridae, infection by RSV involves attachment to host cells followed by fusion of the lipid bilayers of the viral membrane envelope and the cell plasma membrane (6Choppin P.W. Scheid A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1980; 2: 40-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Morrison T. Portner A. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 347-382Crossref Google Scholar). All members of the Paramyxoviridae have type I integral membrane glycoproteins with structural and functional homology that mediate membrane fusion (6Choppin P.W. Scheid A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1980; 2: 40-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Morrison T. Portner A. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 347-382Crossref Google Scholar). However, the structural and functional features of the type II membrane glycoproteins that mediate attachment vary considerably between genera (2Collins P.L. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 103-162Crossref Google Scholar, 3Collins P.L. McIntosh K. Chanock R.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1313-1351Google Scholar, 6Choppin P.W.

Attachment proteins of the Respirovirus (e.g. Sendai virus) andRubulavirus genera (e.g. mumps virus) have hemagglutinin-neuraminidase attachment proteins that recognize sialylated glycoconjugates on host cell membranes (6Choppin P.W. Scheid A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1980; 2: 40-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Morrison T. Portner A. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 347-382Crossref Google Scholar, 9Markwell M.A. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 407-425Crossref Google Scholar). By comparison, attachment proteins of the Morbillivirus genus, for example, measles virus, hemagglutinate but generally lack neuraminidase activity (6Choppin P.W. Scheid A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1980; 2: 40-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Morrison T. Portner A. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 347-382Crossref Google Scholar). Measles virus apparently utilizes CD46 in the process of cell recognition and attachment (10Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RSV also has a type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is believed to mediate attachment (11Levine S. Klaiber-Franco R. Paradiso P.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2521-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Walsh E.E. Schlesinger J.J. Brandriss M.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but it lacks hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities (13Richman A.V. Pedeira F.A. Tauraso N.M. Appl. Microbiol. 1971; 21: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pneumovirus attachment proteins are also remarkable because of their high carbohydrate content, which has resulted in them being termed G proteins (2Collins P.L. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 103-162Crossref Google Scholar, 3Collins P.L. McIntosh K. Chanock R.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed.

However, the term RSV attachment glycoprotein will be used herein to distinguish this viral glycoprotein from cellular G proteins. The RSV attachment glycoprotein consists of several domains (Fig.1) with a short N-terminal domain located inside the viral membrane, a transmembrane domain, and a comparatively large ectodomain (2Collins P.L.

The ectodomain has a central subdomain that lacks any oligosaccharides (21Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Speelman D. Mills J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and is flanked by two larger subdomains to which abundant oligosaccharide side chains are linked (2Collins P.L.

A subsequent molecular dynamics simulation study (48Langedijk J.P.M. de Groot B.L. Berendsen J.C. van Oirschot J.T. Virology. 1998; 243: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggested a specific S-shaped loop structure for the N-terminal portion of the BRSV subdomain. This arrangement of an S-shaped N-terminal portion followed by a cystine noose is reminiscent of the structure of the fourth domain of the 55-kDa human tumor necrosis factor receptor (HTNFr) (48Langedijk J.P.M. de Groot B.L. Berendsen J.C. van Oirschot J.T. Virology. 1998; 243: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The present report provides direct experimental evidence that the nonglycosylated central subdomain of the RSV attachment glycoprotein functions as a ligand for cellular receptors for RSV. In particular, the HRSV subdomain inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) of HRSV on HEp-2 cells. NMR analyses demonstrated that the cystine noose located in the C-terminal portion of the HRSV attachment glycoprotein subdomain has a very similar conformation to the BRSV attachment glycoprotein cystine noose. Surprisingly, the N-terminal portion of the HRSV subdomain was also found to adopt a defined conformation. The capacity to inhibit CPE was mapped to the N-terminal portion of HRSV attachment glycoprotein nonglycosylated central subdomain, and essential residues for this activity have been identified. These core residues serve to stabilize the conformation of the N-terminal portion of the nonglycosylated central subdomain of the HRSV attachment glycoprotein. The present findings represent a promising platform for the development of antiviral agents for RSV. Peptides were synthesized using the solid-phase Fmoc (fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) approach (50Kates S.A. Albericio F. Solid Phase Synthesis: A Practical Guide. Marcel Dekker, New York2000Google Scholar) by Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). Unless otherwise stated, the nomenclature Gx-y indicates a peptide spanning residuesx to y of the attachment glycoprotein of the A2 strain of HRSV with Nα- and Cα-terminal acetyl and carboxamide derivatives, respectively. Molecular weights of purified peptides were determined by electrospray ionization on a PE-Sciex API-100 mass spectrometer and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization on a Bruker Reflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer (21Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Speelman D. Mills J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analysis of metastable ions produced by postsource decay was used to confirm the disulfide bond configurations of purified cystine noose-containing peptides (21Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Speelman D. Mills J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Serial 2-fold dilutions of peptides were prepared in triplicate in 50 µl of growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12; ICN) containing 7% fetal calf serum (CSL), penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and fungizone (Squibb) in 96-well tissue culture plates. Approximately 1–2 × 104 HEp-2 cells were added in 50 µl of growth medium/well. Peptides and cells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Approximately 10 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) of the A2 strain of HRSV was then added to two series of the diluted peptides in an additional 10 µl of growth medium. Growth medium alone was added to one dilution series of each peptide for toxicity controls. Plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 °C, fixed in 1% formalin/saline, and stained with 0.05% neutral red to detect remaining viable cells. The IC50 cited for a peptide was the concentration of the peptide required to protect 50% of cells from a level of virus that would have been cytopathic to all cells in the absence of an antiviral effector. In the presence of substantial protection, the entire well area stained red, at 50% protection, 50% of the well area stained red, and in the absence of protection, the wells appeared clear. IC50 values are only presented for concentrations of peptides that did not diminish cell staining in the absence of virus. Ribavirin and G149–177 were routinely incorporated into assays as a positive antiviral control and an internal standard, respectively. Samples were prepared for NMR by dissolving 5 mg of peptide in 0.55 ml of 10%2H2O/90% H2O. The pH was adjusted with small additions of 0.5 m NaO2H or2HCl, and reported pH values were measured at room temperature and were not corrected for isotope or solvent effects.1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0 ppm via the chemical shift of the H2O resonance (51Wishart D.S.

Spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer. Unless stated otherwise, all spectra were recorded in 90% H2O/10%2H2O at 277 K and pH 5.0, with probe temperatures calibrated according to a previously published method (52Van Geet A.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 679-680Crossref Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded, structural constraints were determined, and structure calculations were carried out as described previously (53Barnham K.J. Torres A.T. Alewood D. Alewood P.F. Domagala T.

In this report, we found that ERα-ΔAF2, a mutant estrogen receptor α (ERα) deleted for the C-terminal activation function 2 (AF2) core domain, directs estradiol (E2)-dependent repression and impairs E2-induced transactivation by wild type ERα. This repression required coexpressed BRG1 in SW-13 cells that lack BRG1, the ATPase constituent of the chromatin-remodeling SWI·SNF complex, and was abolished by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. We further demonstrated that ERα-ΔAF2 constitutively associates with SMRT but binds DNA in an E2-dependent manner in vivo. These results suggest that ERα-ΔAF2 and similar mutant receptors recently found associated with certain tumors may actively perturb the normal E2 signaling via SWI/SNF, N-CoR/SMRT, and HDAC.

The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. The C terminus of the ligand binding domain of these proteins harbors an essential ligand-dependent transactivation function, activation function 2 (AF2)1 (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

Genetic studies have implicated that transcription coregulators (or cofactors) with no specific DNA binding activity are essential components of transcriptional regulation that ultimately led to the identification of a series of nuclear receptor-interacting coregulatory proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 2Glass C.K.

These proteins appear to function by either remodeling chromatin structures and/or acting as adapter molecules between nuclear receptors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus. Transcriptional coactivators of nuclear receptors include the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) family, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein/p300, p/CAF, thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-associated protein/vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein, activating signal cointegrator-1, activating signal cointegrator-2, and many others (2Glass C.K.

Interestingly unliganded retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and TR bind to their target genes and repress transcription. Silencing mediator of RAR and TR (SMRT) and nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) are known to mediate this repression (2Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W.

SMRT and N-CoR harbor transferable repression domains that associate with histone deacetylases (HDACs), consistent with the concept that histone hypoacetylation correlates with gene repression. SMRT and N-CoR were originally thought to exclusively act as adaptor molecules between target nuclear receptors and the mSin3·HDAC1 complex (5Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A.

Enzymatically active HDAC3 complexes that contained both SMRT and N-CoR were isolated from HeLa nuclei (8Li J. Wang J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J.

N-CoR-1 contained HDAC3, the SWI/SNF-related proteins BRG1, BAF 170, BAF 155, and BAF 47/INI1, and the corepressor KAP-1, whereas N-CoR-2 contained predominantly HDAC1 and HDAC2 as well as several other subunits that are found in the Sin3A complex (5Nagy L.

Steroid hormone receptors do not appear to interact with SMRT/N-CoR in the presence or absence of agonists, whereas both the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor can interact with these corepressors in the presence of their respective antagonists (12Xu J.

Similarly, binding of antagonists or the deletion of the AF2 domain is known to enhance the binding of N-CoR/SMRT to TR and RAR (16Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). There is a large and increasing body of experimental and clinical data supporting the existence of variant ER proteins in both normal and neoplastic estrogen target tissues including human breast (for review, see Ref. 18Murphy L.C. Dotzlaw H. Leygue E. Douglas D. Coutts A. Watson P.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The functions of these variant ER proteins, either physiological or pathological, remain largely unclear. However, possible tissue-specific expression suggests that ER variants may have a role in tissue-specific estrogen action. In particular, ER variants lacking internal exons and representing dominant positive and negative activity may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of endocrine-dependent tumors. Interestingly a series of alterations and/or truncations in exon 8, which contains the AF2 core region, were identified with uterine tumor tissues (19Hu C. Hyder S.M. Needleman D.S. Baker V.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as well as a very aggressive and poorly differentiated form of breast cancer tissues recently isolated from African-American women (20Koduri S. Fuqua S.A. Poola I. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 126: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that a mutant ERα deleted for the C-terminal AF2 core domain (ERα-ΔAF2) directs basal repression and impairs transactivation by wild type ERα, both in an estradiol (E2)-dependent manner, via SWI/SNF, N-CoR/SMRT, and HDAC. Our results suggest that ERα-ΔAF2 and similar receptors associated with certain tumors (19Hu C. Hyder S.M. Needleman D.S. Baker V.V. Mol. Cell.

Polymerase chain reaction fragments encoding ERα-ΔAF2 were inserted into EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites of the LexA fusion vector pEG202PL, the B42 fusion vector pJG4-5, and the mammalian expression/in vitro translation vector pcDNA3. B42 and LexA fusions to the ERα, mammalian expression vectors for SMRT, N-CoR, BRG1, and ERα, the reporter constructs estrogen response element (ERE)-Luc and LexA-β-gal, and the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal were as described previously (10Underhill C.

CV-1 or SW-13 (23Leibovitz A. McCombs W.M. Johnston D. McCoy C.E. Stinson J.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar) cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum. After a 24-h incubation, cells were transfected with 100 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of ERE-Luc reporter gene along with expression vectors for ERα, ERα-ΔAF2, N-CoR, and BRG1. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of pcDNA3 to transfections. Twelve hours later, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 12 h, cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with 0.1 μm of the indicated ligand. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase activity was assayed as described previously (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to the β-galactosidase expression. Consistent results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. The cotransformation and β-galactosidase assays in yeast were performed as described previously (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). For each experiment, at least three independently derived colonies were tested. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). Radiolabeled ERE oligonucleotides were incubated with in vitro translated ERα and ERα-ΔAF2, and the reaction products were analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). ERα and ERα-ΔAF2 were in vitro translated/labeled with [35S]Met, and the digestions were done for 10 min at room temperature with 50 μg/ml trypsin in the presence of the increasing amount of the indicated ligands. The reaction products were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (25Emmas C.E. Fawell S.E. Hoare S.A. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with ERα, ERα-ΔAF2, or SMRT expression vector and treated with E2 or TAM for 1 h. Cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against SMRT (a kind gift of Dr. Dean Edwards at University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) and blotted with monoclonal antibody against ERα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For chromatin immunoprecipitation, soluble chromatin from these cells was prepared and immunoprecipitated with ERα antibody as recently described (26Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The final DNA extractions were amplified using pairs of primers that cover the ERE promoter region. The experiments were repeated at least three times and were highly reproducible. To understand the possible role of variant ERs altered in the AF2-containing exon 8 (19Hu C. Hyder S.M. Needleman D.S. Baker V.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Koduri S. Fuqua S.A. Poola I. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 126: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in tumorigenesis, we constructed a mutant ERα that is deleted for the C-terminal 58 amino acids containing the core AF2 region (i.e. ERα-ΔAF2). Interestingly ERα-ΔAF2 repressed transactivation mediated by the ERE-driven luciferase reporter construct in an E2-dependent manner, whereas the wild type ERα directed E2-dependent transactivation as expected (Fig. 1A). In addition, ERα-ΔAF2 impaired E2-mediated transactivation by the wild type ERα in a dose-dependent and dominant negative fashion (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that ERα-ΔAF2 and similar mutant ERs associated with tumors (19Hu C. Hyder S.M. Needleman D.S. Baker V.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Koduri S. Fuqua S.A. Poola I. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 126: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) may actively perturb the normal E2 signaling within the cell, which may play a role in the possible tumorigenesis by these receptors. To understand how ERα-ΔAF2 achieves this repression, we examined various molecular properties of this mutant receptor. First, LexA fusions to ERα-ΔAF2 and ERα enhanced transactivation mediated by B42 fusions to ERα, ERα-ΔAF2, and ERβ in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig.2A). It was interesting to note that LexA-ERα stimulated transactivation mediated by B42-ERβ even in the absence of ligand. These results clearly demonstrate that ERα-ΔAF2 binds ligands and still retains the ability to dimerize with ERs. Second, ERα-ΔAF2 was found to bind ERE either as a homodimer or heterodimer with ERα as demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 2B). Next we examined the tertiary structure of ERα-ΔAF2 by using a limited proteolysis experiment (25Emmas C.E. Fawell S.E. Hoare S.A. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Two previously described fragments of 31 and 28 kDa (25Emmas C.E. Fawell S.E. Hoare S.A. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as well as a smaller fragment of ∼10 kDa were generated in an E2-dependent manner from the full-length, [35S]Met-labeled ERα when subjected to 50 μg/ml trypsin (Fig. 3A). In contrast, only the 28-kDa fragment was visible when the ER antagonist TAM was used. Interestingly ERα-ΔAF2 produced a pattern similar to ERα/TAM in the presence of either E2 or TAM, producing a fragment of ∼28 kDa. Thus, ERα-ΔAF2, in the presence of either E2 or TAM, may adopt a conformation that resembles that of TAM-bound ERα. From these results along with the results in which N-CoR/SMRT bindings were shown to be enhanced either by antagonists or the deletion of the AF2 domain with TR and RAR (16Horlein A.J. Naar A.M.

To test this idea, 293 cells cotransfected with expression vectors for the full-length ERα and SMRT either in the absence or presence of E2 or TAM were immunoprecipitated with SMRT antibody and probed with an antibody against ERα in Western analysis (Fig. 3B). ERα exhibited TAM-dependent interactions as reported previously (12Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surprisingly, however, ERα-ΔAF2 constitutively interacted with SMRT. Similar results were also obtained with the glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays (results not shown). Overall these results were somewhat similar to the case with mutant TR and RAR deleted for the AF2 domain (16Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 17Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). It is important to note that ERα-ΔAF2 was not capable of binding SRC-1 in the glutathioneS-transferase pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays as expected (results not shown). To further examine whether ERα-ΔAF2 binds ERE in an E2-dependent manner in vivo, as it was recently shown with ERα (26Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, both ERα and ERα-ΔAF2 were recruited to ERE in an E2- or TAM-dependent manner. Taking all of these results together, we suspect that ERα-ΔAF2 constitutively associates with SMRT/N-CoR in solution, and this complex is recruited to ERE in a strictly ligand-dependent manner in vivo, leading to the observed E2-dependent repression (Fig. 1). As expected from this prediction, ERα-ΔAF2 also repressed ERE-dependent transactivation in a TAM-dependent manner (results not shown).Figure 3Constitutive association with SMRT and E2-dependent DNA bindings of ER α-Δ AF2.A, limited proteolyses were executed with radiolabeled ERα and ERα-ΔAF2 as described previously (25Emmas C.E. Fawell S.E. Hoare S.A. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The digestions were done for 10 min at room temperature with 50 μg/ml trypsin in the presence of the increasing amounts of either E2 or TAM (10, 100, and 1000 nm, respectively) (25Emmas C.E. Fawell S.E. Hoare S.A. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Approximately 40% of the total reaction was loaded as input. B, 293T cells transfected with expression vectors for SMRT and either ERα or ERα-ΔAF2 were immunoprecipitated with SMRT monoclonal antibody and blotted against ERα antibody. 100 nm E2 and TAM were used as indicated. I.P., immunoprecipitation;W, Western blot. C, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). 293T cells were transfected with ERα or ERα-ΔAF2 expression vector and treated with 100 nm of the indicated ligand. Soluble chromatin from these cells was prepared and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against ERα as described previously (26Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The final DNA extractions were amplified using pairs of primers that cover the ERE promoter region.

In particular, N-CoR-1 contained HDAC3, the SWI/SNF-related proteins BRG1, BAF 170, BAF 155, and BAF 47/INI1, and the corepressor KAP-1 that is involved in silencing heterochromatin (10Underhill C. Qutob M.S. Yee S.P. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). When we examined the transcriptional properties of ERα and ERα-ΔAF2 in SW-13 cells (23Leibovitz A. McCombs W.M. Johnston D. McCoy C.E. Stinson J.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar) that lack BRG1 and the similar protein hBRM, the -fold repression observed with both receptors was negligible (Fig.4A). However, the previously described TAM-dependent repression by ERα was slightly increased in the presence of cotransfected BRG1 expression vector and synergistically increased when BRG1 was coexpressed with N-CoR (Fig.4A, left). Similarly the E2-dependent repression by ERα-ΔAF2 was also enhanced by cotransfected BRG1 (Fig. 4A,right). As expected, trichostatin A, a HDAC inhibitor, abolished the E2-dependent repression by ERα-ΔAF2 (Fig. 4B). Overall these results suggest that the E2-dependent repression by ERα-ΔAF2 may function through recruitment of a distinct N-CoR complex containing both HDAC and BRG1, such as N-CoR-1 (10Underhill C. Qutob M.S. Yee S.P. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), although other similar complexes yet to be identified may also play a role in this repression. Alternatively multiple N-CoR/SMRT complexes (i.e. BRG1 and non-BRG1 complexes) may function in sequence or combination. The SWI/SNF family of nucleosome-remodeling complexes has been shown to play important roles in gene expression throughout eukaryotes via establishing a local chromatin structure that is permissive for increased access of transcription factors for their binding sites. Notably SWI/SNF is required for both transcriptional activation and repression of some genes. Our results, along with the recent results in which BRG1 was shown to be essential for E2-dependent transactivation of ERs (27DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggest that SWI/SNF is also involved with both activation and repression by ER and mutant ERs such as ERα-ΔAF2. Importantly our results unraveled a novel type of functional transformation in which a specific mutation converted an agonist-dependent transcriptional activator (i.e. ERα) into a potent, agonist-dependent repressor (i.e. ERα-ΔAF2). With regard to this switch of function by mutations, it is interesting to note that resistance to thyroid hormone can result from an aberrant interaction between mutant TRβ1 and N-CoR/SMRT (28Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Takeshita A. Misiti S. Chin W.W. Yen P.M.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1888-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For instance, a natural TRβ1 mutant (G345R) with poor T3 binding affinity, originally isolated from resistance to thyroid hormone, formed a TRβ1·N-CoR complex, both in the absence and presence of T3, but could not form a TRβ1·SRC-1 complex (29Liu Y. Takeshita A. Misiti S. Chin W.W. Yen P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4197-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An artificial TRβ1 mutant, which bound T3 with normal affinity and containing a mutation in the AF2 core region (E457D), had normal interactions with N-CoR but could not bind SRC-1 (29Liu Y. Takeshita A. Misiti S. Chin W.W. Yen P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4197-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly another mutant, TRβ1, derived from resistance to thyroid hormone (L454S), bound T3 and weakly interacted with SRC-1 in the presence of T3 (30Tagami T. Gu W.X. Peairs P.T. West B.L. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1888-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of T3, the L454S mutant interacted much more strongly with N-CoR than did the wild type receptor, and the T3-dependent release of N-CoR was markedly impaired (30Tagami T. Gu W.X. Peairs P.T. West B.L. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1888-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All of these mutants had strong dominant negative activity on wild type TR transactivation (28Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Takeshita A. Misiti S. Chin W.W. Yen P.M.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1888-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly treatment with retinoids is known to induce differentiation of leukemic blast cells and disease remission in patients with promyelocytic leukemia RARα fusion but not from patients with promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-RARα due to the ability of the latter to bind N-CoR much more tightly via a second, retinoid-resistant N-CoR-binding site in the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger N-terminal region (31Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F. Zamir I. Seiser C. Grignani F. Lazar M.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1998; 391: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). As exemplified from these results, it is noted that altered bindings to transcriptional coactivators and corepressors could result in perturbation of the normal cellular signalings and serious diseases. Accordingly both specific mutations and fusions/translocations to other proteins with switched functions are expected to exist with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Finally it will be interesting to test whether ERα-ΔAF2 as well as those mutant ERs associated with tumors (19Hu C. Hyder S.M. Needleman D.S. Baker V.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,20Koduri S. Fuqua S.A. Poola I. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 126: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) can directly cause cancers when ectopically overexpressed in mice. In summary, we found that ERα-ΔAF2 directs E2-dependent repression and impairs E2-mediated transactivation by wild type ERα via N-CoR/SMRT, BRG1, and HDAC. Perturbation of the normal E2signaling by ERα-ΔAF2 and similar mutant receptors associated with tumors (19Hu C. Hyder S.M. Needleman D.S. Baker V.V. Mol. Cell.

Quite a lot, it seems, according to Sonenberg and Newgard in their Perspective.

Loss of this kinase results in destruction of insulin-producing b cells in the pancreas and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis."

CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT)1 belongs to the family of cytidylyltransferases that includes CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (1Park Y.S.

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway leading to the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (3Bladergroen B.A. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GCT catalyzes the conversion of CTP and glycerol-3-phosphate to CDP-glycerol, which then serves as the substrate for synthesis of poly- (glycerol phosphate), a cell wall teichoic acid in a number of Gram-positive bacteria. The GCT used in these studies is the product of the tagD gene ofBacillus subtilis (4Mauel C. Young M. Karamata D. J. Gen.

Alignment of amino acid sequences comprising the catalytic cores of members of this cytidylyltransferase family reveals several residues that are highly conserved (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other properties shared by GCT and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase are relatively high Km values for both substrates and the fact that they are homodimers (6Park Y.S. Sweitzer T.D. Dixon J.E. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16648-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5104-5110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these similarities and the ease of expression and purification of GCT, we have begun to use GCT as a model to study the catalytic mechanism of this group of cytidylyltransferases (6Park Y.S. Sweitzer T.D. Dixon J.E. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16648-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly conserved residues have been mutated, and the effects of the mutations on catalysis have been determined (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recent solution of a crystal structure of GCT with bound CTP has revealed the location of the critical catalytic residues as well as the location of those that appear to be important for structural stabilization (8Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure for residues that interact with the bound CTP shows two highly conserved sequences that appear to be involved in CTP binding. One of these conserved sequence motifs is the HXGH motif, first identified in the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (9Jones M.D. Lowe D.M. Burgford T. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1887-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Delarue M. Moras D. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the two histidines of the HXGH sequence in GCT, His-14 and His-17, resulted in greatly decreased catalytic activity (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, these two histidines are in close proximity to the α and β phosphate oxygens of CTP. The second conserved sequence, the RTEGISTT motif, is a signature sequence of this cytidylyltransferase family (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues is also detrimental to catalysis, and the structure shows that these residues form a loop that has multiple interactions with the bound CTP (8Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a step toward understanding the catalytic mechanism of GCT, we have begun to measure affinities of the enzyme for its substrates. For GCT, one might expect that the Kd values for the substrates would be similar to the respective Kmvalues because for a random order, rapid equilibrium reaction, theKm for a substrate is equal to the dissociation constant for that substrate from the ternary enzyme complex (11Ellis J. Bagshaw C.R. Shaw W.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10806-10813Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Engel P.C. Enzyme Kinetics: The Steady State Approach. 2nd Ed. Chapman & Hall, London1981Crossref Google Scholar). However, if the binding of one substrate to the enzyme affects the binding of the other substrate, then this relationship ofKd to Km would not be expected to hold. The possibility that the Km of GCT for CTP may not be similar to Kd was suggested by finding CTP bound to the active site of crystallized GCT (8Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whereas the procedure used to purify the enzyme used for crystallization involved the use of CTP to elute the enzyme from an affinity matrix, excess free CTP was then removed from the enzyme, and CTP was not included in the crystallization solution. The presence of CTP in the crystal structure therefore suggests that the enzyme has a much higher affinity for CTP than would be indicated by its Km for CTP of about 1- 3 mm (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Park Y.S. Sweitzer T.D. Dixon J.E. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16648-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the use of quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to determine substrate binding affinities. We found that the Kd values for initial binding of each substrate were >1000-fold lower than the Km values. Moreover, the enzyme exhibited negative cooperativity with respect to substrate binding, in that the binding of subsequent substrate molecules occurred with markedly decreasing affinities. However, negative cooperativity of enzyme activity is not observed, implying a mechanism in which catalysis does not occur unless the enzyme is “fully loaded,”i.e. all four substrate molecules are bound to the enzyme dimer. CHAPS, N-acetyl tryptophanamide, CTP, glycerol-3-phosphate, CDP-glycerol, and sodium pyrophosphate were obtained from Sigma. Sequenase v.2, [3H]CTP, and [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. Plasmid pET21b and Escherichia coliHMS 174 (DE3) pLysS were from Novagen. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Construction and characterization of N-terminally His-tagged GCT and site-directed mutants thereof were as described previously (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutants of GCT were expressed in E. coli HMS 174 (DE3) pLysS. The bacterial pellet from 1 liter of culture was frozen at −80 °C overnight and then resuspended in 40 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg of bovine deoxyribonuclease. The resuspended pellet was incubated on ice for 10 min before being centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 1.5 h. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose column, and the protein was purified according to the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen). The eluate was treated with 2 mm EDTA to chelate any residual Ni2+ ions and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The enzyme preparations were essentially homogeneous as assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. About 10–15 mg of purified enzyme were obtained from a 1000-ml culture. The purified enzymes were stored at 4 °C because enzyme activity was lost upon freezing. The protein concentration was estimated routinely by the method of Lowry et al. (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of stoichiometry of binding, the protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis at the University of Michigan protein core on an Applied Biosystems amino acid analyzer. The double mutant was constructed from the pET21b constructs of the single mutants, H14A and D94A (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The original plasmids were cut at the HindIII restriction sites at 140 base pairs in the coding sequence and in the vector after the 3′ stop site. The HindIII fragment containing the D94A mutation was ligated to the plasmid containing the fragment with the H14A mutation. The mutagenic sites were verified in the double mutant by DNA sequencing. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured at a GCT concentration (200 nmdimer or 400 nm monomer) to obtain a fluorescence intensity of about 1 million photons/min at a slit width of 4–5 μm. The protein was excited at 280 or 295 nm in 20 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm CHAPS and 5 mmMgCl2. The CHAPS was included to prevent the protein from binding to the cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 320–380 nm on a Photon Technology Inc. spectrofluorimeter or a Fluoromax II spectrofluorimeter. Aliquots of substrate were sequentially added to the cuvette, and the volume was changed by no more than 1–5% total. The contents of the cuvette were constantly stirred using a magnetic pellet for uniform mixing during the experiment. For each concentration, the spectrum was recorded thrice, and the values were averaged. Control experiments showed no change in fluorescence when buffer was added without substrate, and the extent of fluorescence quenching was the same when a bolus of substrate was added as when small aliquots were added sequentially, indicating that the decrease in fluorescence was not due to protein denaturation over time. Inner filter effects due to the high absorbance of CTP in the excitation range were diminished by use of a short path cuvette (inside width, 4 mm) and the use of 295 nm as the excitation wavelength (14Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis Jr., C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap R.B. Roberts G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,15Chen R.F. Hayes Jr., J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A control experiment was carried out by titratingN-acetyl tryptophanamide solution with CTP at 295 nm. This control showed that there was no inner filter effect up to a concentration of 180 μm CTP. Hence, in all CTP titrations of the enzyme, the highest concentration of CTP used did not exceed 180 μm. The fluorescence quanta obtained at 340 nm were converted to ΔF/ΔFmax. To estimate ΔFmax, a linear plot of 1/ΔF versus 1/S for the highest seven data points was used, with the Y intercept taken as 1/ΔFmax. The ΔF/ΔFmax values were then plotted against Stotal using the software Kaleidagraph (Synergy) and fitted to an equation for a two-site model as the sum of two rectangular hyberbolae, ΔF/ΔFmax = {m1× Sh1/(Kd1 +Sh1)} + {m2 ×Sh2/(Kd2 +Sh2)}, where m1 and m2 are the maximal ΔF/ΔFmax values for site 1 and site 2, respectively. For CTP binding data, the average value for m1 was 0.51 ± 0.1, and the average value form2 was 0.47 ± 0.08. For glycerol-3-phosphate binding, the average value for m1 was 0.58 ± 0.09, and the average value for m2 was 0.44 ± 0.08. The valuesh1 and h2 were Hill-type exponents required to fit the data. The need for these exponents was not clear but was possibly due to energy transfer among tryptophans within the protein. For CTP binding data, the average value for h1 was 1.6 ± 0.8, and the average value for h2 was 1.7 ± 0.8. For glycerol-3-phosphate binding, the average value for h1was 1.2 ± 0.2, and the average value for h2 was 1.3 ± 0.7. The Kd values obtained by fitting against Stotal were then used to estimateSfree by a quadratic equation. The plot of ΔF/ΔFmaxversus Sfree was then used to obtain newKd values. This process was repeated until the new and old Kd values differed by <10%. This iterative process resulted in Kd1 values that differed from those obtained by plotting against Stotal by an average factor of 1.4 ± 0.9 for CTP and 1.1 ± 0.6 for glycerol-3-phosphate. The Kd2 values differed by 1.2 ± 0.4 for CTP and 1.1 ± 0.4 for glycerol-3-phosphate. A binding assay with radioactive CTP or glycerol-3-phosphate was used to measure stoichiometry of binding to the enzyme. GCT protein (4.75 nmol; 15.8 μm) was mixed with 0.4–30 nmol (1–100 μm) of the substrate (CTP mixed with [3H]CTP or glycerol-3-phosphate mixed with [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate as radioactive tracer) in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 6 mmMgCl2. The unbound substrate was separated from the bound substrate by centrifugation in a Microcon-10 microconcentrator (Millipore), and the radioactivity in the filtrate was measured. Care was taken to remove no more than 10% of the total volume by centrifugation. The amount of bound substrate was plotted against free substrate, and the data were fitted to the equation for a rectangular hyperbola. Stoichiometry of binding was also determined by quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. This experiment was carried out with 10 μm GCT protein in otherwise the same conditions as described above for quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the slit width was 2 μm. In this experiment, the concentration of substrate bound was taken to be the concentration at which fluorescence stopped decreasing. Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed as described previously (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that the substrate concentrations were varied from 0.3 μm to 10 mm. The Vmax apparent values for each fixed concentration were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation with Kaleidagraph software (Synergy), and then the Vmax apparent values were plotted as a function of fixed substrate, and these data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain true Vmaxand Km values. To measure the binding of substrates to GCT, the enzyme must be free of the substrate. The purification procedure we use for native GCT, however, involves elution of the enzyme from an affinity matrix with CTP. As mentioned above, enzyme purified by this procedure contains a molecule of CTP at each active site (8Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To purify the substrate-free enzyme, we used His-tagged constructs of wild-type and mutant enzymes. Purification of these enzymes by Ni2+-chelate chromatography does not utilize either substrate. These His-tagged constructs have been characterized previously (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The His-tagged wild-type enzyme exhibits kinetic constants similar to those of non-His-tagged GCT, and the His-tagged wild-type and mutant GCT proteins were shown to retain their tertiary structure by two-dimensional NMR (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). No phosphorus peaks were associated with the His-tagged GCT as indicated by31P NMR spectroscopy, indicating that the enzyme did not contain appreciable quantities of substrates or products. 2E. Schurter and E. R. P. Zuiderweg, unpublished observations. Tryptophan residues in proteins exhibit intrinsic fluorescence with fluorescence maxima between 340 and 350 nm when the protein solution is excited at about 280–300 nm. Change in fluorescence intensities can be monitored as a measure of ligand binding to the protein (16Ward L.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). GCT has three tryptophan residues in its coding sequence, Trp-15, Trp-74, and Trp-95. Trp-15 is located within the nucleotide-binding motif, the 14HWGH sequence. Trp-74 and Trp-95 appear to be near the active site of GCT (8Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the W74A mutation exhibits a 10–25-fold decrease inkcat/Km values (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The proximity of Trp-15, Trp-74, and Trp-95 to the active site suggested that these tryptophan residues might be sensitive to substrate binding, allowing the use of fluorescence quenching or enhancement to measure the affinities of the enzyme for the substrates. Emission spectra for GCT fluorescence are shown in Fig. 1. The spectra were taken for the unliganded enzyme (top curve) and for the enzyme with several levels of glycerol-3-phosphate. It is clear that the addition of this substrate caused an appreciable quenching of fluorescence without a noticeable change in emission maximum. When either CTP or glycerol-3-phosphate was added to wild-type GCT, quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was observed. Plots of fluorescence intensity at 340 nm versus the substrate concentration showed biphasic curves, indicating the existence of two binding sites with distinctly different affinities (Fig. 2). TwoKd values were obtained for the binding of either CTP (0.24 and 38 μm) or glycerol-3-phosphate (0.14 and 22 μm) to GCT (Table I). The lower Kd value will be referred to asKd1, and the higher Kd value will be referred to as Kd2. The Kd1values were more than 1000-fold lower than the Kmfor each of the substrates, and the Kd2 values were about 40–50-fold lower than the Km. Therefore, the substrates do bind to the enzyme with much higher affinities than predicted by the Km values. Moreover, the fact that there are two distinct Kd values indicates that substrate binding is negatively cooperative, i.e. binding to one site decreases the affinity of the other active site for the substrate (17Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 139-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Table IComparison of binding and kinetic constants for GCT wild-type and mutantsConstantsWild-typeD94AH14AH17AD94A/H14AμmCTP Km1-aThe Kmvalues for His-tagged wild-type and mutants are from Ref. 1.1,39093,5001,0301,270n.d.1-bn.d., not determined.CTPKd10.24 ± 0.071-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.10 ± 0.041-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.66 ± 0.261-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.53 ± 0.081-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.05 ± 0.0021-dAverage + range of two determinations.CTPKd238 ± 121-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.136 ± 471-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.3.0 ± 1.41-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.114 ± 471-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.22 ± 41-dAverage + range of two determinations.G3PKm1-aThe Kmvalues for His-tagged wild-type and mutants are from Ref. 1.1,090141,0001,2602,220n.d.G3PKd10.14 ± 0.091-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.23 ± 0.061-dAverage + range of two determinations.0.20 ± 0.111-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.20 ± 0.081-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.0.171-eSingle determination.G3PKd222 ± 141-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.18 ± 71-dAverage + range of two determinations.3.3 ± 1.01-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.39 ± 51-cAverage ± standard deviation from three determinations.251-eSingle determination.CTP, G3PKd32.61-eSingle determination.1810 ± 4601-dAverage + range of two determinations.CTP, G3PKd41,3801-eSingle determination.117,000 ± 15,0001-dAverage + range of two determinations.1-a The Kmvalues for His-tagged wild-type and mutants are from Ref. 1Park Y.S.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the two different binding affinities for each substrate actually corresponded to the two active sites per dimer, it was necessary to determine the stoichiometry of substrate binding. The binding of radioactive substrates individually to GCT was therefore measured by filtration using microconcentrators. Plots of bound substrate versus free substrate revealed that binding leveled off at 1.2 molecules of CTP and 0.84 molecules of glycerol-3-phosphate per active site (Fig.3, A and B). (This experiment does not reveal the very low binding affinity ofKd1 because it utilized a very high enzyme concentration, 16 μm, and was not sufficiently sensitive in the range of Kd1.) The stoichiometry of binding was also determined by tryptophan fluorescence quenching, titrating a high level of enzyme with each substrate, and taking the concentration at which fluorescence stopped decreasing as the maximum bound (Fig. 3,C and D). This experiment confirmed that one substrate bound per monomer. Thus, a total of two molecules of each substrate were binding per dimer. In summary, the binding of either substrate to the enzyme dimer is represented by two distinct affinities, where Kd1 is about 0.1–0.3 μm, and Kd2 is about 20–40 μm. The results presented above indicated that the Km value for either substrate in the GCT reaction is not the same as the Kd of the enzyme for the first substrate to bind. This would predict that those mutant enzymes with defective Km orkcat values might have the sameKd1 values as seen for the wild-type enzyme. It was therefore of interest to determine these binding constants for several mutant enzymes. The D94A mutant was previously shown to have very highKm values for both substrates; theKm values for CTP and glycerol-3-phosphate are about 70- and 130-fold higher, respectively, than those obtained for the wild-type enzyme (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Table I). The kcat value for this mutant is about 5-fold lower than that of the wild-type (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analysis of tryptophan fluorescence quenching for D94A in response to substrate binding (Fig. 4, Aand B) revealed complex substrate binding curves similar to those seen for the wild-type. The Kd values were 0.1 and 140 μm for CTP and 0.2 and 18 μm for glycerol-3-phosphate (Table I). Whereas the Kd2 for CTP for D94A was 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type, it was still about 600-fold lower than the Km of D94A for CTP. The other Kd values for D94A were similar to those seen for wild-type GCT and much lower than the Kmvalues for D94A. His-14 and His-17 in the HWGH sequence motif are implicated in transition state stabilization during catalysis (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mutation of these histidines does not appreciably alter Km but does cause a decrease in kcat for H14A and H17A by factors of 1.8 × 104 and 2.6 × 103, respectively. Because these residues are so close to CTP in the active site, it was of interest to determine whether the Kd values were altered by mutagenesis. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in response to substrate binding was again complex for both H14A (Fig. 4,C and D) and H17A (data not shown). Two binding constants for each substrate were obtained for each mutant (Table I). Although Kd1 and Kd2 were altered somewhat for the two mutants, they were reasonably close to theKd values for the wild-type and considerably lower than the Km values. The results presented above indicated that GCT exhibits negative cooperativity with respect to binding of a single substrate. It was possible that further negative cooperativity existed with respect to binding the other substrate species to the enzyme-substrate complex. It was therefore of interest to follow quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme-CTP complex in response to the addition of glycerol-3-phosphate. This experiment would be impossible to do with wild-type GCT because the catalytic activity observed upon addition of the second substrate species would complicate interpretation of the data. However, the H14A mutant catalyzes the reaction so slowly that turnover would be negligible within the time required for the experiment (1Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S. Schurter E.J. Zuiderweg E.R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15161-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Kd values for binding of a single substrate to H14A were similar to those for wild-type GCT (Table I), thus it was reasonable to expect that theKd values for binding of the second substrate species would be similar for H14A and wild-type. This experiment was performed with GCT to which 100 μmCTP had been added to saturate the two CTP binding sites. Quenching of fluorescence was then followed as glycerol-3-phosphate was added sequentially. The curve obtained for glycerol-3-phosphate binding as the second substrate species was biphasic, showing two binding aff"

Two LCAT glycosylation-deficient mutants, N84Q and N384Q, were constructed, permanently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and purified to determine the effects of deleting individual glycan chains on its stability, structure, and function. These purified mutants were studied by spectroscopic structural methods and enzymatic and binding assays to develop a molecular rationale for the relationship between LCAT glycosylation and activity. The N84Q LCAT mutant did not possess measurable enzymatic activity or interfacial binding affinity for reconstituted high-density lipoproteins. In addition, in thermal and chemical denaturation studies, N84Q LCAT was found to be significantly less stable than wild-type LCAT. The N384Q variant was initially more enzymatically active than wild-type LCAT, but gradually lost activity within months; however, it retained full interfacial binding activity. Significant changes were detected over time by circular dichroism in the α-helical content of N384Q LCAT and in the β-sheet content of N84Q LCAT, compared with wild-type LCAT. Fluorescence measurements with the probe 1-anilinonapthalene-8-sulfonate suggested an alteration of the active site cavity in both mutants. In conclusion, both mutants lost catalytic activity, N84Q shortly after purification and N384Q more gradually, and were destabilized, probably because the deletion of the glycan chains altered local structural elements near the active site cavity and/or the interfacial binding regions.

The conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol esters is necessary to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport, the process which removes excess cholesterol and phospholipids from peripheral cells and delivers them to the liver for disposal (1Fielding C. Fielding P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LCAT reaction occurs primarily on the surface of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which contains phospholipids, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Although no crystal structure exists for LCAT, the study of its structure-function relationships has been facilitated by the construction of a computer model of the catalytic core of LCAT (2Peelman F.

Based on its amino acid composition alone, LCAT has an intermediate hydrophobicity between integral membrane proteins and apolipoproteins (7Yang C. Manoogian D. Pao Q. Lee F.-S. Knapp R. Gotto A. Pownall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 644-651Google Scholar). One modification commonly found in plasma proteins, including LCAT, that increases their solubility and hydrophilicity is glycosylation. Four N-linked complex type glycans and twoO-linked glycans are found in LCAT (8Schindler P. Settineri C. Collet X. Fielding C. Burlingame A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Lacko A. Reason A. Nuckolls C. Kudchodkar B. Nair M. Sundarrajan G. Pritchard P. Morris H. Dell A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 807-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and constitute around 20% of the total enzyme mass of human plasma LCAT (10Jonas A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Different cell types transfected with the human LCAT gene express the glycan structure of LCAT differently (11Ayyobi A. Lacko A. Murray K. Nair M. Li M. Molhuizen H. Pritchard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12Miller K. Wang J. Sorci-Thomas M. Anderson R. Parks J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 551-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to disparities between recombinant preparations of LCAT. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells express LCAT bearing a similar glycosylation pattern to plasma LCAT (12Miller K. Wang J. Sorci-Thomas M. Anderson R. Parks J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 551-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making this cell type a preferred recombinant host. The polar glycan chains help solubilize LCAT and prevent it from aggregating; however, glycosylation is known to have a variety of additional effects on other proteins, including regulation of intracellular processing, induction and stabilization of protein folding, determination of binding affinity, and modulation of enzymatic activity. While the removal of certain glycan chains has no detectable effect on some glycoproteins, the removal of others may modify any or all of the functions listed above. Because the effects of removing one or more glycan chains from glycoproteins cannot be predicted or generalized from the available examples, each glycoprotein represents a unique system for the investigation of structure-function interactions. The individual glycans of LCAT have been investigated by other laboratories to determine their role in LCAT function. Two of the glycosylation-deficient mutants, N20Q and N272Q, were similar to WT LCAT in enzymatic activity. However, the N84Q mutant retained little activity compared with WT LCAT, whereas the N384Q mutant was twice as active as WT (13Francone O. Evangelista L. Fielding C. Biochim. Biophys.

These studies involved recombinant LCAT present in cell media; purified mutants of LCAT are required to study structure-function relationships and to clarify some of the ambiguity regarding the effects of glycosylation on LCAT activity. In particular, determination of the reasons for the decrease of activity in the N84Q mutant and the increase of activity in the N384Q mutant may uncover significant facts regarding the catalytic mechanism of LCAT. Therefore, the goals of this study were to elucidate the effects of the deletion of glycan chains at positions Asn84 and Asn384 in purified LCAT, using several experimental approaches to determine differences between the glycosylation-deficient mutants and WT LCAT in enzymatic activity, interfacial binding, and structure and stability. Asparagine residues 84 and 384 were altered to glutamine to prevent glycosylation at those sites. Mutagenic primers were constructed by the Genetic Engineering Facility at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The sequence of the N84Q mutagenic primer was: 5′-GGTTGTCTACCAGCGGAGCTCCGGACTCGTGTCCAAC-3′, which also introduced a BspEI restriction site. The N384Q mutagenic primer was: 5′-GGTCTTCAGCCAGCTGACGCTGGAG-3′, which introduced a PvuII restriction site. Underlined bases are those changed from the human LCAT sequence. The QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was employed to generate the LCAT mutants (17Adimoolam S. Lee Y-P. Jonas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which were subcloned into the pSVDNA expression vector, described by Lee et al. (18Lee Y.-P. Adimoolam S. Liu M. Subbaiah P. Glenn K. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Constructs were sequenced by the Genetic Engineering Facility. Overexpression of the LCAT glycosylation mutants was carried out in dhfr− CHO cells as described by Jin et al. (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stably transfected by the calcium phosphate method. The selective pressure of increasing methotrexate concentrations in cell medium produced concomitant amplification of both dhfr and LCAT genes in the cells. Colonies overexpressing LCAT were isolated and the level of expression was analyzed by Western blotting (17Adimoolam S. Lee Y-P. Jonas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Eventually, cell lines expressing 2.5 mg/liter of cell medium of N84Q LCAT and 5.0 mg/liter of cell medium of N384Q LCAT were produced. WT LCAT (10 mg/liter) was expressed by a CHO cell line generated by an identical procedure by Jin et al. (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of WT LCAT and the glycosylation mutants was carried out (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) over phenyl-Sepharose and Affi-Gel Blue columns. Protein concentration was determined by A280 and purity was evaluated on Coomassie or silver-stained SDS-PAGE Phast gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pure protein fractions were concentrated and dialyzed into storage buffer of 10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, and were stored on ice, in capped plastic tubes under nitrogen. Irreversible aggregation of LCAT was monitored by nondenaturing Phast gels and by Western blots. Acyltransferase assays for LCAT were performed as described previously (18Lee Y.-P. Adimoolam S. Liu M. Subbaiah P. Glenn K. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Because of the relative inactivity of the LCAT mutants, up to 10 times more mutant LCAT was used than WT LCAT in order to obtain kinetic data of sufficient accuracy. LCAT esterase assays were performed based on the procedures of Bonelli and Jonas (20Bonelli F. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14723-14728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the same reason as in the acyltransferase assays, samples required higher mutant LCAT concentrations to obtain measurable activity. However, in neither enzymatic assay did the mutant LCAT concentration exceed that which would induce aggregation. Irreversible aggregation is observed at concentrations greater than 0.5 mg/ml of pure WT LCAT (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The surface plasmon resonance method was used to measure the interfacial binding kinetics of LCAT with reconstituted HDL particles (rHDL). These particles were prepared as described in previous work (21Jin L. Shieh J.-J. Grabbe E. Adimoolam S. Durbin D. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15659-15665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) except that cholesterol was not included and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) was substituted for egg phosphatidylcholine. Thus, the molar ratio of the components of rHDL was 99:0.7:1 of POPC (Sigma)/Cap-Biotinylated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids)/apolipoprotein A-I (purified from human plasma). Control dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) rHDL were made in the same proportions, substituting DPPC for POPC. The small proportions of biotinylated lipid used did not interfere with any properties of the rHDL (21Jin L. Shieh J.-J. Grabbe E. Adimoolam S. Durbin D. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15659-15665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The incorporation of biotinylated lipid was later determined by the Pierce Biotinylation Kit to be 1.1 mol of biotin/mol of rHDL. The lack of cholesterol and the ambient temperature used in these experiments (25 °C) ensured that little or no enzymatic activity took place on the rHDL during the short exposure time to LCAT. Association and dissociation rates of LCAT on the immobilized rHDL were measured on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Inc.) maintained by the Immunological Resources Center (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The SA (streptavidin) chip (Biacore) was used to immobilize the biotin-labeled rHDL. Biotinylated POPC and DPPC rHDL were injected through separate flow cells until around 900 response units of mass had bound to each cell. LCAT does not bind appreciably to DPPC rHDL under the present reaction conditions, so a flow cell coated with this particle provides a negative control for POPC rHDL binding. LCAT was diluted to 2 μm to 62 nm and passed though the cells using KINJECT mode at 30 μl/min, for 1 min contact time, and 5 min dissociation time (21Jin L. Shieh J.-J. Grabbe E. Adimoolam S. Durbin D. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15659-15665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LCAT dissociated from rHDL completely during the dissociation period, making regeneration of the surface unnecessary. Corrected sensorgrams were analyzed by Biacore evaluation software, using the algorithm for a 1:1 Langmuir binding isotherm with global fitting kinetics, compensated for drifting baseline. Finally, a mass transfer control experiment was performed, verifying that binding constants were independent of flow rate. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed by determining enzymatic activity as a function of temperature. Purified LCAT is not stable at temperatures above 4 °C, and does not retain activity for long at temperatures above 37 °C. However, LCAT in plasma or cell media is much more stable and can be used to judge the relative stability of WT compared with mutant enzymes as a function of temperature. Aliquots of cell media were incubated in water baths from 37 to 55 °C for 1 h prior to use in the assay. The decrease in percent conversion of substrate was assumed to correspond to enzyme denaturation. Denaturation curves and theTM, or midpoint of denaturation, were calculated by Origin software. All circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using parameters given previously (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure LCAT samples (0.05 mg/ml) contained progressively increasing concentrations of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Spectra were analyzed by the SELCON 3 algorithm. The intrinsic fluorescence of LCAT due mostly to tryptophan residues was also measured as described previously (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All LCAT samples were identical to those used in CD measurements. The fluorescent probe 1-anilinonapthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) (Molecular Probes) increases in quantum yield and blue shifts upon binding to a hydrophobic protein site. Thus, ANS is a useful indicator of hydrophobic regions in a protein accessible to the probe. A common application of ANS is the detection of folding intermediates or unfolded states of a protein (22Rogers D. Brouilette C. Engler J. Tendian S. Roberts L. Mishra V. Anantharamaiah G. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M. Ray M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this case, it is used to assess qualitatively the differences in structure between WT LCAT and the glycosylation mutants. Experimental conditions were modeled after studies on apoA-I (22Rogers D. Brouilette C. Engler J. Tendian S. Roberts L. Mishra V. Anantharamaiah G. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M. Ray M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). LCAT was added to a 1-cm path length fluorescent cuvette at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. ANS was dissolved in methanol as a 5 mg/ml solution. To ensure complete saturation of available binding sites, ANS was added in a 100-fold molar excess over LCAT. The fluorometer was a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B set to the following parameters: emission slit, 5 nm; excitation slit, 5 nm; excitation wavelength 395 nm; emission scan range, 405–560 nm; scan speed 200 nm/min; and 8 accumulations. In addition, carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) was tested at the same concentration and conditions as LCAT as an example of a globular protein that has very little affinity for ANS. The glycosylation mutants of LCAT were examined in terms of their purity, molecular mass, and tendency toward aggregation. The peak of spectral mass (Protein Sciences Facility, University of Illinois) for WT LCAT was 58.0 kDa, N84Q LCAT was 56.2 kDa, and N384Q LCAT was 57.0 kDa as determined by mass spectrometry analysis. This decrease in mass observed in the two mutants corresponds closely to the theoretical decrease for loss of a triantennary and biantennary complex-typeN-linked glycan chain, respectively. Thus, the predominant glycan chain structure is similar at these two sites between CHO-expressed LCAT and human LCAT (8Schindler P. Settineri C. Collet X. Fielding C. Burlingame A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similar relative masses were observed using SDS-PAGE gels and high molecular weight markers (Fig.1A). This gel also shows the high degree of purity (>95%) of the WT and mutant LCAT preparations. Gels, after eight months of storage of the LCAT variants, gave identical results. Fig. 1B shows Western blots of the purified LCAT variants adjusted in the mass applied to the gel to give comparable staining intensity. Evidently the N84Q mutant is about 500-fold less immunoreactive than WT LCAT, and the N384Q mutant is about 5-fold less reactive. This illustrates the importance and specificity of glycosylation in the expression of glycoprotein epitopes. The aggregation tendencies of the two LCAT mutants did not differ significantly from that of WT LCAT, as tested by native, nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 1C). At the concentrations used for storage and for these experiments (<0.35 mg/ml), no aggregation was detected for any of the LCAT species. Concentrations in excess of 0.5 mg/ml WT LCAT have been shown in the past to result in irreversible aggregation (19Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acyltransferase assay is an important tool for the characterization of the LCAT reaction, for it encompasses all steps of LCATs enzymatic reaction with a physiologically relevant substrate, the rHDL, and reflects the interfacial binding affinity for rHDL in the apparent Km value. Analysis of the results of the acyltransferase assay using a Lineweaver-Burk plot allowed calculation of the apparent kcat andKm of LCAT (Table I). The deletion of glycan chains Asn84 or Asn384resulted in a relatively rapid loss of activity for both glycosylation-deficient mutants. Interestingly, N84Q LCAT was inactive immediately following its purification from cell media, whereas freshly purified N384Q LCAT initially possessed higher activity than WT LCAT, but lost activity steadily over the course of months. The decrease in N384Q activity with time is shown as a percentage of WT LCAT activity in Fig. 2. Shortly after purification, N384Q was about 50% more active than WT LCAT, in agreement with previous studies performed on the mutant in cell media (13Francone O. Evangelista L. Fielding C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14O K. Hill J. Wang X. McLeod R. Pritchard P. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Qu S. Fan H. Blanco-Vaca F. Pownall H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8732-8736Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16O K. Hill J. Pritchard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Seven months later, N384Q had almost no measurable activity while WT LCATs activity was unchanged. Yet, during that same period, the apparentKm of N384Q remained constant relative to WT LCAT apparent Km (Fig. 2 and Table I). Thus, these results indicate that the removal of the glycan chain has drastically affected N84Q LCAT, rendering it enzymatically inactive. In the case of the N384Q mutant, removal of the glycan chain has destabilized N384Q such that its enzymatic activity decreases far more rapidly than WT LCAT, while its interfacial binding affinity remains unchanged.Table IEnzymatic kinetic parameters of N384Q and WT LCAT as a function of time after purificationTime after N384Q purification (months)1-dTime is rounded to the nearest half month.Acyltransferase assay1-aAcyltransferase assay results are the average of three experiments; rHDL substrates were prepared separately for each time point.

The LCAT esterase assay measures the catalytic rate of ester bond hydrolysis for a water-soluble substrate,para-nitrophenylbutyrate. Because the reaction is independent of interfacial binding and activation steps, this assay is used mainly to detect changes in the catalytic core of LCAT. The same trends were observed in the esterase assay results as in the acyltransferase assay (Fig. 2 and Table I). The N84Q mutant was catalytically inactive less than a month after purification. The N384Q mutant initially had a greater activity than WT LCAT, but lost all measurable activity in a matter of months. WT LCAT, as usual, retained a constant activity over the same number of months. TheKm values of WT LCAT and N384Q LCAT remained relatively constant. Evidently, the Asn84 glycan chain is essential for LCAT activity after purification, but the N84Q mutant possesses some activity while still in cell media (see thermal denaturation studies). The Asn384 glycan seems to be important in stabilizing LCAT activity for a period of longer than a few days. Surface plasmon resonance is a powerful method to study LCAT interfacial binding to rHDL. Interestingly, the N84Q mutant displayed no binding affinity at all for the rHDL. Coupled with the negative enzymatic results, this result confirms that the purified mutant is not functional. In contrast, the N384Q mutant binds to rHDL with similar affinity to WT LCAT. In fact, the binding of N384Q LCAT to rHDL held constant regardless of the age of the enzyme preparation, in agreement with the enzymatic assay results that the apparent Km value did not change over time. These results applied equally to association and dissociation rate binding constants, and the resultant equilibrium dissociation constant, as seen in TableII.Table IIInterfacial binding kinetics of N84Q, N384Q, and WT LCAT, measured by surface plasmon resonanceka2-aka, association rate constant; kd, dissociation rate constant;KD, equilibrium dissociation constant.

Open table in a new tab Thermal denaturation studies were used to estimate the stability of the LCAT glycosylation mutants compared with WT LCAT. A decrease in enzymatic activity at progressively higher temperatures generally corresponds to the denaturation of the protein structure. The denaturation curves are shown in Fig.3A. The Tmfor WT LCAT was 48.1 °C, for N384Q LCAT was 47.5 °C, and for N84Q LCAT was 44.5 °C. The N384Q mutant denatured similarly to the WT LCAT, but the N84Q mutant demonstrated a decreased thermal stability compared with either the N384Q mutant or WT LCAT. TheTm of N84Q LCAT has shifted down by about 3.5 °C. This difference in Tm corresponds to a difference of around 0.5 kcal/mol of free energy change in calorimetry studies of other proteins (23Byrne M. Stites W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2545-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the N84Q mutant does have some activity at this point, although the same mutant has no activity after the protein purification procedure, as shown by the enzymatic activity assays. The complete lack of activity in the purified form of N84Q is likely related to the decreased stability of the enzyme, since the purification procedure is the same as that used for WT LCAT and N384Q LCAT. The denaturation of LCAT was also followed by isothermal spectroscopic means. By adding progressively higher concentrations of GdnHCl, CD can be used to observe the disappearance of secondary structure and to determine the stability (or ΔGD°) of LCAT. In a complementary study, fluorescence spectroscopy was used to estimate the average environment of the tryptophan residues of LCAT, which reflect the tertiary structure of the protein, and to follow LCAT denaturation. As high concentrations of GdnHCl denature LCAT, the tryptophans become increasingly exposed to solvent, altering their fluorescence emission spectra and thus allowing observation of the progress of the denaturation. According to the CD spectra of LCAT in buffer, the N84Q mutant possesses less β-sheet structure but slightly more α-helical structure compared with WT LCAT (TableIII). The possible location of these altered structural motifs is considered in the discussion section. A fresh sample of the N384Q mutant also possesses more α-helical structure than does WT LCAT. However, an older sample of N384Q LCAT undergoes a marked decrease in α-helix content with a concurrent increase in the amount of unordered structure. From this data, it appears that N384Q LCAT, over a period of months, loses much of its helical structure, which unravels to become more disordered.Table IIIStructural properties of WT LCAT and glycosylation mutantsWMF3-aWMF, wavelength of maximum fluorescence.
