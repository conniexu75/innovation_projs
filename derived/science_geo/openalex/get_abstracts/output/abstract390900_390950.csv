The emerging field of lipidomics is driven by technology, most notably mass spectrometry, but also by complementary approaches for the detection and characterization of lipids and their biosynthetic enzymes in living cells. The development of these integrated tools promises to greatly advance our understanding of the diverse biological roles of lipids. Once viewed simply as a reservoir for carbon storage, lipids are no longer cast as bystanders in the drama of biological systems. The emerging field of lipidomics is driven by technology, most notably mass spectrometry, but also by complementary approaches for the detection and characterization of lipids and their biosynthetic enzymes in living cells. The development of these integrated tools promises to greatly advance our understanding of the diverse biological roles of lipids. Lipids are not genetically encoded. Instead, like other small molecules they are generated and metabolized by enzymes that are influenced by the environment of a given biological system, for instance by diet and temperature. Although still poorly defined, some estimates have placed the number of distinct chemical entities within the lipid sphere between 10,000 and 100,000. Although it is unclear how and why nature generates this staggering diversity, there is an increasing awareness across many disciplines of the critical importance of lipids in all aspects of life. First, coordinated lipid anabolism and catabolism is a key molecular integrator of energy homeostasis, membrane structure and dynamics, and signaling (Figure 1) with imbalances in lipid metabolism contributing to diverse phenotypes and disease states. Second, there is an expanding number of drugs that target lipid metabolic and signaling pathways, including the well-known and profitable cholesterol-lowering agents (statins) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. For therapeutic intervention in diseases ranging from inflammation and cancer to metabolic diseases, lipid researchers are seeking specific regulators of numerous targets, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases, nuclear hormone receptors (for instance, liver X receptor, LXR; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, PPARs), sphingosine, and ceramide kinases. A recent example is FTY720, approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in October 2010, an immunosuppressant that targets sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (but interestingly does not inhibit serine palmitoyl transferase, unlike its mother compound myriocin, a natural product). The scarcity of pertinent tools has led to investments in programs to develop new approaches for lipid research. Collectively, these efforts have added momentum to the field (reflected in part by the increasing number of publications and conferences dedicated to lipids), which promises to address fundamental questions of lipid function and to meet practical demands in the applied sciences. The aim of this Primer is to introduce the basic concepts behind biochemical (mass spectrometry-based) lipidomics, to discuss how these approaches are being integrated with complementary techniques, and to offer a view on the future of the field. The first reports of mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of complex lipid mixtures via soft ionization techniques (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, MALDI, and electrospray ionization, ESI) date back to the 1990s (Han and Gross, 1994Han X. Gross R.W. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopic analysis of human erythrocyte plasma membrane phospholipids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 10635-10639Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 1994Kim H.Y. Wang T.C. Ma Y.C. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of phospholipids using electrospray ionization.Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3977-3982Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A large number of methods have been developed since then, and many biologically important lipids can now be analyzed on a fairly routine basis. However, unlike genomics and proteomics, which are well represented in various forms at leading research institutions worldwide, this is not yet the case for lipidomics (Figure 2). A major difference in mass spectrometry of lipids (as opposed to proteins) is the large chemical diversity found in these molecules (Figure 1 and Figure 3A ) (Fahy et al., 2005Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Brown H.A. Glass C.K. Merrill Jr., A.H. Murphy R.C. Raetz C.R. Russell D.W. Seyama Y. Shaw W. et al.A comprehensive classification system for lipids.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 839-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it is currently not possible to comprehensively measure the lipidome of a cell or tissue in a single experiment. Furthermore, one often does not know what precise alteration in lipids to expect in any given case. Thus, first surveys are often exploratory, which is to say they often have “untargeted” readouts (Figure 3B). Such methods should have high mass accuracy and resolution, a characteristic of time of flight and Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Fragmentation of an ion of interest is then used for identification (Figure 3C). Analysis of fragmentation pathways has led to a detailed understanding of “bonding” between the different building blocks found in lipids (such as fatty acids, sphingoid bases, and head groups). It has also formed a basis for “shotgun” lipidomics in which precursor lipids are determined based on characteristic fragment ions. Other targeted approaches based on tandem mass spectrometry are now available for analysis of many different classes of lipids and in complex mixtures (Wenk, 2005Wenk M.R. The emerging field of lipidomics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 594-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, Blanksby and Mitchell, 2010Blanksby S.J. Mitchell T.W. Advances in mass spectrometry for lipidomics.Annu Rev Anal Chem (Palo Alto Calif). 2010; 3: 433-465Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The coordinated efforts of LIPID MAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org) have laid the groundwork for standardization (for example, in protocols and in the nomenclature relevant to databases) in the field and to foster the commercial availability of many pure and synthetic lipid standards. These standards are deuterated versions or close chemical analogs of naturally occurring lipids that are used to quantify ion responses. They are used in a rapidly increasing number of lipidomic programs around the world (LIPID MAPS, Kansas Lipidomics Research Center, COBRE, WUSTL, Southampton Lipidomics Research Group, Lipidomics.Net, LipidX, Lipidomics Research Center Graz, LipidProfiles). In addition to these centers that harbor substantial analytical capabilities, individual laboratories are increasingly engaging in the analysis of specific metabolites and lipid pathways. The latter development can be explained, at least in part, by lowered costs and easier handling of modern mass spectrometers. Two technical characteristics, high sensitivity and high specificity (mass resolution), account for the success of mass spectrometry in lipid analysis. For example, mass spectrometry has provided a detailed knowledge of the chemical (lipid) composition of highly purified vesicles or viruses, preparations in which sample amounts are limited. These “organelles” stay largely intact during preparation and are thus biochemically more accessible than other membrane fractions. Studies such as these provide evidence for segregation of specific sterol and sphingolipid species during formation of secretory vesicles at the trans-Golgi (Klemm et al., 2009Klemm R.W. Ejsing C.S. Surma M.A. Kaiser H.J. Gerl M.J. Sampaio J.L. de Robillard Q. Ferguson C. Proszynski T.J. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Segregation of sphingolipids and sterols during formation of secretory vesicles at the trans-Golgi network.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) or enrichment of certain membrane lipids during formation of viruses at donor membranes of the host cell (Brügger et al., 2006Brügger B. Glass B. Haberkant P. Leibrecht I. Wieland F.T. Kräusslich H.G. The HIV lipidome: a raft with an unusual composition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2641-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, Chan et al., 2008Chan R. Uchil P.D. Jin J. Shui G. Ott D.E. Mothes W. Wenk M.R. Retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemia virus are enriched in phosphoinositides.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 11228-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Sensitivity is also required for lipid metabolites that occur at low and transient levels. Phosphoinositides or fatty acyl derivatives have all been characterized by mass spectrometric methods and in complex lipid extracts, a task that would otherwise require laborious (and often indirect) techniques for detection. It should however be noted that, even with the major advances made by MS approaches, the detection of lipid species of very low abundance is still a major challenge (discussed below). High-resolution mass spectrometry aids in identification of previously uncharacterized lipids and discrimination between lipids with similar mass and chemical structures. It has also provided evidence for the presence of isomeric species (which have the same chemical formula but different structures) and isobaric species (ions with the same mass) in cellular lipidomes. For example, ether phospholipids are often isomeric with other abundant cellular phospholipids (Yang et al., 2007Yang K. Zhao Z. Gross R.W. Han X. Shotgun lipidomics identifies a paired rule for the presence of isomeric ether phospholipid molecular species.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1368Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There are several analytical challenges that cannot be addressed satisfactorily by mass spectrometry alone. These include unequivocal assignment of structures: double bond configurations are difficult to determine and cannot be readily assigned based on tandem mass spectrometry (Thomas et al., 2009Thomas M.C. Mitchell T.W. Blanksby S.J. OnLine ozonolysis methods for the determination of double bond position in unsaturated lipids.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 579: 413-441Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar); chemical derivatization and/or nuclear magnetic resonance might be required for structure determination of complex glycolipids. Lipids and their metabolites serve as integrators of many cellular functions. Energy homeostasis is tightly coupled to fatty acid metabolism, and fatty acids are key building blocks of many cellular lipids (Figure 1). Thus, it seems evident that lipid metabolism must follow a very coordinated program during the cell cycle and proliferation. Given that cancer cells are dependent on fatty acids for the synthesis of membranes and signaling lipids, fatty acid synthase (FAS) is considered a potential therapeutic target. Recent work using cell biological approaches (Kurat et al., 2009Kurat C.F. Wolinski H. Petschnigg J. Kaluarachchi S. Andrews B. Natter K. Kohlwein S.D. Cdk1/Cdc28-dependent activation of the major triacylglycerol lipase Tgl4 in yeast links lipolysis to cell-cycle progression.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and functional proteomics (Nomura et al., 2010Nomura D.K. Long J.Z. Niessen S. Hoover H.S. Ng S.W. Cravatt B.F. Monoacylglycerol lipase regulates a fatty acid network that promotes cancer pathogenesis.Cell. 2010; 140: 49-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) discovered that breakdown of glycerolipids via lipases is a key mechanism for the generation of free fatty acids during cell proliferation, thus metabolically coupling lipid bodies with membrane synthesis (Figure 1) (Singh et al., 2009Singh R. Kaushik S. Wang Y. Xiang Y. Novak I. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Cuervo A.M. Czaja M.J. Autophagy regulates lipid metabolism.Nature. 2009; 458: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Similar metabolic coupling, for instance, between membrane lipids and soluble lipid mediators, is likely to be discovered for specific phenotypes other than growth (Patwardhan et al., 2010Patwardhan A.M. Akopian A.N. Ruparel N.B. Diogenes A. Weintraub S.T. Uhlson C. Murphy R.C. Hargreaves K.M. Heat generates oxidized linoleic acid metabolites that activate TRPV1 and produce pain in rodents.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The known lipid “signaling” network is thus poised for a great expansion, in particular in the context of human disease (Wymann and Schneiter, 2008Wymann M.P. Schneiter R. Lipid signalling in disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 162-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These are recent examples of integrated experimental approaches involving experiments that combine lipid biochemistry (via mass spectrometry or other means) and functional readouts. The first challenge in such endeavors is defining the sample. Whole-cell extracts are often used, and as a consequence all information on spatial distribution is lost (van Meer, 2005van Meer G. Cellular lipidomics.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3159-3165Crossref Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In the future, ensembles of protein markers will allow for better identification of subcellular organelles (Andreyev et al., 2010Andreyev A.Y. Shen Z. Guan Z. Ryan A. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Raetz C.R. Briggs S. Dennis E.A. Application of proteomic marker ensembles to subcellular organelle identification.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and thus aid in preparations of lipid fractions related to specific cellular functions. The generation of lipid extracts prior to analysis is a critical aspect that currently attracts only moderate attention. Biochemical fractionation has inherent limitations in terms of the resulting purity and integrity of the samples. Furthermore, recovery rates during partitioning in organic solvents strongly depend on the lipid class, and nonquantitative recovery during extraction introduces variability. Metabolites can vary substantially between individuals and on a day-to-day basis (Assfalg et al., 2008Assfalg M. Bertini I. Colangiuli D. Luchinat C. Schäfer H. Schütz B. Spraul M. Evidence of different metabolic phenotypes in humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1420-1424Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which complicates comparative studies. Often, the degree of natural variation of a metabolite/lipid in an individual or population is not known. In mice, some lysolipids display remarkable circadian patterns with up to 2-fold differences in their levels (Minami et al., 2009Minami Y. Kasukawa T. Kakazu Y. Iigo M. Sugimoto M. Ikeda S. Yasui A. van der Horst G.T. Soga T. Ueda H.R. Measurement of internal body time by blood metabolomics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9890-9895Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Whereas modern mass spectrometers provide linear outputs over several orders of magnitude (linear dynamic range), the biologically relevant dynamic range is lipid specific, varying from 2- to 3-fold for abundant membrane lipids to 10- to 100-fold in extreme cases (such as mediator lipids). Importantly, lipids are also found at very different basal concentrations and have distinct temporal dependencies. Cellular fractionation, liquid chromatographic separation prior to MS (LC-MS), time course experiments, as well as selective capture of lipids will be required to overcome analytical challenges to resolving lipid species of interest when they are of low abundance. In cellular studies, metabolic labeling with chemical isotopes of lipid precursors followed by mass spectrometry is an elegant and powerful way to study kinetics of incorporation and turnover of some classes of lipids (Postle and Hunt, 2009Postle A.D. Hunt A.N. Dynamic lipidomics with stable isotope labelling.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2009; 877: 2716-2721Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In population studies, efforts to combine mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with genomics have been guided by the technical feasibility of measuring lipids on a large scale, the popularity of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and human diseases associated with aberrant lipid metabolism. Strong associations are found between the levels of some polyunsaturated fatty acids (measured as fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatography-MS) and lipid desaturases (Tanaka et al., 2009Tanaka T. Shen J. Abecasis G.R. Kisialiou A. Ordovas J.M. Guralnik J.M. Singleton A. Bandinelli S. Cherubini A. Arnett D. et al.Genome-wide association study of plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids in the InCHIANTI Study.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000338Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). GWAS with larger numbers of metabolic traits, measured via MS methods introduced above, have been conducted and published recently. In one study following 33 metabolic traits, several circulating sphingolipids were found to be under strong genetic control (Hicks et al., 2009Hicks A.A. Pramstaller P.P. Johansson A. Vitart V. Rudan I. Ugocsai P. Aulchenko Y. Franklin C.S. Liebisch G. Erdmann J. et al.Genetic determinants of circulating sphingolipid concentrations in European populations.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In another study with 163 metabolites (including major glycerophospholipids as well as acyl-CoAs and amino acids), ratios of substrate-product concentrations, rather than single metabolite levels, reduced variance and improved statistical significance (Illig et al., 2010Illig T. Gieger C. Zhai G. Römisch-Margl W. Wang-Sattler R. Prehn C. Altmaier E. Kastenmüller G. Kato B.S. Mewes H.W. et al.A genome-wide perspective of genetic variation in human metabolism.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Sequencing of candidate genes in individuals at the extremes of the population distribution with respect to lipoprotein levels led to the discovery of nonsynonymous sequence variants in enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism (Fahmi et al., 2008Fahmi S. Yang C. Esmail S. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Functional characterization of genetic variants in NPC1L1 supports the sequencing extremes strategy to identify complex trait genes.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2101-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Targeted genomics of lipid metabolic pathways in combination with biochemical lipid analysis is an area of great future potential. The link between genetic variation and changes in lipid levels will be relevant not only for population-based studies but also at the level of individuals. Arguably, proteomics was transformed by the development of search algorithms that enabled assignment of protein sequences by comparisons of experimental and theoretical MS fragmentation patterns of tryptic peptides. In the case of lipids, the bioinformatic needs are different and to a substantial extent remain unmet. Biological lipids are small, nonpolymeric molecules (with molecular weights less than 2000 Da). Typical analytical readouts in “untargeted” approaches include retention time (in the case of LC separation), mass-to-charge ratio, (m/z, ideally with high mass accuracy), and information on fragment ions (in the case of tandem MS). “Targeted” analysis delivers a matrix of lipid identities (including precursors to fragment ions) and their intensities. Typical informatic frameworks include data processing (peak integration, identification, and normalization), statistics (univariate or multivariate), and integration into pathways (e.g., the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) or other datasets (see above). Open source and commercial software packages are now becoming available to support some of these functions (Wheelock et al., 2009Wheelock C.E. Goto S. Yetukuri L. D'Alexandri F.L. Klukas C. Schreiber F. Oresic M. Bioinformatics strategies for the analysis of lipids.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 580: 339-368Google Scholar, Blanksby and Mitchell, 2010Blanksby S.J. Mitchell T.W. Advances in mass spectrometry for lipidomics.Annu Rev Anal Chem (Palo Alto Calif). 2010; 3: 433-465Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Building databases for lipids follows closely related efforts for other small molecule metabolites (Fahy et al., 2007Fahy E. Cotter D. Byrnes R. Sud M. Maer A. Li J. Nadeau D. Zhau Y. Subramaniam S. Bioinformatics for lipidomics.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 247-273Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Kind et al., 2009Kind T. Wohlgemuth G. Lee Y. Lu Y. Palazoglu M. Shahbaz S. Fiehn O. FiehnLib: mass spectral and retention index libraries for metabolomics based on quadrupole and time-of-flight gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 10038-10048Crossref Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Appropriate data processing and validation will be a particularly critical element in biomarker discovery where many hundreds of different lipids are measured in human body fluids such as blood plasma (Quehenberger et al., 2010Quehenberger O. Armando A.M. Brown A.H. Milne S.B. Myers D.S. Merrill A.H. Bandyopadhyay S. Jones K.N. Kelly S. Shaner R.L. et al.Lipidomics reveals a remarkable diversity of lipids in human plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 3299-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These examples illustrate the benefits of data integration at all levels and across scientific disciplines. Biochemical analysis of lipids by mass spectrometry is only one element in such interdisciplinary projects but will be a key tool in many fields including cell and developmental biology, molecular medicine, and nutrition (Shevchenko and Simons, 2010Shevchenko A. Simons K. Lipidomics: coming to grips with lipid diversity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). New features and functions will undoubtedly be introduced to augment those currently used in the MS analysis of lipids. For instance, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which combines information of molecular shape (the collisional cross-section) with the mass/charge, has not yet been extensively applied to the analysis of lipids. Biophysical studies have shown that the double bond configuration of fatty acyls determines the conformation of lipids in bilayers, and this structural characteristic might also affect the collisional cross-section. It is also conceivable that ion mobility is affected by head group geometry (which is impacted by phosphorylation and glycosylation). Thus, it is likely that IM-MS will provide valuable information that is otherwise difficult to obtain. IM-MS has been successfully used for detection of lipids directly from tissue sections via MALDI (Ridenour et al., 2010Ridenour W.B. Kliman M. McLean J.A. Caprioli R.M. Structural characterization of phospholipids and peptides directly from tissue sections by MALDI traveling-wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 1881-1889Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The resulting “image” containing mass spectral data yields spatial information on lipid distribution (Murphy et al., 2009Murphy R.C. Hankin J.A. Barkley R.M. Imaging of lipid species by MALDI mass spectrometry.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S317-S322Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Many lipids bind to cations, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, via their charged head groups. These reactions regulate assembly of lipids in biological as well as cell-free systems. Lipid oxidation on the other hand is in part coupled to free radical chemistry. Thus, elemental composition of lipid preparations (metal ions in particular) could yield important additional information related to biomarker discovery. Such information can be determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (Becker and Jakubowski, 2009Becker J.S. Jakubowski N. The synergy of elemental and biomolecular mass spectrometry: new analytical strategies in life sciences.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009; 38: 1969-1983Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a method that is amenable to imaging. An interesting new technique for imaging of lipids is coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy. Images are generated based on the vibrational states of molecules, such as the CH2 bonds found in fatty acyls. Thus, CARS does not require external labels. It is rapid (1 s/frame) and can be used for live imaging. Currently, CARS works well in applications with high signal-to-noise ratios, for example lipid bodies that harbor many CH2 segments (Volkmer, 2005Volkmer A. Vibrational imaging and microspectroscopies based on coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy.J. Phys. D Appl. Phys. 2005; 38: R59-R81Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Müller and Zumbusch, 2007Müller M. Zumbusch A. Coherent anti-stokes raman scattering microscopy.ChemPhysChem. 2007; 8: 2156-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Future developments might lead to CARS spectroscopy, moving the technique beyond the monitoring of a single frequency such that C-C double bonds (lipid unsaturation), or ester bonds could also be imaged. Such refinements should also help overcome background problems. Progress has been made toward ascertaining the determinants of specificity for lipid enzymes and protein effectors. For instance, mammalian FAS generates mainly palmitic acid (C16:0,16 carbons and no double bonds between them) and to a lesser extent produces C14:0 and C18:0. This specificity is determined, at least in part, by the thioesterase domain of FAS and the geometry of its catalytic cavity (Pemble et al., 2007Pemble 4th, C.W. Johnson L.C. Kridel S.J. Lowther W.T. Crystal structure of the thioesterase domain of human fatty acid synthase inhibited by Orlistat.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Phospholipases and lipid kinases are other well-studied examples. Both require interfacial targeting and specific recognition of their substrates for catalysis (Manford et al., 2010Manford A. Xia T. Saxena A.K. Stefan C. Hu F. Emr S.D. Mao Y. Crystal structure of the yeast Sac1: implications for its phosphoinositide phosphatase function.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides, an important class of cellular signaling lipids, are recognized by a large number of protein effectors that have vastly different folds. Sophisticated technology based on inducible formation of protein-protein complexes (Suh et al., 2006Suh B.C. Inoue T. Meyer T. Hille B. Rapid chemically induced changes of PtdIns(4,5)P2 gate KCNQ ion channels.Science. 2006; 314: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) or peptide sensors has helped to monitor (using optical imaging) the distributions of phosphoinositides and associated protein factors within cells (Fairn et al., 2009Fairn G.D. Ogata K. Botelho R.J. Stahl P.D. Anderson R.A. De Camilli P. Meyer T. Wodak S. Grinstein S. An electrostatic switch displaces phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases from the membrane during phagocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, it is clear that recognition of lipids at the atomic level remains poorly understood (Manford et al., 2010Manford A. Xia T. Saxena A.K. Stefan C. Hu F. Emr S.D. Mao Y. Crystal structure of the yeast Sac1: implications for its phosphoinositide phosphatase function.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Ernst et al., 2010Ernst A.M.

Determinants of specificity at the protein-lipid interface in membranes.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1713-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly evident that highly specific lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions regulate cell physiology (Guan et al., 2009Guan X.L. Souza C.M. Pichler H. Dewhurst G. Schaad O. Kajiwara K. Wakabayashi H. Ivanova T. Castillon G.A. Piccolis M. et al.Functional interactions between sphingolipids and sterols in biological membranes regulating cell physiology.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2083-2095Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Shevchenko and Simons, 2010Shevchenko A. Simons K. Lipidomics: coming to grips with lipid diversity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It will therefore be a challenge to understand and therapeutically target such interactions. Lipid enzymes are an interesting case to consider given that they produce mediators that have closely related structures but opposing functions (Figure 1). Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is involved in the generation of both inflammatory compounds (e.g., prostaglandins) as well as anti-inflammatory compounds from similar, albeit chemically distinct, substrates (glycerophospholipids with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acyl, respectively) (Groeger et al., 2010Groeger A.L. Cipollina C. Cole M.P. Woodcock S.R. Bonacci G. Rudolph T.K. Rudolph V. Freeman B.A. Schopfer F.J. Cyclooxygenase-2 generates anti-inflammatory mediators from omega-3 fatty acids.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Acetyl-salicylic acid (aspirin), a natural compound that targets COX-2, decreases production of proinflammatory mediators and increases production of anti-inflammatory compounds. This shift in COX activity is not achieved by synthetic and selective inhibitors of COX that are designed based on active site catalysis. Chemically synthesized derivatives of natural products are therefore promising tools for probing enzyme cavities and for identifying new lipid-binding factors and off-targets (Yang et al., 2010Yang P.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2140252926,"Dynamic reorganization of signaling systems frequently accompanies pathway perturbations, yet quantitative studies of network remodeling by pathway stimuli are lacking. Here, we report the development of a quantitative proteomics platform centered on multiplex absolute quantification (AQUA) technology to elucidate the architecture of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) network and to evaluate current models of dynamic CRL remodeling. Current models suggest that CRL complexes are controlled by cycles of CRL deneddylation and CAND1 binding. Contrary to expectations, acute CRL inhibition with MLN4924, an inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme, does not result in a global reorganization of the CRL network. Examination of CRL complex stoichiometry reveals that, independent of cullin neddylation, a large fraction of cullins are assembled with adaptor modules, whereas only a small fraction are associated with CAND1. These studies suggest an alternative model of CRL dynamicity where the abundance of adaptor modules, rather than cycles of neddylation and CAND1 binding, drives CRL network organization."
https://openalex.org/W2016391867,"The inositol pyrophosphate IP7 (5-diphosphoinositolpentakisphosphate), formed by a family of three inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks), modulates diverse cellular activities. We now report that IP7 is a physiologic inhibitor of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates glucose homeostasis and protein translation, respectively, via the GSK3β and mTOR pathways. Thus, Akt and mTOR signaling are dramatically augmented and GSK3β signaling reduced in skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and liver of mice with targeted deletion of IP6K1. IP7 affects this pathway by potently inhibiting the PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt, preventing its activation and thereby affecting insulin signaling. IP6K1 knockout mice manifest insulin sensitivity and are resistant to obesity elicited by high-fat diet or aging. Inhibition of IP6K1 may afford a therapeutic approach to obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2037149016,"The ectopic expression of transcription factors can reprogram differentiated tissue cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. However, this is a slow and inefficient process, depending on the simultaneous delivery of multiple genes encoding essential reprogramming factors and on their sustained expression in target cells. Moreover, once cell reprogramming is accomplished, these exogenous reprogramming factors should be replaced with their endogenous counterparts for establishing autoregulated pluripotency. Complete and designed removal of the exogenous genes from the reprogrammed cells would be an ideal option for satisfying this latter requisite as well as for minimizing the risk of malignant cell transformation. However, no single gene delivery/expression system has ever been equipped with these contradictory characteristics. Here we report the development of a novel replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus (SeVdp) vector based on a noncytopathic variant virus, which fulfills all of these requirements for cell reprogramming. The SeVdp vector could accommodate up to four exogenous genes, deliver them efficiently into various mammalian cells (including primary tissue cells and human hematopoietic stem cells) and express them stably in the cytoplasm at a prefixed balance. Furthermore, interfering with viral transcription/replication using siRNA could erase the genomic RNA of SeVdp vector from the target cells quickly and thoroughly. A SeVdp vector installed with Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc could reprogram mouse primary fibroblasts quite efficiently; ∼1% of the cells were reprogrammed to Nanog-positive induced pluripotent stem cells without chromosomal gene integration. Thus, this SeVdp vector has potential as a tool for advanced cell reprogramming and for stem cell research.

The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) 3The abbreviations used are: iPS, induced pluripotent stem; ES, embryonic stem; SeV, Sendai virus; SeVdp, defective and persistent Sendai virus; Bs, blasticidin S; Zeo, zeocin; Zeo, phleomycin-binding protein gene; Bsr, blasticidin S deaminase gene; Hyg, hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; KO, Kusabira Orange; KR, Keima Red; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; NP, nucleocapsid protein; CFU, colony-forming unit. cells by reprogramming tissue cells with defined factors opened the door for realizing the medical application of patient-derived engineered stem cells (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19304) Google Scholar). iPS cells were established originally by the ectopic expression of multiple transcription factors (e.g. Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) using a retroviral vector (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19304) Google Scholar). Since then, researchers have established iPS cells by several different approaches (and by their combination), including gene transfer, protein transduction, and treatment with chemical compounds (2Müller L.U. Daley G.Q. Williams D.A. Mol. Ther. 2009; 17: 947-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, because of superior reproducibility and efficacy, ectopic expression of reprogramming factors by gene transfer is still the primary method of choice. Various lines of evidence indicate that efficient cell reprogramming requires the sustained and simultaneous expression of several (usually 4) exogenous factors for at least 10–20 days (3Jaenisch R. Young R. Cell. 2008; 132: 567-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, after reprogramming has been completed, these exogenous factors should be replaced promptly with their endogenous counterparts if the cells are to acquire autoregulated pluripotency (3Jaenisch R. Young R. Cell. 2008; 132: 567-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). For this reason, retroviral and lentiviral vectors have been used preferentially; chromosomal insertion of the vector genome allows for stable gene expression, whereas epigenetic modification of the viral promoter shuts off the vector-mediated gene expression after cell reprogramming has been accomplished. Nevertheless, cell reprogramming with these insertional vectors has a crucial disadvantage in that silencing and reactivation of the integrated reprogramming genes is often unmanageable, which might affect the differentiation potency of iPS cells and the safety of the iPS-derived cells. Thus, investigators have focused on generating iPS cells carrying no exogenous genetic materials either by repetitive transient gene expression (4Okita K. Nakagawa M. Hyenjong H. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Science. 2008; 322: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 5Jia F. Wilson K.D. Sun N. Gupta D.M. Huang M. Li Z. Panetta N.J. Chen Z.Y. Robbins R.C. Kay M.A. Longaker M.T.

Thomson J.A. Science. 2009; 324: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar), or by recombinase-mediated excision of integrated genes from the chromosome (Refs. 7Kaji K. Norrby K. Paca A. Mileikovsky M. Mohseni P. Woltjen K. Nature. 2009; 458: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar and 8Woltjen K. Michael I.P. Mohseni P. Desai R. Mileikovsky M. Hämäläinen R. Cowling R.

Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, all of these approaches are not only inefficient but also laborious in practice, and development of a simpler gene delivery/expression system suitable for cell reprogramming is needed. Sendai virus (SeV) is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae (10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 689-724Google Scholar). As SeV can infect various animal cells with an exceptionally broad host range and is not pathogenic to humans, various applications have been explored for SeV as a recombinant viral vector capable of transient but strong gene expression (11Griesenbach U. Inoue M. Hasegawa M. Alton E.W. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2005; 7: 346-352PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated the potential of SeV as a tool for stable gene expression through an analysis of the Cl.151 strain (12Nishimura K. Segawa H. Goto T. Morishita M. Masago A. Takahashi H. Ohmiya Y. Sakaguchi T. Asada M. Imamura T. Shimotono K. Takayama K. Yoshida T. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27383-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This unique variant was originally isolated as a mutant capable of persistent infection at a nonpermissive temperature (38 °C) (13Yoshida T. Nagai Y. Maeno K. Iinuma M. Hamaguchi M. Matsumoto T. Nagayoshi S. Hoshino M. Virology. 1979; 92: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We cloned the entire genome of SeV Cl.151 and determined that more than two genetic elements were responsible independently for the establishment of stable persistent infections (12Nishimura K. Segawa H. Goto T. Morishita M. Masago A. Takahashi H. Ohmiya Y. Sakaguchi T. Asada M. Imamura T. Shimotono K. Takayama K. Yoshida T. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27383-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that SeV Cl.151 installed with a single exogenous gene could express it stably without chromosomal insertion (12Nishimura K. Segawa H. Goto T. Morishita M. Masago A. Takahashi H. Ohmiya Y. Sakaguchi T. Asada M. Imamura T. Shimotono K. Takayama K. Yoshida T. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27383-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As this characteristic is advantageous for cell reprogramming, we planned to optimize this gene delivery/expression system through a more extensive analysis of SeV-mediated stable gene expression. Here we describe the replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus (SeVdp) vector, a novel gene transfer/expression system based on SeV Cl.151, with the following characteristics, 1) efficient, harmless, and simultaneous delivery of up to four exogenous genes installed on a single vector, 2) stable and reproducible expression of installed genes at a pre-fixed balance without chromosomal integration, and 3) quick and complete erasure of the vector genome by interfering with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using siRNA. We also demonstrated that an SeVdp vector installed with Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc could reprogram mouse primary fibroblasts efficiently. These characteristics should make SeVdp a universal tool for stem cell research, especially for advanced cell reprogramming. All recombinant DNA experiments were performed according to our institutional guidelines and under the permission of the institutional recombinant DNA experiment committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and of the National Institutes of Health Sciences. Replication-competent SeV was reconstituted as described (12Nishimura K. Segawa H. Goto T. Morishita M. Masago A. Takahashi H. Ohmiya Y. Sakaguchi T. Asada M. Imamura T. Shimotono K. Takayama K. Yoshida T. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27383-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Full-length SeVdp vector genomic cDNA for SeV (Cl.151 strain and Nagoya strain) and for installed genes was constructed on the lambda Dash II vector as described in supplemental Fig. S1. In brief, the M, F, and HN genes were replaced with exogenous genes cloned between KasI and MluI restriction sites (for M), between BglII sites (for F), and between NheI and SphI sites (for HN). Additional extra genes were inserted into an NheI/NotI site created between the P/C/V and M genes. cDNAs encoding blasticidin S deaminase (Bsr), phleomycin-binding protein (Zeo), enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), Cypridina noctiluca luciferase (CLuc), humanized Kusabira Orange (KO), and human gp91phox (CYBB) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pCX4-bsr (14Akagi T. Sasai K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), pUT58 (15Drocourt D. Calmels T. Reynes J.P. Baron M. Tiraby G. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), pEGFP-1 (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan), pCLm (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan), phKO1-MN1 (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), and gp91phox-pCI-neo as templates, respectively. cDNA encoding humanized Keima Red (KR) was synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ), according to a published peptide sequence (16Kogure T. Karasawa S. Araki T. Saito K. Kinjo M. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The reconstructed cDNA plasmids (2 μg) and the expression vector plasmids for SeV nucleocapsid protein (NP), P/C, and L proteins (1 μg each) and pSRD-HN-Fmut (17Taira H. Sato T. Segawa H. Chiba M. Katsumata T. Iwasaki K. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (2 μg) were transfected into BHK/T7/151M(SE) cells using Lipofectamine LTX Plus reagent (Invitrogen). BHK/T7/151M(SE) cells were established by expressing humanized T7 RNA polymerase and the M protein of the SeV Cl.151 strain stably in BHK-21 cells and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The SeVdp vector was reconstituted in cells from positive-strand antigenome RNA transcribed from this cDNA and the SeV NP, P/C, L, Fmut, HN, and M (Cl.151) proteins. The vector-packaging cells harboring the SeVdp vector were established by selecting with antibiotics (blasticidin S at 10 μg/ml, zeocin at 500 μg/ml, or hygromycin B at 200 μg/ml) except for SeVdp(c-Myc/Klf4/Oct4/Sox2). The SeVdp vector was rescued by transient expression of the SeV Fmut, HN, and M (Cl.151) genes (driven by the SRα promoter derived from pcDL-SRα) (18Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the packaging cells as described above and recovered into the culture supernatant after incubation at 32 °C for 4 days. Fmut, a modified F gene for expressing the protease-susceptible SeV F protein, was generated as described (17Taira H. Sato T. Segawa H. Chiba M. Katsumata T. Iwasaki K. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filters and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Titers of SeVdp vectors were determined by examining LLCMK2 cells infected with a diluted SeVdp vector suspension using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-NP rabbit polyclonal antibody. Long term stability of gene expression mediated by the SeVdp vectors was examined in LLCMK2 cells and in human primary fibroblasts (TIG3) cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For examining stability under antibiotic selection, the cells were incubated in the presence of blasticidin S (Bs) (5 μg/ml), hygromycin B (200 μg/ml), or a mixture of blasticidin S (5 μg/ml) and zeocin (Zeo) (100 μg/ml). For examining stability without selection, the cells were preselected with antibiotics and then cultured without selection. The presence of SeVdp was determined by detecting SeV NP antigen with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, counterstained with DAPI. EGFP, KO, and KR were detected by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using specific filters customized for these proteins. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences; see Figs. 2B and 3, E and F) and with FISHMAN R (On-chip Biotechnologies, Tokyo, Japan; Fig. 3, G and H) according to the standard procedures provided by the manufacturers.FIGURE 3Compatibility of two independent SeVdp vectors in a single cell. A, genome structure of SeVdp(KO/Hyg/EGFP/Luc2CP) is shown. B, genome structure of SeVdp(Bsr/EGFP/CYBB) and SeVdp(Zeo/KO/CLuc), coexisting in a single cell is shown. C and D, fluorescence and phase-contrast micrographs of the cells described in schema (C) and in schema B (D) are shown. LLCMK2 cells were infected with the SeVdp vectors as described in Fig. 1C and selected with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) (C) or with zeocin (100 μg/ml) and blasticidin S (5 μg/ml) (D). Fluorescence images of KO and of EGFP were obtained separately with specific filter sets, converted to artificial color (green for EGFP and red for KO), and merged using iVision software (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA). E–H, quantitative analysis of EGFP and KO expression by flow cytometry is shown. The cells shown in C (E and G) or in D (F and H) were harvested as single-cell suspensions with trypsin, and the fluorescent signals were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) for quantifying the signals of EGFP (FL1, 515–545 nm) and KO (FL2, 564–606 nm) after compensation (E and F) and analyzed with FISHMAN R (On-tip Biotechnologies) for determining the ratio of the signals of EGFP and KO in each cell as a histogram (G and H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All experiments using human resources were performed according to National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and National Institutes of Health Sciences guidelines. OP9 cells (19Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) (provided by the RIKEN BioResource Center through the National Bio-Resource Project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan) were cultured with minimal essential medium-α containing 20% FCS and 4 mm l-glutamine. Human umbilical cord blood was collected after a normal pregnancy and delivery after obtaining informed consent from the mothers. Human mononuclear cells were isolated from the cord blood using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. CD133/1(+) cells were prepared from mononuclear cells using CD133 microbead kits and an AutoMACS system (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) with a purity greater than 90%, confirmed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur. The purified CD133/1(+) cells were infected with SeVdp(Bsr/ΔF/KO) at a multiplicity of infection of 4 at 37 °C for 2 h. For examining the efficiency of gene delivery, the infected cells were cultured for 10 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 20% FCS, 8 mm L-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/ml human stem cell factor, 5 ng/ml interleukin-6 (IL-6), 5 ng/ml IL-3, 25 ng/ml flt-3 ligand (all from PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and 50 ng/ml human thrombopoietin (Kirin, Tokyo, Japan), and the fraction of KO-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). For long term culture-initiating cell assays (20Croisille L. Auffray I. Katz A. Izac B. Vainchenker W. Coulombel L. Blood. 1994; 84: 4116-4124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 20- 200 SeVdp-infected cells were seeded on 1.25 × 104 γ-ray-irradiated OP9 cells in 96-well plates in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 12.5% FCS, 12.5% horse serum, 8 mm L-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm hydrocortisone for 5 weeks; half of the medium was exchanged every week. Then whole cells in a well were recovered and cultured in 300 μl of semisolid colony-forming cell assay medium (MethoCult GF+ H4433, StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) in 48-well plates. After culturing for 2 weeks, the numbers of KO-positive colonies were determined. The sequences of siRNAs against SeV NP, P, and L mRNAs (designed and synthesized by iGENE Therapeutics, Tokyo, Japan) used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. For examining the effect of siRNAs on the infection of replication-competent SeV vectors (supplemental Fig. S4A), 2 × 104 HeLa cells were seeded in 48-well plates with DMEM containing 10% FCS on day 0. On day 1, the cells were treated with siRNAs (100 nm) mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 6 h, then infected with SeV Cl.151(EGFP) at a multiplicity of infection of 100. The medium was replaced on day 2, and the cells were examined using fluorescence microscopy on day 4. For examining the effect of siRNAs on the removal of SeVdp vector from BHK-21 cells expressing the T7 RNA polymerase and F protein of the SeV Nagoya strain constitutively (BHK/T7/NaF cells) (supplemental Fig. S4B), 1 × 104 cells harboring SeVdp(M/EGFP/Bsr) were seeded in 48-well plates on day 0. On day 1 the cells were treated with siRNA (100 nm) mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. On day 5, the cells were examined using fluorescence microscopy. In both of these experiments, siRNA against firefly luciferase (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) was used as a control. For examining the effect of siRNA on the removal of SeVdp vector using luciferase activity as a quantitative index (Fig. 4), 1.5 × 105 (Fig. 4B) or 3 × 104 (Fig. 4C) HeLa cells harboring SeVdp(KO/Hyg/EGFP/Luc2CP) were seeded with siRNAs (40 nm) mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as described above on day 0 in a 6-well plate (Fig. 4B) or in a 24-well plate (Fig. 4C), respectively. siRNA against Renilla reniformis luciferase (22Sano M. Sierant M. Miyagishi M. Nakanishi M. Takagi Y. Sutou S. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5812-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used as a control. The cells were passaged with fresh siRNA on days 3 and 7, and the culture medium was replaced on the next day at each point. Firefly luciferase activity in the cell extract was determined on the indicated day using a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Specific luciferase activity was determined by normalizing against the amount of protein, determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates prepared on days 3, 7, and 12 were also analyzed by Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-SeV L protein rabbit antibody (2 μg/ml). For certifying complete removal of the SeVdp genome, the cells harboring SeVdp(KO/Hyg/EGFP/Luc2CP) and treated with siRNA as described above were cultured in the absence of siRNA for 4 weeks. Then, 1 × 104 of the cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured in the presence of hygromycin B (100 μg/ml) for 10 days. The surviving cells were fixed, then stained with 0.01% crystal violet. SDS-PAGE and protein blotting were performed as described (23Okabe J. Eguchi A. Wadhwa R. Rakwal R. Tsukinoki R. Hayakawa T. Nakanishi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For filter trap assays to detect the NP antigen (Table 1), culture supernatants of the cells harboring SeVdp vectors were passed through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filters, trapped onto supported nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad) by vacuum filtration, and probed with an anti-SeV NP monoclonal mouse antibody.TABLE 1Determination of infectious virions and the NP protein in the culture supernatant of the cells harboring SeV Cl.151-based vectorsStructural genesNP proteinNumber of Bsr coloniesng/day/105 cellsMaReplication-competent vector.FaReplication-competent vector.HNaReplication-competent vector.8.75> 106–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.FHN5.36366M–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.HN7.622MF–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.72.0510M–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.2.51cBackground caused by spontaneous cell lysis.0–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.F–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.2.76cBackground caused by spontaneous cell lysis.0–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.HN2.61cBackground caused by spontaneous cell lysis.0–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.–bCorresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.2.56cBackground caused by spontaneous cell lysis.0a Replication-competent vector.b Corresponding genes were deleted or replaced with exogenous genes.c Background caused by spontaneous cell lysis. Open table in a new tab Isolation and culture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a Nanog/GFP knock-in mouse (provided by the Riken BioResource Center) (MEF/Nanog-GFP), reprogramming with retroviral vectors and culture of mouse iPS cells were performed as described previously (24Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). Retroviral vectors installed separately with Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (RvMX4) were prepared as described (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19304) Google Scholar) using template DNA obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). For reprogramming with SeVdp vectors installed with Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, 1.25 × 105 of MEF/Nanog-GFP-expressing cells were infected with SeVdp vectors at 32 °C for 14 h. Then 1.0 × 103 of infected cells were seeded onto the feeder cells in 6-well plates and cultured as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. The numbers of iPS colonies expressing GFP were determined using fluorescent microscopy. At 10 days after SeVdp infection, GFP-positive clones were isolated and treated with siRNA L527 as described above. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Assays were performed using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and the primer sets listed in supplemental Table S2. Template cDNA was synthesized with random primers using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from 2 μg of total cellular RNA isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Bisulfite sequencing analysis was performed using the EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with primer sets listed in supplemental Table S2. The PCR DNA fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced by TAKARA BIO INC. (Shiga, Japan). Telomerase activity was determined using the Quantitative Telomerase Detection kit (Allied Biotech, Vallejo, CA). Teratoma formation was performed by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 106 SeVdp-iPS cells (clone #13) into SCID mice. Tumors recovered at necropsy after 6 weeks were processed for fixing and paraffin wax embedding, sectioned (4 μm), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological findings were evaluated using a DM3000 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Chimera animals were generated by microinjection of iPS cells into eight-cell or morula stage embryos. The embryos were collected in Medium 2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) from oviduct and uterus of ICR female mice 2.5 days post-coitum. These embryos were transferred into potassium simplex optimized medium with amino acids (KSOM-AA, Millipore) and cultured for 1–2 h. iPS cells were trypsinized and suspended in iPS cell culture medium. A piezo-driven micro-manipulator (Prime Tech, Tokyo, Japan) was used to drill zona pellucida under the microscope, and 10–15 iPS cells were introduced into the subzonal space of individual 8-cell or morula-stage embryos. After injection, embryos underwent follow-up culture in KSOM-AA for 24 h (until blastomere stage) and then were transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant recipient ICR female mice. The SeV genome consists of six independent cistrons (NP, P/C/V, M, F, HN, and L), encoding eight proteins (10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 689-724Google Scholar). Each cistron is preceded by a gene-start signal (3′-UCCCNNUUUC) and is followed by a gene-end signal (3′-AUUCUUUUU), which are the only essential cis-elements for transcription (25Plattet P. Strahle L. le Mercier P. Hausmann S. Garcin D. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 2007; 362: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This simple structure of each cistron makes it easier to design a defective viral vector by gene replacement. The NP, P, and L genes of SeV encode a major NP and two subunits of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (P and L), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2153820061,"Meiotic double-strand break (DSB)-initiated recombination must occur between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (""homolog bias""), even though sister chromatids are present. Through physical recombination analyses, we show that sister cohesion, normally mediated by meiotic cohesin Rec8, promotes ""sister bias""; that meiosis-specific axis components Red1/Mek1kinase counteract this effect, thereby satisfying an essential precondition for homolog bias; and that other components, probably recombinosome-related, directly ensure homolog partner selection. Later, Rec8 acts positively to ensure maintenance of bias. These complexities mirror opposing dictates for global sister cohesion versus local separation and differentiation of sisters at recombination sites. Our findings support DSB formation within axis-tethered recombinosomes containing both sisters and ensuing programmed sequential release of ""first"" and ""second"" DSB ends. First-end release would create a homology-searching ""tentacle."" Rec8 and Red1/Mek1 also independently license recombinational progression and abundantly localize to different domains. These domains could comprise complementary environments that integrate inputs from DSB repair and mitotic chromosome morphogenesis into the complete meiotic program."
https://openalex.org/W2165832576,"Although spiral waves are ubiquitous features of nature and have been observed in many biological systems, their existence and potential function in mammalian cerebral cortex remain uncertain. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that spiral waves occur frequently in the neocortex in vivo, both during pharmacologically induced oscillations and during sleep-like states. While their life span is limited, spiral waves can modify ongoing cortical activity by influencing oscillation frequencies and spatial coherence and by reducing amplitude in the area surrounding the spiral phase singularity. During sleep-like states, the rate of occurrence of spiral waves varies greatly depending on brain states. These results support the hypothesis that spiral waves, as an emergent activity pattern, can organize and modulate cortical population activity on the mesoscopic scale and may contribute to both normal cortical processing and to pathological patterns of activity such as those found in epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2089942817,"Defective transepithelial electrolyte transport is thought to initiate cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Yet, how loss of CFTR affects electrolyte transport remains uncertain. CFTR−/− pigs spontaneously develop lung disease resembling human CF. At birth, their airways exhibit a bacterial host defense defect, but are not inflamed. Therefore, we studied ion transport in newborn nasal and tracheal/bronchial epithelia in tissues, cultures, and in vivo. CFTR−/− epithelia showed markedly reduced Cl- and HCO3- transport. However, in contrast to a widely held view, lack of CFTR did not increase transepithelial Na+ or liquid absorption or reduce periciliary liquid depth. Like human CF, CFTR−/− pigs showed increased amiloride-sensitive voltage and current, but lack of apical Cl- conductance caused the change, not increased Na+ transport. These results indicate that CFTR provides the predominant transcellular pathway for Cl- and HCO3- in porcine airway epithelia, and reduced anion permeability may initiate CF airway disease."
https://openalex.org/W2084035329,"Cellular mRNAs exist in messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes, which undergo transitions during the lifetime of the mRNAs and direct posttranscriptional gene regulation. A final posttranscriptional step in gene expression is the turnover of the mRNP, which involves degradation of the mRNA and recycling of associated proteins. How tightly associated protein components are released from degrading mRNPs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ATPase activity of the RNA helicase Upf1 allows disassembly of mRNPs undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the absence of Upf1 ATPase activity, partially degraded NMD mRNA intermediates accumulate in complex with NMD factors and concentrate in processing bodies. Thus, disassembly and completion of turnover of mRNPs undergoing NMD requires ATP hydrolysis by Upf1. This uncovers a previously unappreciated and potentially regulated step in mRNA decay and raises the question of how other mRNA decay pathways release protein components of substrate mRNPs."
https://openalex.org/W1967276782,"The specific functions of the prodomains of TGFβ superfamily members are largely unknown. Interactions are known between prodomains of TGFβ-1-3 and latent TGFβ-binding proteins and between prodomains of BMP-2, -4, -7, and -10 and GDF-5 and fibrillins, raising the possibility that latent TGFβ-binding proteins and fibrillins may mediate interactions with all other prodomains of this superfamily. This possibility is tested in this study. Results show that the prodomain of BMP-5 interacts with the N-terminal regions of fibrillin-1 and -2 in a site similar to the binding sites for other bone morphogenetic proteins. However, in contrast, the prodomain of GDF-8 (myostatin) interacts with the glycosaminoglycan side chains of perlecan. The binding site for the GDF-8 prodomain is likely the heparan sulfate chain present on perlecan domain V. These results support and extend the emerging concept that TGFβ superfamily prodomains target their growth factor dimers to extracellular matrix macromolecules. In addition, biochemical studies of prodomain·growth factor complexes were performed to identify inactive complexes. For some members of the superfamily, the prodomain is noncovalently associated with its growth factor dimer in an inactive complex; for others, the prodomain·growth factor complex is active, even though the prodomain is noncovalently associated with its growth factor dimer. Results show that the BMP-10 prodomain, in contrast to BMP-4, -5, and -7 prodomains, can inhibit the bioactivity of the BMP-10 growth factor and suggest that the BMP-10 complex is like TGFβ and GDF-8 complexes, which can be activated by cleavage of the associated prodomain."

Postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders: Meeting at the synapse?.Science. 2003; 302: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Consistent with the physiological relevance of synapse-organizing molecules, links of SynCAM 1 and cadherins to autism-spectrum disorders have also been reported (Wang et al., 2009Wang K. Zhang H. Ma D. Bucan M. Glessner J.T. Abrahams B.S. Salyakina D. Imielinski M. Bradfield J.P.

Commun. 2008; 377: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Among the select proteins that drive synapse formation, SynCAM 1 (also known as Cadm1 and nectin-like molecule 2) is the founding member of a family of four immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins that are expressed throughout the developing and mature brain (Biederer, 2006Biederer T.

Akins M.R. Biederer T. Expression and adhesion profiles of SynCAM molecules indicate distinct neuronal functions.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SynCAM 1 participates in axo-dendritic interactions, indicating early roles in the contact-mediated differentiation of synapses (Stagi et al., 2010Stagi M. Fogel A.I. Biederer T. SynCAM 1 participates in axo-dendritic contact assembly and shapes neuronal growth cones.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At later developmental stages, SynCAM proteins are enriched in pre- and postsynaptic plasma membranes and engage in specific homo- and heterophilic adhesive interactions (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C.

Functionally, the heterophilic partners SynCAM 1 and SynCAM 2 drive presynaptic terminal formation in cultured neurons and increase the number of excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite the significant molecular insights into the synapse-organizing roles of trans-synaptic interactions, three decisive aspects remain insufficiently understood. First, to which extent are synapse numbers regulated by synaptic adhesion in the brain? Second, at which steps during the lifetime of synapses are individual synaptic adhesion molecules engaged? Third, do these synapse-organizing proteins alter synaptic physiology and affect neuronal network functions? We now demonstrate that SynCAM 1 significantly impacts these three aspects. Combining electron microscopy, Golgi staining, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that elevated expression of SynCAM 1 in a transgenic mouse model increases functional excitatory synapse number. This activity corresponds to its endogenous role, as SynCAM 1 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit fewer excitatory synapses. Moreover, SynCAM 1 functions dynamically at developing synapses: Using the temporal control afforded by the design of our transgenic model, we show that continued SynCAM 1 elevation is required to maintain the increase in synapse number it drives in the first place. Unexpectedly, SynCAM 1 additionally alters the plasticity of synapses once they are formed, with its overexpression abrogating long-term depression (LTD) and its loss increasing LTD. These complementary changes in synapse number and plasticity correlate with altered cognitive functions and SynCAM 1 KO mice exhibit improved spatial learning. Our results reveal important contributions of SynCAM 1 to excitatory synapse number and function in the developing and adult brain. This supports a model that synaptic adhesion by SynCAM 1 can promote synapse formation and restrict synaptic plasticity to regulate the wiring and remodeling of neuronal circuits. To gain better molecular insight into SynCAM properties in vivo, we determined the abundance of the four SynCAM family members. Quantitative immunoblotting of synaptic plasma membranes purified at postnatal day 9 (P9), when excitatory synapse formation begins to peak in the forebrain, showed that the heterophilic adhesion partners SynCAM 1 and 2 accounted for 0.41 ng/μg and 4.0 ng/μg of total synaptic membrane proteins, respectively. SynCAM 3 and 4 were present at 0.46 ng/μg and 0.20 ng/μg in this fraction. Thus, 0.5% of synaptic membrane proteins were comprised of SynCAM proteins at this developmental stage, a high fraction even when compared to the most abundant synaptic protein CaMKII that constitutes 7% of the postsynaptic density (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E. Schlager M.A. Duong D.M. Xu P. Wijayawardana S.R. Hanfelt J. Nakagawa T. et al.Relative and absolute quantification of postsynaptic density proteome isolated from rat forebrain and cerebellum.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, SynCAM proteins were prominent in brain homogenates (see Table S1 available online) where they are considerably more abundant than neuroligins (Varoqueaux et al., 2006Varoqueaux F. Aramuni G. Rawson R.L. Mohrmann R. Missler M. Gottmann K. Zhang W. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Neuroligins determine synapse maturation and function.Neuron. 2006; 51: 741-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). This prominent expression indicated that SynCAM proteins could play important roles at synapses. Redundancy and compensation between synapse-organizing proteins may preclude the identification of phenotypes in mice lacking single synaptic adhesion molecules as previously reported (Varoqueaux et al., 2006Varoqueaux F. Aramuni G. Rawson R.L. Mohrmann R. Missler M. Gottmann K. Zhang W. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Neuroligins determine synapse maturation and function.Neuron. 2006; 51: 741-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Specifically, the single loss of SynCAM 1 in KO mice may be compensated by other SynCAM family members or functionally related proteins. We therefore reasoned that elevating SynCAM 1 in neurons may expose its in vivo activities more readily than a loss-of-function approach. To pursue the overexpression of SynCAM 1 in vivo, we generated a mouse line carrying a transgene encoding flag-epitope tagged SynCAM 1 under the control of a Tet-responsive element (TRE) (Mansuy and Bujard, 2000Mansuy I.M. Bujard H. Tetracycline-regulated gene expression in the brain.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). This line was crossed to mice transgenically expressing the transcriptional transactivator tTA from the CaMKII promoter, which is active in excitatory forebrain neurons (Mayford et al., 1996Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Control of memory formation through regulated expression of a CaMKII transgene.Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In the resulting TRE-SynCAM 1flag x CaMKII-tTA mice, tTA mediated the expression of the transgenic SynCAM 1flag protein throughout neurons in the forebrain, similar to its endogenous distribution (Figures S1A and S1B) (Thomas et al., 2008Thomas L.A. Akins M.R. Biederer T. Expression and adhesion profiles of SynCAM molecules indicate distinct neuronal functions.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mice carrying only the CaMKII-tTA transgene did not exhibit altered SynCAM 1 protein levels (data not shown) and served as controls for transgenic SynCAM 1flag overexpressors (OE) in this study. The developmental profile of SynCAM 1flag protein expression in OE mice followed the increase of endogenous SynCAM 1 in the postnatal forebrain, without altering the expression of SynCAM 2-4 (Figure 1B). No change in the expression profile of other synaptic proteins was detected (Figure 1B) and quantitative immunoblotting at P28 confirmed that the amounts of neuroligin 1, NCAM, and N-cadherin were unaltered in these mice (data not shown). Our transgenic design resulted in 8.4 ± 0.03-fold higher amounts of total SynCAM 1 in the hippocampus at P28, without affecting its expression in the cerebellum where the CaMKII promoter is inactive and tTA is not expressed (Figure 1C). This double-transgenic mouse model constitutes a Tet-Off system (Mansuy and Bujard, 2000Mansuy I.M. Bujard H. Tetracycline-regulated gene expression in the brain.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and administration of the tTA inhibitor doxycycline tightly repressed SynCAM 1flag approximately to control levels (Figure 1C). Subcellular fractionation confirmed the enrichment of overexpressed SynCAM 1 in synaptic plasma membranes purified from forebrain of adult OE mice, similar to endogenous SynCAM 1 in controls (Figure 1D). Consequently, total SynCAM 1 amounts were increased 8-fold in synaptic plasma membranes purified from the forebrain of adult OE mice (Figure S1C). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the correct subcellular sorting of SynCAM 1flag to synaptic regions, while cell body layers lacked staining (Figure 1E). Analysis at higher magnification revealed that the majority of vGlut1/2-positive excitatory synapses expressed SynCAM 1flag (Figure 1F), whereas it was not detected at inhibitory synapses marked by GAD65 (Figure 1G). This agreed with previous immunoelectron microscopic results that SynCAM proteins are endogenously present at excitatory synapses (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. SynCAM, a synaptic adhesion molecule that drives synapse assembly.Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). We additionally immunoprecipitated SynCAM 1 to test whether overexpression alters its extracellular interactions (Figure 1H). Control mice showed strong heterophilic interaction of SynCAM 1 with SynCAM 2 (lanes 1-4) as reported previously (Fogel et al., 2007Fogel A.I. Akins M.R. Krupp A.J. Stagi M. Stein V. Biederer T. SynCAMs organize synapses through heterophilic adhesion.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12516-12530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SynCAM 1 reduced the amount of bound SynCAM 2 (lanes 5–8), presumably because elevation of SynCAM 1 increased the formation of homophilic SynCAM 1 adhesion complexes and competed SynCAM 2 out of the heterophilic interaction. Heterophilic SynCAM 1/2 complexes were however still readily detected in the overexpressors, consistent with the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous SynCAM 2 with overexpressed SynCAM 1flag using anti-flag antibodies (Figure 1I). Together, this transgenic SynCAM 1 mouse model replicated the properties of endogenous SynCAM 1 and was suited to identify roles of SynCAM 1 in the postnatal brain. Using electron microscopy, we determined the effects of altered SynCAM 1 expression on the density and ultrastructure of excitatory (Gray type I, asymmetric) and inhibitory (Gray type II, symmetric) synapses in the CA1 stratum radiatum of the hippocampus (Figures 2A and 2H ). This area was selected as the morphological and physiological properties of its synapses are well characterized. Importantly, the density of excitatory synapses in SynCAM 1 overexpressing mice was increased by 26% ± 3%, while the number of the less abundant inhibitory synapses was not affected (Figure 2B). In addition, we used electron microscopy to count inhibitory synapses at perisomal regions of CA1 pyramidal neurons, where inhibitory synapses are prominent (Megias et al., 2001Megias M. Emri Z. Freund T.F. Gulyas A.I. Total number and distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). As in CA1 stratum radiatum, no difference in perisomal inhibitory synapse density was observed between SynCAM 1 OE and control mice (Figures S2A and S2B). These results demonstrated that SynCAM 1 specifically increases excitatory synapse number. They also show that the elevation of SynCAM 1 in the complex environment of the brain is not compensated by mechanisms negatively regulating excitatory synapse number. Further, these findings agree with the synaptogenic activities of SynCAM 1 previously demonstrated in cultured hippocampal neurons (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. SynCAM, a synaptic adhesion molecule that drives synapse assembly.Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, Fogel et al., 2007Fogel A.I. Akins M.R. Krupp A.J. Stagi M.

Atasoy D. Chubykin A. Mozhayeva M.G. Südhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. Selective capability of SynCAM and neuroligin for functional synapse assembly.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The absence of an effect on inhibitory synapse number in vivo was consistent with our transgenic design that overexpressed SynCAM 1 in excitatory forebrain neurons, similar to its endogenous expression pattern (Thomas et al., 2008Thomas L.A. Akins M.R. Biederer T. Expression and adhesion profiles of SynCAM molecules indicate distinct neuronal functions.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The average number of synaptic vesicles per excitatory terminal was not altered by SynCAM 1 overexpression (Figure 2C), and the thickness and length of the postsynaptic density (PSD) were also unchanged (Figures 2D and 2E). These results demonstrated that SynCAM 1 overexpression increases excitatory synapse number in vivo without altering their ultrastructure. We considered that our electron microscopic study was likely biased toward excitatory synapses on mushroom-type spines as these are most prominent and readily identifiable. For a comprehensive analysis of all spine types, we employed Golgi staining (Figure 2F) and classified spines of pyramidal neurons in CA1 stratum radiatum using described criteria (Knott et al., 2006Knott G.W. Holtmaat A. Wilbrecht L. Welker E. Svoboda K. Spine growth precedes synapse formation in the adult neocortex in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This demonstrated an increase in total spine density by 37% ± 10% in SynCAM 1 overexpressors. Morphometric scoring determined a 34% ± 10% increase in the density of mushroom-type spines per dendrite length, and a 4-fold increase in the number of the far less prominent thin spines (Figure 2G). The density of stubby spines and the small fraction of unclassifiable spine structures was unchanged (data not shown). These results agree with our electron microscopic analysis and additionally revealed an increased number of thin spines, which can correspond to sites of new synapses (Knott et al., 2006Knott G.W.

The effects of SynCAM 1 overexpression motivated us to analyze synapses in the brain of KO mice lacking SynCAM 1 to determine whether the organization of synapses is its endogenous function. The only previously known phenotype of SynCAM 1 KO neurons is their more exuberant growth cone morphology in early development (Stagi et al., 2010Stagi M. Fogel A.I. Biederer T. SynCAM 1 participates in axo-dendritic contact assembly and shapes neuronal growth cones.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), while synaptic changes remained to be addressed. The one apparent phenotype of these KO mice is male infertility due to impaired spermatid adhesion (Fujita et al., 2006Fujita E. Kouroku Y. Ozeki S. Tanabe Y. Toyama Y. Maekawa M. Kojima N. Senoo H. Toshimori K. Momoi T. Oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia in mice lacking RA175/TSLC1/SynCAM/IGSF4A, a cell adhesion molecule in the immunoglobulin superfamily.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our electron microscopic analysis of the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum at P28 showed that the number of excitatory synapses in SynCAM 1 KO mice was significantly reduced by 10% ± 3% (Figure 2I), demonstrating that it is a biological function of SynCAM 1 to contribute to synapse organization. As in SynCAM 1 overexpressors, the number of inhibitory synapses was neither affected in the CA1 stratum radiatum of KO mice (Figure 2I) nor in the stratum pyramidale (Figures S2C and S2D). The PSD length was reduced in SynCAM 1 KO mice by 19% ± 2%, concomitant with a reduction in active zone length by 15% ± 3%, while other parameters of synapse ultrastructure were unchanged (Figures 2J–2M). Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the presynaptic terminal area was unchanged in the KO (data not shown), indicating that these ultrastructural effects of SynCAM 1 loss result from impaired interactions across the synaptic cleft and are not due to a nonspecific reduction of synapse size. To address the developmental roles of SynCAM 1 at synapses, we analyzed KO mice at P14. Similar to the results at P28, the lack of SynCAM 1 reduced the number of excitatory synapses by 20% ± 6%, while inhibitory synapse density was unchanged (Figure 2N). PSD length was also shortened by 9% ± 2% (Figure 2O). SynCAM 1 therefore modulates excitatory synapse number at different stages of postnatal development. Moreover, our findings show that endogenous SynCAM 1 not only elevates synapse number but also plays a role in the structural organization of excitatory synapses. We noted a higher density of excitatory synapses in wild-type controls of the KO mice compared to the transgenic controls containing the tTA transgene alone (Figures 2B and 2I). This likely reflects the different genetic backgrounds of the KO and transgenic mouse strains used in this study. A rescue of the SynCAM 1 KO by transgenic overexpression was not performed because the male infertility of the KO left only breeding strategies with a very low likelihood of obtaining litters that included offspring carrying the SynCAM 1 gene deletion and both transgenes encoding SynCAM 1flag and tTA, and the required littermate controls. Together, the reciprocal effects of overexpression and loss on synapse density in these mouse models demonstrate that SynCAM 1 promotes excitatory synapse numbers in vivo. We next addressed whether the synapses gained by SynCAM 1 overexpression were functional. We used miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency as a measure of synapse number, as an increase in the number of functional synapses would increase the frequency of mEPSCs. Recordings were obtained from acute hippocampal slices at P14. Similar to the morphological data, we observed strain-dependent mEPSC differences between overexpressor and KO controls. We therefore only compared relative differences of overexpressors and KOs to their respective littermate controls. Consistent with the increase in morphologically defined synapses, transgenic animals continuously overexpressing SynCAM 1 (OEalways) exhibited a strong 2.1-fold increase in mEPSC frequency compared to control littermates carrying only the tTA transgene (Figures 3A and 3B ). mEPSC amplitude was not affected (Figure 3C). The transgenic design allowed us to continuously repress overexpression by administering doxycycline (see Figures 1C and 5B). These doxycycline-treated mice served as additional controls (OEnever) and their mEPSC frequencies and amplitudes were indistinguishable from those of tTA control littermates (Figures 3A–3C). Converse to the overexpression of SynCAM 1, its loss caused a strong reduction in mEPSC frequency by more than half compared to control wild-type littermates (Figures 3D and 3E). The unaltered mEPSC amplitude in the KO mice (Figure 3F) indicated that the density of AMPA receptors is not changed in their shortened PSD, as mEPSC amplitude reflects AMPA receptor density rather than total receptor number (Raghavachari and Lisman, 2004Raghavachari S. Lisman J.E. Properties of quantal transmission at CA1 synapses.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A similar phenotype of reduced PSD length and unaltered mEPSC amplitude has also been observed in Shank1 KO mice (Hung et al., 2008Hung A.Y. Futai K. Sala C. Va"
https://openalex.org/W2087865968,"The therapeutic and diagnostic efficiency of engineered small proteins, peptides, and chemical drug candidates is hampered by short in vivo serum half-life. Thus, strategies to tailor their biodistribution and serum persistence are highly needed. An attractive approach is to take advantage of the exceptionally long circulation half-life of serum albumin or IgG, which is attributed to a pH-dependent interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) rescuing these proteins from intracellular degradation. Here, we present molecular evidence that a minimal albumin binding domain (ABD) derived from streptococcal protein G can be used for efficient half-life extension by indirect targeting of FcRn. We show that ABD, and ABD recombinantly fused to an Affibody molecule, in complex with albumin does not interfere with the strictly pH-dependent FcRn-albumin binding kinetics. The same result was obtained in the presence of IgG. An in vivo study performed in rat confirmed that the clinically relevant human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeting Affibody molecule fused to ABD has a similar half-life and biodistribution profile as serum albumin. The proof-of-concept described may be broadly applicable to extend the in vivo half-life of short lived biological or chemical drugs ultimately resulting in enhanced therapeutic or diagnostic efficiency, a more favorable dosing regimen, and improved patient compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2111550789,"Acetylcholine release and activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) enhance synaptic plasticity in vitro and cognition and memory in vivo. Within the hippocampus, mAChRs promote NMDA-type glutamate receptor-dependent forms of long-term potentiation. Here, we use calcium (Ca) imaging combined with two-photon laser glutamate uncaging at apical spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons to examine postsynaptic mechanisms of muscarinic modulation of glutamatergic transmission. Uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials and Ca transients are increased by muscarinic stimulation; however, this is not due to direct modulation of glutamate receptors. Instead, mAChRs modulate a negative feedback loop in spines that normally suppresses synaptic signals. mAChR activation reduces the Ca sensitivity of small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels that are found in the spine, resulting in increased synaptic potentials and Ca transients. These effects are mediated by M1-type muscarinic receptors and occur in a casein kinase-2-dependent manner. Thus, muscarinic modulation regulates synaptic transmission by tuning the activity of nonglutamatergic postsynaptic ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W1972565986,"Our recent animal and human studies revealed that chronic hyponatremia is a previously unrecognized cause of osteoporosis that is associated with increased osteoclast numbers in a rat model of the human disease of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). We used cellular and molecular approaches to demonstrate that sustained low extracellular sodium ion concentrations ([Na(+)]) directly stimulate osteoclastogenesis and resorptive activity and to explore the mechanisms underlying this effect. Assays on murine preosteoclastic RAW 264.7 cells and on primary bone marrow monocytes both indicated that lowering the medium [Na(+)] dose-dependently increased osteoclast formation and resorptive activity. Low [Na(+)], rather than low osmolality, triggered these effects. Chronic reduction of [Na(+)] dose-dependently decreased intracellular calcium without depleting endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. Moreover, we found that reduction of [Na(+)] dose-dependently decreased cellular uptake of radiolabeled ascorbic acid, and reduction of ascorbic acid in the culture medium mimicked the osteoclastogenic effect of low [Na(+)]. We also detected downstream effects of reduced ascorbic acid uptake, namely evidence of hyponatremia-induced oxidative stress. This was manifested by increased intracellular free oxygen radical accumulation and proportional changes in protein expression and phosphorylation, as indicated by Western blot analysis from cellular extracts and by increased serum 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in vivo in rats. Our results therefore reveal novel sodium signaling mechanisms in osteoclasts that may serve to mobilize sodium from bone stores during prolonged hyponatremia, thereby leading to a resorptive osteoporosis in patients with SIADH."

https://openalex.org/W1981645566,"Deranged Ca(2+) signaling and an accumulation of aberrant proteins cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a hallmark of cell death implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are elusive. Here, we report that dysfunction of an ER-resident Ca(2+) channel, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R), promotes cell death during ER stress. Heterozygous knockout of brain-dominant type1 IP(3)R (IP(3)R1) resulted in neuronal vulnerability to ER stress in vivo, and IP(3)R1 knockdown enhanced ER stress-induced apoptosis via mitochondria in cultured cells. The IP(3)R1 tetrameric assembly was positively regulated by the ER chaperone GRP78 in an energy-dependent manner. ER stress induced IP(3)R1 dysfunction through an impaired IP(3)R1-GRP78 interaction, which has also been observed in the brain of Huntington's disease model mice. These results suggest that IP(3)R1 senses ER stress through GRP78 to alter the Ca(2+) signal to promote neuronal cell death implicated in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1963883410,"Complexin activates and clamps neurotransmitter release; impairing complexin function decreases synchronous, but increases spontaneous and asynchronous synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Here, we show that complexin-different from the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1-activates synchronous exocytosis by promoting synaptic vesicle priming, but clamps spontaneous and asynchronous exocytosis-similar to synaptotagmin-1-by blocking a secondary Ca(2+) sensor. Activation and clamping functions of complexin depend on distinct, autonomously acting sequences, namely its N-terminal region and accessory α helix, respectively. Mutations designed to test whether the accessory α helix of complexin clamps exocytosis by inserting into SNARE-complexes support this hypothesis, suggesting that the accessory α helix blocks completion of trans-SNARE-complex assembly until Ca(2+) binding to synaptotagmin relieves this block. Moreover, a juxtamembranous mutation in the SNARE-protein synaptobrevin-2, which presumably impairs force transfer from nascent trans-SNARE complexes onto fusing membranes, also unclamps spontaneous fusion by disinhibiting a secondary Ca(2+) sensor. Thus, complexin performs mechanistically distinct activation and clamping functions that operate in conjunction with synaptotagmin-1 by controlling trans-SNARE-complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1999983425,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is widely implicated in various pathological conditions such as diabetes. Previously, we reported that enhanced ER stress contributes to inflammation and vascular damage in diabetic and ischemia-induced retinopathy. However, the exact role of the signaling pathways activated by ER stress in vascular inflammation remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) in retinal adhesion molecule expression, leukostasis, and vascular leakage. Exposure of human retinal endothelial cells to low dose ER stress inducers resulted in a robust activation of XBP1 but did not affect inflammatory gene expression. However, ER stress preconditioning almost completely abolished TNF-α-elicited NF-κB activation and adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Pharmaceutical inhibition of XBP1 activation or knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA markedly attenuated the effects of preconditioning on inflammation. Moreover, loss of XBP1 led to an increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Conversely, overexpression of spliced XBP1 attenuated TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65, accompanied by decreased NF-κB activity and reduced adhesion molecule expression. Finally, in vivo studies show that activation of XBP1 by ER stress preconditioning prevents TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, leukostasis, and vascular leakage in mouse retinas. These results collectively indicate a protective effect of ER stress preconditioning against retinal endothelial inflammation, which is likely through activation of XBP1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) and inhibition of NF-κB activation."

This is not surprising, given the little available data on motion response in V2 and the reports that indicate little directional response in macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta) V2 (e.g., Levitt et al., 1994Levitt J.B. Kiper D.C. Movshon J.A. Receptive fields and functional architecture of macaque V2.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 2517-2542PubMed Google Scholar). However, given the well-described anatomical projection from V2 thick stripes to middle temporal area (MT) (Shipp and Zeki, 1985Shipp S. Zeki S.

We approached this by investigating possible functional organization for direction selectivity in V2. In our view, the presence of a functional organization for a particular parameter points to features that are central to a cortical area's defining role. For example, MT, an area central to motion processing, contains a well-described functional organization for direction selectivity (Albright et al., 1984Albright T.D. Desimone R. Gross C.G.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1398-1415PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a hue map in V2 thin stripes reinforces the idea that thin stripes are important for processing of color information (Xiao et al., 2003Xiao Y. Wang Y. Felleman D.J. A spatially organized representation of colour in macaque cortical area V2.Nature. 2003; 421: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Lim et al., 2009Lim H. Wang Y. Xiao Y. Hu M. Felleman D.J. Organization of hue selectivity in macaque V2 thin stripes.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 2603-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Evidence of functional organization for objects or faces in monkey anterior inferotemporal cortex enhances the concept that it is an area important for object vision (e.g., Wang et al., 1996Wang G.

Representation of Visual Features of Objects in the Inferotemporal Cortex.Neural Netw. 1996; 9: 1459-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this vein, we examined whether there are direction maps in V2. We have established standard methods for revealing the different functional stripe types (thin, pale, and thick) with optical imaging methods (for review, see Roe and T'so, 1997; Roe, 2003Roe A.W.

As a full thin/pale/thick/pale stripe cycle spans approximately 4 mm, multiple stripes of a single type can be readily imaged within a single cm-sized field of view. Briefly, thin stripes are mapped based on hue-specific responses or by mapping preference to isoluminant color gratings versus luminance gratings of the same spatial frequency (Roe and Ts'o, 1995Roe A.W.

Thick stripes can be distinguished from pale and thin stripes based on preference for binocularity over monocularity (Ts'o et al., 2001Ts'o D.Y. Roe A.W. Gilbert C.D.

Lu H.D. Roe A.W. A map for horizontal disparity in monkey V2.Neuron. 2008; 58: 442-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Some thick stripes contain color-selective cells and color response (Ts'o et al., 2001Ts'o D.Y. Roe A.W. Gilbert C.D. A hierarchy of the functional organization for color, form and disparity in primate visual area V2.Vision Res. 2001; 41: 1333-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the location of thin, pale, and thick stripes can be determined based on differential imaging methods. In this study, we found clear evidence of direction maps in V2, consistent with locations of thick stripes, and, in contrast, no evidence of direction maps in V1. Four hemispheres (cases 1–4) in three macaques were imaged in this study. Because the presence of motion maps in V1 and V2 had not been found previously, we wondered whether it could be due to the possibility that motion signals are weak under anesthesia and therefore more difficult to detect. There has also been a report on the presence of more direction-selective neurons in the superficial layers (including layer 2/3) of V1 in awake monkeys than in anesthetized monkeys (Gur et al., 2005Gur M. Kagan I. Snodderly D.M. Orientation and direction selectivity of neurons in V1 of alert monkeys: Functional relationships and laminar distributions.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore imaged visual cortex in both anesthetized and awake monkeys (cf. Roe, 2007Roe A.W. Long-term optical imaging of intrinsic signals in anesthetized and awake monkeys.Appl. Opt. 2007; 46: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two hemispheres (case 1 and case 3) from monkeys M1 and M2 were imaged in both awake and anesthetized conditions. The other two hemispheres (case 2 from M2 and case 4 from M3) were imaged in the anesthetized condition. Figure 1A illustrates the approximate location of a roughly 2 cm chamber over V1 and V2 and the blood vessel map at this location (Figure 1B). Figures 1C–1G illustrate standard functional organizations revealed in a single imaging session by such large field optical imaging. Each image is a difference map that is obtained by subtracting the sum of images collected from one condition from those of another condition (condition subtractions are illustrated below each image). The V1/V2 border is revealed by imaging for ocular dominance (Figure 1C). Because much of V2 is buried in the lunate sulcus in the macaque, what we know about functional organization in V2 is largely derived from this 1–3 mm region between the lunate and the V1/V2 border (for review, see Roe, 2003Roe A.W. Modular complexity of Area V2 in the Macaque monkey.in: Collins C. Kaas J. The Primate Visual System. CRC Press, New York, NY2003: 109-138Crossref Google Scholar). Retinotopic layout of such large fields of view can be imaged by multiple methods (e.g., Lu et al., 2009Lu H.D. Chen G. Ts'o D.Y. Roe A.W. A rapid topographic mapping and eye alignment method using optical imaging in Macaque visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2009; 44: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We illustrate one method resulting from subtraction of responses to two stationary phase-shifted squarewave gratings (Figure 1D). Typical orientation organization in V1 and V2 can also be imaged, as shown by the color-coded orientation preference map in Figure 1E and the two-orientation subtraction map in Figure 1F. As shown by previous studies (e.g., Roe and Ts'o, 1995Roe A.W. Ts'o D.Y. Visual topography in primate V2: Multiple representation across functional stripes.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3689-3715PubMed Google Scholar, Lu and Roe, 2007Lu H.D. Roe A.W. Optical imaging of contrast response in Macaque monkey V1 and V2.Cereb.

Color activation maps (subtraction of isoluminant red/green and achromatic luminance conditions) identify locations of blobs in V1 and thin stripes in V2 (Figure 1G; locations of thin stripes are indicated by green arrowheads in the middle panel in Figure 1J) (cf.

Roe A.W. Functional organization of color domains in V1 and V2 of macaque monkey revealed by optical imaging.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 516-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To examine whether there is any functional organization for directional response in V1 and V2, we imaged cortical response to random dot patterns drifting in single directions. Figure 1H shows the direction map obtained by subtracting images obtained in response to two random dot patterns moving in opposite directions (left and right). Since dot size (0.04°), density (10%), speed (8°/s), and luminance (30 cd/m2) were identical between the two conditions, preference for one condition over the other represents the difference in directional preference (dark pixels: rightward preference, light pixels: leftward preference, shown expanded in Figure 1I). Except for the blood vessels, the map in V1 is largely gray, indicating a lack of detectable direction preference organization in V1. In V2, however, five clusters of dark/white patches are evident (red arrowheads), indicating regions in V2 with preference for rightward (dark pixels) and leftward (light pixels) directional preference. Note that the leftmost red arrowhead in Figure 1I points to a region with two clusters of directional domains (one closer to the lunate sulcus and one closer to the V1/V2 border), indicating that single thick stripes can contain more than one direction-selective region. Based correlations previously established (with both electrophysiological and imaging methods) between functional preference (orientation, color, luminance, and disparity) in V2 and CO stripes (thin, thick, and pale stripes) (e.g., Roe and Ts'o, 1995Roe A.W.

A map for horizontal disparity in monkey V2.Neuron. 2008; 58: 442-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we aligned the maps for orientation selectivity, color selectivity, and direction selectivity to determine in which stripes these direction domains are located. As shown in Figure 1J (f, g, and h are enlarged regions of V2 shown in boxed regions of Figures 1F, 1G, and 1H, respectively), the locations of direction-selective domains (indicated by red arrowheads in h) align with the orientation-selective zones (indicated by cyan bars in f) and avoid the thin stripe zones (indicated by green arrowheads in g), indicating that these direction-selective domains fall within thick/pale zones. In each of the four hemispheres examined, we found direction maps in V2, but no evidence of direction maps in V1. Figure 2 illustrates cortical maps obtained from case 2 (Figures 2A–2C, monkey M2) and case 3 (Figures 2D–2F, monkey M1). In case 2 (Figures 2A–2C), orientation, color, and direction maps were obtained from an anesthetized monkey. Because this is an 8 mm field of view, two stripes of each type are expected within each image. Such imaging reveals alternating regions of orientation preference (Figure 2A, indicated by cyan bars above) that correspond to thick/pale stripes in V2 and regions revealed by color versus luminance preference that correspond to thin stripes in V2 (Figure 2B, indicated by green arrowheads above). The regions of direction selectivity in V2 (Figure 2C, two activation zones indicated by red arrowheads) fall within the locations of thick/pale stripes as revealed by orientation response in V2 (cyan bars from Figure 2A) and fall outside regions preferentially responsive to color (Figure 2B). Figures 2D–2F (case 3) are imaged from an awake, fixating monkey. Plotting conventions are the same as in Figures 2A–2C. Similar to what is seen in the anesthetized monkey, orientation maps reveal broad activation regions in V2 that identify thick/pale stripes (Figure 2D), and color maps reveal largely complementary locations of thin stripes (Figure 2E). In this case, some color activation is observed within the thick/pale region identified by orientation mapping (Figure 2D), consistent with the presence of color response in disparity-selective thick stripes (Ts'o et al., 2001Ts'o D.Y. Roe A.W. Gilbert C.D. A hierarchy of the functional organization for color, form and disparity in primate visual area V2.Vision Res. 2001; 41: 1333-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Directional domains are also observed, located within thick/pale zones in V2 (red arrowheads located in the middle of cyan bars in Figure 2F). The same cortical region in case 3 was also imaged under anesthetized conditions and the same stimulus settings. For cortical regions imaged in both awake and anesthetized conditions (case 1 and case 3), we found that, except for signal magnitude, the anesthetized maps are very similar to the awake ones (See Figure S1 available online). In four hemispheres of three monkeys, we have imaged a total of 12 direction-selective clusters. All of these overlapped with pale/thick/pale stripes of V2 and did not overlap with thin stripes. Nine out of the twelve clusters aligned with the centers of the pale/thick/pale stripe regions, consistent with previous reports of direction-selective neurons in V2 thick stripes (Hubel and Livingstone, 1987Hubel D.H. Livingstone M.S. Segregation of form, color, and stereopsis in primate area 18.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3378-3415PubMed Google Scholar, Levitt et al., 1994Levitt J.B. Kiper D.C. Movshon J.A.

The functional organization of area V2, I: Specialization across stripes and layers.Vis. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 187-210PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining three clusters were located within, although not centered on, the pale/thick/pale orientation regions. To further examine the relationship of these direction domains to V2 stripes, we measured the spacing between direction domain clusters. We found that the average distance between two clusters of direction domains in vivo (4.0 ± 0.9 mm, n = 8) is consistent with the spacing between CO thick stripes in histologically processed tissue (4.0–4.25 mm for a full cytochrome oxidase (CO) cycle, Tootell and Hamilton, 1989Tootell R.B. Hamilton S.L. Functional anatomy of the second visual area (V2) in the macaque.J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2620-2644PubMed Google Scholar, Roe and Ts'o, 1995Roe A.W. Ts'o D.Y.

The functional architecture of Area V2 in the Macaque monkey.in: Rockland K. Kaas J.H. Peters A. Cerebral Cortex, Vol. 12: Extrastriate Cortex in Primates. Plenum Press, New York1997: 295-333Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, direction domains tend to be centered between two thin stripes: the average distance between direction domains and the nearby color domains (thin stripes) is 2.0 ± 0.6 mm, or half of the thin-thin cycle width. The direction clusters were roughly centered between thin stripes, as there was no difference in distance to the medially located (1.9 ± 0.7 mm) and the laterally located (2.0 ± 0.6 mm) thin stripe (t test, p = 0.68). In 11/12 cases, the direction domain clusters were clearly separated from the color activation regions. Only in one case did the direction domains appear adjacent to a color-activated zone. Thus, the bulk of the evidence suggests that the direction domains fall within the thick stripes. Although we do not as yet have histological confirmation of this (as the monkeys are still being used in awake imaging studies), given the amount of functional evidence (mapping for color and orientation), supported with a large body of previous studies, we are confident in our stripe localization. Therefore, our results suggest that direction maps in V2 are localized to the thick/pale stripes and most often correspond to thick stripe locations. We examined the detailed spatial structure of direction-selective domains within single clusters. Two examples (same domains as the left motion domain in Figure 2C and the left motion domain in Figure 2F) are shown expanded in Figure 3. In Figures 3A and 3C, each of the panels is a subtraction between the direction indicated by the corresponding arrow (shown in the center of figure) and its opposite direction. For example, the right panel in the middle row is a subtraction of rightward (dark pixels: right preferring) and leftward (light pixels: left preferring) drifting random dots. In Figure 3A, comparison of these maps reveals that shifts in stimulus direction results in shifts in the location of activation within the thick/pale stripe. This shifting with respect to direction preference can be viewed in Movie S1 available online. Both difference maps and single-condition maps show shifting of focal activation in response to random dot patterns drifting in different directions (see Figure S2). The movie reveals that activated regions shift smoothly with each shift in the direction of the moving random dots, resulting in a pinwheel-like pattern. This systematic representation is also illustrated in Figure 3B, which is the vectorized summation of these eight panels in Figure 3A. Thus, within this approximately mm-sized region, all directions tested are represented, suggesting the presence of a complete directional map within each direction cluster. In addition to pinwheel-like organizations, we also observed linear type organizations. In the case shown in Figures 3C and 3D, regions selective for leftward direction preference alternated with those for rightward direction, suggesting a more linear mapping organization. Roughly half of the motion regions exhibited pinwheel-like organization, while others were more linear in organization. Thus, not unlike orientation domains in V2, both pinwheel and linear organizations are observed. Previous studies have shown that the preferred direction is usually orthogonal to the preferred orientation, and thus the direction map is strongly correlated with the orientation map (Malonek et al., 1994Malonek D.

Functional organization for direction of motion and its relationship to orientation maps in cat area 18.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6945-6964PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between the direction and orientation maps, for each case we calculated vector maps for both direction and orientation selectivity. Figure 4 illustrates the comparison of vector maps for direction selectivity and orientation selectivity (case 3, same cortical area as in Figure 2F). In the direction vector map shown in Figure 4A, the hue represents the preferred direction and the saturation represents the strength of selectivity. The two regions of directional selectivity in V2 are clearly distinguished (red arrows above Figure 4A indicate two regions of saturated color in V2). The direction region shown in Figure 4A (in the white frame) is shown enlarged in Figure 4B. The direction (arrows) and orientation preferences (bars) at each location are overlaid on the vector map.

Here, we demonstrate that the perirhinal cortex (PRc), within the MTL, plays a role in conceptually-driven implicit memory. Amnesic patients with MTL lesions that converged on the left PRc exhibited deficits on two conceptual implicit tasks (i.e., exemplar generation and semantic decision). A separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in healthy subjects indicated that PRc activation during encoding of words was predictive of subsequent exemplar generation. Moreover, across subjects, the magnitude of the fMRI and behavioral conceptual priming effects were directly related. Additionally, the PRc region implicated in the fMRI study was the same region of maximal lesion overlap in the patients with impaired conceptual priming. These patient and imaging results converge to suggest that the PRc plays a critical role in conceptual implicit memory, and possibly conceptual processing in general.

In contrast, implicit memory, which is measured in tasks where experience with a prior item facilitates the subsequent identification or production of that item, is thought to rely on associative cortical regions outside the MTL (Gabrieli, 1998Gabrieli J.D.E. Cognitive neuroscience of human memory.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1998; 49: 87-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, Schacter et al., 2000Schacter D.L. Wagner A.D. Buckner R.L.

Memory systems of the brain: a brief history and current perspective.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2004; 82: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Implicit memory effects can emerge as a byproduct of reprocessing the perceptual or conceptual aspects of an item and thus psychologists have distinguished between perceptually- and conceptually-driven priming effects. In general, studies have shown that the MTL is not critical for priming on perceptually-driven implicit memory tests (e.g., study “windsurfer,” then complete the word fragment “w_n__ur__r” at test) (Roediger and McDermott, 1993Roediger H.L.

Amnesic patients with MTL damage and who are impaired on explicit memory tests perform normally on perceptual implicit memory tests like word fragment completion (Blaxton, 1992Blaxton T.A.

Intact perceptual memory in the absence of conscious memory.Behav. Neurosci. 1997; 111: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and neuroimaging studies have indicated that explicit memory is associated with MTL activation, whereas perceptual implicit memory is associated with activity in areas linked to stimulus identification such as the extrastriate cortex (Schacter et al., 1996Schacter D.L.

It is less certain whether the MTL plays a critical role in conceptual forms of implicit memory. In conceptual implicit tests, prior processing of an item is found to facilitate performance on a task in which conceptual retrieval cues are provided (i.e., study “windsurf,” then generate an example of “a sport” at test). In behavioral experiments, conceptual implicit memory and familiarity-based recognition memory judgments are sensitive to the same kinds of manipulations (for a review, see Yonelinas, 2002Yonelinas A.P. The nature of recollection and familiarity: A review of 30 years of research.J. Mem. Lang. 2002; 46: 441-517Crossref Scopus (2546) Google Scholar), and several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that familiarity-based recognition is supported by the PRc (for a review, see Eichenbaum et al., 2007Eichenbaum H. Yonelinas A.P. Ranganath C. The medial temporal lobe and recognition memory.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 123-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Although neuroimaging methods have not yet been used to study conceptual implicit memory in tasks like exemplar generation, imaging data indicate that PRc activity may be modulated by repeated semantic processing of the same item (O'Kane et al., 2005O'Kane G. Insler R.Z. Wagner A.D. Conceptual and perceptual novelty effects in human medial temporal cortex.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Voss et al., 2009Voss J.L. Hauner K.K.Y. Paller K.A. Establishing a relationship between activity reduction in human perirhinal cortex and priming.Hippocampus. 2009; 19: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, patients with damage to the PRc are impaired in their ability to make fine semantic discriminations between objects (e.g., tiger or lion) and PRc activation in healthy participants is increased when they make these kinds of semantic discriminations (Moss et al., 2005Moss H.E.

Processing objects at different levels of specificity.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2004; 16: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, patients with semantic dementia have deficits in semantic processing, and this is sometimes accompanied by damage to the PRc (Davies et al., 2004Davies R.R. Graham K.S. Xuereb J.H. Williams G.B. Hodges J.R. The human perirhinal cortex and semantic memory.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Davies et al., 2005Davies R.R. Hodges J.R.

These findings suggest the possibility that the PRc contributes to conceptual processing, and therefore may also support conceptual implicit memory. Here, we report three experiments testing the hypothesis that the PRc is critical for conceptual implicit memory. In experiments 1 and 2, we assessed amnesic patients and healthy controls on two conceptual implicit memory tasks, category exemplar generation and semantic decision, respectively. In the exemplar generation experiment, subjects encoded words and then were required to generate examples of semantic categories with the first words that came to mind. In the semantic decision experiment, subjects made speeded size judgments for words and pictures in the study phase then made similar judgments to repeated and novel items in the test phase. In experiment 3, we scanned healthy young adults while they encoded a list of words, and we subsequently tested conceptual (i.e., exemplar generation) and perceptual (i.e., fragment completion) implicit memory. The results showed that activation in the left PRc predicted subsequent conceptual implicit memory performance, and this region overlapped with the region of maximal lesion overlap in MTL patients with conceptual implicit memory impairments. Together, these results indicate that regions in the MTL, particularly the PRc, are critical for conceptual implicit memory. To investigate the effects of MTL damage on conceptual implicit memory, we first examined performance on a category exemplar generation task in five patients with extensive damage to the left MTL (MTL group), four hypoxic patients (H group), and 22 age matched controls. The MTL group consisted of left posterior cerebral infarct and temporal lobectomy patients. Lesion reconstructions of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the patients revealed that the region of greatest overlap was in the PRc (Figure 1A ). This region was affected in four of the five subjects. The H group consisted of hypoxic patients with explicit memory deficits that were comparable to those of the MTL group (e.g., 74 and 73, respectively, on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised [WMSr] delayed memory subscales). Additionally, as reported in Yonelinas et al., 2002Yonelinas A.P. Kroll N.E. Quamme J.R. Lazzara M.M. Sauvé M.J. Widaman K.F. Knight R.T. Effects of extensive temporal lobe damage or mild hypoxia on recollection and familiarity.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, both the H and MTL groups were impaired at recollecting qualitative details of prior study events, but only the MTL group exhibited impaired familiarity-based recognition. Lesion reconstructions could not be obtained in the hypoxic patients because of implanted defibrillators, but mild hypoxia is expected to lead to relatively selective damage to the hippocampus (e.g., Rempel-Clower et al., 1996Rempel-Clower N.L. Zola S.M. Squire L.R. Amaral D.G. Three cases of enduring memory impairment following bilateral damage limited to the hippocampal formation.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5233-5255PubMed Google Scholar). After encoding a list of words by making pleasantness or syllable judgments, subjects were presented with 36 category cues, and asked to quickly provide the first five exemplars of the given category that came to mind. Twenty-four of the category cues corresponded to previously studied exemplars. The remaining 12 category cues had no relationship to the studied items and were included to estimate the baseline generation rates in the absence of conceptual priming. Priming scores were collapsed across encoding condition (pleasantness/syllable judgment) because it did not interact with group (i.e., in all three groups priming was greater in the deep encoding condition) (Table 1) . The three groups did not differ with respect to the proportion of baseline items produced (F[2, 28] = 0.57). Because of this, priming was measured as the proportion of old items produced minus the proportion of baseline items produced (Figure 1B). Planned contrasts indicated that the priming effects were significant in the H (t[3] = 3.39, p < 0.05), and control (t[21] = 6.48, p < 0.01) groups, and not significant in the MTL group (t[4] = 0.53). Furthermore, the MTL group was significantly impaired in conceptual priming compared to controls (t[25] = 2.19, p < 0.05), whereas there were no significant differences between the H group and controls (t[24] = −0.28). A direct comparison of the two patient groups showed that the priming effects were marginally smaller in the MTL group compared with the hypoxic group (t[7] = 1.74; p = 0.06, one-tailed). In sum, the results indicate that priming on conceptual implicit memory tests is not significantly affected by hypoxia, but damage to the temporal lobe regions surrounding the hippocampus (i.e., the PRc) does significantly reduce conceptual priming.Table 1Mean Proportion of Target Items Generated by Group and Condition with Standard Deviations in Parenthesis on the Category Exemplar Generation Task for Patients and ControlsGroupEncoding ConditionShallowDeepNewH0.20 (0.04)0.32 (0.06)0.13 (0.08)MTL0.15 (0.01)0.20 (0.10)0.15 (0.06)Control0.26 (0.07)0.32 (0.10)0.16 (0.06)H: hypoxic group; MTL: medial temporal lobe group. Open table in a new tab H: hypoxic group; MTL: medial temporal lobe group. In order to test the generalizability of our results to other conceptual implicit memory tests, we investigated whether our findings would replicate using a semantic decision task. We compared semantic decision priming in the same MTL, H, and control groups as described above, except that the two left posterior cerebral artery infarct patients were not included in the MTL group because they could not easily complete the visual word reading task used in the current experiment. In the study phase, participants made speeded size judgments for words and pictures and then made similar judgments to repeated and novel items in the test phase. On average, patients and controls made similar percentages of errors at test (i.e., an incorrect decision about the relative size of an item compared to a shoebox); ∼10% of all responses were incorrect. Only correct decisions that did not exceed two standard deviations (SD) from the participant's mean reaction time (RT) within each study-test condition were included in the analysis, resulting in the elimination of ∼5% of the total number of responses for each group. Priming scores were collapsed across the study-test conditions as they did not interact with group (Table 2). The three groups exhibited equivalent RTs to new items (F[2, 26] = 1.21, p > 0.05), thus, similarly to the first experiment, priming scores were calculated as the difference in RT for novel (i.e., baseline) compared to repeated items (Figure 1C). Planned contrasts indicated that the priming effects were marginally significant in the H group (t[3] = 2.32, p = 0.05, one-tailed), significant in the control group (t[21] = 5.46, p < 0.01), and not significant in the MTL group (t[2] = 0.40). Importantly, the MTL group was significantly impaired in conceptual priming compared to controls (t[23] = 1.78, p < 0.05, one-tailed), whereas the H group did not perform differently from the controls (t[24] = −0.33). Moreover, the priming scores were marginally smaller in the MTL group relative to the hypoxic group (t[5] = 1.71; p = 0.07, one-tailed). Consistent with the exemplar generation priming results, semantic decision priming was intact in H patients, but significantly impaired in MTL patients.Table 2Mean RTs by Group and Condition with Standard Deviations in Parenthesis on the Semantic Decision Task for Patients and ControlsGroupStudy → Test ConditionPic. → Pic.Pic. → WordWord → Pic.Word → WordNew Pic.New WordH744.25 (64.98)890.75 (111.30)810.50 (53.92)880.50 (141.37)898.50 (179.47)978.75 (112.92)MTL728.67 (149.49)763.33 (196.02)724.67 (84.61)719.00 (120.02)751.67 (104.16)733.33 (100.38)Control686.91 (128.43)796.86 (118.36)743.77 (149.60)772.00 (183.92)831.05 (184.61)853.82 (187.15)H: hypoxic group; MTL: medial temporal lobe group; Pic: picture; RTs: reaction times. Open table in a new tab H: hypoxic group; MTL: medial temporal lobe group; Pic: picture; RTs: reaction times. The results from these two experiments demonstrate that conceptual priming can be consistently impaired in amnesia. These impairments, however, do not generalize to all amnesic patient groups. Hypoxic patients showed no indication of impairment in the exemplar generation or semantic decision priming tasks, whereas patients with extensive damage to the MTL, with the greatest amount of lesion overlap in the PRc (Figure 1A), exhibited significant impairments on both implicit tasks. Although these results implicate the PRc as a critical structure in conceptual implicit memory tests, in human lesion patients it is possible that the observed deficits may have been produced by undetected damage to other brain regions. Additionally, although most of the patients in the MTL group had documented damage to the left PRc, an examination of individual patient scores indicated that one of those patients did not appear to have a PRc lesion and yet still exhibited a low conceptual priming score. (The difference in the conceptual priming scores between the control and MTL groups in experiment 1 was medium [Cohen's d = 0.55] when this patient was removed; it was large [Cohen's d = 0.87] with this patient included.) To further verify that the PRc is critically involved in conceptual implicit memory we next conducted a neuroimaging study on healthy individuals to determine if neural activity in the PRc is related to implicit memory. Seventeen healthy participants were scanned while they encoded words by making pleasantness judgments for each item. Afterward, they were asked to complete a conceptual implicit memory test (i.e., category exemplar generation) to determine whether activity in the PRc during encoding was predictive of priming on the implicit test. Participants were then also given a perceptual implicit memory test (i.e., word fragment completion) in order to determine whether the regions involved in conceptual implicit memory might also be important for perceptual implicit memory. Priming effects were measured as the proportion of old items produced minus the proportion of baseline items produced. In the exemplar generation task, subjects were presented with 42 category cues at test (28 studied, 14 baseline) and asked to generate five exemplars per category. The mean priming score was 0.13 (SD = 0.05), which was significant (t[15] = 10.10, p < 0.001) and comparable to that observed in the controls in experiment 1. In the fragment completion test, subjects were presented with a total of 210 word fragments (140 studied, 70 baseline). The priming effect was 0.14 (SD = 0.05) and this priming effect was also significant (t[16] = 11.55, p < 0.001). We first tested the a priori prediction that activation in the PRc would be increased for studied items that were subsequently produced in the exemplar generation test (i.e., primed) compared to those that were not produced (i.e., unprimed). As shown in Figure 1D, this contrast revealed a cluster of suprathreshold voxels in the left PRc (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates: x = −33, y = −9, z = −36 mm; t[15] = 4.29), indicating that it was involved in conceptual implicit memory. Importantly, this activation was in the same region as the MTL patient lesion reconstruction overlap (Figures 1A and 1D). No regions within the PRc showed less activation for subsequently primed items than for subsequently unprimed items. To further examine the relationship between PRc activation and conceptual priming, we tested whether individual differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) subsequent priming effects (i.e., the difference in PRc activation between subsequently primed and unprimed items) were related to individual differences in the magnitude of behavioral conceptual priming effects. Activation in the left PRc was positively correlated with the magnitude of the behavioral priming effects (r = 0.56, p < 0.05), indicating that participants with larger subsequent priming effects in PRc during encoding exhibited larger behavioral priming effects (Figure 1E). Additionally, an exploratory whole brain analysis was conducted to determine if there were regions outside the PRc that were also involved in conceptual implicit memory. Regions showing greater activation for subsequently primed compared to subsequently unprimed items included the right superior temporal gyrus (MNI coordinates: x = 39, y = −51, z = 9 mm; t[15] = 4.60), the right cerebellum (x = 36, y = −63, z = −36 mm; t[15] = 5.22), and the right thalamus (x = 18, y = −24, z = 9; t[15] = 4.37). No region showed less activation for primed compared to unprimed items. Unlike the PRc activation, none of these regions were significantly correlated with behavioral priming scores. However, direct comparisons indicated that these differences in correlations were not statistically significant. Lastly, in order to determine whether the PRc is involved in perceptual forms of implicit memory, we examined whether PRc activation was related to subsequent performance on the fragment completion test. There were no regions within the PRc showing significant differences between subsequently primed and unprimed items. An exploratory whole brain analysis revealed a significant increase in activation in the left superior temporal gyrus for primed compared to unprimed items (MNI coordinates: x = −51, y = −54, z = 18 mm; t[16] = 4.92). We conducted two experiments with amnesic patients and one fMRI study in healthy participants to test the hypothesis that the PRc plays a critical role in conceptual implicit memory. The results showed that patients with extensive MTL damage that converged in the PRc showed severe conceptual priming impairments relative to controls. In a separate fMRI experiment in healthy subjects, we found that PRc activity was increased during encoding of items that were subsequently produced in an exemplar generation test than those that were not, and there was a direct relationship between the PRc activity and the individual differences in conceptual priming effects. No relationships were observed between PRc activity and perceptual priming, suggesting that the observed PRc activity was specifically related to encoding in a conceptual implicit memory task. Thus, the patient and fMRI studies provided converging evidence to suggest a vital role for the left PRc in conceptual implicit memory. The results from the present studies help to explain some discrepancies in the existing lesion literature on implicit memory. Various studies have reported evidence for preserved conceptual priming in amnesic patients in tasks like exemplar generation (Keane et al., 1997Keane M.M. Gabrieli J.D.E. Monti L.A. Fleischman D.A.

However, many of these studies included a mixture of patients with damage to different MTL regions, which could account for the variable outcomes. Memory impairments seen in patients suffering from mild hypoxia (that can selectively affect the hippocampus) are quite different from those seen in patients with damage to the surrounding PRc and PHc (e.g., Yonelinas et al., 2002Yonelinas A.P. Kroll N.E. Quamme J.R. Lazzara M.M. Sauvé M.J. Widaman K.F. Knight R.T. Effects of extensive temporal lobe damage or mild hypoxia on recollection and familiarity.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Prior studies have found that conceptual priming is intact in amnesic patients with relatively selective hippocampal damage (Graf et al., 1985Graf P. Shimamura A. Squire L.R. Priming across modalities and across category levels: Extending the domain of preserved function in amnesia.J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem.

Sci. 2004; 15: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas studies of patients with more extensive MTL damage reported impaired conceptual implicit memory (Blaxton, 1992Blaxton T.A.

Cognit. 1992; 20: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Cermak et al., 1988Cermak L.S. Blackford S.P. O'Connor M. Bleich R.P. The implicit memory ability of a patient with amnesia due to encephalitis.Brain Cogn. 1988; 7: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One exception is a study that reported normal conceptual priming effects in two patients with extensive MTL damage (Levy et al., 2004Levy D.A. Stark C.E.L. Squire L.R. Intact conceptual priming in the absence of declarative memory.Psychol. Sci. 2004; 15: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the baseline level of performance in these patients was impaired relative to controls, which would be expected to artifactually inflate the priming scores of those patients (Ostergaard, 1999Ostergaard A.L. Priming deficits in amnesia: now you see them, now you don't.J. Int. Neuropsychol. Soc. 1999; 5: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present results are inconsistent with current theories of memory that assume that the MTL supports declarative but not nondeclarative memory (Squire, 2004Squire L.R. Memory systems of the brain: a brief history and current perspective.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2004; 82: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar); or that it supports episodic but not semantic memory (Schacter et al., 2000Schacter D.L. Wagner A.D. Buckner R.L. Memory systems of 1999.in: Tulving E. Craik F.I.M. The Oxford Handbook of Memory. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 627-643Google Scholar). More specifically, the results suggest that regions in the MTL, such as the PRc, contribute to normal performance on at least some types of implicit memory measures. The current results converge with other studies that have suggested that the MTL may contribute to implicit expressions of memory. For example, the MTL has been implicated in contextual cueing tasks (e.g., Chun and Phelps, 1999Chun M.M. Phelps E.A.

However, transport of lipids by alternate, or “nonvesicular,” routes is also critical for lipid synthesis, metabolism, and proper membrane partitioning. In the past few years, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the mechanisms of nonvesicular lipid transport and how it may go awry in particular diseases, but many fundamental questions remain for this rising field. Eukaryotic cells possess a remarkable diversity of lipids, which distribute among cellular membranes by well-characterized vesicle trafficking pathways. However, transport of lipids by alternate, or “nonvesicular,” routes is also critical for lipid synthesis, metabolism, and proper membrane partitioning. In the past few years, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the mechanisms of nonvesicular lipid transport and how it may go awry in particular diseases, but many fundamental questions remain for this rising field. A typical higher eukaryotic cell contains more than 1000 different lipid species. These lipids are not homogenously distributed among intracellular membranes, but instead each organelle has a characteristic lipid composition that is required for its proper function. For example, cholesterol and sphingolipids are highly enriched in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and indeed, many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, and lysosomal storage disorders, are associated with defects in maintaining the correct distribution of intracellular lipids. How do these hydrophobic molecules shuttle between intracellular membranes inside the aqueous milieu of the cell? Although trafficking largely determines the intracellular distribution of most lipids, we currently understand less about lipid trafficking than we do about protein trafficking. Nevertheless, proteins and lipids do share similar properties. Both lipids and integral membrane proteins move between organelles in membrane-enclosed sacs called transport vesicles, and there is growing evidence that lipids, like proteins, are sorted during the formation of transport vesicles. However, unlike proteins, lipids can rapidly and efficiently move between cellular membranes by routes independent of transport vesicle, or “nonvesicular transport” pathways. This important difference between protein and lipid trafficking is not widely appreciated, in part, because the roles and mechanisms of nonvesicular lipid exchange have, in many cases, been obscure and difficult to characterize. In the past few years, researchers have made significant progress toward understanding how and why nonvesicular lipid trafficking occurs. This Essay summarizes the current state of the field and the major challenges for its future. The first studies suggesting the existence of nonvesicular lipid exchange pathways in the cell examined the movement of newly synthesized lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are made, to the plasma membrane. Drugs that halt vesicular trafficking do not stop lipid transfer from the ER to the plasma membrane, indicating that some lipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphoatidylethanolamine (PE), cholesterol, and glucosylceramide (GlcCer), can move between the ER and plasma membrane by nonvesicular pathways. Moreover, these pathways have substantial capacity because the rate of lipid transfer does not decrease when vesicular trafficking is blocked (Sleight and Pagano, 1983Sleight R.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9050-9058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Kaplan and Simoni, 1985aKaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear what fraction of the lipid exchange between the ER and plasma membrane is nonvesicular when vesicular trafficking is not blocked. More recently, studies have reported strong evidence for nonvesicular transfer of ceramides from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi (Kok et al., 1998Kok J.W. Babia T. Klappe K. Egea G. Hoekstra D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Funato and Riezman, 2001Funato K. Riezman H. J.

Maxfield F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For example, studies using dehydroergosterol, a fluorescent analog of cholesterol, found that, when this sterol is added to cells, it initially incorporates into the plasma membrane but then moves to the endocytic recycling compartment by a nonvesicular, energy-independent pathway. Dehydroergosterol equilibrates between the plasma membrane and endocytic recycling compartment quite quickly—within 2–3 min—and astonishingly, an estimated one million dehydroergosterol molecules exchange between these compartments each second (Maxfield and Mondal, 2006Maxfield F.R. Mondal M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Collectively, these and many other studies indicate that the cell possesses numerous pathways of nonvesicular lipid transport, and more pathways will probably be discovered in the future. However, in most cases, we still are uncertain about of how much nonvesicular pathways contribute to the total lipid exchange inside of a cell. Are the nonvesicular pathways needed for exchanging a large proportion of lipids between organelles, or do only a small fraction of lipids move by nonvesicular mechanisms? In addition, some classes of lipids, such as complex glycolipids, gangliosides, and sphingolipids, may transfer by only vesicular routes (Wattenberg, 1990Wattenberg B.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Hechtberger and Daum, 1995Hechtberger P. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nonvesicular lipid trafficking serves at least four important functions in cells. First, it provides lipids that are needed for membrane biogenesis in organelles that cannot obtain sufficient lipids from vesicular trafficking. Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lipid droplets lack most of the enzymes needed to make certain lipids required for their biogenesis. These organelles are not connected to the rest of the cell by vesicular trafficking pathways and thus rely on nonvesicular trafficking pathways to obtain these lipids. Indeed, many studies show that lipids exchange between the ER and mitochondria or chloroplasts by nonvesicular routes (Voelker, 2009Voelker D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 827-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Benning, 2009Benning C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 71-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Less is known about lipid transfer among lipid droplets or between lipid droplets and other organelles, but these pathways are almost certainly nonvesicular as well. There is also evidence for nonvesicular lipid exchange between the ER and peroxisomes (Raychaudhuri and Prinz, 2008Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15785-15790Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nonvesicular transport also helps to maintain the proper level of a lipid in an organelle or domain of an organelle. Compared to vesicular routes, one obvious advantage of nonvesicular trafficking is that it can rapidly move lipids between specific compartments in cells without having to also transfer integral membrane proteins. This may be particularly important for lipids, such as cholesterol, which can be toxic to cells. Cells use a number of mechanisms to rapidly decrease cholesterol levels when they are too high, such as effluxing cholesterol out of cells to external lipoproteins and producing cholesteryl esters (i.e., ester linkages between the hydroxyl group of cholesterol and the carboxylate group of a fatty acid), which are stored in lipid droplets. Nonvesicular transport of cholesterol probably provides a route to move cholesterol quickly and efficiently to the enzymes that perform these reactions without disrupting vesicular trafficking. Third, nonvesicular lipid trafficking may also regulate lipid metabolism. For example, the nonvesicular transfer of ceramides from the ER, where they are synthesized, to the Golgi complex, where they are converted into glycolipids and sphingolipids, may regulate the production of these lipids. Finally, it is possible that nonvesicular lipid transfer is required for the transmission of a lipid as part of a signaling or regulatory pathway. For example, diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C and ceramides serve as signaling molecules to regulate differentiation, proliferation, programmed cell death, and apoptosis. Lipid monomers can exchange spontaneously between membranes by simply diffusing through the aqueous phase (Figure 1A ). However, for most classes of lipids, this process occurs too slowly to be physiologically relevant; for example, most glycerolipids and sphingolipids spontaneously exchange between membranes with half-times > 40 hr. The rate-limiting step in this process is lipid desorption from a membrane, and thus proteins that accelerate lipid transfer may increase the rate of lipid egress from the membrane. Lipid transfer between membranes may also occur when two membranes collide (Figure 1B). Although the mechanism of lipid exchange during collision is not well understood, one model is that a lipid must be “activated,” or partially extended from the bilayer, prior to collision (Steck et al., 2002Steck T.L. Ye J. Lange Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This activation increases the probability of transfer to a second membrane during collision. Activation could be stochastic, resulting from the thermal motion that causes lipids to bounce or bob in a bilayer, or it could be mediated by a protein. Proteins clearly facilitate the lipid nonvesicular transport between membranes. Although this process has been well characterized in vitro, studies are only beginning to unravel the mechanisms for these pathways inside the cell (Voelker, 2009Voelker D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 827-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Benning, 2009Benning C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 71-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the three cases described below, specific details have emerged, including how defects in these lipid trafficking pathways cause disease. Ceramide is the precursor of sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, an abundant lipid in the plasma membrane of all mammalian cells. Sphingomyelin is synthesized in the Golgi complex, but ceramide is made in the ER. Therefore, to produce sphingomyelin, ceramide must be transported from the ER to the Golgi complex, and this is accomplished by CERT, the ceramide transport protein (Hanada et al., 2009Hanada K. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Yamaji T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CERT is expressed ubiquitously in higher eukaryotes, but it is not present in yeast. CERT was identified from a mutant cell line of Chinese hamster ovary cells, called LY-A, which has low levels of sphingomyelin (Hanada et al., 2003Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Studies found that, although LY-A mutant cells make sphingomyelin at a reduced rate, these cells produce normal amounts of enzymes that synthesize sphingomyelin (i.e., sphingomyelin synthase) and the sphingomyelin precursors, ceramide and PC. These results suggested that LY-A cells have a defect in the nonvesicular transfer of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi complex. The gene that complemented the cell's defect was isolated and named CERT. Disruption of the CERT gene in mice results in death at approximately embryonic day 11.5 (Wang et al., 2009Wang X. Rao R.P.

Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and flies lacking CERT have a dramatic decrease in ceramide phosphoethanolamine, the fly analog of sphingomyelin (Rao et al., 2007Rao R.P. Yuan C. Allegood J.C. Rawat S.S. Edwards M.B. Wang X. Merrill Jr., A.H.J. Acharya U. Acharya J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CERT encodes a 68 kDa protein that has three domains, an N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, a FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) motif, and a C-terminal START (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein [StAR]-related) domain. The PH domain binds to phosphoinositides (PIPs), whereas the FFAT motif associates with proteins on the ER called VAPs (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins). The START domain is the portion of the protein that transports lipids, and it binds a single molecule of ceramide in a hydrophobic cavity (Kudo et al., 2008Kudo N. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Yamaji T. Wakatsuki S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. Kato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CERT facilitates the movement of ceramide between liposomes in vitro (Hanada et al., 2003Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The PH domain and FFAT motif in CERT target it to the ER and Golgi complex, respectively. Thus, in vivo CERT probably extracts ceramide from the ER, shuttles it through the cytoplasm, and delivers it to the Golgi complex. In general, proteins that mediate lipid transfer by this mechanism are called lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) (Figure 1C). The consumption of ceramide in the Golgi complex to produce sphingomyelin probably drives the directionality of the ceramide transport. Ceramide transfer by CERT in vitro does not require energy. Surprisingly, however, ATP depletion blocks ceramide transport by CERT in cells (Hanada et al., 2003Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), and the role that energy plays in CERT function in vivo remains an interesting, unsolved mystery. The rate-limiting step for ceramide transport by CERT is likely diffusion through the cytosol. This is probably true of other LTPs as well. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that CERT or other LTPs diffuse long distances through the cytosol. Rather, they probably operate mostly at regions where membranes are closely apposed and come within ∼20 nm of each other. Called membrane contact sites or MCSs, these junctions are present ubiquitously in all cells and are frequently found between the ER and a second organelle (Levine and Loewen, 2006Levine T. Loewen C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At membrane contact sites between the ER and Golgi complex, CERT would have to diffuse only a small distance, or it may even bind both membranes simultaneously using its two targeting domains, PH and FFAT (Hanada et al., 2009Hanada K. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Yamaji T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although it is still unknown for certain whether CERT localizes to membrane contact sites between the ER and Golgi complex, some LTPs are enriched at these membrane junctions, including the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) ORP1L in mammals and most of the OSBP-related proteins in yeast (the Osh proteins) (Levine and Munro, 2001Levine T.P. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Loewen et al., 2003Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P.

Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 889-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CERT is part of a large family of proteins that contain START domains, and many members of this family can facilitate lipid transfer between membranes in vitro. In addition, there are approximately four other large families of LTPs, and most cells express numerous LTPs (D'Angelo et al., 2008D'Angelo G. Vicinanza M. De Matteis M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Lev, 2010Lev S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Some LTPs have high specificity and bind only a few lipids, whereas others can associate with a broad range of lipids. The different families of LTPs are quite diverse, with few similarities in sequence or structure. However, all LTPs share the ability to bind lipid monomers with a stoichiometry of one lipid for each protein. In addition, all LTPs bind the lipid monomer in a pocket covered with a flexible “lid” domain that shields the associated lipid from the aqueous phase (Figure 1C). As with CERT, lipid exchange by LTPs does not require energy. A major controversy in the field is whether the primary function of many LTPs in cells is to transfer lipids between membranes, as they do in vitro, or whether they serve another main purpose in cells. Aside from CERT, there is indeed compelling evidence that other LTPs, such as FAPP2 (Golgi-associated four-phosphate adaptor protein 2), NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease, type C2), and some oxysterol-binding proteins in yeast, transfer lipids in cells (Yamaji et al., 2008Yamaji T. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Hanada K. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, D'Angelo et al., 2008D'Angelo G. Vicinanza M. De Matteis M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Prinz, 2007Prinz W.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). That said, many LTPs do not appear to transport lipids in cells but rather serve as lipid sensors or regulate lipid metabolism and signaling by presenting lipids to metabolic enzymes. For example, the Sec14 superfamily of LTPs has been proposed to present phosphoinositol to kinases that produce PIPs, and thus these LTPs regulate many membrane trafficking and signaling events that require PIPs (Bankaitis et al., 2010Bankaitis V.A. Mousley C.J. Schaaf G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 150-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nonvesicular lipid trafficking that occurs at membrane contact sites does not always require soluble LTPs. Indeed, lipid exchange between the ER and mitochondria probably occurs independently of LTPs. Lipid transport between these organelles is critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphoatidylethanolamine (PE), two of the most abundant lipids in the membranes of eukaryotes. In one of the two major pathways for producing PC, the first step is the synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS), which occurs at the ER. PS is then transferred to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is decarboxylated to form PE, the precursor of PC. However, the enzymes that convert PE to PC reside back in the ER, and thus to make PC, the PE must be returned to the ER from the mitochondrial inner membrane. Consequently, producing PE and PC by this pathway requires multiple nonvesicular lipid transfer steps. Remarkably, yeast mutants that can make PE and PC solely by this pathway grow as well as wild-type cells and have similar levels of PE and PC (Trotter et al., 1995Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These results indicate that nonvesicular lipid transfer between ER and mitochondria must be highly efficient. Surprisingly, phospholipid exchange between the ER and mitochondria requires neither cytosolic factors nor energy. It is thought to occur at specialized regions of the ER called mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are closely apposed to mitochondria (Choi et al., 2006Choi J.Y. Riekhof W.R. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An important question in the field is how these membrane contact sites form. In mammals, a number of proteins, such as mitofusins, GRP75 (glucose-regulated protein 75), and PACS2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2), have been proposed to mediate contacts between the MAM and mitochondria, but whether any of these proteins are needed for efficient lipid exchange between these organelles is not known (Lev, 2010Lev S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In yeast, studies recently found that lipid transfer between the ER and mitochondria slows down in mutants missing a complex of four proteins called the ERMES complex, which bridges the ER and mitochondria (Kornmann et al., 2009Kornmann B. Currie E. Collins S.R. Schuldiner M. Nunnari J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Science. 2009; 325: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Thus, maintaining close contacts between the ER and mitochondria is required for efficient lipid exchange between these organelles. There are a number of ways in which lipid transport exchange between the ER and mitochondria may occur at membrane contact sites. First, protein complexes in the two organelles could interact to form a type of hydrophobic tunnel or conduit that allows lipids to passively diffuse between the two membranes with little or no contact with the aqueous phase (Figure 1D). Second, a membrane protein complex at a contact site could use energy to facilitate lipid desorption from one of the membranes. The probability that the lipid then diffuses into the adjacent membrane is comparable to that of it diffusing back into original membrane (Figure 1E), leading to a net transfer of lipid from one membrane to the other. Third, if lipid transfer occurs by an activated collision mechanism, then a protein complex could also promote lipid activation and increase the chance of lipid exchange during membrane collision (Figure 1F). Membranes at contact sites may not be held a fixed distance and may frequently collide. A fourth possibility is that transmembrane proteins on two different organelles bring two membranes in close apposition so that they undergo transient hemifusion (Figure 1G). Lipids could then easily diffuse between the hemifused membranes without contacting the aqueous phase. Defects in lipid transport to mitochondria cause multiple diseases. For example, some forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is characterized by an impaired ability to produce the steroid cortisol, are caused by defects in cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membranes. Steroids are synthesized from cholesterol, and the first step in this process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membranes. Transporting cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membranes requires the LTP StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein). Although StAR binds cholesterol and can transfer it between membranes in vitro (Kallen et al., 1998Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), its role in cholesterol transport in cells remains controversial. It is not clear whether StAR moves cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, moves cholesterol from another organelle to the outer mitochondrial membrane, or regulates the proteins that are actually responsible for cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Such fundamental questions need to be resolved before we can understand and begin developing treatments for many diseases caused by defects in lipid transport. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) transport cholesterol and other lipids through the bloodstream, and receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDLs serves as a major source of cholesterol in mammalian cells. When endocytosed LDL reaches late endosome/lysosome compartments, cholesteryl esters in these particles are hydrolyzed and the resulting cholesterol is subsequently trafficked to the rest of the cell. Nonvesicular mechanisms transport cholesterol from internal membranes to the outer membrane of the late endosome/lysosome and then eventually out of the organelle. Two proteins required for this type of cholesterol transport are NPC1 and NPC2. These proteins were identified by studies on patients with Niemann-Pick type C, a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease in which cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in late endosomes/lysosomes. NPC1 is an integral membrane protein with 13 putative transmembrane domains that reside in the outer membrane of late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, NPC2 is a small soluble protein in the lumen of these organelles. NPC2 is an LTP that facilitates cholesterol transport between membranes in vitro (Cheruku et al., 2006Cheruku S.R. Xu Z. Dutia R. Lobel P. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31594-31604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In cells, it probably transfers cholesterol between internal membranes in the late endosome/lysosome and then hands it off to NPC1 in the outer membrane (Infante et al., 2008Infante R.E. Wang M.L. Radhakrishnan A. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15287-15292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, Kwon et al., 2009Kwon H.J. Abi-Mosleh L. Wang M.L.

Abi-Mosleh L. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 166-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). NPC1 may then facilitate the egress of cholesterol from the late endosome/lysosome to other cellular compartments. However, future studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to characterize exactly how NPC1 facilitates cholesterol transfer to other cellular membranes. Many details of nonvesicular lipid trafficking remain open questions and are currently the focus of intense research. However, a few concepts are clear. For one, most nonvesicular lipid transfer probably occurs at membrane contact sites, and undoubtedly, new techniques are needed to study these junctions and identify proteins that function at these key locations in the cell. In addition, a significant portion of lipid trafficking at membrane contact sites probably does not require soluble LTPs, but the mechanistic details for how transfer occurs remain an important question. Other fundamental issues in this field include the energetics of nonvesicular lipid trafficking and its regulatory mechanisms, including if and how its directionality is determined. Answers to these questions are imperative for understanding how defects in nonvesicular lipid trafficking cause disease, but they are also critical for deciphering fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells, including lipid metabolism, signaling, and intracellular distribution.

https://openalex.org/W2015169289,"Human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) K(+) channels have a critical role in cardiac repolarization. hERG channels close (deactivate) very slowly, and this is vital for regulating the time course and amplitude of repolarizing current during the cardiac action potential. Accelerated deactivation is one mechanism by which inherited mutations cause long QT syndrome and potentially lethal arrhythmias. hERG deactivation is highly dependent upon an intact EAG domain (the first 135 amino acids of the N terminus). Importantly, deletion of residues 2-26 accelerates deactivation to a similar extent as removing the entire EAG domain. These and other experiments suggest the first 26 residues (NT1-26) contain structural elements required to slow deactivation by stabilizing the open conformation of the pore. Residues 26-135 form a Per-Arnt-Sim domain, but a structure for NT1-26 has not been forthcoming, and little is known about its site of interaction on the channel. In this study, we present an NMR structure for the entire EAG domain, which reveals that NT1-26 is structurally independent from the Per-Arnt-Sim domain and contains a stable amphipathic helix with one face being positively charged. Mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies indicate that neutralizing basic residues and breaking the amphipathic helix dramatically accelerate deactivation. Furthermore, scanning mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain suggest that negatively charged patches on its cytoplasmic surface form an interface with the NT1-26 domain. We propose a model in which NT1-26 obstructs gating motions of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain to allosterically stabilize the open conformation of the pore."
https://openalex.org/W1965137822,"Blockade of neurotransmitter release by botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT(A)) underlies the severe neuroparalytic symptoms of human botulism, which can last a few years. The structural basis for this remarkable persistence remains unclear. Herein, recombinant BoNT(A) was found to match the neurotoxicity of that from Clostridium botulinum, producing persistent cleavage of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) and neuromuscular paralysis. When two leucines near the C terminus of the protease light chain of A (LC(A)) were mutated, its inhibition of exocytosis was followed by fast recovery of intact SNAP-25 in cerebellar neurons and neuromuscular transmission in vivo. Deletion of 6-7 N terminus residues diminished BoNT(A) activity but did not alter the longevity of its SNAP-25 cleavage and neuromuscular paralysis. Furthermore, genetically fusing LC(E) to a BoNT(A) enzymically inactive mutant (BoTIM(A)) yielded a novel LC(E)-BoTIM(A) protein that targets neurons, and the BoTIM(A) moiety also delivers and stabilizes the inhibitory LC(E), giving a potent and persistent cleavage of SNAP-25 with associated neuromuscular paralysis. Moreover, its neurotropism was extended to sensory neurons normally insensitive to BoNT(E). LC(E-)BoTIM(A)(AA) with the above-identified dileucine mutated gave transient neuromuscular paralysis similar to BoNT(E), reaffirming that these residues are critical for the persistent action of LC(E)-BoTIM(A) as well as BoNT(A). LC(E)-BoTIM(A) inhibited release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory neurons mediated by transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 and attenuated capsaicin-evoked nociceptive behavior in rats, following intraplantar injection. Thus, a long acting, versatile composite toxin has been developed with therapeutic potential for pain and conditions caused by overactive cholinergic nerves."

While the consequences associated with depleting calcium from the ER have been studied in multiple systems, it is not known whether the intrinsic properties of a neuron change in response to such perturbations. In this study, we demonstrate that the depletion of calcium from the ER of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons induces a persistent, perisomatic increase in the density of functional h channels resulting in a reduction in intrinsic excitability and an increase in the optimal response frequency. This form of intrinsic plasticity is dependent on the elevation of cytoplasmic calcium, inositol triphosphate receptors, store-operated calcium channels, and the protein kinase A pathway. We postulate that this form of depletion-induced intrinsic plasticity is a neuroprotective mechanism that reduces excitability after depletion of calcium stores triggered through altered network activity during pathological conditions."

Also, in contrast to other bacteria, O-acetylation of B. anthracis peptidoglycan is combined with N-deacetylation to confer resistance of cells to lysozyme.

Lesion studies have implicated the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in this process, particularly when expected rewards are omitted. However, lesion studies cannot specify how information processing in CeA supports such learning. To address these questions, we recorded CeA neurons in rats performing a task in which rewards were delivered or omitted unexpectedly. We found that activity in CeA neurons increased selectively at the time of omission and declined again with learning. Increased firing correlated with CeA-inactivation sensitive measures of attention. Notably CeA neurons did not fire to the cues or in response to unexpected rewards. These results indicate that CeA contributes to learning in response to reward omission due to a specific role in signaling actual omission rather than a more general involvement in signaling expectancies, errors, or reward value."
https://openalex.org/W2006044429,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) stimulates neurogenesis, dendritic growth of hippocampal neurons, and higher cognitive functions, such as spatial learning and memory formation. Although astrocyte-derived atRA has been considered a key factor in neurogenesis, little direct evidence identifies hippocampus cell types and the enzymes that biosynthesize atRA. Here we show that primary rat astrocytes, but not neurons, biosynthesize atRA using multiple retinol dehydrogenases (Rdh) of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene family and retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (Raldh). Astrocytes secrete atRA into their medium; neurons sequester atRA. The first step, conversion of retinol into retinal, is rate-limiting. Neurons and astrocytes both synthesize retinyl esters and reduce retinal into retinol. siRNA knockdown indicates that Rdh10, Rdh2 (mRdh1), and Raldh1, -2, and -3 contribute to atRA production. Knockdown of the Rdh Dhrs9 increased atRA synthesis ∼40% by increasing Raldh1 expression. Immunocytochemistry revealed cytosolic and nuclear expression of Raldh1 and cytosol and perinuclear expression of Raldh2. atRA autoregulated its concentrations by inducing retinyl ester synthesis via lecithin:retinol acyltransferase and stimulating its catabolism via inducing Cyp26B1. These data show that adult hippocampus astrocytes rely on multiple Rdh and Raldh to provide a paracrine source of atRA to neurons, and atRA regulates its own biosynthesis in astrocytes by directing flux of retinol. Observation of cross-talk between Dhrs9 and Raldh1 provides a novel mechanism of regulating atRA biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2035756665,"Modulation of T cell receptor signal transduction in CD8(+) T cells represents a novel strategy toward enhancing the immune response to tumor. Recently, levels of guanine exchange factors, RasGRP and SOS, within T cells have been shown to represent a key determinant in the regulation of the analog to the digital activation threshold of Ras. One important for regulating activation levels of RasGRP is diacylglycerol (DAG), and its levels are influenced by diacylglycerol kinase-ζ (DGKζ), which metabolizes DAG into phosphatidic acid, terminating DAG-mediated Ras signaling. We sought to determine whether DGKζ-deficient CD8(+) T cells demonstrated enhanced in vitro responses in a manner predicted by the current model of Ras activation and to evaluate whether targeting this threshold confers enhanced CD8(+) T cell responsiveness to tumor. We observed that DGKζ-deficient CD8(+) T cells conform to most predictions of the current model of how RasGRP levels influence Ras activation. But our results differ in that the EC(50) value of stimulation is not altered for any T cell receptor stimulus, a finding that suggests a further degree of complexity to how DGKζ deficiency affects signals important for Ras and ERK activation. Additionally, we found that DGKζ-deficient CD8(+) T cells demonstrate enhanced responsiveness in a subcutaneous lymphoma model, implicating the analog to a digital conversion threshold as a novel target for potential therapeutic manipulation."

Kidneys from proteinuric rats showed colocalization of syndecan-1, a major epithelial HSPG, and properdin in the apical membranes of PTEC, which was not seen in control renal tissue. In vitro, PTEC did not constitutively express properdin. However, exogenous properdin binds to these cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Properdin binding was prevented by heparitinase pretreatment of the cells and was dose-dependently inhibited by exogenous heparin. ELISA and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore) showed a strong dose-dependent interaction between heparan sulfate (HS) and properdin (Kd = 128 nm). Pretreatment of HSPG with heparitinase abolished this interaction in ELISA. Competition assays, using a library of HS-like polysaccharides, showed that sulfation pattern, chain length, and backbone composition determine the interaction of properdin with glycosaminoglycans. Interestingly, two nonanticoagulant heparin derivatives inhibited properdin-HS interaction in ELISA and BIAcore. Incubation of PTEC with human serum as complement source led to complement activation and deposition of C3 on the cells.

The complement system plays an important role in glomerular injury and the development of tubulointerstitial scarring in several progressive renal diseases (1Tang S. Lai K.N. Sacks S.H. Kidney Blood Press. Res. 2002; 25: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Hsu S.I. Couser W.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S186-S191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the three complement activation pathways is the alternative pathway (AP), 2The abbreviations used are: APalternative pathwayCSchondroitin sulfateGAGglycosaminoglycanHSheparan sulfateHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycan. and there is growing evidence of activation of AP on renal tubular cells in proteinuric renal diseases (3Biancone L.

The AP is controlled by a number of inhibitory regulators, but there is only one known positive regulator, properdin (8Kemper C. Atkinson J. Hourcade D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 281: 131-155Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Kemper C. Hourcade D.E. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 4048-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Kimura Y. Miwa T. Zhou L. Song W.C. Blood. 2008; 111: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This protein was first discovered in 1954 but received renewed interest in the 1970s (9Kemper C. Hourcade D.E. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 4048-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Properdin is a highly positively charged protein. It is composed of identical subunits that associate together to make dimers, trimers, tetramers, and even higher oligomers. Properdin oligomerization is known to be essential for its function (9Kemper C. Hourcade D.E. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 4048-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). AP activation can be amplified following formation of the C3 convertase complex (C3bBb). Nascent C3bBb is known to be unstable in plasma. Properdin can bind to this complex and stabilizes it 5–10-fold, protecting the complex partially from inhibition by factors I and H (8Kemper C. Atkinson J. Hourcade D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 281: 131-155Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Kemper C. Hourcade D.E. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 4048-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Kimura Y. Miwa T. Zhou L. Song W.C. Blood. 2008; 111: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that extending the half-life of the C3bBb complex is not the only role of properdin. Properdin also may initiate AP activation by binding to the target surface and providing a platform for convertase assembly (11Spitzer D. Mitchell L.M. Atkinson J.P. Hourcade D.E. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2600-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Farries T.C. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In proteinuria, properdin is found in the urine and may bind to proximal tubular cells. In vitro it was demonstrated that this properdin activates the AP on renal cells (6Gaarkeuken H. Siezenga M.A. Zuidwijk K. van Kooten C. Rabelink T.J. Daha M.R. Berger S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1397-F1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Siezenga M.A. van der Geest R.N. Mallat M.J. Rabelink T.J. Daha M.R. Berger S.P. Nephrol. Dial.

Furthermore, the excretion of properdin in urine is correlated with increased urinary levels of the terminal complement cascade complex C5b-9 and with poor renal function (6Gaarkeuken H. Siezenga M.A. Zuidwijk K. van Kooten C. Rabelink T.J. Daha M.R. Berger S.P. Am. J. Physiol.

Transplant. 2010; 25: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although properdin activates the AP on renal tubular cells, the ligand for properdin to bind to these cells is not yet known. A previous study showed that properdin can bind to immobilized heparin (14Yu H. Muñoz E.M. Edens R.E. Linhardt R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In another study comparing wild-type and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, it was shown that properdin binds to these cells via heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan chains and that this binding is dependent on the sulfation pattern of these GAG chains (15Kemper C. Mitchell L.M. Zhang L. Hourcade D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9023-9028Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that properdin binds to apoptotic T cells via GAGs (15Kemper C. Mitchell L.M. Zhang L. Hourcade D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9023-9028Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GAGs are linear polysaccharides covalently bound to a core protein, forming a proteoglycan. Based on the composition of GAG chains, proteoglycans are categorized as heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), keratan sulfate, or dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (16Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 17Rienstra H. Katta K. Celie J.W. van Goor H. Navis G. van den Born J. Hillebrands J.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sulfation pattern on these GAG chains affects activities of proteoglycans (18Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2745-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans are found in the extracellular matrix and on almost all mammalian cell types, and they can interact with many factors among which are growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines (19Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, development, cell-cell adhesion, and signaling (19Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 20Dreyfuss J.L. Regatieri C.V. Jarrouge T.R. Cavalheiro R.P. Sampaio L.O. Nader H.B. An Acad. Bras.

Although proteoglycans play a role in mammalian physiology, under certain conditions they can also be involved in the pathophysiology of certain diseases (19Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The most abundant form of GAGs found in renal tissue is HS (23Murata K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1975; 63: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These HS polysaccharide side chains display variations in sulfation and the expression pattern in renal tubulointerstitium of various renal diseases (24Celie J.W. Reijmers R.M. Slot E.M. Beelen R.H. Spaargaren M. Ter Wee P.M. Florquin S. van den Born J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F253-F263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of AP activation by properdin on renal tubular cells, we studied the possibility of tubular GAGs acting as ligands for properdin. To this end, we searched for the presence of properdin in several proteinuric rat models and investigated the interaction of properdin with heparan sulfate proteoglycans in vitro. Our results showed tubular heparan sulfate proteoglycan to be a platform for properdin binding. We therefore suggest that, upon leakage of proteins from plasma into the primary urine, properdin binds to tubular cells and subsequently leads to complement activation on tubular cells ultimately leading to renal injury. Experimental renal disease was induced in male Wistar rats with a single injection of adriamycin as described previously (25Rook M. Lely A.T. Kramer A.B. van Goor H. Navis G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2005; 20: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein-overload nephropathy was also induced in male Wistar rats as described previously (26van Timmeren M.M. Bakker S.J. Vaidya V.S. Bailly V. Schuurs T.A. Damman J. Stegeman C.A. Bonventre J.V. van Goor H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 291: F456-F464Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Healthy male Wistar rats were used as source of normal control rat renal tissue. Kidneys of rats were obtained, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Sections were cut and used for immunofluorescent staining (see below). Human properdin and polyclonal rabbit anti-human properdin antibodies were prepared as described previously (6Gaarkeuken H. Siezenga M.A. Zuidwijk K. van Kooten C. Rabelink T.J. Daha M.R. Berger S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1397-F1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human syndecan-1 was purchased from Invitrogen, Zymed Laboratories Inc. Frozen sections (5 μm thickness) were cut from rat renal tissue with cryostat Leica CM1950. First, the sections were fixed with acetone for 10 min. The sections were then washed with TBS (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.4), followed by blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.1% H2O2. After washing with TBS, sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min. After washing with TBS, the slides were incubated with 10 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-human properdin antibody diluted in 1% BSA for 1 h. After washing with TBS, sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) (1:100) for 45 min. The HRP antibody was detected by the TSATM tetramethylrhodamine system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (10 min, 1:50). Slides were washed again with TBS and mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI for nuclear staining (Brunschwig Chemie, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The whole staining procedure was done at room temperature. Double staining of properdin and syndecan-1 was done on adriamycin-induced proteinuric rat renal tissue. The double staining was done by Zenon rabbit IgG labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Rabbit anti-human syndecan-1 was labeled with Alexa 647 with a molar ratio 1:6 of antibody/labeling reagent. Rabbit anti-human properdin was labeled with the same molar ratio with Alexa 488. The antibodies were incubated with labeling reagents for 5 min and then blocked with the kit's blocking reagent for an additional 5 min, and the mixtures were applied to the sections and incubated for 1 h. The fixation, washings, and blockings were done as described above. An additional fixation was done with 4% formaldehyde at the end of the process just before mounting. In addition, a binding assay was performed to evaluate the localization and identity of the binding sites for properdin on renal tissue. To this end, sections were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified human properdin before detection with anti-properdin antibody. To cleave HS, pretreatment of the sections was done with heparitinase I (from flavobacterium, 0.05 unit/ml; purchased from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for 1 h at 37 °C. Heparitinase was diluted in acetate buffer (50 mm C2H3O2Na, 5 mm CaCl2·H2O, 5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.0). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica DMLB microscope (Leica Microsystems, Rijswijk, The Netherlands) equipped with a Leica DC300F camera and LeicaQWin 2.8 software. Photos were taken from cortical regions of the tissue in random order. Quantification of the stainings was done in five animals for each group (normal rat renal tissue, adriamycin-induced nephropathy renal tissue, and protein overload-induced nephropathy renal tissue) on 10 randomly taken photos of cortical tubular regions per sample (magnification ×400). In heparitinase I-pretreated sections of normal rat, 10 random photos were taken per field for each group (magnification ×200). The total area stained was quantified using ImageJ 1.41 (rsb.info.nih.gov). The difference between groups in total area stained for properdin was tested with a Mann-Whitney U test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc.). The immortalized human kidney proximal epithelial cell line HK-2 was provided by M. van der Toorn (Laboratory of Allergology and Pulmonary Diseases, University Medical Center, Groningen). Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all purchased from Invitrogen), and also 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 36 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (all purchased from Sigma). For properdin staining on HK-2 cells, the cells were grown on cover glass in wells in medium as described above. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with TBS and incubated with 5% BSA for 15 min. After washing with TBS, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-human properdin antibody. Bound anti-properdin antibody was detected by HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins. The signal was visualized by using the TSATM tetramethylrhodamine system. The whole staining procedure was done on ice without fixation and permeabilization. For evaluating the binding sites for properdin on HK-2 cells, the binding assay was performed following incubation of the cells with 5 μg/ml human properdin before incubation with anti-properdin antibody. Pretreatment of the cells with heparitinase I (from flavobacterium, 0.05 units/ml) was done for 1 h at 37 °C, to cleave HS side chains of proteoglycans on HK-2 cells. The heparitinase was diluted in acetate buffer (50 mm C2H3O2Na, 5 mm CaCl2·H2O, 5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.0). The microscopy and statistics were done in the same fashion as described above. C3 recruitment from serum by HK-2-bound properdin and its dependence on tubular heparan sulfates was tested by FACS staining. HK-2 cells were cultured in 48-well tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated with heparitinase I (from flavobacterium, 0.05 units/ml) and chondroitinase ABC (5 units/ml) diluted in medium without serum at pH 7.2 for 30 min at 37 °C. Both enzymes were purchased from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. After washing the cells with medium, human properdin (10 μg/ml) was added, and incubation was followed for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed again and incubated further with 5% normal human serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed with medium and harvested with nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma). The cells were then transferred to FACS tubes and incubated with rabbit anti-human properdin (to detect properdin binding on cells) or with mouse anti-human C3 (to detect C3 deposition and AP activation on cells) (RFK-22; Laboratory of Nephrology, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged three times, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-APC (Beckman Coulter, Woerden, The Netherlands) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-PE (Southern Biotech Associates, Birmingham, AL) for 30 min on ice. Annexin V (VPS Diagnostics, Hoeven, The Netherlands) was also included for staining of apoptotic and dead cells. Propidium iodide (1 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was used for exclusion of apoptotic cells at the last step. Properdin binding and C3 deposition on cells were assessed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Maxisorp 96-well plates (U96 from VWR International, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were coated overnight in PBS with 5 μg/ml heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG/mouse perlecan, Sigma). After washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, wells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h. In a separate microtiter plate, properdin (0.75 μg/ml diluted in PBS) was incubated with a dilution range of different HS-like heparinoids (see below) for 30 min and transferred to the ELISA plate after the wells were washed again. Incubation in the wells took 1 h. The wells were washed again, and polyclonal rabbit anti-human properdin antibody (10 μg/ml) diluted in PBS was added for 1 h. Secondary antibody was added after a washing step (HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, 1:2000 DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Secondary antibody was detected with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma) for 15 min in the dark, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 n H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader. All incubations were done at room temperature in a volume of 100 μl/well. Heparin from ovine intestinal mucosa, heparin from bovine lung, heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, CS-A, CS-B, CS-C, dextran, dextran sulfate, fucoidan, N-acetylated heparin porcine intestine, and perlecan HSPG were from Sigma. Fraxiparin (molecular weight ≈4500) was purchased from Sanofi Winthrop (Maassluis, The Netherlands); Fragmin® (molecular weight ≈6000) was purchased from Pharmacia & Upjohn, and enoxaparin or clexane (molecular weight ≈4500) were purchased from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (Paris, France). Keratan sulfate, isolated from bovine cartilage, was obtained from Fluka Biochemicals (Buchs, Switzerland). HS isolated from bovine kidney or from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma and N-sulfated K5 were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. Escherichia coli capsular polysaccharide K5, with the same (GlcUA→GlcNAc)n structure as the nonsulfated HS/heparin precursor polysaccharide (27Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); O-sulfated K5; low molecular weight O-sulfated K5; and N-desulfated reacetylated heparin were kindly provided by Dr. G. van Dedem (Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands). HS from bovine intestine was kindly provided by Marco Maccarana (Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center, University of Lund, Sweden) (28Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). HS from human aorta was isolated essentially as described by Iverius (29Iverius P.H. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). N-Deacetylation was performed by hydrazinolysis as described previously (30Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). N-Acetylation of polysaccharides was performed by treatment with acetic anhydride as described by Danishefsky and Steiner (31Danishefsky I. Steiner H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 101: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Completely (N- and O-) desulfated heparin was prepared according to Bäckström et al. (32Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. Jacobsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reacetylated as described above. N+O-sulfated K5 was produced by N-deacetylation (hydrazinolysis), subsequent N-sulfation with sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine (33Rej R.N. Ludwig-Baxter K.G. Perlin A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 210: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), followed by N-acetylation. The same procedure was followed for HS from bovine kidney to make a fully N-sulfated HS and for completely desulfated heparin to make O-desulfated, N-sulfated heparin (34van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31303-31309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Size-defined heparin (6 kDa) and HS (15 kDa) were biotinylated at the reducing end and immobilized on a BIAcore sensor chip (BIAcore AB) in different flow cells as described previously (35Vivès R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For this purpose, three flow cells of a CM4 sensor chip on a BIAcore 1000 were activated with 50 μl of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide before injection of 50 μl of streptavidin (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.2). Remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Typically, this procedure permitted coupling of 2000–2500 resonance units of streptavidin. Biotinylated heparin (5 μg/ml) in HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.3 m NaCl was then injected over the second flow cell to obtain an immobilization level of 60 resonance units. Similarly, an HS surface was prepared on the third flow cell (70 resonance units). The first flow cell was left with streptavidin only, as a negative control. Flow cells were then conditioned with several injections of 1 m NaCl. For binding assays, different concentrations of purified human properdin (ranging from 0 to 200 μg/ml) in HBS-P buffer (HBS plus 0.005% surfactant P20) were injected over the streptavidin only, heparin, and HS surfaces for 5 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, followed by a 5-min washing with HBS-P buffer (BIAcore AB) and a 2-min regeneration step with 3 m MgCl2. For competition experiments, different polysaccharides (at 2.5 μg/ml, final concentration) were incubated with purified human properdin (12.5 μg/ml, final concentration) for 30 min and then injected on the heparin coated flow cell, at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Sensorgrams were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software to determine the on and off rate constants (kon and koff) from which the affinity Kd value was calculated (Kd = koff/koff). Syndecan-1 is a major cell surface HSPG on tubular cells. By a double staining approach in adriamycin nephrotic rats, we demonstrated the presence of syndecan-1 at basal and apical cell membranes, whereas properdin was only present at the apical cell membranes and nicely colocalized with syndecan-1 (Fig. 1, A–D). Based on the location of these tubules (mostly cortex), the diameter and the presence of a brush border, we identified these tubules as being proximal tubules. In protein overload nephropathy, properdin exactly localized in the same apical tubular membranes, which was not found at all in control renal tissue. Results of quantification showed a significant increase in the presence of tubular properdin in protein overload-induced nephropathy and adriamycin-induced nephropathy as compared with normal rat renal tissue (Fig. 1E). Addition of exogenous properdin (10 μg/ml) to normal rat renal tissue sections resulted in properdin binding to tubular cells. This binding could be reduced significantly following pretreatment of the tissue by means of the HS-degrading enzyme, heparitinase I (Fig. 1F). We found that proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) did not show a positive staining for properdin under normal culture conditions (Fig. 2A). However, incubation of unfixed, living cells with exogenous properdin on ice resulted in the binding of properdin to these cells as shown by immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2B). Before incubation with properdin, pretreatment of HK-2 cells with heparitinase I (which cleaves HS polysaccharide chains from these cells) resulted in a significant reduction of properdin binding to the cells (Fig. 2C). Preincubation of properdin with increasing concentrations of heparin dose-dependently reduced the binding of properdin to HK-2 cells (Fig. 2, D–F). We next treated HK-2 cells with GAG-degrading enzymes, followed by properdin incubation and detection of cell-bound properdin by FACS analysis. In control cells without enzyme pretreatment, properdin binding to HK-2 cells was observed as seen previously. However, after cleaving the HS side chains from the cells with heparitinase I, a strong reduction in properdin binding was observed (Fig. 2, G and H). This was not the case after chondroitinase ABC treatment of the cells, which cleaves CS and dermatan sulfate chains. A combination of both enzymes reduced properdin binding to HK-2 cells in a fashion comparable with use of heparitinase alone (Fig. 2, G and H). These enzyme treatments provide evidence that properdin specifically binds to HS present on HK-2 cells. In ELISA, properdin dose-dependently interacted with immobilized HSPG as shown in Fig. 3. Pretreatment of plate-bound HSPG with heparitinase I before properdin incubation completely abolished any properdin-HSPG interaction, whereas an antibody against the core protein of this HSPG remained bound after heparitinase digestion. The HSPG binding even increased, most probably due to reduced steric hindrance resulting from removal of the HS chains. Based on these experiments, we concluded that properdin binding to HSPG occurs via the HS GAG side chains. The binding of properdin to solid-phase HSPG was investigated using competition experiments with a number of different HS preparations from various sources (see Table 1). Table 1, part A, shows that only one out of four HS preparations was able to bind to properdin, namely HS isolated from human aorta. This suggests that the epitope for properdi"
https://openalex.org/W2122076384,"Mutations in the human TGFBI gene encoding TGFBIp have been linked to protein deposits in the cornea leading to visual impairment. The protein consists of an N-terminal Cys-rich EMI domain and four consecutive fasciclin 1 (FAS1) domains. We have compared the stabilities of wild-type (WT) human TGFBIp and six mutants known to produce phenotypically distinct deposits in the cornea. Amino acid substitutions in the first FAS1 (FAS1-1) domain (R124H, R124L, and R124C) did not alter the stability. However, substitutions within the fourth FAS1 (FAS1-4) domain (A546T, R555Q, and R555W) affected the overall stability of intact TGFBIp revealing the following stability ranking R555W>WT>R555Q>A546T. Significantly, the stability ranking of the isolated FAS1-4 domains mirrored the behavior of the intact protein. In addition, it was linked to the aggregation propensity as the least stable mutant (A546T) forms amyloid fibrils while the more stable variants generate non-amyloid amorphous deposits in vivo. Significantly, the data suggested that both an increase and a decrease in the stability of FAS1-4 may unleash a disease mechanism. In contrast, amino acid substitutions in FAS1-1 did not affect the stability of the intact TGFBIp suggesting that molecular the mechanism of disease differs depending on the FAS1 domain carrying the mutation. Mutations in the human TGFBI gene encoding TGFBIp have been linked to protein deposits in the cornea leading to visual impairment. The protein consists of an N-terminal Cys-rich EMI domain and four consecutive fasciclin 1 (FAS1) domains. We have compared the stabilities of wild-type (WT) human TGFBIp and six mutants known to produce phenotypically distinct deposits in the cornea. Amino acid substitutions in the first FAS1 (FAS1-1) domain (R124H, R124L, and R124C) did not alter the stability. However, substitutions within the fourth FAS1 (FAS1-4) domain (A546T, R555Q, and R555W) affected the overall stability of intact TGFBIp revealing the following stability ranking R555W>WT>R555Q>A546T.

During these processes, proteolytic activities of tumor and stromal cells modify the extracellular matrix to produce a microenvironment suitable for their growth and migration. In recent years the family of ADAM proteases has been ascribed important roles in these processes. ADAM-9 is expressed in human melanoma at the tumor-stroma border where direct or indirect interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts occur. To analyze the role of ADAM-9 for the interaction between melanoma cells and stromal fibroblasts, we produced the recombinant disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain of ADAM-9 (DC-9). Melanoma cells and human fibroblasts adhered to immobilized DC-9 in a Mn2+-dependent fashion suggesting an integrin-mediated process. Inhibition studies showed that adhesion of fibroblasts was mediated by several β1 integrin receptors independent of the RGD and ECD recognition motif. Furthermore, interaction of fibroblasts and high invasive melanoma cells with soluble recombinant DC-9 resulted in enhanced expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2. Silencing of ADAM-9 in melanoma cells significantly reduced cell adhesion to fibroblasts. Ablation of ADAM-9 in fibroblasts almost completely abolished these cellular interactions and melanoma cell invasion in vitro. In summary, these results suggest that ADAM-9 expression plays an important role in mediating cell-cell contacts between fibroblasts and melanoma cells and that these interactions contribute to proteolytic activities required during invasion of melanoma cells.

Growth and progression of human melanoma is a process that requires a cascade of different cellular processes including cellular interactions and proteolytic cleavage of growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins. ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; DC, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; CMFDA, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; FGFR2iiib, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2(iiib); EphB4, ephrin-type B receptor 4; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin. with both their proteolytic and adhesive functions play a pivotal role in these processes (1Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Most of the members of the ADAM family share a general phylogenetically well-conserved domain structure including a pro-, metalloprotease-, disintegrin-like-, cysteine rich-, EGF-like-, and cytoplasmic domain (reviewed by Refs. 2Bergers G. Coussens L.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from their proteolytic activity, ADAMs exert also adhesive functions, which are mediated for example in ADAM-15 by the RGD motif in the disintegrin-like domain (4Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For other ADAMs, as ADAM-2 and ADAM-9, an electron capture detection motif (ECD) also located within the disintegrin-like domain has been reported to be responsible for this event (5Chen M.S. Tung K.S. Coonrod S.A. Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Chang A. Yamashita Y. Kincade P.W. Herr J.C. White J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that ADAM-15 interacts with ανβ3 and α5β1 integrins (7Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ADAM-2 binds to α6β1 integrin and ADAM-9 to α6β1, ανβ5 and α3β1 integrins (6Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Stephens P.E.

The interactions of ADAM proteases with cellular receptors have been proven to be of major importance in cell adhesion and fusion processes as for instance during spermatogenesis (ADAM-1, -16, -20) and myo- and osteogenesis (ADAM-9, -12, -19) (1Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that ADAM-9 is expressed in both human and mouse epidermis. In keratinocytes, the adhesive activity of ADAM-9 leads to modulation of MMP-9 expression and cell migration (10Zigrino P. Steiger J. Fox J.W. Löffek S. Schild A. Nischt R. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30785-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further, proteolysis via ADAM-9 in keratinocytes has been shown to be important for the constitutive shedding of collagen XVII (11Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schäcke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Altered collagen XVII shedding was also detected in skin of ADAM-9-deficient mice, resulting in increased keratinocyte migration and accelerated skin repair (11Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schäcke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Mauch C. Zamek J. Abety A.N. Grimberg G. Fox J.W. Zigrino P. J. Invest Dermatol. 2010; 130: 2120-2130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Altered expression of certain ADAMs has been associated with a number of diseases including asthma, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and cancer (13O'Shea C. McKie N. Buggy Y. Duggan C. Hill A.D. McDermott E. O'Higgins N. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, relatively sparse information is available on the functional role of ADAMs in malignancy. Expression of ADAM-9, -10, -12 is increased in breast cancer (13O'Shea C. McKie N. Buggy Y. Duggan C. Hill A.D. McDermott E. O'Higgins N. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ADAM-9 is also expressed in human melanoma where it is localized on melanoma cells and peritumoral stromal fibroblasts while this protein was not found in fibroblasts distant from the tumor site (14Zigrino P. Mauch C. Fox J.W. Nischt R. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In prostate cancer ADAM-9 plays a tumor promoting role which was attributed to its ability to cleave EGF and FGFR2IIIb thereby altering signaling (15Peduto L. Reuter V.E. Shaffer D.R. Scher H.I. Blobel C.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9312-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a soluble form of ADAM-9 is produced by activated stellate cells that bind via α6β4 integrin to tumor cells at the border of liver metastasis and promote in vitro invasion (16Mazzocca A. Coppari R. De Franco R. Cho J.Y. Libermann T.A. Pinzani M. Toker A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4728-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, ADAM-9 has also been implicated in pathological neovascularization likely by modulating expression of EphB4, Tie-2, Flk-1, CD40, VCAM, and VE-cadherin, which all have been identified as substrates of ADAM-9 (17Guaiquil V. Swendeman S. Yoshida T. Chavala S. Campochiaro P.A. Blobel C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2694-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Many studies over the last years were focused on the role of the proteolytic domain of ADAM-9. By contrast, less is known about the function of its adhesive domain for melanoma cell interactions. To elucidate the role of ADAM-9 as an adhesive receptor for human skin fibroblasts and melanoma cells, the recombinant disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains (DC-9) (10Zigrino P. Steiger J. Fox J.W. Löffek S. Schild A. Nischt R. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30785-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were used as substrate for cell attachment experiments. Here we show that both fibroblasts and melanoma cells adhere to the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM-9. This interaction is mediated by β1-containing integrin receptors and leads to augmentation of proteolytic activities. More importantly, we provide evidence that ADAM-9 is directly involved in melanoma cell-fibroblast interactions which might affect the invasive behavior of melanoma cells. For Western blot analysis goat polyclonal antibodies raised against human ADAM-9 were purchased from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Actin was detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The blocking monoclonal mouse antibody 4B4 directed against the human β1-integrin chain was obtained from Coulter Corp. (Hialeah, FL); the antibodies against the human β3- and the α-integrin subunits from Chemicon (Beta1 Integrin Partners Kit; Hofheim, Germany). Antibodies directed against MMP-1 were a kind gift from P. Angel (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg). Primary human and murine dermal fibroblasts were obtained by outgrowth from skin explants as previously described (18Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Fibroblasts were passaged by trypsinization at a ratio of 1:2 every 5 days and used at passages 1–10. The human melanoma cell lines (19Löffek S. Zigrino P. Steiger J. Kurschat P. Smola H. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MV3 cells were transiently transfected with double-stranded RNA encoding ADAM-9 sequences (20Asai M. Hattori C. Szabó B. Sasagawa N. Maruyama K. Tanuma S. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). After 6 h, medium was replaced and ADAM-9 expression analyzed after further 24 and 48 h of culture. Semi-confluent mono-layer cultures of human primary fibroblasts or melanoma cells were detached with 0.05% EDTA. The cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer (1 mm Hepes, 0.5% BSA, 1 mm of each CaCl2 and MnCl2). Adhesion assays were performed as described before (10Zigrino P. Steiger J. Fox J.W. Löffek S. Schild A. Nischt R. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30785-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well tissue culture plates were coated with recombinant DC-9 and His6 peptide (0.6 μm) at 4 °C overnight. Expression and purification of the disintegrin-cysteine rich domain of ADAM-9 has been described elsewhere (10Zigrino P. Steiger J. Fox J.W. Löffek S. Schild A. Nischt R. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30785-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). BSA coating and blocking of nonspecific binding sites were performed with heat-denatured BSA (1% BSA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the wells, 2 × 104 cells/well were seeded and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For competition assays, antibodies (10 μg/ml) or peptides (0.6 μm) were added to the cell suspension before plating. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.6, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol. The dye was released from the cells by addition of 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% (v/v) ethanol. The absorbance (A) of the released dye solution was determined at 595 nm. Adhesion was either expressed directly as A595 nm or as percentage relative to untreated controls, which were set arbitrarily as 100%. Statistical analysis was performed with the ANOVA Dunnett's multiple comparison test or Student's t test. Analysis of melanoma cell adhesion to fibroblasts was performed as described previously (21Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, melanoma cells were labeled with 0.5 μm CellTrackerTM CMFDA (5-chloromethyl-fluorescein diacetate; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. After extensive washes, 2 × 104 cells/well were seeded onto confluent monolayers of fibroblasts in 96-well plates for 30 min. After incubation, not adhered cells were removed and attached cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Bound cells were counted in 5 microscopic fields in three separate wells and averaged. Alternatively, cells were resuspended and their fluorescence measured in a Victor Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer). Melanoma cell invasion was assayed using transwell with polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size, Corning Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). The filters were coated with 25 μl of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and placed above the lower compartment, which contained either 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium or fibroblast-conditioned medium. GFP-expressing B16F1 melanoma cells (22Zigrino P. Kuhn I. Bäuerle T. Zamek J. Fox J.W. Neumann S. Licht A. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Mauch C. J. Invest Dermatol. 2009; 129: 2686-2693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) mixed 2:1 with primary wild type or ADAM-9 knock-out fibroblasts were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 (1 × 105/ml) and seeded into the upper compartment of the chamber. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Cells attached to the upper side of the filter were mechanically removed. The filters were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and nuclei stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI. Invasion was determined by counting the GFP-positive cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter. For each filter, the number of cells in 5 randomly chosen microscope fields was determined and averaged. The experiment was performed twice each in quadruplicates. Total RNA was prepared using RNAzol (Wak-Chemie Medical GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). For RT-PCR (REDTaqTM ReadyMixTM PCR Reaction Mix, Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo dT. The following primers were used for amplification of human ADAM-9: 5′-CCTCGGGGACCCTTCGTGT and 5′-ATCCCATAACTCGCATTCTCTAAA (10Zigrino P. Steiger J. Fox J.W. Löffek S. Schild A. Nischt R. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30785-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Amplification of S26 was used for normalization (18Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed for 32 cycles (within the linear range of amplification): denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (60 °C, 1 min) and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. Serum-free conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography as previously described (18Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15–20 μl of supernatants (corresponding to 10 μg of cell lysate) were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (bovine, Sigma). Gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min before overnight incubation in metalloproteinase substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2) and stained with Coomassie Blue R 250. Bands corresponding to gelatinase activities appeared white against a blue background. Lysates were prepared by directly scraping off the cells on ice in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet® P40, 0,5% Natriumdesoxycholat, 0,1% SDS) containing aprotinin (10 μg/ml), Pefabloc (0.25 mg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). Protein concentration was determined using a commercial assay (MicroBCA, Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany). For detection of MMP-1 supernatants corresponding to 10 μg of cell lysates were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred onto Hybond-C SuperTM (GE Healthcare, München, Germany). The blots were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Bound primary antibodies were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000; Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and visualized using ECL system (GE Healthcare). To analyze the role of ADAM-9 as an adhesive substrate for human fibroblasts we performed cell adhesion assays using the recombinant disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM-9 (DC-9) as immobilized substrate (Fig. 1A). Adhesion of fibroblasts was maximal at a coating concentration of 50 μg/ml reaching about 60% of the adhesion level determined with serum, which was used as a positive control substrate. At all coating concentrations of DC-9 fibroblasts showed a spread morphology demonstrating an active process of substrate recognition and signaling. Furthermore, comparable adhesion to DC-9 was detected using human skin fibroblasts isolated from 8 individuals of different sex and age at passages between 4 and 7. This indicates that adhesion of fibroblasts to DC-9 is not dependent on the cell source (data not shown). Adhesion of human fibroblasts to recombinant DC-9 was dependent on the presence of Mn2+ ions, which is in line with an integrin-dependent adhesion process (data not shown). Human fibroblasts express several integrin receptors in vivo and in vitro and these include integrins of the β1 and β3 subgroups (23Margadant C. Sonnenberg A. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To identify the integrin subunit mediating cell adhesion to DC-9, we incubated fibroblasts in the presence of different inhibitory anti-integrin antibodies before performing adhesion assays. Antibodies directed against the β1 but not the β3 integrin subunit efficiently inhibited adhesion (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, antibodies against the α3, α5, and α6 integrin chains reduced adhesion by 50, 30, and 60%, respectively, whereas inhibitory antibodies directed against the α1, α2, and α4 subunits had no significant effect when compared with the antibody-untreated control. This demonstrates that multiple β1-containing integrin receptors contribute to the adhesion of fibroblasts to DC-9. Interestingly, the ECD cyclic peptide did not affect adhesion to immobilized DC-9. This indicates that the ECD motif located in the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM-9 does not contribute to ADAM-9 mediated adhesion (Fig. 1B). The RGD sequence, albeit not present in ADAM-9, was used to exclude that binding through closely associated RGD dependent receptors e.g. integrins α5β1 and αvβ3, which are expressed by fibroblasts, might interfere with cell adhesion to DC-9. This peptide as well as the control peptides containing the RAD and ECD scrambled motifs had no effect on the adhesion of fibroblasts to DC-9. In addition, adhesion of fibroblasts to DC-9 either applied as immobilized or soluble substrate, induced synthesis of MMP-1 and MMP-2 as well as proMMP-2 activation (Fig. 2). Melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro express ADAM-9 (14Zigrino P. Mauch C. Fox J.W. Nischt R. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using melanoma cells of various invasive abilities we analyzed whether melanoma cells bind to the adhesive domains of ADAM-9 and whether the differences in adhesion correlate with their invasive potential. All melanoma cell lines adhered to DC-9 (Fig. 3). Adhesion to DC-9 was high for the low invasive cell lines IF6, Skmel 28, and WM 164, reaching at the coating concentration of 100 μg/ml almost the same adhesion level as determined on serum, which was used as positive control substrate. Interestingly, adhesion of all high invasive melanoma cell lines BLM, MV3, and VMM5 to DC-9 was significantly lower at all coating concentrations. MV3 cells showed the highest adhesion level at a coating concentration of 10 μg/ml. However, adhesion was significantly lower at the same substrate concentration when compared with low invasive Skmel 28 and WM164 cells. MMP-2 expression was slightly increased in the high invasive MV3 and BLM cells by treatment with soluble DC-9 as compared with low invasive melanoma cells (Fig. 3, right panel). In summary, these results indicate that adhesion to DC-9 and alterations of MMP-2 expression/activation do not directly correlate with the invasive capacity of the melanoma cells. Adhesion of ADAMs to integrin receptors has been shown to result in cell-cell interactions as in the case of ADAM-15 (24Charrier L. Yan Y. Nguyen H.T. Dalmasso G. Laboisse C.L. Gewirtz A.T. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16948-16958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and ADAM-9. For ADAM-9 this leads to cellular fusion of monocytes and macrophages (25Namba K. Nishio M. Mori K. Miyamoto N. Tsurudome M. Ito M. Kawano M. Uchida A. Ito Y. Cell. Immunol. 2001; 213: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Puissegur M.P. Lay G. Gilleron M. Botella L. Nigou J. Marrakchi H. Mari B. Duteyrat J.L. Guerardel Y. Kremer L. Barbry P. Puzo G. Altare F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3161-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether ADAM-9 may function as a cell surface receptor mediating interactions of melanoma cells and fibroblasts, MV3 cells were labeled with the fluorochrome CMFDA and seeded on top of confluent fibroblast monolayers in the absence or presence of recombinant DC-9 (Fig. 4). While MV3 cells attached to fibroblasts in the absence of DC-9, this interaction was significantly reduced when DC-9 was added to the incubation buffer. Increasing concentrations of DC-9 up to 50 μg/ml had no further effect. As fibroblasts as well as melanoma cells express ADAM-9 and thus both cell types may be involved in mediating cellular interactions, we used in a second approach murine dermal fibroblasts isolated from ADAM-9-deficient mice. In addition, to reduce expression of ADAM-9 also in melanoma cells we applied siRNA targeting sequences shown previously to be effective for silencing (27Fischer O.M. Hart S. Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5172-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Transient silencing of ADAM-9 for 48 h in MV3 melanoma cells resulted in an almost complete reduction of ADAM-9 mRNA. However, ADAM-9 protein was reduced by only about 50% (Fig. 5A), which might result from a slow turnover of the protein. Using these MV3 cells in cell-cell adhesion assays with murine wild-type fibroblasts, the number of melanoma cells attaching to fibroblasts was significantly lower (Fig. 5B) when compared with melanoma cells with normal ADAM-9 expression (+). In addition, cell-cell interaction between MV3 cells with reduced ADAM-9 expression (low) and ADAM-9 knock-out fibroblasts (Fb-) was further decreased when compared with the corresponding controls. The difference in attachment of MV3 cells with reduced ADAM-9 expression to wild-type fibroblasts compared with those attached to ADAM-9 knock-out fibroblasts was highly significant (***, p < 0.0004). Comparable results were obtained with B16F1 murine melanoma cells which express ADAM-9 (data not shown). The attachment to ADAM-9 knock-out fibroblasts was about 50% lower than the attachment to wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 5C). To analyze whether ADAM-9-mediated cell-cell interactions affect the invasive behavior of melanoma cells, B16F1 melanoma cells expressing GFP were seeded in a 2:1 ratio with wild-type or ADAM-9-deficient fibroblasts on matrigel-coated transwells. The melanoma cells which have migrated through the matrigel were counted after 24 and 48 h, (Fig. 5D). After 24 h, the number of invaded melanoma cells was similar independent of the type of fibroblasts. However, after 48 h, the number of invaded melanoma cells was dramatically reduced in the presence of ADAM-9 knock-out fibroblasts when compared with the wild type control. This suggests that loss of ADAM-9-mediated cross-talk between fibroblasts and melanoma cells contributes significantly to the invasive behavior of melanoma cells in vitro. Several lines of evidence point to a role for ADAM-9 in the development and spreading of a variety of tumors (28Peduto L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ADAM-9 protein expression is increased in melanoma in vivo and melanoma cells in vitro (14Zigrino P. Mauch C. Fox J.W. Nischt R. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, a high-throughput analysis of human melanomas revealed a correlation between ADAM-9 expression and melanoma progression (29Alonso S.R. Tracey L. Ortiz P. Pérez-Gómez B. Palacios J. Pollán M. Linares J. Serrano S. Sáez-Castillo A.I. Sánchez L. Pajares R. Sánchez-Aguilera A. Artiga M.J. Piris M.A. Rodríguez-Peralto J.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3450-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, the understanding how ADAM-9 contributes to melanoma growth and invasion and by which function, proteolytic or adhesive, is still rudimentary. In this report we have addressed the adhesive role of ADAM-9 for cellular processes involved in melanoma progression. Using the recombinant disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM-9 as immobilized substrates we show that human primary dermal fibroblasts strongly adhere to this substrate and that adhesion is primarily mediated by β1 integrin receptors (see Fig. 1B). Keratinocytes also interact with ADAM-9 via a β1 integrin receptor (10Zigrino P. Steiger J. Fox J.W. Löffek S. Schild A. Nischt R. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30785-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) indicating a narrow specificity of receptor recognition. Interestingly, in both studies adhesion was not altered in the presence of peptides containing the ECD motif, which is located within the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM-9 (30Blobel C.P. White J.M. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These results are in good agreement with a crystal structure study of the vascular apoptosis-inducing protein-1 (VAP-1), a snake venom homologue of mammalian ADAMs. In this study the high variable region in the cysteine-rich domain was shown to be responsible for substrate interaction, whereas the disintegrin loop containing the ECD motif turned out to be masked and inaccessible for protein binding (31Takeda S. Igarashi T. Mori H. Araki S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Serrano S.M. Jia L.G. Wang D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that various integrins, including α3β1, α5β1, and α6β1, are involved in DC-9 mediated adhesion of fibroblasts. This suggests, as already observed for other cell types which recognize the soluble ADAM-9 domain via both α6β4 and α2β1 integrins (16Mazzocca A. Coppari R. De Franco R. Cho J.Y. Libermann T.A. Pinzani M. Toker A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4728-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), that several integrin receptors are able to contribute to the interaction with the adhesive domains of ADAM-9. Adhesion to the DC-9 was also detected using different melanoma cell lines. Adhesion was dependent on the presence of Mn2+ but not of Ca2+ ions indicating an integrin-mediated process (data not shown). The number of adhering cells tended to be higher for the low invasive melanoma cells than for the high invasive ones. This difference may be attributed to different integrin expression profiles on the cell surface of differently invasive cells. In vivo studies revealed that expression of integrin α6β1 and/or α6β4 is more common in nevi than in malignant melanomas, whereas most lesions of malignant melanoma seem to contain cells expressing α2β1, α3β1, and αvβ3 integrins (35Heino J. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus it is tempting to speculate that interaction of melanoma cells with ADAM-9 depends on the expression of specific integrin receptors which in turn might play a role for the invasiveness of these cells. Interestingly, adhesion of both fibroblasts and melanoma cells to recombinant ADAM-9 domains was paralleled by alterations of cellular activities. Fibroblast displayed increased spreading and secretion of MMP-1 and -2 when plated on DC-9. Incubation of melanoma cells with increasing concentrations of soluble DC-9 also resulted in slightly increased levels of MMP-2 expression and activation, however, no effect was seen in low invasive melanoma cells or in control cells treated with the histidine peptide. Induction of MMPs can be stimulated by growth factors and cytokines but also by engagement of integrin receptors (18Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that increased expression and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-14 in MV3 and BLM melanoma cells occur upon α2β1 interaction with collagen (18Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Kurschat P. Zigrino P. Nischt R. Breitkopf K. Steurer P. Klein C.E. Krieg T. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21056-21062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, these changes are only observed in the presence of fibrillar but not monomeric collagen type I suggesting that integrin clustering by a more complex substrate may be required for this response. Similarly, while we could detect adhesion to ADAM-9 already at low substrate levels, a prominent increase in proteolytic activities occurred only in the presence of high amounts. These high levels may be a prerequisite for integrin clustering and hence for inhanced expression of MMP-1 and -2 as detected in fibroblasts and high invasive melanoma cells. In vivo expression of both MMP-2 and MMP-1 has been detected in peritumoral fibroblasts. MMP-2 is also found in tumor cells invading the underlying tissue in human melanoma (38Kurschat P. Wickenhauser C. Groth W. Krieg T. Mauch C. J. Pathol. 2002; 197: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Hofmann U.B. Westphal J.R. Waas E.T. Zendman A.J. Cornelissen I.M.

Dermatol. 2000; 9: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In line with these observations our data suggest that ADAM-9 mediated cell interaction might provide an additional mechanism to increase proteolytic activities in the tumor microenvironment thus contributing to melanoma cell invasion. Importantly, we show that ADAM-9 mediates direct interactions between melanoma cells and fibroblasts as incubation of fibroblasts and melanoma cells with soluble DC-9 resulted in significant reduction of cell-cell adhesion. This finding is stressed by the observation that a strong reduction of cell-cell adhesion occurs when ADAM-9 was ablated in either melanoma cells or fibroblasts. Adhesion of fibroblasts to DC-9 was almost completely abolished in the presence of anti-β1 integrin antibodies, suggesting a heterotypic adhesion process mediated by the interaction of ADAM-9 with integrin receptors. This notion is supported by the finding that ADAM-9 depletion in both cell types resulted in a further reduction of cell-cell adhesion between fibroblasts and melanoma cells, indicating that homotypic interactions between ADAM molecules are not significantly contributing to this adhesion process. Adhesion is not completely abrogated, which we think is most likely due to the incomplete silencing of ADAM-9 protein in melanoma cells. Similar types of cellular interactions have been shown for ADAM-15 between T-lymphocytes and epithelial cells (24Charrier L. Yan Y. Nguyen H.T. Dalmasso G. Laboisse C.L. Gewirtz A.T. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16948-16958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In these cells interactions led to secretion of pro-inflammatory factors thus suggesting a putative role of ADAM-15 in eliciting inflammatory responses. In this report we show that interactions through ADAM-9 also elicit cellular responses such as secretion of proteolytic enzymes. As ablation of ADAM-9 in fibroblasts resulted in strong inhibition of melanoma cell invasion in vitro, we speculate that these interactions leading to altered secretion of proteases are involved in the invasion process. In line with this hypothesis is the work from Stuelten and co-authors (41Stuelten C.H. Busch J.I. Tang B. Flanders K.C. Oshima A. Sutton E. Karpova T.S. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Niederhuber J.E. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showing that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts are necessary to modify the local microenvironment and increase tumorigenicity of cancer cells in vivo. In conclusion, we have shown that ADAM-9 is an adhesive protein, which induces cell signaling leading to increased proteolytic activities. Most importantly, it mediates fibroblast-melanoma cell interactions and seems to be important for melanoma invasion. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which ADAM-9 ablation interferes with melanoma cell invasion and whether this results not only in impaired invasion but also in alterations of tumor growth in vivo. We thank Julia Steiger and Claudia Coerper-Ochsmann for excellent technical assistance, Dr. Carl Blobel (Hospital for Special Surgery New York) for kindly providing the ADAM-9-deficient mice, and Dr. Beate Eckes for helpful comments on this manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2024053980,"Intercellular signaling is important for accurate circadian rhythms. In Drosophila, the small ventral lateral neurons (s-LN(v)s) are the dominant pacemaker neurons and set the pace of most other clock neurons in constant darkness. Here we show that two distinct G protein signaling pathways are required in LN(v)s for 24 hr rhythms. Reducing signaling in LN(v)s via the G alpha subunit Gs, which signals via cAMP, or via the G alpha subunit Go, which we show signals via Phospholipase 21c, lengthens the period of behavioral rhythms. In contrast, constitutive Gs or Go signaling makes most flies arrhythmic. Using dissociated LN(v)s in culture, we found that Go and the metabotropic GABA(B)-R3 receptor are required for the inhibitory effects of GABA on LN(v)s and that reduced GABA(B)-R3 expression in vivo lengthens period. Although no clock neurons produce GABA, hyperexciting GABAergic neurons disrupts behavioral rhythms and s-LN(v) molecular clocks. Therefore, s-LN(v)s require GABAergic inputs for 24 hr rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W1966271494,"The essential and evolutionarily conserved Smc5-Smc6 complex (Smc5/6) is critical for the maintenance of genome stability. Partial loss of Smc5/6 function yields several defects in DNA repair, which are rescued by inactivation of the homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Thus HR is thought to be toxic to cells with defective Smc5/6. Recent work has highlighted a role for Smc5/6 and the Sgs1 DNA helicase in preventing the accumulation of unresolved HR intermediates. Here we investigate how deletion of MPH1, encoding the orthologue of the human FANCM DNA helicase, rescues the DNA damage sensitivity of smc5/6 but not sgs1Δ mutants. We find that MPH1 deletion diminishes accumulation of HR intermediates within both smc5/6 and sgs1Δ cells, suggesting that MPH1 deletion is sufficient to decrease the use of template switch recombination (TSR) to bypass DNA lesions. We further explain how avoidance of TSR is nonetheless insufficient to rescue defects in sgs1Δ mutants, by demonstrating a requirement for Sgs1, along with the post-replicative repair (PRR) and HR machinery, in a pathway that operates in mph1Δ mutants. In addition, we map the region of Mph1 that binds Smc5, and describe a novel allele of MPH1 encoding a protein unable to bind Smc5 (mph1-Δ60). Remarkably, mph1-Δ60 supports normal growth and responses to DNA damaging agents, indicating that Smc5/6 does not simply restrain the recombinogenic activity of Mph1 via direct binding. These data as a whole highlight a role for Smc5/6 and Sgs1 in the resolution of Mph1-dependent HR intermediates."

These findings suggest the existence of compartment specific dynamics for O-GlcNAc in response to signal-inducing stimuli, pointing to complex regulation of this modification. In addition, inhibition of the PI3K pathway by wortmannin abolished the O-GlcNAc response, suggesting that the activity observed is modulated downstream of the PI3K pathway. Taken together, our data argues that O-GlcNAc is a rapidly induced component of signaling and that the interplay between O-GlcNAc and kinase signaling may be more akin to the complex relationship between kinase pathways. β-O-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification involved in a plethora of biological systems ranging from cellular stress to insulin signaling.

These ligands require the inserted (I) domain within the α2 subunit of α2β1 for binding. Previous studies have identified the binding sites for collagen and echovirus 1 in the α2 I domain. We used CHO cells expressing mutated α2β1 to identify amino acids involved in binding to human and animal rotaviruses. Residues where mutation affected rotavirus binding were located in several exposed loops and adjacent regions of the α2 I domain. Binding by all rotaviruses was eliminated by mutations in the activation-responsive αC-α6 and αF helices. This is a novel feature that distinguishes rotavirus from other α2β1 ligands. Mutation of residues that co-ordinate the metal ion (Ser-153, Thr-221, and Glu-256 in α2 and Asp-130 in β1) and nearby amino acids (Ser-154, Gln-215, and Asp-219) also inhibited rotavirus binding. The importance of most of these residues was greatest for binding by human rotaviruses. These mutations inhibit collagen binding to α2β1 (apart from Glu-256) but do not affect echovirus binding. Overall, residues where mutation affected both rotavirus and collagen recognition are located at one side of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site, whereas those important for collagen alone cluster nearby.

Protease cleavage of VP4 facilitates rotavirus infectivity and generates the virion-associated VP5* (60 kDa) and VP8* (28 kDa) subunits. Truncated RRV VP5* binds expressed α2I protein and competes with RRV for binding to cell surface-expressed α2β1 (7Graham K.L. Halasz P. Tan Y. Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Mackow E.R. Robinson M.K.

Mutation of the putative α2β1 ligand sequence DGE located in VP5* at positions 308 to 310 abrogates binding of truncated VP5* to α2I and VP5* competition with RRV cell binding and infectivity (7Graham K.L.

Additionally, DGE-containing peptides specifically inhibit rotavirus-cell binding and infection mediated through α2β1 (6Coulson B.S. Londrigan S.L. Lee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The DGE sequence is externally located on the trypsin-primed and putative post-penetration structural forms of VP5* (32.Trask, S. D., Kim, I. S., Harrison, S. C., Dormitzer, P. R., J. Virol. 84, 1764–1770Google Scholar, 33Dormitzer P.R. Nason E.B. Prasad B.V. Harrison S.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the importance of α2I in monkey rotavirus recognition of α2β1. However, the role of α2I in α2β1 recognition by rotaviruses from other species (including humans) has not been determined, and the α2I residues involved have not been identified for any rotavirus strain. Monkey rotaviruses preferentially recognize human α2β1 over human α2 combined with hamster β1 (17Londrigan S.L. Graham K.L. Takada Y. Halasz P. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for the β1 subunit that requires further analysis. In this study, the α2I was shown to be necessary for α2β1 binding by human, monkey and bovine rotaviruses. The effect of mutations in exposed loops and adjacent regions of α2I, and in β1, on α2β1 binding by these rotaviruses was determined. Interestingly, rotaviruses showed strain-specific differences in their dependence on particular α2β1 residues for binding. We have identified regions of α2β1 that are involved in rotavirus recognition, including sites that differentiate rotavirus binding from that of other α2β1 ligands. Notably, all rotaviruses required residues in the activation-responsive αC-α6 and αF helices of α2I, in contrast to other α2β1 ligands.

The origins and characterization of rotavirus strains RRV and SA11 (monkey), Wa and K8 (human), NCDV (bovine) and CRW-8 (porcine) have been described previously (7Graham K.L. Halasz P. Tan Y.

Virol. 1991; 65: 5968-5974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rotaviruses were propagated in MA104 cells following trypsin activation of infectivity, harvested by two freeze-thawing cycles and stocks clarified by low-speed centrifugation (RRV cell culture harvest), as previously (7Graham K.L.

Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rotavirus infectivity titers were determined by indirect immunofluorescent staining of MA104 cells inoculated with serial dilutions of samples followed by microscopy, as described previously (8Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Londrigan S.L. Graham K.L. Takada Y. Halasz P. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Titers were expressed as the number of fluorescent cell-forming units (FCFU)/ml. Surface α2β1 integrin expression was detected on CHO cell lines by direct (Ha1/29) or indirect (AK7, Gi9, Has4) immunofluorescent staining of 8 × 105 cells followed by flow cytometry as described previously (8Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The relative linear median fluorescence intensity (RLMFI) was calculated, defined as the ratio of the median fluorescence intensities obtained with the test and isotype control antibodies. A positive RLMFI was defined as ≥1.2, as before (8Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Assays of infectious rotavirus binding at 4 °C for 1 h to confluent CHO cell lines (8 × 105 cells) were performed as previously described (8Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Londrigan S.L. Graham K.L. Takada Y. Halasz P. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rotavirus doses of 4 × 106 and 8 × 106 FCFU, corresponding to 5 and 10 FCFU/cell, respectively, were bound to cells. The multiplicity of infection used, defined as the number of FCFU/cell, was 5 or 10. Rotavirus-cell binding assays were conducted at 4 °C rather than 37 °C to avoid inaccuracy due to the virus entry that begins within 5 min at 37 °C (43Kaljot K.T. Shaw R.D. Rubin D.H. Greenberg H.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Titers of bound virus were measured by inoculation and immunofluorescent staining of MA104 cell monolayers as described above (8Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Londrigan S.L. Graham K.L. Takada Y. Halasz P. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rotavirus replication in CHO cell lines (8 × 105 cells) was assayed at 16 h post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Rotavirus titers (expressed in FCFU/ml) were determined by titration in MA104 cells as described above. In graphs, data are given as the mean of at least three independent experiments, and the bar indicates the S.D. A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by Student's t test unless otherwise indicated. A panel of CHO cell lines was produced, each transfected to express human α2 with a single point mutation (n = 50) or a short deletion (n = 1) in α2I. As transfection produces cell surface expression of heterodimers of human α2 combined with the endogenous hamster β1, these cell lines were examined for surface α2 expression by flow cytometry. The binding of monoclonal antibodies HAS4 and AK7, directed to α2 outside the I domain and to the I domain, respectively, was determined for a subset of 14 cell lines, including parental CHO K1 cells transfected with empty vector (PBJ-1) or with cDNA encoding human α2 (Hu α2). With both antibodies, PBJ-1 cells showed a negative RLMFI of <1.2, and Hu α2 showed positive RLMFI of 13.6 (HAS4) and 10.5 (AK7; Fig. 1A). All other CHO cell lines showed positive RLMFI values, with means ± 95%CI of 5.7 ± 2.6 (HAS4) and 6.2 ± 2.1 (AK7). As shown in Fig. 1A, a highly significant correlation was observed between the α2 RLMFI values determined using these antibodies (Spearman r = 0.94; p < 0.0001). In the 13 α2-positive cell lines, the percentage of cells expressing α2 (mean ± 95%CI) was 40.9 ± 10.5 with HAS4 and 45.9 ± 12.8 with AK7. These percentages also were significantly correlated (Spearman r = 0.83; p = 0.0001). Levels of α2 expression on the full mutant CHO cell panel (n = 51) were determined using AK7. With one exception, AK7 detected α2 on all cell lines. These α2-positive cell lines showed RLMFI values and percentages of positive cells (mean ± 95%CI) of 10.5 ± 5.0 and 50.2 ± 7.3, respectively. The exception was the CHO α2 R288A cell line, which showed a negative RLMFI of 1.1 ± 0.1 with AK7, and a positive RLMFI of 5.1 ± 0.1 when tested with HAS4. This implicates Arg-288 in AK7 recognition of α2I. Initially, binding to PBJ-1 or Hu α2 cells by purified RRV was compared with binding by RRV cell culture harvest (Fig. 1B). As purification did not affect infectious RRV binding to these cell lines (p > 0.05), cell culture harvests were used for all further experiments. The effect of rotavirus dose on α2β1 binding was determined. Previously, we were unable to detect Wa binding to α2β1 on CHO cells using a multiplicity of infection of 1 (17Londrigan S.L. Graham K.L. Takada Y. Halasz P. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, use of higher doses allowed significant levels of dose-dependent Wa binding to Hu α2 to be demonstrated (Fig. 1C; p < 0.01). The other integrin-using rotavirus strains RRV, SA11, K8, and NCDV also showed dose-dependent binding to α2β1 on Hu α2 cells (p < 0.01), and a multiplicity of infection of 10, corresponding to 8 × 106 FCFU, was optimal for all rotaviruses (Fig. 1C). Dose-independent binding to Hu α2 cells at control levels by the integrin-independent rotavirus CRW-8 demonstrated the specificity of α2β1 binding by the other rotaviruses. To examine if the level of CHO cell α2 expression affected RRV binding, α2 RLMFI values on the 29 cell lines that bound RRV rotavirus (titer of virus bound ≥80% of the titer bound to cells expressing wt α2) were compared with those on the 22 cell lines showing RRV binding at or near the level of the PBJ-1 negative control (Fig. 1D). The RLMFI values determined with AK7 were used for all cell lines except CHO α2 R288A, for which the HAS4 RLMFI was used. Irrespective of the effect of the α2 mutation of RRV binding, there was no correlation between levels of RRV binding and cellular α2 expression (Spearman r<-0.02; p > 0.75). This shows that the level of α2 integrin expression on transfected CHO cell lines was not limiting for detection of rotavirus binding, and lack of binding above control levels was an indication that the α2 mutation inhibited virus binding. To determine the effect of α2I mutations on rotavirus recognition, the titer of RRV bound to the CHO cells expressing recombinant α2 with mutated α2I residues was assayed. As shown in Fig. 2, the 21 point mutations in α2I that abolished or reduced RRV binding were located in the N-terminal region (Cys-140), the loop between βA and α1 (Ser-153, Asn-154), the α1 helix (Asp-160, Lys-163), the loop between helices α3 and α4 (Gln-215, Asp-219, Leu-220, Thr-221), the region between α4 and βD (Arg-231, Lys-232, Tyr-233, Arg-242), the loop between βD and α5 (Glu-256, Gly-260, Ser-261), the α5 helix (Asp-268), the α6 loop (Thr-293, Asn-295, Lys-298), and the αF loop (Glu-309). Our earlier data indicated a trend for a reduction in RRV binding to CHO cells expressing α2β1 with the T221A mutation (17Londrigan S.L. Graham K.L. Takada Y. Halasz P. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9486-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Improvements in assay reproducibility led to a clear demonstration of RRV binding loss due to this mutation (Fig. 2). Deletion of the αC loop (amino acids 283–290) also abolished RRV binding, although individual alanine point mutations within and immediately adjacent to this region (Gly-284, Tyr-285, Asn-287, Arg-288, Asn-289, Leu-291, Asp-292) did not affect RRV binding (Fig. 2). This CHO cell-expressed α2I deletion was shown previously to have no effect on collagen binding affinity, demonstrating its functionality (34Kamata T. Liddington R.C. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32108-32111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A single C terminus mutation (D343A) increased RRV binding. This mutation appeared to increase collagen binding in a previous study (44Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With one exception (D219A), all mutations that reduced RRV binding also reduced Wa binding to α2β1 (Fig. 2). However, mutations E256A and N295A reduced Wa binding to a greater extent than RRV binding. The findings indicated that Wa binding to α2β1 also involves α2I, and rotavirus binding to α2I was affected by mutations of many residues in a manner novel to α2β1 ligands. In addition, several α2I mutations affected binding by individual rotavirus strains to differing extents. Mutations differentially affecting RRV and Wa binding to α2β1 (D219A, E256A, N295A) or involving the αC, α6, or αF loops were investigated for their effects on binding by other human (K8), monkey (SA11), and bovine (NCDV) rotaviruses (Fig. 3). As previous studies had shown SA11 binding to be unaffected by the T221A mutation, whereas RRV binding was reduced (Fig. 2), the effects of this mutation also were further analyzed. Initially, the ability of rotaviruses K8 and NCDV to bind human α2 on CHO cells was demonstrated (wt α2; Fig. 3). This is consistent with the K8 and NCDV binding to human α2β1 on K562 cells shown previously (7Graham K.L. Halasz P. Tan Y. Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Mackow E.R. Robinson M.K. Coulson B.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9969-9978Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Each virus strain showed a distinct pattern of reactivity with cells expressing the D219A, T221A, or E256A mutations in α2I (Fig. 3). Although K8 binding was almost eliminated by all 3 mutations, SA11 binding was reduced by D219A and E256A and unaffected by T221A, and NCDV binding was unaffected by any of the three mutations. In contrast, mutation of αC, the loop between αC and α6, α6 helix or αF region abrogated binding by K8, SA11, and NCDV (Fig. 3). These findings also show the dependence on α2I of K8 and NCD"
https://openalex.org/W2094860885,"Many Gram-negative bacteria that cause major diseases and mortality worldwide require the type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins into their hosts and cause infections. A structural component of the T3SS is the needle apparatus, which consists of a base, an external needle, and a tip complex. In Salmonella typhimurium, the external needle is assembled by the polymerization of the needle protein PrgI. On top of this needle sits a tip complex, which is partly formed by the tip protein SipD. How SipD interacts with PrgI during the assembly of the T3SS needle apparatus remains unknown. The central region of PrgI forms an α-helical hairpin, whereas SipD has a long central coiled-coil, which is a defining structural feature of other T3SS tip proteins as well. Using NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, we have identified a specific region on the SipD coiled-coil that interacts directly with PrgI. We present a model of how SipD might dock at the tip of the needle based on our paramagnetic relaxation enhancement results, thus offering new insight about the mechanism of assembly of the T3SS needle apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2067049305,"Parvulins are a group of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) responsible for important biological processes in all kingdoms of life. The PinA protein from the psychrophilic archaeon Cenarchaeum symbiosum is a parvulin-like PPIase. Due to its striking similarity to the human parvulins Pin1 and Par14, PinA constitutes an interesting subject for structural and functional studies. Here, we present the first high resolution NMR structure of an archaeal parvulin, PinA, based on 1798 conformational restraints. Structure calculation yields an ensemble of 20 convergent low energy structures with a backbone r.m.s.d. value of 0.6 Å within the secondary structure elements. The overall fold of PinA comprises the β-α(3)-β-α-β(2) fold typical for all parvulin structures known so far, but with helix III being a short 3(10)-helix. A detailed comparison of this high resolution structure of the first archaeal PinA protein with bacterial and eukaryotic parvulin PPIase structures reveals an atypically large catalytic binding site. This feature provides an explanation for cold-adapted protein function. Moreover, the residues in and around 3(10)-helix III exhibit strong intramolecular dynamics on a microsecond to millisecond timescale and display structural heterogeneity within the NMR ensemble. A putative peptide ligand was found for PinA by phage display and was used for (1)H-(15)N-HSQC titrations. Again, the flexible region around 3(10)-helix III as well as residues of the peptide binding pocket showed the strongest chemical shift perturbations upon peptide binding. The local flexibility of this region also was modulated by ligand binding. A glycine and two positively charged residues are conserved in most parvulin proteins in this flexible loop region, which may be of general functional importance for parvulin-type PPIases."
https://openalex.org/W1985677664,"There are few examples of host signals that are beneficial to bacteria during infection. Here we found that 31 out of 42 host immunoregulatory chemokines were able to induce release of the virulence factor protein A (SPA) from a strain of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). Detailed study of chemokine CXCL9 revealed that SPA release occurred through a post-translational mechanism and was inversely proportional to bacterial density. CXCL9 bound specifically to the cell membrane of CA-MRSA, and the related SPA-releasing chemokine CXCL10 bound to both cell wall and cell membrane. Clinical samples from patients infected with S. aureus and samples from a mouse model of CA-MRSA skin abscess all contained extracellular SPA. Further, SPA-releasing chemokines were present in mouse skin lesions infected with CA-MRSA. Our data identify a potential new mode of immune evasion, in which the pathogen exploits a host defense factor to release a virulence factor; moreover, chemokine binding may serve a scavenging function in immune evasion by S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2086588018,"Cytochrome c(550) (cyt c(550)) is a component of photosystem II (PSII) from cyanobacteria, red algae, and some other eukaryotic algae. Its physiological role remains unclear. In the present work, measurements of the midpoint redox potential (E(m)) were performed using intact PSII core complexes preparations from a histidine-tagged PSII mutant strain of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus (T.) elongatus. When redox titrations were done in the absence of redox mediators, an E(m) value of +200 mV was obtained for cyt c(550). This value is ∼300 mV more positive than that previously measured in the presence of mediators (E(m) = -80 mV). The shift from the high potential form (E(m) = +200 mV) to the low potential form (E(m) = -80 mV) of cyt c(550) is attributed to conformational changes, triggered by the reduction of a component of PSII that is sequestered and out of equilibrium with the medium, most likely the Mn(4)Ca cluster. This reduction can occur when reduced low potential redox mediators are present or under highly reducing conditions even in the absence of mediators. Based on these observations, it is suggested that the E(m) of +200 mV obtained without mediators could be the physiological redox potential of the cyt c(550) in PSII. This value opens the possibility of a redox function for cyt c(550) in PSII."
https://openalex.org/W2032082763,"Human interleukin-11 (hIL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine administered to patients with low platelet counts. From a structural point of view hIL-11 belongs to the long-helix cytokine superfamily, which is characterized by a conserved core motif consisting of four α-helices. We have investigated the region of hIL-11 that does not belong to the α-helical bundle motif, and that for the purpose of brevity we have termed ""non-core region."" The primary sequence of the interleukin was altered at various locations within the non-core region by introducing glycosylation sites. Functional consequences of these modifications were examined in cell-based as well as biophysical assays. Overall, the data indicated that the non-core region modulates the function of hIL-11 in two ways. First, the majority of muteins displayed enhanced cell-stimulatory properties (superagonist behavior) in a glycosylation-dependent manner, suggesting that the non-core region is biologically designed to limit the full potential of hIL-11. Second, specific modification of a predicted mini α-helix led to cytokine inactivation, demonstrating that this putative structural element belongs to site III engaging a second copy of cell-receptor gp130. These findings have unveiled new and unexpected elements modulating the biological activity of hIL-11, which may be exploited to develop more versatile medications based on this important cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1997691741,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are two major forms of innate immune receptors that trigger inflammatory responses by various biological mechanisms such as cytokine production, recruitment of inflammatory cells, or activation of adaptive immunity. Although the innate immune system is designed to fight against infectious pathogens, excessive activation of TLR or NLR signaling pathways may lead to unwarranted inflammation with hazardous outcomes, including septic shock or inflammatory diseases. As part of the search for effective therapeutics to regulate these responses, here we show that a novel aminosaccharide compound, named DFK1012, inhibits immune responses caused by TLR and NLR activation. Treatment with DFK1012, but not its derivatives DFK845 or DFK846, strongly inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon stimulation via either TLR or NLR proteins in macrophages. Importantly, we have not observed cytotoxicity in any range of its working concentration. Treatment with DFK1012 did not interfere with TLR- or NLR-induced activation of p38 and JNK, phosphorylation/degradation of IκB, and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of DFK1012 is not due to the suppression of downstream signaling. Indeed, DFK1012 did not impair transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes but rather promoted post-translational degradation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, DFK1012 is a novel anti-inflammatory compound that drives proteolysis of proinflammatory cytokines induced by TLR and NLR stimulation. DFK1012 may represent a novel class of potential therapeutic agents aimed at the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are two major forms of innate immune receptors that trigger inflammatory responses by various biological mechanisms such as cytokine production, recruitment of inflammatory cells, or activation of adaptive immunity.
