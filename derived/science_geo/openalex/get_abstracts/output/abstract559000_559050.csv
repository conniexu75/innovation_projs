https://openalex.org/W2410453457,"Protein homeostasis is maintained by quality control mechanisms that detect and eliminate deficient translation products. Cytosolic defective proteins can arise from translation of aberrant mRNAs lacking a termination codon (NonStop) or containing a sequence that blocks translation elongation (No-Go), which results in translational arrest. Stalled ribosomes are dissociated, aberrant mRNAs are degraded by the cytoplasmic exosome, and the nascent peptides remaining in stalled 60S exit tunnels are detected by the ribosome-bound quality control complex (RQC) composed of Ltn1, Rqc1, Rqc2, and Cdc48. Whereas Ltn1 polyubiquitylates these nascent peptides, Rqc2 directs the addition of C-terminal alanine-threonine tails (CAT-tails), and a Cdc48 hexamer is recruited to extract the nascent peptides, which are addressed to the proteasome for degradation. Although the functions of most RQC components have been described, the role of Rqc1 in this quality control process remains undetermined. In this article we show that the absence of Rqc1 or Ltn1 results in the aggregation of aberrant proteins, a phenomenon that requires CAT-tail addition to the nascent peptides by Rqc2. Our results suggest that aberrant CAT-tailed protein aggregation results from a defect in Cdc48 recruitment to stalled 60S particles, a process that requires both Rqc1 and Ltn1. These protein aggregates contain Ltn1-dependent polyubiquitin chains and are degraded by the proteasome. Finally, aggregate characterization by proteomics revealed that they contain specific chaperones including Sis1, Sgt2, Ssa1/2, and Hsp82, suggesting that these protein aggregates may be addressed to aggresome-like structures when the RQC complex fails to deliver aberrant nascent peptides to the proteasome for degradation.

Protein homeostasis is maintained in eukaryotic cells by quality control pathways that ensure the recognition and the degradation of defective translation products. Whereas molecular chaperones perform unfolding and refolding of misfolded proteins, aberrant proteins are recognized and eliminated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These cellular responses prevent the toxicity generated by the accumulation of defective proteins that may be nonfunctional and are prone to aggregation. However, in the presence of a translational stress, the rapid increase of the amount of defective proteins often leads to the accumulation of protein aggregates (for review see Ref. 1Richter K. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. The heat shock response: life on the verge of death.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 253-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). It has been shown that these protein aggregates can be transported via the microtubules network to a deposit called the aggresome (2Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Aggresomes: a cellular response to misfolded proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar), in which the coordinated action of chaperones and proteasome-recruiting factors enables aggregate processing, thus limiting their intracellular toxicity and maintaining the quality of the cellular protein pool (3Kopito R.R. Aggresomes, inclusion bodies and protein aggregation.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, accumulation of aberrant proteins may result from the translation of aberrant mRNAs that trigger ribosome stalling during translation elongation. These stalled ribosomes act as a signal for mRNA (4Frischmeyer P.A. van Hoof A. O'Donnell K. Guerrerio A.L. Parker R. Dietz H.C.

Two types of aberrant transcripts causing translational arrest have been identified: mRNAs lacking a STOP codon (NonStop mRNAs) (4Frischmeyer P.A. van Hoof A. O'Donnell K. Guerrerio A.L. Parker R.

Parker R. Endonucleolytic cleavage of eukaryotic mRNAs with stalls in translation elongation.Nature. 2006; 440: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In both cases, Dom34 (Pelota in mammals) and Hbs1 bind to the stalled ribosomes, which trigger the recruitment of the ATPase Rli1/ABCE1 (11Shoemaker C.J. Green R.

Together, they promote dissociation of the stalled ribosome. Following the dissociation, the aberrant transcripts undergo an endonucleolytic cleavage (6Doma M.K. Parker R.

After ribosome dissociation, the exit tunnel of the 60S subunit still contains an aberrant nascent peptide bound to a tRNA that must be degraded to prevent the accumulation of defective translation products. Recent studies revealed that these aberrant substrates are detected by the ribosome-bound quality control complex (RQC), 3The abbreviations used are: RQCribosome-bound quality control complexCAT-tailC-terminal alanine-threonine tailPAPperoxidase-anti-peroxidase. composed of the RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1, the factors Rqc1 and Rqc2, a hexamer of Cdc48 (Listerin, TCF25, NEMF, and p97 in mammals, respectively), and the Cdc48 co-factors Npl4 and Ufd1 (13Brandman O.

Rqc2 binds to the 60S interface surface and consequently prevents 40S reassociation (16Lyumkis D. Oliveira dos Passos D. Tahara E.B. Webb K. Bennett E.J. Vinterbo S. Potter C.S. Carragher B.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 15981-15986Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An additional function of Rqc2 is to sense the tRNA in the P-site of the stalled 60S and to coordinate the recruitment of alanyl- and threonyl-tRNAs in the A-site to add a nontemplated C-terminal alanine-threonine tail (CAT-tail) to the nascent peptide (17Shen P.S.

In parallel, Ltn1 performs the polyubiquitylation of the aberrant peptide (15Bengtson M.H. Joazeiro C.A.

This enables the recruitment of a Cdc48 hexamer that hydrolyzes ATP to extract the aberrant substrate from the 60S exit tunnel and to escort it to the proteasome for degradation (14Defenouillère Q.

Cdc48/p97 promotes degradation of aberrant nascent polypeptides bound to the ribosome.eLife. 2013; 2: e00308Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Whereas Rqc1 is not involved in the polyubiquitylation process, it is required for Cdc48 recruitment on the 60S subunit and therefore essential for efficient degradation of these aberrant proteins (13Brandman O.

Although the functions of Ltn1, Rqc2, and Cdc48 within this RQC-mediated translational quality control have been partly described (see review in Ref. 20Brandman O. Hegde R.S. Ribosome-associated protein quality control.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the function of Rqc1 remains widely unknown. Furthermore, rapid accumulation of defective proteins in case of stress often results in a saturation of quality control mechanisms (for review see in Ref. 21Tyedmers J. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cellular strategies for controlling protein aggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), and the fate of aberrant translation products in the absence of a fully functional RQC complex is yet to be determined. In this study, we show that Rqc1, Ltn1, and Cdc48 prevent the aggregation of aberrant proteins that can only appear after CAT-tail addition by Rqc2. These protein aggregates contain polyubiquitin chains generated by Ltn1 and are degraded by the proteasome. Finally, these aggregates are recognized by specific chaperones including Sis1, Sgt2, Ssa1/2, and Hsp82, suggesting that they are targeted to aggresome-like structures. This work reveals the importance of Cdc48 recruitment on stalled 60S particles by Rqc1 and Ltn1 to prevent the accumulation of CAT-tail induced aggregates of aberrant translation products, thus participating in the maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis.

For proteasome inhibition, the cells were treated for 2 h with 100 μm MG132 before lysis. They were deleted from ERG6 to increase the sensitivity to MG132. 7 A260 of clarified cell lysates were loaded on 10–50% sucrose gradients. Collected fractions were precipitated with 10% TCA and resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer, and 10 μl were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. Total protein extracts were prepared from 5 A600 of exponential culture. Briefly, the cells were broken with glass beads using a MagNA Lyser (twice for 60 s at 4800 rpm) in 300 μl of TCA 20%. We let beads settle and transferred the supernatant into a new tube. 300 μl of 5% TCA were added to the beads, and after vortex for 10 s, we again let beads settle and transferred the supernatant into the collected tube. After centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g, the samples were resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer, and 10 μl were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, a fast method using alkaline treatment (22Kushnirov V.V. Rapid and reliable protein extraction from yeast.Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) was used as mentioned in the text. 5 A600 of exponential culture were resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the cells were collected by centrifugation for 3 min at room temperature and resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were denatured for 3 min at 95 °C, and cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation. 10 μl of supernatant were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane with a semidry system, proteins were detected by hybridization with the appropriate antibodies.

Fluorescence microscopy was performed with GFP-NonStop-expressing yeast cells grown in liquid synthetic medium containing galactose without uracil to a final A600 of 4.0 and resuspended in sterile water. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33352 (5 ng·μl−1) for 5 min, and cells were washed twice in sterile water. Samples were imaged using a Leica DMRXA fluorescence microscope. Fluorescent signals were collected with single band pass filters for excitation of GFP (Leica) for 3500 ms, mCherry (Cy3; Leica) for 800 ms and Hoechst 33352 (A; Leica) for 40 ms.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar) and lacking a translation termination codon (called “TAP-NonStop”) in the absence of RQC1 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to the previously observed accumulation of the aberrant reporter protein in rqc1Δ cells compared with a wild type when protein extracts were prepared using NaOH (Fig. 1B, bottom two panels, and Ref. 14Defenouillère Q. Yao Y. Mouaikel J. Namane A. Galopier A. Decourty L. Doyen A. Malabat C. Saveanu C. Jacquier A. Fromont-Racine M. Cdc48-associated complex bound to 60S particles is required for the clearance of aberrant translation products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5046-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), extracting proteins using TCA and blotting the stacking part of the polyacrylamide gel revealed an additional form of the TAP-NonStop reporter stabilized in the absence of Rqc1 that was retained in the stacking gel (Fig. 1B, top two panels). Interestingly, these high molecular weight species of the TAP-NonStop were not visible in rqc2Δ cells, and the absence of Rqc2 suppressed their accumulation in the rqc1Δrqc2Δ double mutant, although the accumulation of the running gel-migrating TAP-NonStop was comparable between this double mutant and the rqc1Δ single mutant (Fig. 1B). Whereas these high molecular weight species were resistant to the SDS present in the protein sample buffer, treating the yeast cultures with 5 mm guanidine for 15 h significantly reduced high molecular weight species accumulation in the stacking gel of rqc1Δ cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that they could correspond to aggregated forms of the TAP-NonStop aberrant protein that accumulate in the absence of Rqc1. We addressed this hypothesis by replacing the TAP sequence in the TAP-NonStop reporter gene by a GFP sequence to monitor the aberrant “GFP-NonStop” reporter by fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, whereas the fluorescent signal was weak and homogeneously distributed in the cytosol of wild-type cells, the GFP-NonStop aberrant protein accumulated to a higher extent in rqc1Δ cells and formed green foci corresponding to protein aggregates that were localized in the cytosol, according to a merge with nucleus staining (Fig. 2). In contrast, whereas the GFP-NonStop fluorescent signal in the cytosol of rqc2Δ cells was comparable with the intensity observed in rqc1Δ cells, no green foci were detected in the absence of Rqc2, whether in the presence or Rqc1 or not (Fig. 2). These observations corroborate those obtained in Fig. 1 and suggest that high molecular weight species observed with the TAP-NonStop correspond to the cytosolic aggregates observed with the GFP-NonStop reporter. Taken together, these results show that Rqc1 is essential to prevent the formation of cytosolic aggregates of aberrant peptides synthesized from NonStop mRNAs; however, aggregate formation strictly depends on the presence of Rqc2. We then investigated why Rqc2 was essential for aggregate formation even in the absence of Rqc1. Because Rqc2 was shown to initiate CAT-tail addition to aberrant nascent peptides (17Shen P.S. Park J.

Therefore, they operate under low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in inflammatory and tumor environments. In vitro studies of NK cells are, however, commonly performed in ambient air (normoxia). We used global gene expression profiling to evaluate changes in transcriptional pathways in primary human NK cells following short term culture under hypoxia compared with normoxia and in response to interleukin 15 (IL-15) priming using a 2 × 2 factorial design. The largest contrasts observed were priming dependences for associations between hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1 signaling and glycolysis pathways. RT-PCR confirmed positive synergistic hypoxia/IL-15 interactions for genes of key regulatory and metabolic enzymes. IL-15 primes NK cells for effector functions, which were recently demonstrated to depend on glycolytic switching. We did not, however, observe important increases in glycolytic flux through hypoxia and priming alone. Chemical Hif-1α inhibition suggested equal importance of this transcription factor for glycolysis and energy production under normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia promoted secretion of CC chemokines Ccl3/4/5 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Unexpectedly, hypoxia also stimulated migration of NK cells through the extracellular matrix and shifted amounts of susceptible leukemia target cells toward late apoptosis in a cell killing assay. We conclude that short term hypoxia supports these activities by positively interacting with NK cell priming at the level of glycolytic gene transcription.

In vitro, promotion of NK cell-mediated cell killing by interleukin-2 (IL-2) was reported to be reduced after 96 h at 1% O2 compared with 20% O2, although antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was not affected (11Balsamo M.

Short term hypoxia (14–17 h, 1% O2) similarly reduced target cell killing, but sustaining hypoxia during the 4–4.5-h cell killing assay contributed to this reduction (12Fink T. Ebbesen P.

NK cell effector functions are controlled by the cytokine milieu and integration of activating and inhibitory signals on potential target cells (14Long E.O. Kim H.S. Liu D. Peterson M.E.

During an active immune response, the ability of NK cells to respond to activation is substantially enhanced through IL-15, which is produced by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. IL-15 initiates Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-Stat) signaling that promotes growth of cytotoxic lymphocytes, including NK cells (15Mishra A. Sullivan L.

Recently, NK cell treatment with IL-15, in addition to stimulation by cytokines (IL-2, -12, and -18) and binding of ligands for activating NK receptors, was shown to support switching to glycolytic metabolism, which involves nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling and is a requirement for production of Ifn-γ and cytolytic effector molecules (17Donnelly R.P.

Different signaling pathways thus underlie the effectiveness of IL-15 treatment and, consequently, of current ex vivo expansion and stimulation strategies that make use of this cytokine in NK cell-based immunotherapy of cancer (21Knorr D.A.

Immunol. 2015; 6: 264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Importantly, NK cell treatment with IL-15 also triggers miRNA-27a-5p-mediated down-regulation of the cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme B (Gzmb) and perforin beyond the first 6 h of cytokine addition (25Kim T.D. Lee S.U. Yun S. Sun H.N. Lee S.H. Kim J.W. Kim H.M. Park S.K. Lee C.W. Yoon S.R. Greenberg P.D. Choi I. Human microRNA-27a* targets Prf1 and GzmB expression to regulate NK-cell cytotoxicity.Blood. 2011; 118: 5476-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we thus use the term IL-15 priming to refer to an initial period of IL-15 exposure limited to 6 h. We were interested in transcriptional pathway changes and possible functional differences in NK cells cultured under physiologically low oxygen, namely hypoxia, compared with the commonly used standard condition, i.e. normoxia, in response to IL-15 priming. Hypoxia and priming synergistically drove glycolytic gene transcription, and unexpectedly, hypoxia positively impacted on several NK cell intrinsic activities as follows: secretion of certain cytokines, migration through extracellular matrix (ECM), and progression of target cells to late apoptosis. The obligatory role of glycolysis for cellular energy (ATP) production under hypoxia precludes interference with it, e.g. by chemical Hif inhibition or addition of glucose analogs, under conditions of low oxygen as a viable experimental strategy in tests of cellular function. Nevertheless, our data emphasize the importance of controlling oxygen levels during the in vitro study of NK cells and suggest that hypoxia can promote NK cell properties desirable for adoptive transfer immunotherapy. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the medical faculty ethics committee. NK cells were prepared from buffy coats obtained through the local Red Cross Blood Donor Service or whole blood of healthy donors after informed consent by negative selection (NK-Cell Isolation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec). Preparations stained ≥93% CD56+CD3− and ≤1% each CD3+, CD14+, CD15+, and CD19+ as judged by flow cytometry. Freshly isolated NK cells were plated at 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm l-glutamine and were maintained in a standard tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 resulting in 20% O2 (normoxia, standard condition) or in an oxygen-controlled Galaxy 48R CO2 incubator (New Brunswick) with a nitrogen gas line to establish 1% O2 (hypoxia) at 5% CO2. Human recombinant IL-15 (PeproTech) was used for priming and an equal volume of PBS as control. The Hif-1α inhibitor chetomin (CTM) was prepared as a 1 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). K562 cells (DSZM accession number 10) were cultured in the same medium and under normoxic standard conditions. At seeding and harvest, NK and K562 cell viabilities by trypan blue staining under all conditions tested were ≥90% (Countess, Invitrogen). We combined use of the mirVana buffer system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the smaller Pure Link micro kit filter columns and collection tubes (Invitrogen) to obtain higher final RNA concentrations than with the regular mirVana kit procedure. Centrifuge settings were adjusted (10,000 × g, 1 min), and RNA was eluted in 15 μl of nuclease-free water preheated to 95 °C (14,000 × g, 1 min). DNase-treated samples (DNA-free kit, Ambion) were spectrometrically quantified (Tecan Infinite M200 NanoQuant). RNA integrity numbers were ≥8 (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100). For gene expression profiling, we used Hugene-2_0-st-type arrays (Affymetrix) on an Affymetrix GeneChip platform (Affymetrix Core Facility, Medical Research Center Mannheim), and a Custom CDF Version 17 with Entrez-based gene definitions for array annotation (26Dai M.

Evolving gene/transcript definitions significantly alter the interpretation of GeneChip data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying quantile normalization and robust multiarray average background correction. One-way analysis of variance was performed to identify differentially expressed genes using JMP10 Genomics version 6 (SAS Institute). A false-positive rate of α = 0.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction was considered significant. We performed GSEA to determine whether defined gene sets exhibited statistically significant bias in their distribution within a ranked gene list (27Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S.

For relative mRNA quantitation, we reverse-transcribed total RNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit and performed TaqMan RT-PCR gene expression analysis on a 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR instrument (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Open table in a new tab We screened 29 panel analytes selected from MILLIPLEX map kits HCYTOMAG-60K, HCD8MAG-15K, HSP1MAG-63K, and HTH17MAG-14K (Merck Millipore) for secretion by NK cells. Conditioned culture supernatants were stored at −80 °C until analysis on a MAGPIX system (Luminex). Duplicate determinations were averaged and evaluated using MILLIPLEX Analyst software. Human Vegf was determined by ELISA (Quantikine kit, R&D Systems). The ability of NK cells to migrate through ECM was assessed using Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membranes (Corning) based on a published protocol (28Edsparr K.

Human NK cell lines migrate differentially in vitro related to matrix interaction and MMP expression.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 NK cells in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine), supplemented with IL-15 at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml or 5 μl/ml PBS, were loaded in triplicate into the upper chambers of 24-well plate inserts. Lower chambers were filled with 1.5 ml of likewise supplemented medium, respectively. Assembled chambers were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and either 20 or 1% O2. From the same NK cell preparation, we set up parallel NK cell cultures under these four conditions for calibration purposes. Four hours before the end of the 48-h incubation period, we added 150 μl of Alamar Blue to the lower chambers. Cells from the parallel cultures were counted, and five serial 1:1 dilutions starting at 5 × 105 cells in final volumes of 1.5 ml were plated in duplicate into free wells on the same plate holding the inserts for the corresponding oxygen concentration, plus two background controls. As to the lower chambers, 150 μl of Alamar Blue was added to standards and controls, and plates were returned to incubators at 20 and 1% O2, correspondingly, for the remaining 4 h. At the end of the 48-h period, inserts were removed. Fluorescence of reduced Alamar Blue was measured as described previously (28Edsparr K. Johansson B.R. Goldfarb R.H. Basse P.H. Nannmark U. Speetjens F.M. Kuppen P.J. Lennernäs B. Albertsson P. Human NK cell lines migrate differentially in vitro related to matrix interaction and MMP expression.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Numbers of migrated NK cells were calculated from calibration curves. The Alamar Blue assay was also applied to assess viabilities of NK cells conditioned for 22 h under normoxia or hypoxia with IL-15, varying concentrations of CTM, and the dye present during the final 6 h of this period. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 105 cells in 100 μl per well. The Alamar Blue volume added was 10 μl per well. NK cell protein expression was assessed using fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Table 2). For intracellular staining, we used the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences). A total of 105 stained cells were acquired on a FACSCanto II cytometer and analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis in CTM-treated NK cells was detected by staining with annexin V-APC and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD Biosciences) and gating on singlets in the forward scatter height versus forward scatter area plot. Duplets were between 3 and 6%.TABLE 2Monoclonal antibody-fluorochrome conjugates used in flow cytometry by providerAntigenCloneFluorochromeBD Biosciences CD56NCAM 16.2PE CD3UCHT1FITC CD452D1PerCP CD15H198APC CD14M5E2PE-Cy7 CD19SJ25C1APC-Cy7 CD25MA251Pe-Cy5 CD69FN50APC CD107aH4A3APC Ifn-γB27APCMiltenyi Biotec GzmbREA162APC Open table in a new tab To assess the ability of NK cells to induce apoptosis in target cells, 2.5–5 × 106 K562 cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 62.5 nm in 2 ml of PBS for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine), incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, CFSE-labeled K562 target cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine) at a concentration of 105 cells/ml and co-incubated with 2.5 × 106 conditioned NK cells in a final volume of 2 ml under standard culture conditions. After 4 h, the killing reaction was stopped by putting the cells on ice and washing twice with PBS followed by addition of annexin V-APC and 7-AAD. To quantify specific lysis of K562 target cells (T) by effector NK cells (E), release and cellular contents of Ldh were determined enzymatically using the coupled CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega). Fixed numbers of 5 × 104 K562 cells were mixed with conditioned NK cells in volumes of 200 μl at a final FBS concentration of 2% and indicated E/T ratios in triplicate and maintained under standard conditions for 4 h. Ldh activities in lysates of K562 cells and culture supernatants were derived from initial slopes of absorbance versus time progress curves for dye reduction. Cellular Ldh content of NK cells was assessed in lysates of 2 × 105 cells in 100 μl of culture medium using the same lysis procedure as for K562 cells. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured on a Seahorse XFp analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) using the Seahorse XF glycolysis stress test kit. Conditioned NK cells were washed twice and resuspended in serum-free unbuffered RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm l-glutamine and without glucose (Sigma). For comparison of two or three conditions, respectively, cells were plated in triplicate or duplicate into Seahorse miniplates at 2 × 105 cells per well. ECAR was recorded over time with sequential additions of glucose (10 mm), oligomycin (1 μm), and 2-deoxyglucose (50 mm) (Seahorse Bioscience). Data were evaluated using Seahorse Wave software. Glucose and lactate levels in culture supernatants from conditioned NK cells were measured enzymatically in single determinations on a Cobas c 311 analyzer using the glucose HK (GLUC2) and lactate (LACT2) assay kits (Roche Applied Science/Hitachi), with a measuring range of 0.11–41.60 and 0.2–15.5 mm, respectively. Cellular ATP levels were assessed in aliquots of 105 conditioned and CTM-treated cells in 100 μl of culture medium in triplicate using the CellTiter Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Differences between experimental groups of paired samples were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (SigmaPlot version 11). p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. NK cells conditioned by a 22-h culture under hypoxia or normoxia with or without IL-15 priming for the final 6 h were subjected to global transcriptome profiling. Abundance for 23% of 23,786 genes on the microarray was changed significantly by priming regardless of oxygen concentration. Hypoxia alone only changed it for 1.79% with and for 1.70% without priming. We focused on significantly regulated pathways attributable to NK cells as a single cell type (Fig. 1). Priming was consistently and positively associated with expression of genes involved in protein anabolism, energy production, and immune signaling. Notably, up-regulation of the mitochondrial pathways citric acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation did not depend on oxygen. Hypoxia compared with normoxia did not produce any significant pathway alteration without and only few with priming. Dependences on priming for associations of hypoxia with Hif-1 signaling and with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (further referred to as glycolysis) were by far the strongest contrasts observed. In Fig. 2, significant mean transcriptional changes >1.25-fold for single genes by priming, hypoxia, and/or their combination, each compared with standard conditions, are mapped onto Hif-1 signaling (A) and glycolytic (B) pathways. Priming dominated responses in both. Responses were overall more pronounced when priming was performed under hypoxia, especially for glycolytic genes. Transcriptional changes in response to both stimuli together frequently appeared to display additive to synergistic behavior. Up-regulation by IL-15 of five genes encoding enzymes with pathway regulatory roles appeared to particularly depend on hypoxia, namely elongin C and prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (Phd2) encoded by the transcription elongation factor B polypeptide 1 (TCEB1) and egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) gene, respectively (Hif-1 signaling), and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK1) (glycolysis). These were selected for RT-PCR validation. We also selected the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) genes for RT-PCR validation because of the important roles of encoded enzymes as ATP producers at low oxygen. In view of strong induction of anabolic processes by priming, we additionally considered the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Fig. 2C). PPP genes from the oxidative branch (NADPH production) were up-regulated by priming, whereas mixed responses were seen for the non-oxidative branch. Here, IL-15 unexpectedly down-regulated transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) expression opposing its expected up-regulation by hypoxia (29Bentz S. Cee A. Endlicher E. Wojtal K.A. Naami A. Pesch T. Lang S. Schubert P. Fried M. Weber A. Coy J.F. Goelder S. Knüchel R. Hausmann M. Rogler G. Hypoxia induces the expression of transketolase-like 1 in human colorectal cancer.Digestion. 2013; 88: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We thus included TKTL1 in RT-PCR validation. Fig. 3 summarizes transcriptional responses of Hif-1 signaling, glycolytic, and PPP genes and genes of mitochondrial shuttle enzymes.FIGURE 2Mapping of gene expression changes in NK cells by IL-15 priming and hypoxia onto Hif-1 signaling and glycolytic pathways. Microarray analysis was performed on NK cells isolated from whole blood of five healthy donors and cultured at 20% O2 or 1% O2 for 22 h without or with IL-15 (45 ng/ml) during the final 6 h. Total RNA was hybridized onto human genome array chips. Data were subjected to GSEA using KEGG pathways applying an FDR-adjusted probability (FDR q-value) threshold of pathway enrichment of 0.05. By far, the strongest associations for hypoxia were seen with the HIF-1 signaling and glycolysis pathways after priming, although there were no significant associations for hypoxia without priming (Fig. 1). Significant mean transcriptional changes of >1.25-fold relative to standard culture conditions (legend on top) are mapped onto Hif-1 signaling (A) and glycolytic (B) pathways and the PPP (C) using a binary logarithmic color scale with white for no change, green for decreased, and red for increased mean gene expression levels. Glycolytic genes assigned to both KEGG pathways are included in the glycolytic pathway (B), which is further complemented by the SLC16A1/3 and PC genes encoding lactate transporters Mct1/4 and pyruvate carboxylase,"
https://openalex.org/W2427411141,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) has emerged as an important mechanism in cardiac pathology. However, the signals that up-regulate SOCE in the heart remain unexplored. Clinical trials have emphasized the beneficial role of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling blockade in heart failure and associated arrhythmias. Accumulated evidence suggests that the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone, through activation of its receptor, MR, might be a key regulator of Ca(2+) influx in cardiomyocytes. We thus assessed whether and how SOCE involving transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) and Orai1 channels are regulated by aldosterone/MR in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Molecular screening using qRT-PCR and Western blotting demonstrated that aldosterone treatment for 24 h specifically increased the mRNA and/or protein levels of Orai1, TRPC1, -C4, -C5, and stromal interaction molecule 1 through MR activation. These effects were correlated with a specific enhancement of SOCE activities sensitive to store-operated channel inhibitors (SKF-96365 and BTP2) and to a potent Orai1 blocker (S66) and were prevented by TRPC1, -C4, and Orai1 dominant negative mutants or TRPC5 siRNA. A mechanistic approach showed that up-regulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 mRNA expression by aldosterone is involved in enhanced SOCE. Functionally, 24-h aldosterone-enhanced SOCE is associated with increased diastolic [Ca(2+)]i, which is blunted by store-operated channel inhibitors. Our study provides the first evidence that aldosterone promotes TRPC1-, -C4-, -C5-, and Orai1-mediated SOCE in cardiomyocytes through an MR and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 pathway."

This is particularly true for O-glycans; thus we have recently developed a “bottom up” mass spectrometry-based technique for mapping O-glycosylation sites on herpes simplex virus type 1. We found wide distribution of O-glycans on herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins and demonstrated that elongated O-glycans were essential for the propagation of the virus. Here, we applied our proteome-wide discovery platform for mapping O-glycosites on representative and clinically significant members of the herpesvirus family: varicella zoster virus, human cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. We identified a large number of O-glycosites distributed on most envelope proteins in all viruses and further demonstrated conserved patterns of O-glycans on distinct homologous proteins. Because glycosylation is highly dependent on the host cell, we tested varicella zoster virus-infected cell lysates and clinically isolated virus and found evidence of consistent O-glycosites.

We here show that catalytic proteasome inhibition results in fast recruitment of PA28γ and PA200 to 20S and 26S proteasomes within 2–6 h. Rapid formation of alternative proteasome complexes did not involve transcriptional activation of PA28γ and PA200 but rather recruitment of preexisting activators to 20S and 26S proteasome complexes. Recruitment of proteasomal activators depended on the extent of active site inhibition of the proteasome with inhibition of β5 active sites being sufficient for inducing recruitment. Moreover, specific inhibition of 26S proteasome activity via siRNA-mediated knockdown of the 19S subunit RPN6 induced recruitment of only PA200 to 20S proteasomes, whereas PA28γ was not mobilized. Here, formation of alternative PA200 complexes involved transcriptional activation of the activator. Alternative proteasome complexes persisted when cells had regained proteasome activity after pulse exposure to proteasome inhibitors.

The proteasome, one of the main proteolytic systems of the cell, is essential for maintenance of protein homeostasis and thus of cellular functions. The proteolytic activity of this multicatalytic protease resides inside the 20S core particle, built of four stacked rings of seven α and β subunits with α7β7β7α7 organization. The internal cavity of the complex, defined by the two β rings, encloses three pairs of distinct active sites named according to their differential cleavage site specificity: chymotrypsin-like (CT-L), 3The abbreviations used are: CT-Lchymotrypsin-likeT-Ltrypsin-likeC-Lcaspase-likePA28proteasome activator 28PA200proteasome activator 200Rpl19ribosomal protein L19BZbortezomibphLFprimary human lung fibroblastsNRF1nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1MTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideOZoprozomib. trypsin-like (T-L), and caspase-like (C-L) catalytic sites (1Kish-Trier E.

Due to the closed conformation of the native 20S core complex, binding of different proteasome activators is required to induce opening of the 20S entry pores and allow injection of substrates into the catalytic chamber for degradation (2Groll M.

Densitometric analysis in the linear range of exposure was performed and is presented for the protein of interest relative to the respective β-actin protein level. HeLa cells grown in DMEM (Lonza) containing 4.5 g/liter of glucose, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowest), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 10 mg/ml of streptomycin (Lonza), treated or not with 10 nm bortezomib for 24 h, were harvested, washed with PBS, and kept frozen at −80 °C. Cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT. After centrifugation (15 min, 4 °C), the extract was filtered (0.2 μm) using a Microspin Filter CA/1.9 Receiver (5000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and 50 μl were loaded on a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT. Fractions were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted on a PVDF FL membrane (100 V, 90 min). The proteins of interest were immunoprobed using anti-RPT6 (BML-PW9265, 1:1000, Enzo Life Sciences), anti-β2 (BML-PW8145, 1:1000, Enzo Life Sciences), and anti-PA28γ (611180, 1:1000, BD Biosciences) antibodies, detected using an Odyssey scanner (Licor) and fluorescence was quantified using either Odyssey or ImageJ software. Cells were lysed in TSDG buffer as described above. 3 μl of antibody specific for 20S subunit α4 (BML-PW8120, Enzo Life Sciences) were incubated with Protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at 1200 rpm. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of protein were incubated with antibody-coupled beads at a total volume of 250 μl for 2 h on an overhead shaker at 4 °C. 10% of the total volume was removed as input control. After four times washing of the beads in 400 μl of TSDG buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by incubation of beads in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, eluted samples and input control were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. RNA extraction was from phLF using the Roti®-Quick-Kit (Carl Roth), reverse transcription and quantitative PCR was performed as previously described (40Keller I.E. Vosyka O. Takenaka S. Kloß A.

Rep. 2015; 5: 10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The 60S ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) served as a housekeeping gene for relative expression analysis. Proteasome activity was analyzed using fluorescent substrates specific for the chymotrypsin-like (Suc-LLVY-AMC, I-1395, Bachem), caspase-like (Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC, I-1945, Bachem), and trypsin-like activities (Bz-Val-Gly-Arg-AMC, I-1085, Bachem). TSDG protein lysate (2 μg of protein for chymotrypsin-like activity and 7 μg for caspase- and trypsin-like activities) was subjected to a black flat-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner bio-one). Assay buffer (225 mm Tris, 45 mm KCl, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 units of creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 6 mm ATP and 1 mm DTT) and a 200 μm concentration of the respective substrate were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a TriStar LB 941 plate reader (Berthold Technologies). Metabolic activity of phLF in response to PA28γ silencing and bortezomib treatment was analyzed by 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 20,000 cells per well were cultured in a 24-well plate with transfection mixture for PA28γ silencing. After 24 h medium was exchanged to starvation medium containing 1% FBS. 48 h after silencing cells were treated with 10 nm bortezomib for 6 h. Cells were washed with fresh starvation medium and incubated for 24 h to allow recovery of the proteasome activity. For the MTT assay, the cells were incubated with a solution of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (5 mg/ml in PBS, Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterward medium was aspirated and the blue crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol + 0.1% Triton X-100. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a SunriseTM plate reader (TECAN). For analysis of cell growth via cell count the same protocol was used as described for the MTT assay with the only difference that cells were cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were trypsinized, mixed with trypan blue (Sigma), and the cell number was determined using a Neubauer counting chamber. All sequences were derived from the promoter sequence retrieval database ElDorado 12-2013 (Genomatix), which is based on NCBI build 37. Promoter sequences of PSME4 (PA200) and PSME3 (PA28γ) from six different species were aligned with the DiAlign TF program (42Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A.

The corresponding position weight matrix V$TCF11MAFG.01 was applied to promoter analyses according to the Matrix Family Library Version 9.2 (October 2014). The promoter sequences were defined as in ElDorado. The following Genomatix/Entrez Gene identifier were used for PSME4: GXP_90931/23198 (human); GXP_4967564/459229 (chimp); GXP_4841060/716580 (rhesus monkey); GXP_4346524/103554 (mouse); GXP_4713352/498433 (rat); GXP_3358724/100379940 (Western clawed frog).

Binding sites were considered as conserved when the promoter sequences could be aligned in the region of the NRF1 binding site with help of the DiAlign TF program (using default settings). The PA28γ (human) cDNA was subcloned into the pET-14B plasmid. After expression in Escherichia coli, the protein complex was purified essentially as previously described for PA28αβ (43Le Feuvre A.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2342884487,"Some complex plant-derived polysaccharides, such as modified citrus pectins and galactomannans, have been shown to have promising anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Most reports propose or claim that these effects are due to interaction of the polysaccharides with galectins because the polysaccharides contain galactose-containing side chains that might bind this class of lectin. However, their direct binding to and/or inhibition of the evolutionarily conserved galactoside-binding site of galectins has not been demonstrated. Using a well established fluorescence anisotropy assay, we tested the direct interaction of several such polysaccharides with physiological concentrations of a panel of galectins. The bioactive pectic samples tested were very poor inhibitors of the canonical galactoside-binding site for the tested galectins, with IC50 values >10 mg/ml for a few or in most cases no inhibitory activity at all. The galactomannan Davanat® was more active, albeit not a strong inhibitor (IC50 values ranging from 3 to 20 mg/ml depending on the galectin). Pure synthetic oligosaccharide fragments found in the side chains and backbone of pectins and galactomannans were additionally tested. The most commonly found galactan configuration in pectins had no inhibition of the galectins tested. Galactosylated tri- and pentamannosides, representing the structure of Davanat®, had an inhibitory effect of galectins comparable with that of free galactose. Further evaluation using cell-based assays, indirectly linked to galectin-3 inhibition, showed no inhibition of galectin-3 by the polysaccharides. These data suggest that the physiological effects of these plant polysaccharides are not due to inhibition of the canonical galectin carbohydrate-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2341086864,"Developmental signals in metazoans play critical roles in inducing cell differentiation from multipotent progenitors. The existing paradigm posits that the signals operate directly through their downstream transcription factors to activate expression of cell type-specific genes, which are the hallmark of cell identity. We have investigated the mechanism through which Wnt signaling induces osteoblast differentiation in an osteoblast-adipocyte bipotent progenitor cell line. Unexpectedly, Wnt3a acutely suppresses the expression of a large number of genes while inducing osteoblast differentiation. The suppressed genes include Pparg and Cebpa, which encode adipocyte-specifying transcription factors and suppression of which is sufficient to induce osteoblast differentiation. The large scale gene suppression induced by Wnt3a corresponds to a global decrease in histone acetylation, an epigenetic modification that is associated with gene activation. Mechanistically, Wnt3a does not alter histone acetyltransferase or deacetylase activities but, rather, decreases the level of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus. The Wnt-induced decrease in histone acetylation is independent of β-catenin signaling but, rather, correlates with suppression of glucose metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Functionally, preventing histone deacetylation by increasing nucleocytoplasmic acetyl-CoA levels impairs Wnt3a-induced osteoblast differentiation. Thus, Wnt signaling induces osteoblast differentiation in part through histone deacetylation and epigenetic suppression of an alternative cell fate.

https://openalex.org/W2336362570,"Peripheral nerve injury induces increased expression of thrombospondin-4 (TSP4) in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia that contributes to neuropathic pain states through unknown mechanisms. Here, we test the hypothesis that TSP4 activates its receptor, the voltage-gated calcium channel Cavα2δ1 subunit (Cavα2δ1), on sensory afferent terminals in dorsal spinal cord to promote excitatory synaptogenesis and central sensitization that contribute to neuropathic pain states. We show that there is a direct molecular interaction between TSP4 and Cavα2δ1 in the spinal cord in vivo and that TSP4/Cavα2δ1-dependent processes lead to increased behavioral sensitivities to stimuli. In dorsal spinal cord, TSP4/Cavα2δ1-dependent processes lead to increased frequency of miniature and amplitude of evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents in second-order neurons as well as increased VGlut2- and PSD95-positive puncta, indicative of increased excitatory synapses. Blockade of TSP4/Cavα2δ1-dependent processes with Cavα2δ1 ligand gabapentin or genetic Cavα2δ1 knockdown blocks TSP4 induced nociception and its pathological correlates. Conversely, TSP4 antibodies or genetic ablation blocks nociception and changes in synaptic transmission in mice overexpressing Cavα2δ1 Importantly, TSP4/Cavα2δ1-dependent processes also lead to similar behavioral and pathological changes in a neuropathic pain model of peripheral nerve injury. Thus, a TSP4/Cavα2δ1-dependent pathway activated by TSP4 or peripheral nerve injury promotes exaggerated presynaptic excitatory input and evoked sensory neuron hyperexcitability and excitatory synaptogenesis, which together lead to central sensitization and pain state development."

Expression of the TREK (TWIK-related K+ channel) subfamily members of K2P channels often overlaps in neurons and in other excitable cells. Here, we demonstrate that heterologous coexpression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits results in the formation of functional heterodimers.

In this study, we confirmed its high thermal stability compared with other microbial rhodopsins and also report the potential availability of TR for optogenetics as a light-induced neural silencer. The x-ray crystal structure of TR revealed that its overall structure is quite similar to that of xanthorhodopsin, including the presence of a putative binding site for a carotenoid antenna; but several distinct structural characteristics of TR, including a decreased surface charge and a larger number of hydrophobic residues and aromatic-aromatic interactions, were also clarified. Based on the crystal structure, the structural changes of TR upon thermal stimulation were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations revealed the presence of a thermally induced structural substate in which an increase of hydrophobic interactions in the extracellular domain, the movement of extracellular domains, the formation of a hydrogen bond, and the tilting of transmembrane helices were observed. From the computational and mutational analysis, we propose that an extracellular LPGG motif between helices F and G plays an important role in the thermal stability, acting as a “thermal sensor.” These findings will be valuable for understanding retinal proteins with regard to high protein stability and high optogenetic performance.

Here, we present the first structural insight for dimers of Mec1·Ddc2 and Tel1 using single-particle electron microscopy. Both kinases reveal a head to head dimer with one major dimeric interface through the N-terminal HEAT (named after Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, and yeast kinase TOR1) repeat. Their dimeric interface is significantly distinct from the interface of mTOR complex 1 dimer, which oligomerizes through two spatially separate interfaces. We also observe different structural organizations of kinase domains of Mec1 and Tel1. The kinase domains in the Mec1·Ddc2 dimer are located in close proximity to each other. However, in the Tel1 dimer they are fully separated, providing potential access of substrates to this kinase, even in its dimeric form."

We identify a point mutant that abrogates this interaction and show that this mutant fails to accumulate at sites of DNA damage and that the mutant cannot activate ATR.

Previous work has detailed important aspects of how ATR is activated by stalled forks. For this, ATR associates with a binding partner, ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), and the complex is localized to stalled forks via a direct interaction between ATRIP and replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (13Cortez D.

RPA-coated ssDNA (RPA-ssDNA) is generated at stalled forks due to the uncoupling of DNA helicase and polymerase activities that occurs when the polymerase stalls but the helicase does not (19Byun T.S.

Functional uncoupling of MCM helicase and DNA polymerase activities activates the ATR-dependent checkpoint.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). ATRIP-mediated ATR docking is necessary but not sufficient for kinase activation. Independent of ATR-ATRIP, another protein complex forms on RPA-ssDNA and then joins with ATR-ATRIP to activate ATR (20Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Regulation of ATR substrate selection by Rad17-dependent loading of Rad9 complexes onto chromatin.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This second complex contains, minimally, the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (911) trimeric clamp protein, the clamp loader Rad17-replication factor C (RFC), and TopBP1. Upon assembly of this second complex, TopBP1 is altered so that its ATR activation domain is revealed, and this allows interaction between TopBP1 and ATR-ATRIP in a manner that activates ATR kinase (10Kumagai A.

TopBP1 and ATR are not only required for the DSB response in mitotic cells but also for efficient completion of meiotic recombination (for review, see Ref. 28Cooper T.J. Wardell K. Garcia V. Neale M.J. Homeostatic regulation of meiotic DSB formation by ATM/ATR.Exp. Cell Res. 2014; 329: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mechanism for ATR activation at sites of DSBs is not fully understood. Work in Xenopus has outlined a pathway whereby DSBs activate ATM, which then phosphorylates TopBP1, and this allows TopBP1 to activate ATR (29Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A.

Previous work has also shown that, in human cells containing DSBs, ATR activity toward different substrates requires distinct activation modes. Although TopBP1 is required for ATR activity in all cases, Rad17 (and by extension the 911 complex) is more important for Chk1 phosphorylation, whereas the Nbs1 protein is more important for ATR-directed phosphorylation of RPA32 (30Shiotani B. Nguyen H.D. Håkansson P. Maréchal A. Tse A. Tahara H. Zou L.

A dual involvement of Rad17 and Nbs1 in ATR activation has also been observed in Xenopus (31Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G.

Given the central role of TopBP1 in ATR signaling at both stalled forks and DSBs, it is important to understand how TopBP1 is recruited to these different DNA structures. At stalled forks, TopBP1 can form a complex with 911-Rad17-RFC by virtue of an interaction between the BRCT 1 and 2 domains within TopBP1 and the C-terminal tail domain of Rad9 (33Delacroix S.

Structure and function of the Rad9-binding region of the DNA-damage checkpoint adaptor TopBP1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This interaction requires phosphorylation of Rad9 on Ser-373 (in the Xenopus protein), a site that is thought to be constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase II (37Takeishi Y. Ohashi E. Ogawa K. Masai H. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T.

The TopBP1-Rad9 tail interaction is required for the ability of TopBP1 to contact DNA-bound ATR-ATRIP complexes and for ATR activation (33Delacroix S. Wagner J.M. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto K.

The discovery of the TopBP1-Rad9 interaction led to a simple model for TopBP1 recruitment whereby the 911 clamp is loaded by Rad17-RFC, and TopBP1 is then recruited via interaction with the Rad9 tail. Four recent findings, however, have challenged this view and suggest that initial TopBP1 recruitment to sites of damage is independent of 911. First, multiple lines of published evidence point to a direct role for TopBP1 in 911 loading. A study from our laboratory has shown that when replicating chromatin is isolated and transferred to Xenopus egg extract lacking TopBP1, 911 fails to load onto stalled replication forks (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chromatin transfer experiments showed that TopBP1 must be physically present with 911 for 911 to load onto stalled forks (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, a TopBP1 point mutant (W265R) was identified that cannot accumulate at sites of replication stress, and in egg extract containing this mutant as the sole source of TopBP1, both Rad17 and 911 fail to associate with stalled replication forks and ATR is not activated (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This mutant is, however, competent to initiate DNA replication (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A requirement for TopBP1 in 911 recruitment has also been observed in human cells, as siRNA-mediated depletion of TopBP1 prevents recruitment of 911 to chromatin after hydroxyurea treatment (39Gong Z. Kim J.-E. Leung C.C. Glover J.N. Chen J. BACH1/FANCJ acts with TopBP1 and participates early in DNA replication checkpoint control.Mol.

Interaction between Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 and TopBP1 activates ATR-ATRIP and promotes TopBP1 recruitment to sites of UV-damage.DNA Repair. 2014; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data make it clear that TopBP1 arrives at the stalled fork either before or concurrent with Rad17 and 911 but not after. Second, it has been demonstrated that the TopBP1-Rad9 tail interaction is dispensable for initial recruitment of TopBP1 to stalled forks (35Lee J. Dunphy W.G. Rad17 plays a central role in establishment of the interaction between TopBP1 and the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex at stalled replication forks.Mol. Biol.

In these studies TopBP1 was shown to accumulate on stalled forks even when Rad9 tail phosphorylation was prevented by a S373A mutation. Third, in the context of meiotic DSBs in mice, TopBP1 recruitment is unhindered in Hus1 conditional knock-out spermatocytes (41Lyndaker A.M. Lim P.X. Mleczko J.M. Diggins C.E. Holloway J.K.

Fourth, for ATR activity toward RPA32 at DSBs in human cells, Rad17 is dispensable, but TopBP1 is not (30Shiotani B. Nguyen H.D. Håkansson P. Maréchal A. Tse A. Tahara H. Zou L. Two distinct modes of ATR activation orchestrated by Rad17 and Nbs1.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 1651-1662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These recent findings call for a revision to the simple model where TopBP1 is recruited to sites of damage by virtue of the interaction with the Rad9 tail. Rather, TopBP1 accumulates at stalled forks and DSBs via a previously unknown mechanism, and once it is there then 911 loading and ATR activation follow. To fully understand how ATR is activated during replication stress and DNA damage, it is, therefore, necessary to understand the mechanism for the initial TopBP1 recruitment to stalled forks and DSBs. As detailed below, we have elucidated this mechanism, and it involves direct interaction between the TopBP1 BRCT2 domain and RPA-ssDNA. Egg extracts and sperm chromatin were prepared as described (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sperm chromatin was isolated from egg extract as described (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All of the expression vectors used for IVT protein production were based on pCS2+MT. All cloning was done according to standard procedures. The TopBP1 cDNA used for our experiments was isoform TopBP1-B (NCBI accession number AAP03894), cloned into pCS2+MT (8Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. The Xenopus Xmus101 protein is required for the recruitment of Cdc45 to origins of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This protein was initially named Xmus101 (8Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. The Xenopus Xmus101 protein is required for the recruitment of Cdc45 to origins of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All deletion mutants were produced by PCR using TopBP1-B cDNA as template. PCR primers included an NcoI site on the 5′ end and an XhoI site on the 3′ end. Fragments were subcloned into NcoI/XhoI-digested pCS2+MT and verified by DNA sequencing. For the TopBP1 deletion mutants, the amino acid sequence for each deletion mutant is given below: BRCT0-5 (amino acids (aa) 1–758); BRCT6-8 (aa 759–1513); BRCT0-2 (aa 1–333); BRCT3 (aa 333–480); BRCT4-5 (aa 480–758); BRCT0–1 (aa 1–191); BRCT1 (aa 99–191); BRCT1-2 (aa 99–333); BRCT2 (aa 191–333); BRCT4-5 (aa 527–800). The TopBP1 Δ4-5 mutant was made by deleting amino acids 588–710. The W265R point mutant was previously described (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IVT reactions were performed using a TnT® SP6 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, according to the vendor's instructions (Promega). Expression vectors encoding the Xenopus RPA trimer and the Rad9 tail domain were kind gifts of K. Cimprich. Xenopus RPA trimer was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified under denaturing conditions using urea. Proteins were then renatured using sequential dialysis in buffers containing decreasing concentrations of urea. Proteins were then purified via nickel-agarose chromatography. A detailed protocol for the purification is available upon request. All GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli using standard conditions. In brief, biotin-linked DNA fragments of varying sizes were produced by PCR and then denatured after coupling to Dynabeads® streptavidin (Life Technologies). Beads were mixed with egg extract or IVT proteins and binding buffer, isolated, washed in binding buffer, and eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Biotin-dsDNA was coupled to magnetic streptavidin beads in BW buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and optionally treated with 0.15 n NaOH to produce ssDNA. Binding reactions contained either egg extract, IVT proteins, or purified proteins mixed optionally with purified RPA and dsDNA or ssDNA beads in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm B-glycerol phosphate, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Reaction volumes were 60 μl. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the beads were isolated on a magnetic stand and washed 3 times with 500 μl of Buffer A. Beads were then eluted in 2× Laemmle sample buffer. RPA and TopBP1 were depleted from Xenopus egg extract as described (38Yan S. Michael W.M. TopBP1 and DNA polymerase-α directly recruit the 9–1-1 complex to stalled DNA replication forks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Xenopus TopBP1 antibodies have been described (8Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. The Xenopus Xmus101 protein is required for the recruitment of Cdc45 to origins of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and were specific for the ∼180-kDa TopBP1 protein, and their specificity was validated via Western blotting of egg extract. Xenopus RPA antibodies were kind gifts of J. Walter and have been described (42Walter J. Newport J.

Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These antibodies recognize all three RPA subunits, and their specificity has been validated via Western blotting of egg extract. Xenopus Orc2 antibodies were a kind gift of J. Newport and have been described (43Walter J. Newport J.W. Regulation of replicon size in Xenopus egg extracts.Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These antibodies are specific for the ∼80-kDa Orc2 protein, and their specificity was validated via Western blotting of egg extract. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Sigma, catalogue number M4439) was used to detect myc-tagged IVT proteins. Phosphorylated Chk1 was detected with Phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) antibody #2341 (Cell Signaling Technology). Chk1 was detected using Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody #FL-476. GST fusion proteins were detected with anti-GST antibodies (Sigma, catalogue number 06-332). Previous studies have revealed that the platform for ATR signaling is the RPA-ssDNA that becomes exposed upon uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities during replication stress or after resection of DSBs (for review, see Ref. 3Maréchal A. Zou L. RPA-coated single-stranded DNA as a platform for post-translational modifications in the DNA damage response.Cell Res. 2015; 25: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Given that RPA-ssDNA is a common feature of both stalled forks and DSBs and that TopBP1 activates ATR in both contexts, we reasoned that interaction between TopBP1 and RPA-ssDNA is likely to be important for how TopBP1 is recruited to sites of damage. We, therefore, examined the ability of TopBP1 to bind to ssDNA after incubation in Xenopus egg extract. Magnetic streptavidin beads were coupled to either buffer or equal amounts of either dsDNA or ssDNA and then incubated in egg extract (Fig. 1A). After incubation, the beads were isolated and washed, and protein binding was assessed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1A, TopBP1 could bind well to ssDNA beads but did not efficiently bind either dsDNA beads or beads alone. To better characterize TopBP1's binding to ssDNA, we next determined size requirements for binding. We produced ssDNAs of different lengths, and these were incubated in egg extract, recovered, washed, and assayed for protein binding. As shown in Fig. 1B, efficient binding of TopBP1 was observed for ssDNAs of >250 nt; however, binding was not observed for a 100-nt piece of ssDNA. Interestingly, RPA could bind efficiently to the 100-nt ssDNA. These data reveal a size threshold for efficient TopBP1 binding to the ssDNA, between 100 and 250 nt. To pursue these observations, we next asked if RPA is required for TopBP1 interaction with ssDNA in egg extract. When RPA was removed from the extract by immunodepletion, TopBP1 could not bind efficiently to ssDNA beads, although binding was observed in the mock-depleted control extract (Fig. 2A). This suggests that RPA is necessary for TopBP1 to bind ssDNA in egg extract. To confirm this using a different ssDNA-containing template, we added sperm chromatin to either mock- or RPA-depleted egg extract and then treated the reactions with the EcoRI restriction enzyme to induce DSBs and subsequent ssDNA formation on the chromatin. After incubation the chromatin was isolated and probed for TopBP1, the Orc2 protein (as a loading control), and RPA (Fig. 2B). We observed that Orc2 was bound to chromatin in both extracts, as expected, and that RPA could only be detected in the sample taken from the mock-depleted extract, also as expected. Although TopBP1 could associate with chromatin in the mock-depleted sample, it did not associate with chromatin taken from the RPA-depleted sample, and thus it appears that RPA is needed for recruitment of TopBP1 to both ssDNA alone (Fig. 2A) and to DSB-containing sperm chromatin (Fig. 2B). To ask if RPA is sufficient for TopBP1 ssDNA binding, we produced a recombinant, purified form of the RPA trimer and used it to prepare RPA-ssDNA templates for TopBP1 binding assays. Recombinant, myc-tagged TopBP1 was produced by IVT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. IVT TopBP1 was then incubated with purified RPA and ssDNA and assayed for binding. We observed that TopBP1 bound, in an RPA dose-dependent manner, to the ssDNA beads (Fig. 2C). Binding was not observed when RPA was omitted from the reactions. We next asked if TopBP1 could bind to the RPA trimer in the absence of ssDNA. RPA trimer was immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads by virtue of a six-histidine tag on RPA70 and incubated with IVT TopBP1. As shown in Fig. 2D, TopBP1 did not bind to immobilized RPA. Based on these data, we conclude that TopBP1 binds to RPA-ssDNA but not ssDNA alone nor RPA trimer alone. We next asked if there was any difference for TopBP1 binding between RPA-ssDNA formed in egg extract versus RPA-ssDNA formed with purified, recombinant RPA. For this, ssDNA beads were incubated either with egg extract or purified RPA. RPA-ssDNA complexes were then isolated, washed, and incubated with IVT TopBP1. As shown in Fig. 2E, recombinant RPA was just"

Defects in dendrite morphogenesis are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, and microRNAs are emerging as regulators of aspects of neuronal maturation such as axonal and dendritic growth, spine formation, and synaptogenesis. Here, we show that miR-214 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of dendritic development. Overexpression of miR-214 increased dendrite size and complexity, whereas blocking of endogenous miR-214-3p, a mature form of miR-214, inhibited dendritic morphogenesis. We also found that miR-214-3p targets quaking (Qki), which is implicated in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, through conserved target sites located in the 3'-untranslated region of Qki mRNA, thereby down-regulating Qki protein levels. Overexpression and knockdown of Qki impaired and enhanced dendritic formation, respectively. Moreover, overexpression of Qki abolished the dendritic growth induced by miR-214 overexpression. Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial role for the miR-214-Qki pathway in the regulation of neuronal dendritic development."

As a defense strategy, the cuprous oxidase CueO is secreted into the periplasm to oxidize the more membrane-permeable and toxic Cu(I) before it can enter the cytoplasm. CueO itself is a multicopper oxidase that requires copper for activity. Because it is transported by the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, which transports folded proteins, a requirement for cofactor assembly before translocation has been discussed. Here we show that CueO is transported as an apo-protein. Periplasmic CueO was readily activated by the addition of copper ions in vitro or under copper stress conditions in vivo. Cytoplasmic CueO did not contain copper, even under copper stress conditions. In vitro Tat transport proved that the cofactor assembly was not required for functional Tat transport of CueO. Due to the post-translocational activation of CueO, this enzyme contributes to copper resistance not only by its cuprous oxidase activity but also by chelation of copper ions before they can enter the cytoplasm. Apo-CueO was indistinguishable from holo-CueO in terms of secondary structural elements. Importantly, the binding of copper to apo-CueO greatly stabilized the protein, indicating a transformation from an open or flexible domain arrangement with accessible copper sites to a closed structure with deeply buried copper ions. CueO is thus the first example for a natural Tat substrate of such incomplete folding state.

Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the expression of αB via shRNA inhibits exosome secretion from ARPE19 cells indicating that exosomal cargo may have a role in exosome biogenesis (synthesis and/or secretion). Sucrose density gradient fractionation of the culture medium and cellular extracts suggests continued synthesis of exosomes but an inhibition of exosome secretion. In cells where αB expression was inhibited, the distribution of CD63 (LAMP3), an exosome marker, is markedly altered from the normal dispersed pattern to a stacked perinuclear presence. Interestingly, the total anti-CD63(LAMP3) immunofluorescence in the native and αB-inhibited cells remains unchanged suggesting continued exosome synthesis under conditions of impaired exosome secretion. Importantly, inhibition of the expression of αB results in a phenotype of the RPE cell that contains an increased number of vacuoles and enlarged (fused) vesicles that show increased presence of CD63(LAMP3) and LAMP1 indicating enhancement of the endolysosomal compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2340838087,"Animal steroid hormones regulate gene transcription through genomic pathways by binding to nuclear receptors. These steroid hormones also rapidly increase intracellular calcium and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and activate the protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) nongenomic pathways. However, the function and mechanism of the nongenomic pathways of the steroid hormones are unclear, and the relationship between the PKC and PKA pathways is also unclear. We propose that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) activates the PKA pathway to enhance 20E-induced gene transcription in the lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera. The expression of the catalytic subunit 1 of PKA (PKAC1) increased during metamorphosis, and PKAC1 knockdown blocked pupation and repressed 20E-responsive gene expression. 20E regulated PKAC1 phosphorylation at threonine 200 and nuclear translocation through an ecdysone-responsive G-protein-coupled receptor 2. PKAC1 induced cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation at serine 143, which bound to the cAMP response element on DNA to enhance 20E-responsive gene transcription. Through ecdysone-responsive G-protein-coupled receptor 2, 20E increased cAMP levels, which induced CREB PKA phosphorylation and 20E-responsive gene expression. This study demonstrates that the PKA/CREB pathway tightly and critically regulates 20E-induced gene transcription as well as its relationship with the 20E-induced PKC pathway."

However, the mechanisms governing transcription of p21 need to be extensively studied. In this study, we demonstrate that the high-mobility group box-containing protein 1 (HBP1) transcription factor is a novel activator of p21 that works as part of a complex mechanism during senescence and tumorigenesis. We found that HBP1 activates the p21 gene through enhancing p53 stability by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, a well known positive regulator of p21. HBP1 was also found to enhance p21 transcription by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We identified histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2, as a target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. HBP1-mediated repression of EZH2 through Wnt/β-catenin signaling decreased the level of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 of overall and specific histone on the p21 promoter, resulting in p21 transactivation. Although intricate, the reciprocal partnership of HBP1 and p21 has exceptional importance.

Cellular senescence is characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest and distinct morphological, physiological, and epigenetic changes in response to events such as telomere attrition, aberrant oncogene activation, and abrogation of tumor suppressor gene functions. Senescence is a tumor-suppressive process whose abrogation enables the path to tumorigenesis (1Hornsby P.J. Senescence as an anticancer mechanism.J. Clin.

HBP1 repression of the p47phox gene: cell cycle regulation via the NADPH oxidase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3011-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By regulating the transcription of various genes, HBP1 has been found to participate in multiple cell progressions, including cell cycle inhibition, terminal differentiation, senescence induction, and tumor suppression, in a variety of tissues and cell types (19Pan K. Chen Y. Roth M. Wang W. Wang S. Yee A.S. Zhang X. HBP1-mediated transcriptional regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 and its impact on cell senescence.Mol. Cell.

We found that HBP1 enhanced p53 stability by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and thus promoted p21 transcription activated by p53. On the other hand, HBP1 could also bind TCF4, an important transcription factor in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, through the repression domain and inhibit the transcriptional activation of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 by TCF4. EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me) and mediates gene silencing of target genes via local chromatin reorganization (22Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in Polycomb-group silencing.Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HBP1 reduced EZH2 levels and thus decreased the trimethylation of H3K27 on the p21 promoter, which further facilitated p53 binding on the p21 promoter and activated p21 transcription. Our study indicates that HBP1 potentially up-regulates p21 expression by both the Mdm2/p53 and TCF4/EZH2 pathways. The up-regulation of p21 by HBP1 induced cell growth arrest and cellular senescence and also inhibited tumorigenesis. The human cell lines H1299 (p53−/−), A549, HepG2, U2OS, HEK293T, and WI-38 were purchased from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °;C in 5% CO2. The GSK3β inhibitor SB415286 was purchased from Sigma, and LiCl was purchased from M&C Gene Technology. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using TurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) following the protocol of the manufacturer. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed for detection of transfection efficiency. The siRNA was transfected with X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The β-catenin target siRNA sequence was 5-AGCTGATATTGATGGACAG-3. TCF4 target siRNA sequence was 5-AGACGAGGGCGAACAGGAG-3. The lentivirus vector pLL3.7-shHBP1 expresses shRNA that targets HBP1 mRNA (5′-ACTGTGAGTGCCACTTCTC-3′). The lentivirus vector pLL3.7-shp53 expresses shRNA that targets p53 mRNA (5′-CCACTTGAUGGAGAGTATT-3′). The lentivirus vector pLL3.7-EZH2 expresses shRNA that targets EZH2 mRNA (5′-GACTCTGAATGCAGTTGCT-3′). The experiment was performed as described previously (23Wang W. Chen Y. Wang S. Hu N. Cao Z.

Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). A total of 20–60 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall). The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting analysis were against HBP1 (11746-1-AP, Proteintech), p53 (DO-1, sc-126, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 9282, Cell Signaling Technology), Mdm2 (sc-965, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21 (K0081-3, MBL), GAPDH (KM9002, Sungene), EZH2 (5246, Cell Signaling Technology), Wnt2 (11160-1-AP, Proteintech), DNMT1 (sc-10222, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p16 (10883-1-AP, Proteintech), FLAG (F1804, Sigma-Aldrich), HA (MMS-101P, Covance), GST (IT003M, M&C Gene Technology), His (66005-1, Proteintech), histone 3 (17168-1-AP, Proteintech), H3K27me3 (A2363, ABclonal), GFP(CW8006, CW Biotech), β-catenin (9587P, Cell Signaling Technology), TCF4 (13838-1-AP, Proteintech), and HDAC1 (AH379, Beyotime). The following secondary antibodies were purchased from Rockland: anti-mouse IgG antibody IRDye 800-conjugated (610-132-121) and DyLight 800-conjugated, affinity-purified anti-rabbit IgG (611-145-002). The infrared fluorescence image was obtained using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE). Total RNA was isolated using the RNAsimple total RNA kit (Tiangen). The cDNA was synthesized using the ReverAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) and then analyzed by real-time PCR analysis with Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific). The DNA sequences of the primers were as follows: human HBP1, 5-TGAAGGCTGTGATAATGAGGAAGAT-3 and 5-CATAGAAAGGGTGGTCCAGCTTA-3 (these primers result in a 191-bp product); human p53, 5-TAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGC-3 and 5-AGGACAGGCACAAACATGCACC-3 (these primers result in a 121-bp product); human p21, 5-GCAGACCAGCATGACAGATTT-3 and 5-GGATTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGA-3 (these primers result in a 70-bp product); human Mdm2, 5-GCAGTGAATCTACAGGGACGC-3 and 5-ATCCTGATCCAACCAATCACC-3 (these primers result in an 83-bp product); human EZH2, 5-GGTTCAGACGAGCTGATGAAG-3 and 5-CGCTGTTTCCATTCTTGGTT-3 (these primers result in a 97-bp product); and human GAPDH, 5-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3 and 5-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3 (these primers result in a 195-bp product). GAPDH was applied as an internal control for normalizing the real-time PCR results. Cells for the immunoprecipitation assay were lysed in IP lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell extracts were incubated with the specified antibodies or control IgG and protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °;C with constant rotation. The immunocomplexes were then washed three times with IP lysis buffer, and subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. The experiment was performed as described previously (23Wang W. Chen Y. Wang S. Hu N. Cao Z. Wang W. Tong T. Zhang X. PIASxα ligase enhances SUMO1 modification of PTEN protein as a SUMO E3 ligase.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 3217-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The control GST and GST-tagged proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The His-tagged recombinant protein expression vectors pET-HBP1, pET-Mdm2, and pET-p53, were constructed on the base of the pET-28b (+) vector. The vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli, and recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °;C for 8 h. The purified control GST and GST-tagged proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °;C, and then the His-tagged proteins were added to each tube for another 4 h at 4 °;C. The beads were then washed three times with binding buffer and eluted with GST elution buffer. The elution was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the interactions were analyzed by Western blotting with the specified antibody. For the detection of p53 ubiquitination levels, p53-null H1299 cells were cotransfected with various plasmids as indicated in individual experiments. 18 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Merck Millipore) for 6 h, and the whole cell lysates prepared by FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and fresh protease inhibitors) (24Li M.

Deubiquitination of p53 by HAUSP is an important pathway for p53 stabilization.Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody and then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. A549 cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in individual experiments. 48 h after transfection, 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide was added to the dishes, and the cycloheximide treatment was terminated at the 0-, 20-, 40-, 60-, and 80-min time points as indicated. The whole cell lysates were prepared, and 25 or 60 μg of total protein from each sample was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p53 antibody. Quantification of p53 protein was determined using TotalLab software normalized to GAPDH. The EMSA was conducted using the LightShift chemiluminescence EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The nuclear extract (4 μg of protein) was mixed with a biotin-labeled DNA probe or cold competitor in binding buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-FLAG antibody was included for supershifts. Then the reaction mixture was incubated for additional 30 min at room temperature. Samples were run on the 6% acrylamide gel at 70 V for 2 h. The gel was then transferred to a nylon membrane. The biotin-labeled DNA was detected using the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and LightShift chemiluminescent substrate. The DNA sequences of the probes used were as follows: EZH2-WT, 5-AGAGTTATATACTGCTTTGATTTGCT-3 and 5-AGCAAATCAAAGCAGTATATAACTCT-3; EZH2-MT, 5-AGAGTTATATACTGCGGGTATTTGCT-3 and 5-AGCAAATACCCGCAGTATATAACTCT-3. The ChIP assay was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore) following the instructions of the manufacturer, using 2 μg of either normal IgG or antibodies against p53, HA, FLAG, and H3K27me3. Real-time PCR was performed as illustrated above at least three times with independent DNA samples. The reported data represent real-time PCR values normalized to input DNAs and to the values obtained with normal IgG, which were set as one unit in each calculation. Data are presented as -fold differences relative to input and values obtained by normal IgG with the formula 2((Ct IgG − Ct Input) − (Ct Ab − Ct Input)), where Ct is the threshold cycle, IgG is the normal IgG, Ab is the specific antibody, and Input is the input genomic DNA. For the TCF4 promoter, the PCR primer sequences were 5-CTAAACGTCTAGCAATTTAC-3 and 5-GCATTTTTAAGAGGAAGATC-3. For the p21 promoter, the PCR primer sequences were 5-CTGGACTGGGCACTCTTGTC-3 and 5-CTCCTACCATCCCCTTCCTC-3 (for p53 binding) (25Mattia M. Gottifredi V. McKinney K.

For each antibody, at least three independent ChIP experiments were performed. Cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in individual experiments. Cell lysates were prepared with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer at 24–48 h post-transfection. The firefly luciferase activity measurements were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for the same sample. The luciferase assay was performed on three biological replicates, and each replicate was measured at least three times. To identify histone modifications, acid extraction of histone was performed as reported previously (27Cao L.L. Wei F. Du Y. Song B. Wang D. Shen C. Lu X. Cao Z. Yang Q. Gao Y. Wang L. Zhao Y. Wang H. Yang Y. Zhu W.G. ATM-mediated KDM2A phosphorylation is required for the DNA damage repair.Oncogene. 2016; 35: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, H1299 cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The nuclei were then resuspended in 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated for at least 30 min after spinning. The supernatant containing histones was collected and incubated with trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min. The histone pellet was collected after spinning, washed with acetone, and dissolved in diluted H2O. WI-38, A549, and p53-null H1299 cells were stably transfected with plasmids as indicated in individual experiment. After puromycin (0.4 μg/ml) and/or G418 (400 μg/ml) selection, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells/well. After culturing for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10 days, 15 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthyazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well, followed by further incubation at 37 °;C for 4 h. The medium was removed and 200 μl of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance at 490 nm was read using the microplate reader. The MTT assay was performed on three biological replicates, and each replicate was measured at least three times. Cells were grown on coverslips and synchronized in 0.2% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 24 h. The subconfluent cultures were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 10 μg of BrdU and fixed, and nuclei incorporating BrdU were visualized by immunostaining using a commercially available kit (BrdU labeling and detection kit, Roche). For visualization of all nuclei in a field, the coverslips were stained with Hoechst dye for 1 min at 37 °;C. All coverslips were examined using fluorescence microscopy with the appropriate filters. At least 300 cells were counted in randomly chosen fields from each culture well. The experiment was performed using a senescence β-galactosidase staining kit (Beyotime) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were washed once in PBS, fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 3% formaldehyde, and washed three times with PBS again. Then, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °;C with freshly prepared SA galactosidase stain solution. At least 300 cells were counted in randomly chosen fields (19Pan K. Chen Y. Roth M. Wang W.

The effect of HBP1 on the anchorage-independent growth of A549 and p53-null H1299 cells was estimated by a soft agar colony formation assay as described previously (23Wang W. Chen Y. Wang S. Hu N. Cao Z. Wang W. Tong T. Zhang X. PIASxα ligase enhances SUMO1 modification of PTEN protein as a SUMO E3 ligase.J. Biol.

Single-cell suspensions of 1.5–3 × 104 cells were plated per 6-well plate in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.35% agar on a layer of 2 ml of the same medium containing 0.7% agar. Two weeks after culture, photographs were taken, and the numbers of colonies were determined by TotalLab software. A549 and p53-null H1299 cells were stably transfected with either control plasmid or HBP1 plasmid or both HBP1 and EZH2 plasmid. After puromycin (0.4 μg/ml) and/or G418 (400 μg/ml) selection, 3 × 106 cells were suspended in 150 μl of PBS and subcutaneously injected into the left or right hind leg of 6-week-old female nude mice. 3–4 weeks after injection, the mice were killed, the tumors were weighed, and the size was measured. Each cell subline was evaluated in three different animals. All of the array data related to cancers and cancer lines from the Affymetrix human genome U133 Plus 2.0 platform were downloaded from the GEO database, and a TumorProfile database 3Y. Chen, K. Pan, P. Wang, Z. Cao, W. Wang, S. Wang, N. Hu, J. Xue, H. Li, W. Jiang, G. Li, and X.

The expression profile of HBP1, EZH2, and p21 in a variety of cancers and the corresponding control (normal or non-tumor) tissues was searched in this database. Rank-based gene expression curves, which visually reflect the gene expression profile across multiple tissues, were generated using the TumorProfile dataset. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. from an appropriate number of experiments as indicated in the figure legends. The statistical analysis was done by using Student’s t test, and p < 0.01 or 0.05 was considered significant. We had observed previously that p53 and p21 protein levels increased during HBP1-induced premature senescence and tumor inhibition in normal human fibroblasts (19Pan K. Chen Y. Roth M. Wang W.

Additionally, other work suggested that histone methyltransferase EZH2 depletion promotes cellular senescence by activation of p21 in gastric cancer cells (30Bai J. Chen J. Ma M. Cai M. Xu F. Wang G.

Intriguingly, we observed a statistically significant inverse correlation between HBP1 and EZH2 expression in cervical tumors from NCBI GEO database GSE9750 and in many cancer cell lines, such as HCT116 (a human colorectal cancer cell line) and A549 (a human lung carcinoma cell line), through data mining using the background dataset of the TumorProfile database (data not shown). In addition, we found that HBP1 and p21 were significantly down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma, whereas EZH2 was significantly up-regulated in the cancer, according to bioinformatics analysis (Fig. 1A). Thus, we raised the question of whether p53 and EZH2 are both involved in p21 expression regulated by HBP1. To determine"

There are 28 different types of collagens known today. All of them have in common as a defining feature the so-called collagen triple helix, a structural element that is formed by three individual polypeptide chains (reviewed in Refs. 1Kadler K.E.

The three-dimensional structure of this extended, non-globular domain puts severe restrictions on the linear amino acid sequence of collagens, resulting in repeating triplets of the sequence Xaa-Yaa-Gly with proline and hydroxyproline as the preferred residues in the Xaa and Yaa positions, respectively. Biogenesis of collagen is a complicated process involving extensive post-translational modifications (4Koide T. Nagata K. Asada S. Takahara Y. Nishikawa Y. Kitagawa K. Brinckmann J. Notbohm H.

Contrary to other chaperones, HSP47 binds preferentially to the folded (i.e. triple-helical) conformation of its client (11Ono T. Miyazaki T. Ishida Y. Uehata M. Nagata K.

After dissociation from collagen in the low pH compartments of the cis-Golgi or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, HSP47 is recycled back to the ER due to its C-terminal RDEL sequence. HSP47 is a member of the serpin family (14Whisstock J.C. Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Bottomley S.P. Kaiserman D. Luke C.J. Pak S.C. Reichhart J.-M. Huntington J.A.

Based on CD and fluorescence spectra, conformational rearrangements of HSP47 at lower pH values have nevertheless been postulated (15El-Thaher T.S.H. Drake A.F. Yokota S. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. The pH-dependent, ATP-independent interaction of collagen specific serpin/stress protein HSP47.Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 1-8Google Scholar, 16Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Structure-function studies on hsp47: pH-dependent inhibition of collagen fibril formation in vitro.Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of HSP47 in complex with collagen model peptides have been published, and the interface between the two proteins is known in atomic detail (17Widmer C. Gebauer J.M. Brunstein E. Rosenbaum S. Zaucke F. Drögemüller C. Leeb T. Baumann U. Molecular basis for the action of the collagen-specific chaperone Hsp47/SERPINH1 and its structure-specific client recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 13243-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, a number of important questions, especially regarding the pH-triggered client release, are still open. Six histidine residues are found within this binding interface, thus opening an attractive explanation of client release at slightly acidic pH values. The involvement of imidazole side chains has also been previously postulated, due to their pKa values usually falling in the interval between 6 and 7, thus titrating in the pH interval relevant to the HSP47 client-binding and release cycle (15El-Thaher T.S.H.

Previous work has mainly assigned a pair of histidine residues in the so-called breach region of HSP47 as responsible triggers of collagen binding and release (18Abdul-Wahab M.F. Homma T. Wright M. Olerenshaw D. Dafforn T.R. Nagata K. Miller A.D. The pH sensitivity of murine heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) binding to collagen is affected by mutations in the breach histidine cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 4452-4461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), together with another histidine located close by. The exact mechanism by which protonation of these histidines results in collagen dissociation from HSP47 is still unclear. To gain a deeper insight into the function of HSP47 and the molecular nature of the interaction between chaperone and client, we have undertaken a systematic study involving the prediction of pKa values followed by an extensive mutagenesis approach. We show here that the previous assignment of histidine residues is in error and put forward a detailed model of how low pH triggers collagen release from HSP47. The crystal structure of HSP47 in complex with a collagen model peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 3ZHA (17Widmer C. Gebauer J.M. Brunstein E. Rosenbaum S. Zaucke F. Drögemüller C. Leeb T. Baumann U.

For closing the gap in the protein backbone between Ser-119 and Val-126 (chain A), a modeled loop was inserted using ModLoop (19Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Modeling of loops in protein structures.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 20Fiser A. Sali A.

Titrating aspartate, glutamate, and histidine residues were renamed to prepare the pdb files for the constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulation developed by Mongan et al. (21Mongan J. Case D.A. McCammon J.A. Constant pH molecular dynamics in generalized Born implicit solvent.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 2038-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were added using the LEaP module of AMBER 12 (22Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Walker R.C. Zhang W. Merz K.M. Roberts B. Hayik S. Roitberg A. Seabra G. Swails J. et al.AMBER 12. University of California, San Francisco2012Google Scholar). Subsequently, the topology and coordinate files of the systems were generated with LEaP. The CpHMD (and also all other MD) simulations were performed using Sander of AMBER 12 and the ff99SB force field (23Wang J. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. How well does a restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model perform in calculating conformational energies of organic and biological molecules.J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3494) Google Scholar) for proteins. At first, a minimization was carried out in three subsequent steps to optimize the geometry of the starting structures. In the first step of the minimization, the hydrogen atoms of the protein were minimized, whereas everything else was restrained with a constant force of 10 kcal/(mol·Å2) to the initial positions. In the second step, the modeled loop was minimized, whereas the remaining protein was restrained with 10 kcal/(mol·Å2). In the last step, no restraints were used, so that the whole system was minimized. All three minimization parts started with 2,500 steps using the steepest descent algorithm, followed by 2,500 steps of a conjugate gradient minimization. The molecules were solvated with the implicit solvent developed by Onufriev et al. (control variable igb = 2) (24Onufriev A. Bashford D. Case D.A. Exploring protein native states and large-scale conformational changes with a modified generalized Born model.Proteins. 2004; 55: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). The salt concentration was set to 0.1 m (based on Debye-Hückel). The cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was set to 30.0 Å, and bonds involving hydrogen were constrained with SHAKE. The time step was 2 fs, and a Monte Carlo step was performed after every step. Thereafter, the systems were equilibrated in two successive steps. In the first step (0.1 ns long), the temperature was raised from 10 to 310 K, and the protein was restrained with a constant force of 5 kcal/(mol·Å2). In the second step (0.4 ns long), only the Cα atoms of the protein were restrained with a constant force of 5 kcal/(mol·Å2). Then the simulations ran for 25 ns (pH 4.0) or 100 ns (pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) without any restraints at physiological temperature (310 K) with a Langevin thermostat. For the analysis of the MD simulations, the fraction of doubly protonated histidines was measured over simulation. The H238N mutant and, for comparison, also the wild-type HSP47 were simulated without the collagen molecule for 50 ns with the described CpHMD method at pH 8.0. For the wild-type HSP47 and the mutants (H273N, H274N, and H273N/H274N), a modified version of the CpHMD, namely a pH titrating MD (pHtMD) (25Socher E. Sticht H. Mimicking titration experiments with MD simulations: a protocol for the investigation of pH-dependent effects on proteins.Sci. Rep. 2016; 622523Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) simulation, was conducted. During these 201-ns-long simulations, the solution pH was decreased from 8.00 to 4.00 with a rate of −0.02 pH units/ns. Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were performed for wild-type HSP47 and the H273N/H274N mutant, both complexed with the collagen model peptide, to investigate the work necessary for dissociation of the HSP47-collagen complex. Ten different structures from the pHtMD simulation at pH 6.0 were used as starting structures for the 10 independent SMD simulations. While the HSP47 molecule was restrained with a constant force of 5,000 kcal/(mol·Å2), the collagen was pulled away with a constant velocity of 0.5 Å/ps, thereby increasing the distance between the centers of mass of the collagen triple helix and the HSP47 molecule from 32 to 82 Å. Finally, the computed work, which is the integrated force over distances, was averaged over the 10 simulations. A canine-derived synthetic HSP47 gene coding for residues 36LSP … RDEL418 was purchased as a codon-optimized cDNA for Escherichia coli from DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) with an additional C-terminal StrepII tag and cloned into the manufacturer’s expression plasmid, pJExpress 411. The construct was transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells grown to A600 of 0.6–0.7, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °;C/180 rpm, cells were harvested, and pellets were stored at −20 °;C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm PMSF, 4 mm DTT) and lysed by sonication. Cleared lysates were loaded onto 1 ml of Streptactin Superflow (IBA) and eluted with 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin in lysis buffer excluding PMSF. The eluted proteins were further subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and the protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °;C. Mutations were introduced according to an optimized site-directed mutagenesis protocol (26Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. An efficient one-step site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis protocol.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) using overlapping primers. The mutants were expressed and purified following the protocol used for wild-type HSP47. The plasmid coding for the GPR-foldon peptide (27Du C. Wang M. Liu J. Pan M. Cai Y. Yao J. Improvement of thermostability of recombinant collagen-like protein by incorporating a foldon sequence.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 79: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. M. Koch (University of Cologne). It encodes an N-terminal Twin-StrepII tag, a thrombin site, a collagen sequence ((GPP)5GPR(GPP)6), and a C-terminal phage T4 foldon domain for protein trimerization. The protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3), induced at A600 of 1.0 with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside, and incubated overnight at 20 °;C/180 rpm. The foldon protein was purified analogously to HSP47 constructs but without DTT in the buffers. Protein sequences of all currently annotated SerpinH1 orthologs in ENSEMBL (ensemble.org/GRCh38.p3) were retrieved and aligned using the ClustalO plugin of CLC Bio. Sequences containing too many gaps to be useful were deleted. The species were grouped together based on their phylogenetic class, and these classes were ordered by their phylogenetic relationship. Protein sequences of human SerpinF1 (PEDF), SerpinA1 (antitrypsin), and SerpinC1 (antithrombin) were included as an outgroup. The alignment was colored using BOXSHADE. Biolayer interferometry was measured on a BLItz system (Pall ForteBIO LLC, Menlo Park, CA). For coupling on streptavidin biosensors, foldon peptides were biotinylated with NHS-Biotin following the manufacturer’s protocols (Pierce) and loaded at a concentration of 10 μm to a response of ∼5.5 nm. Free biotin binding sites were blocked with 10 μm biocytin, and nonspecific interactions were blocked with two load/regeneration cycles with HSP47. The sensors were regenerated with McIlvaine buffer (28McIlvaine T.C. A buffer solution for colorimetric comparison.J. Biol. Chem. 1921; 49: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) at pH 6.0 for up to 40 s. Successful regeneration of the sensors was verified by comparison of HSP47 binding at pH 7.5 before and after regeneration. Kinetics were measured with a constant protein concentration of 5 μm HSP47 protein. The association time was fixed at 60 s, whereas the dissociation time was chosen differently at different pH to allow for sufficient dissociation (pH 7.5, 140 s; pH 7.0, 120 s; pH 6.5, 100 s; pH 6.0, 80 s). For each condition and sample, at least three sensorgrams were recorded, and all experiments were repeated at least twice on different days with different protein preparations. Kinetic parameters were extracted separately using the program Origin version 8.5 and a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Sensorgrams are shown as representative results, and kinetic parameters (kon, koff, and KD) are presented with error bars indicating the S.D. in a single experiment. For ELISA style binding assays, rat tail collagen I (BD Biosciences) was diluted in TBS and coated at 10 μg/ml (500 ng/well) overnight at room temperature onto 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc). After washing with TBS-T (TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS. Strep-tagged HSP47 proteins were added at a concentration of 3 μm in TBS-T containing 1% milk powder and incubated for 1 h. After washing away unbound protein with TBS-T, wells were incubated with McIlvaine buffers at the indicated pH levels for 5 min, shortly washed at the indicated pH, and then washed three times with TBS-T. Bound proteins were detected by Streptactin-HRP (IBA, Goettingen, Germany) and visualized with tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. The reaction was monitored at 370 nm. Data were analyzed using Origin version 8.5 and fitted using a four-parameter logistic model (29Findlay J.W. Dillard R.F. Appropriate calibration curve fitting in ligand binding assays.AAPS J. 2007; 9: E260-E267Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-715 instrument at 20 °;C. All constructs were dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.0, and the indicated pH was adjusted shortly before the measurement by diluting the protein to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in at least 10 volumes of target buffer. The samples were measured in a 1-mm cuvette with bandwidth at 2 nm, a response of 2 s, sensitivity set to standard (100 millidegrees), data pitch 0.2 nm, and a scan speed of 50 nm/min. Each curve was measured with 10 accumulations and plotted in Origin version 8.5. Data were analyzed between 200 and 240 nm with the CDPro package (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W.

Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar) using the CONTIN/LL algorithm (31Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Estimation of globular protein secondary structure from circular dichroism.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar) and the reference set 7 (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W.

Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). Melting temperatures were measured using a total volume of 50 μl with 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration and a final dilution of 1× Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes). Samples were heated in a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) at an approximate rate of 0.5 K/min, and the fluorescence intensity was measured every 0.5 K using the channel 6 filter set (excitation, 450–490 nm; emission, 560–580 nm). Curves were analyzed using the supplied software CFX Manager version 3.1, and melting temperatures were deduced from the minima of the first derivative. The crystal structure of HSP47 bound to trimeric collagen model peptides (17Widmer C. Gebauer J.M. Brunstein E. Rosenbaum S. Zaucke F. Drögemüller C. Leeb T. Baumann U. Molecular basis for the action of the collagen-specific chaperone Hsp47/SERPINH1 and its structure-specific client recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

During the secretion process, the pH changes from 7.4 in the ER to 6.3 in the Golgi. It was already proposed earlier that histidine residues, whose imidazole side chains have a pKa of ∼6.1, might be responsible for the dissociation of the complex at low pH (15El-Thaher T.S.H. Drake A.F. Yokota S. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. The pH-dependent, ATP-independent interaction of collagen specific serpin/stress protein HSP47.Protein Pept.

Chem. 2013; 288: 4452-4461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Canine HSP47 possesses 14 histidine residues (Fig. 1), with most of them being conserved in the HSP47 family. His108 and His353 appear to be general serpin features because they occur in all other serpin clades as well, such as antitrypsin (SerpinA1), antithrombin (SerpinC1), or PEDF (SerpinF1). Some histidines show a strict conservation in HSP47 (e.g. His238 or His315), whereas others are sometimes replaced (e.g. His216, His273, or His262) (Fig. 2). Of the 14 histidines in HSP47, six are directly involved in the collagen binding interface, namely His215, His216, His238, His273, His274, and His386 in the numbering of the protein from Canis lupus familiaris, UniProt ID C7C419 (Fig. 1). However, histidine residues outside of the interface could introduce changes in the overall structure upon protonation as well and might thereby also lead to a dissociation of the complex. Large conformational changes are very common for members of the serpin family, and pH-dependent changes in CD and fluorescence spectra have been reported (32Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. HSP47 binds cooperatively to triple helical type I collagen but has little effect on the thermal stability or rate of refolding.J. Biol.

Protein sequences from all annotated SerpinH1 orthologs currently in ENSEMBL (ensemble.org/GRCh38.p3) were deduced and aligned using ClustalO. Sequence fragments containing histidines either in the HSP47-collagen interface or predicted to be of importance for pH dependence are shown, separated by white bars. The species were grouped together based on their phylogenetic class, and these classes were ordered by their phylogenetic relationship. Protein sequences of human SerpinF1 (PEDF), SerpinA1 (antitrypsin), and SerpinC1 (antithrombin) were included to differentiate between conservation within HSP47 orthologs and other members of the serpin protein family.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pKa values of histidine side chains are known to depend on the chemical environment generated by the protein structure and can vary from about 4 to 9 with values between 5.0 and 8.0 being regularly observed (33Edgcomb S.P. Murphy K.P. Variability in the pKa of histidine side-chains correlates with burial within proteins.Proteins. 2002; 49: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To narrow down possible key residues, we tried to calculate the pKa values of all histidine residues in HSP47 by CpHMD simulations. These simulations were performed for the HSP47 molecule in complex with the collagen triple helix at pH 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, and 4.0, based on the assumption that these histidine residues should change their charge in a pH range between 6.0 and 7.0. Therefore, the doubly protonated (i.e. positively charged) fraction of each of the 14 histidine residues was calculated with an analysis tool of Amber 12 (Fig. 3 and Table 1).TABLE 1Protonation states of histidines in HSP47Fraction of doubly protonated histidine residuesResidue numberInterfacepH 4.0pH 5.0pH 6.0pH 7.0pH 8.0%10894.992.914.15.00.115395.890.367.16.21.315896.162.436.95.81.020979.659.411.110.40.4215Yes5.63.70.10.20.0216Yes94.875.715.80.50.0238Yes42.34.91.71.41.326299.090.082.618.93.1273Yes91.650.332.73.31.3274Yes20.95.40.50.10.031550.483.75"

UV-sensitive syndrome consists of three genetic complementation groups caused by mutations in the CSA, CSB, and UVSSA genes. UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA), the product of UVSSA, which is required for stabilization of Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein and reappearance of the hypophosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II after UV irradiation, forms a complex with ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7). In this study, we demonstrated that the deubiquitination activity of USP7 is suppressed by its interaction with UVSSA. The interaction required the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor domain of USP7 and the central region of UVSSA and was disrupted by an amino acid substitution in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-binding motif of UVSSA. Cells expressing mutant UVSSA were highly sensitive to UV irradiation and defective in recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation. These results indicate that the interaction between UVSSA and USP7 is important for TC-NER. Furthermore, the mutant UVSSA was rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and CSB was also degraded after UV irradiation as observed in UVSSA-deficient cells.

NER occurs via two subpathways, global genome NER (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER); the choice of subpathway is determined by the location of the lesion. As its name implies, GG-NER operates throughout the entire genome, whereas TC-NER specifically removes lesions from the transcribed strands of actively transcribed genes (2Hanawalt P.C. Spivak G.

In GG-NER, the XPC-RAD23B-CETN2 complex recognizes lesions with the help of the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex. By contrast, in TC-NER, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalled at a lesion on the transcribed strand serves as the damage recognition signal. Subsequently, TC-NER-specific factors, including CSA, CSB, UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA), and XAB2, are recruited to the lesion site (2Hanawalt P.C. Spivak G.

Following the specific recognition events of GG-NER and TC-NER, the subpathways merge into a common pathway involving several steps: unwinding of damaged DNA, introduction of dual incisions in the damaged strand, removal of the damage-containing oligonucleotide, repair synthesis in the resulting gap, and ligation of the repair patch to the contiguous parental DNA strand (2Hanawalt P.C.

After UV irradiation, UVSSA stabilizes CSB and restores the hypophosphorylated form of Pol II (Pol IIa) in collaboration with USP7 (16Zhang X. Horibata K. Saijo M. Ishigami C. Ukai A. Kanno S.

USP7 has deubiquitination activity, and its catalytic domain is formed by residues 208–564. In addition, USP7 has a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domain in its N-terminal region and five ubiquitin-like domains in its C-terminal region (Fig. 1A). In this study, we examined the effect of interaction with UVSSA on the deubiquitination activity of USP7 and identified the regions in both proteins required for binding. Moreover, we revealed that the interaction between UVSSA and USP7 is critical for TC-NER. For expression of WT and truncated UVSSA, DNA sequence encoding FLAG and HA tags was attached to the 5′-end of each UVSSA cDNA, and the resultant fragments were inserted between the NotI and XbaI sites of vector pFastBac-1 (Invitrogen). For expression of WT and truncated USP7, DNA sequence encoding the V5 tag was attached to the 5′-end of each USP7 cDNA, and the resultant fragments were inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of vector pFastBac HTb, which contains DNA sequence encoding the His6 tag. Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated according to the protocol for the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Briefly, the plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac for transposition into the bacmid. Sf9 cells were transfected with the bacmid DNA, and recombinant baculoviruses were obtained and amplified. To generate mammalian expression constructs for UVSSA mutants, point mutations were introduced into pcDNA3-FLAG-HA-UVSSA (16Zhang X. Horibata K. Saijo M. Ishigami C. Ukai A. Kanno S. Tahara H. Neilan E.G. Honma M. Nohmi T. Yasui A. Tanaka K. Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and destabilize ERCC6 in transcription-coupled DNA repair.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The resultant plasmid was sequenced to rule out non-targeted mutations elsewhere in the cDNA. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Sf9 cells were infected with the appropriate baculovirus(es) and incubated for 72 h. Infected cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells infected with recombinant baculovirus for FLAG-HA-UVSSA or co-infected with viruses for FLAG-HA-UVSSA and His6-V5-USP7 were lysed in NETN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,600 × g for 10 min and incubated with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were centrifuged at 3,800 × g for 1 min, and the resultant supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed five times with NETN buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with NETN buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted samples were further purified using Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of purified UVSSA-USP7 complex was 231 ng/μl. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells infected with recombinant baculovirus for His6-V5-USP7 were lysed in TALON buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X-100, 10% glycerol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,600 × g for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant was incubated with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged at 3,800 × g for 1 min, and the resultant supernatant was incubated with nickel-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed five times with TALON buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with TALON buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted samples were further purified using Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of purified USP7 was 757 ng/μl. Ubiquitin-rhodamine 110 (Life Sensors) was incubated with USP7 or UVSSA-USP7 complex in 100 μl of reaction buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 100 μm BSA) at 25 °C. The increase in fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 535 nm) due to release of rhodamine 110 was followed on a multimode reader (Mithras LB 940). Reactions were performed in duplicate. The Kps3 cell line was derived from a UVSS-A patient and immortalized with SV40 large T antigen and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (16Zhang X. Horibata K. Saijo M. Ishigami C. Ukai A. Kanno S. Tahara H. Neilan E.G. Honma M. Nohmi T. Yasui A. Tanaka K. Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and destabilize ERCC6 in transcription-coupled DNA repair.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Kps3 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with FLAG-HA-UVSSA expression constructs using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). For transient expression, cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. To isolate stable transfectants, transfected cells were incubated in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. The G418-resistant clones were assayed for expression of FLAG-HA-UVSSA by Western blotting with anti-UVSSA or anti-HA antibody. Cell lysates were prepared using NETN buffer as described above. After preclearance with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), the lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma) or anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed five times with NETN buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with NETN buffer containing the corresponding peptide. Exponentially growing cells were inoculated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 500 cells/dish. After 12 h, cells were washed with PBS; irradiated with UV light at 0, 4, 8, or 12 J/m2; and then incubated for 1–2 weeks. The resultant colonies were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted using a stereomicroscope. Cells were irradiated with 10 J/m2 of UV light and incubated for various times. Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). For the control, DNA was prepared from unirradiated cells. DNA was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by rapid chilling in an ice bath. To quantify the DNA lesions, denatured DNA (100 ng for CPD and 200 ng for 6-4PP) was spotted onto Hybond-N+ (GE Healthcare) with 5× SSC using a slot-blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schüll). The filter was baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Quantification of CPDs and 6-4PPs was carried out using anti-CPD antibody (Kamiya Biomedical; KTM53) and anti-6-4PP antibody (Cosmo Bio; 64M-2). Antibodies bound to CPDs and 6-4PPs were detected using Pierce Western Blotting Substrate Plus (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed by ImageQuant LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare). To measure RNA synthesis after UV irradiation, two sets of cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/dish. After 12 h of incubation, cells were washed with PBS and irradiated with UV light at 10 J/m2. After 24 h of incubation, the cells in one set were counted. The other set of cells was labeled with 370 kBq/ml [3H]uridine for 30 min to quantitate RNA synthesis. Labeling was terminated by the addition of NaN3 to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 200 μg/ml NaN3 and lysed in 0.8% SDS for 30 min at room temperature. Next, an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate was added to the lysates and incubated on ice for 1 h. Acid-insoluble materials were collected on GF-C glass microfiber filters (Whatman), and radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Radioactivity was normalized to cell number. The ratio of radioactivity of UV-irradiated cells to that of non-irradiated cells was taken to reflect the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation. CSB silencing was performed by transfection with siRNA (Dharmacon; M-004888) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transfection was performed first, and forward transfection was performed 24 h later. Cells were irradiated with UV light 24 h after forward transfection and then incubated for the indicated amount of time. Anti-UVSSA (N1N2; GTX106751) was from GeneTex. Anti-USP7 (4833) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-CSB (E-18; sc-10459), anti-CSA (W-16; sc-10997), anti-Pol II (A-10; sc-17798), and anti-lamin B (C20; sc-6216) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HA (3F10; 1867423) was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-V5 (46-0705) was from Invitrogen. UVSSA forms a complex with USP7 (16Zhang X. Horibata K. Saijo M. Ishigami C. Ukai A. Kanno S. Tahara H.

Vermeulen W. Marteijn J.A. UV-sensitive syndrome protein UVSSA recruits USP7 to regulate transcription-coupled repair.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We analyzed the UVSSA-USP7 complex using a baculovirus expression system. Recombinant baculoviruses for N-terminally FLAG- and HA-tagged UVSSA (FLAG-HA-UVSSA) and N-terminally His6- and V5-tagged USP7 (His6-V5-USP7) were generated. Sf9 cells were infected with one or both viruses, and cell lysates were prepared. Both proteins were detected in the lysates (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). Smaller bands detected with anti-USP7 antibody were considered to represent degradation products (lanes 2 and 3). Immunoprecipitation of UVSSA and USP7 from the lysates was performed with anti-FLAG and anti-V5 antibody, respectively. UVSSA was precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody (lanes 4 and 6), and USP7 was co-precipitated with UVSSA from the lysates of co-infected Sf9 cells (lane 6). Similarly, USP7 was precipitated by anti-V5 antibody (lanes 8 and 9), and UVSSA was co-precipitated with USP7 from lysates of co-infected Sf9 cells (lane 9). These observations confirm that the UVSSA-USP7 interaction could be detected in the baculovirus expression system. To examine the effects of UVSSA on the deubiquitination activity of USP7, we purified USP7 and UVSSA-USP7 complex. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus for His6-V5-USP7 or co-infected with viruses for His6-V5-USP7 and FLAG-HA-UVSSA, and cell lysates were prepared from the infected cells. USP7 and UVSSA-USP7 complex were purified from the lysates using nickel-Sepharose and anti-FLAG-agarose, respectively. UVSSA was also purified by the same method used for the UVSSA-USP7 complex. Samples were further purified by gel filtration chromatography. The purified samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies (Fig. 2A). USP7 and UVSSA bands were detected at the predicted molecular sizes. To determine the purity of the samples, USP7 and UVSSA-USP7 complex were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 2B). Bands corresponding to USP7 (lane 2) and to USP7 and UVSSA (lane 3) were detected as predicted. Under these conditions, the intensities of the USP7 bands in both samples were almost identical. No other bands were detected. Hence, these purified samples were used for subsequent experiments. The deubiquitination activity of UVSSA-USP7 complex was compared with that of USP7 using ubiquitin-rhodamine 110 as a substrate. Cleavage between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and rhodamine by USP7 results in an increase in rhodamine fluorescence (23Hassiepen U. Eidhoff U. Meder G. Bulber J.F. Hein A. Bodendorf U. Lorthiois E. Martoglio B. A sensitive fluorescence intensity assay for deubiquitinating proteases using ubiquitin-rhodamine110-glycine as substrate.Anal. Biochem. 2007; 371: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In these experiments, USP7 or UVSSA-USP7 complex (3 nm) was incubated with 1 μm substrate, and deubiquitination was monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2C). For the first 20 min of the reaction, the fluorescence intensity was lower in the UVSSA-USP7 than in the sample with USP7 alone; at 10 min, the fluorescence intensity of UVSSA-USP7 complex was 48% of that of USP7. Ultimately, the fluorescence intensities reached almost the same level. Next, we ran the same reaction using substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, and 4 μm. Based on the fluorescence data, we plotted the velocity of deubiquitination in the linear range of the reaction (Fig. 2D) and calculated the kinetic parameters from the Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 2E). Km did not differ significantly between USP7 and the UVSSA-USP7 complex (1.0 μm), but the Vmax of USP7 (11.1 × 102 fluorescence intensity/min) was 1.3-fold higher than that of UVSSA-USP7 (8.3 × 102 fluorescence intensity/min). Therefore, UVSSA does not influence the affinity of USP7 for the substrate but instead decreases the catalytic turnover. These data indicate that the deubiquitination activity of USP7 is inhibited by UVSSA in a non-competitive manner. To identify the UVSSA-binding region in USP7, we prepared recombinant baculoviruses for His6-V5-USP7 and truncated variants. USP7(1–564), USP7(208–1102), and USP7(1–208) contain the TRAF and catalytic domains, the catalytic and ubiquitin-like domains, and the TRAF domain alone, respectively (Fig. 3A). Sf9 cells were co-"
https://openalex.org/W2342594657,"The hepatic hormone hepcidin is the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Its expression level is adjusted to alterations in iron levels, inflammatory cues, and iron requirements for erythropoiesis. Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) contributes to the iron-dependent control of hepcidin. In addition, TGF-β1 may stimulate hepcidin mRNA expression in murine hepatocytes and human leukocytes. However, receptors and downstream signaling proteins involved in TGF-β1-induced hepcidin expression are still unclear. Here we show that TGF-β1 treatment of mouse and human hepatocytes, as well as ectopic expression of TGF-β1 in mice, increases hepcidin mRNA levels. The hepcidin response to TGF-β1 depends on functional TGF-β1 type I receptor (ALK5) and TGF-β1 type II receptor (TβRII) and is mediated by a noncanonical mechanism that involves Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. Interestingly, increasing availability of canonical Smad2/3 decreases TGF-β1-induced hepcidin regulation, whereas the BMP6-hepcidin signal was enhanced, indicating a signaling component stoichiometry-dependent cross-talk between the two pathways. Although ALK2/3-dependent hepcidin activation by BMP6 can be modulated by each of the three hemochromatosis-associated proteins: HJV (hemojuvelin), HFE (hemochromatosis protein), and TfR2 (transferrin receptor 2), these proteins do not control the ALK5-mediated hepcidin response to TGF-β1. TGF-β1 mRNA levels are increased in mouse models of iron overload, indicating that TGF-β1 may contribute to hepcidin synthesis under these conditions. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that a complex regulatory network involving TGF-β1 and BMP6 may control the sensing of systemic and/or hepatic iron levels."
https://openalex.org/W2343668821,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an extremely lethal cancer that rapidly metastasizes. Although the molecular attributes of IBC have been described, little is known about the underlying metabolic features of the disease. Using a variety of metabolic assays, including 13C tracer experiments, we found that SUM149 cells, the primary in vitro model of IBC, exhibit metabolic abnormalities that distinguish them from other breast cancer cells, including elevated levels of N-acetylaspartate, a metabolite primarily associated with neuronal disorders and gliomas. Here we provide the first evidence of N-acetylaspartate in breast cancer. We also report that the oncogene RhoC, a driver of metastatic potential, modulates glutamine and N-acetylaspartate metabolism in IBC cells in vitro, revealing a novel role for RhoC as a regulator of tumor cell metabolism that extends beyond its well known role in cytoskeletal rearrangement. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an extremely lethal cancer that rapidly metastasizes.

Using a variety of metabolic assays, including 13C tracer experiments, we found that SUM149 cells, the primary in vitro model of IBC, exhibit metabolic abnormalities that distinguish them from other breast cancer cells, including elevated levels of N-acetylaspartate, a metabolite primarily associated with neuronal disorders and gliomas. Here we provide the first evidence of N-acetylaspartate in breast cancer. We also report that the oncogene RhoC, a driver of metastatic potential, modulates glutamine and N-acetylaspartate metabolism in IBC cells in vitro, revealing a novel role for RhoC as a regulator of tumor cell metabolism that extends beyond its well known role in cytoskeletal rearrangement.

Treat. 2015; 151: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). IBC disproportionally affects both younger women and African American women and is typically characterized by rapid and specific changes in skin appearance, such as peau d'orange, erythema, skin thickening, and rapid enlargement of the affected breast (2Woodward W.A. Cristofanilli M. Inflammatory breast cancer.Semin. Radiat. Oncol. 2009; 19: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Instead of forming solid masses, IBC cells tend to form abundant tumor emboli that have the capacity to rapidly invade the lymphatic system and spread to distant sites. Although the molecular attributes of IBC are well described and are suggestive of constitutive adaptation to hypoxia (3Silvera D. Schneider R.J. Inflammatory breast cancer cells are constitutively adapted to hypoxia.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 3091-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), little is known about the underlying metabolic features of the disease. inflammatory breast cancer tricarboxylic acid α-ketoglutarate N-acetylaspartate glutamine synthetase oxygen consumption rate quantitative RT-PCR pyruvate kinase M2 activity reporter potassium cyanide fructose 1,6-bisphosphate dihydroxyacetone phosphate glyceraldehyde phosphate oxaloacetate mass isotopomer distribution hypoxia-inducible factor N-acetyltransferase N-acetyl-aspartylglutamate isocitrate dehydrogenase glutaminase analysis of variance acetyl-CoA. Metabolic reprogramming is increasingly recognized as a fundamental hallmark of cancer, and efforts to identify clinically viable drugs that target cancer metabolism are underway (4Vander Heiden M.G. Targeting cancer metabolism: a therapeutic window opens.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). It is well established that many tumor cells consume glucose and produce lactate at significantly higher rates than the surrounding tissue, even when sufficient oxygen is present, via a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect (5Gillies R.J. Robey I. Gatenby R.A. Causes and consequences of increased glucose metabolism of cancers.J. Nucl. Med. 2008; 49: 24S-42SCrossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). It was originally hypothesized that cancer cells utilize aerobic glycolysis because of mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction. However, even though a number of mitochondrial defects in tumor cells have been reported, evidence suggests that most tumor cells have functional tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles and electron transport chains (6Ferreira L.M. Cancer metabolism: the Warburg effect today.Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2010; 89: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Vaupel P. Mayer A. Availability, not respiratory capacity governs oxygen consumption of solid tumors.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 44: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to increased glucose uptake, many cancer cells also consume glutamine at higher rates than normal cells, both in culture and in vivo (8Eagle H. Nutrition needs of mammalian cells in tissue culture.Science. 1955; 122: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 9Sauer L.A. Dauchy R.T. Ketone body, glucose, lactic acid, and amino acid utilization by tumors in vivo in fasted rats.Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3497-3503PubMed Google Scholar). The Rho GTPase family of proteins has recently been linked to the regulation of glutaminase activity (10Wang J.B. Erickson J.W. Fuji R. Ramachandran S. Gao P. Dinavahi R. Wilson K.F. Ambrosio A.L.

The oncogene RhoC, a GTPase involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell motility, is a driver of the metastatic phenotype exhibited by IBC (11van Golen K.L. Davies S. Wu Z.F. Wang Y. Bucana C.D. Root H. Chandrasekharappa S. Strawderman M. Ethier S.P. Merajver S.D.

RhoC expression increases with tumor stage, is a robust predictor of breast cancer aggressiveness and survival (13Kleer C.G. Griffith K.A. Sabel M.S. Gallagher G. van Golen K.L. Wu Z.F. Merajver S.D. RhoC-GTPase is a novel tissue biomarker associated with biologically aggressive carcinomas of the breast.Breast Cancer Res.

RhoC GTPase, a novel transforming oncogene for human mammary epithelial cells that partially recapitulates the inflammatory breast cancer phenotype.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a role in breast cancer metastasis, RhoC increases the metastatic potential in lung, melanoma, pancreatic, and bladder cancers (14Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).To better understand the metabolic alterations associated with IBC, we probed the metabolic phenotypes of a set of breast cancer cell lines, including IBC-derived SUM149 cells, which is the primary in vitro model for the study of IBC. Our results indicate that SUM149 cells exhibit a number of metabolic abnormalities that distinguish them from other breast cancer cells, including a near-complete conversion of glucose to lactate, low mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and a large reductive carboxylation flux from glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate (AKG) to citrate under normal culture conditions. We also discovered that RhoC is a potent regulator of both glutamine and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) metabolism in SUM149 cells. Although NAA has long been considered a brain-specific metabolite (18Mehta V. Namboodiri M.A. N-acetylaspartate as an acetyl source in the nervous system.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 31: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it was recently linked to ovarian cancer (19Hascalik S. Celik O. Sarac K. Alkan A. Mizrak B.

Here we provide the first evidence of elevated NAA in breast cancer cells and demonstrate that RhoC modulates NAA levels in IBC cells in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest a number of potential metabolic and molecular vulnerabilities in IBC cells that warrant additional exploration as therapeutic targets. MCF10A cells were maintained in 50:50 DMEM:F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.02 μg/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin. MCF7 cells were maintained in DMEM, and MDA231 cells were maintained in RPMI1640, both supplemented with 10% FBS. SUM149 and SUM149 shRNA cells were maintained in F12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Cells were grown in 5% CO2 except the SUM149 WT and SUM149 shRNA cell lines, which were grown in 10% CO2. For the 13C isotope, extracellular flux, and proliferation assay experiments, all cells were grown in base DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, D5030) lacking glutamine, glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and pyruvate, which was supplemented with the cell line-specific supplements described above and 44 mm sodium bicarbonate as well as glutamine, glucose, and sodium pyruvate as indicated. RhoC (3430), Cdc42 (2466), and citrate synthase (14309) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. RhoA (sc-418), pyruvate carboxylase (sc-67021), GLS1 (sc-100533), GLS2 (sc-168424), and Actin (sc-1616) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and HIF-1α (610958) antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The GS (Invitrogen, PA5–29737) antibody was a gift from Robert W. O’Rourke (University of Michigan). Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (255599) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glucose, lactate, and glutamine concentrations were measured in media using a YSI 2950D biochemistry analyzer. The difference in metabolite concentrations in conditioned cell culture media from concentrations in incubated control medium not exposed to cells (but otherwise treated the same) were normalized to total protein. Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were measured using a Seahorse XF24 flux analyzer and XF Cell Mito stress test kits (Seahorse Bioscience) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells were seeded on 24-well assay plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well, except for MDA231 cells, which were seeded at 80,000 cells/well, and allowed to adhere overnight. Growth medium was replaced with unbuffered, serum-free DMEM supplemented with 11 mm glucose, 2.5 mm glutamine, and 10 mm sodium pyruvate. Stable shRNA cell lines were generated via lentiviral transduction using pGIPZ shRNA clones (GE Healthcare). Following infection, cells were sorted for GFP expression and grown as a population of transduced cells. SUM149 shRhoC pSM2c has been described previously (22Rosenthal D.T. Zhang J. Bao L. Zhu L. Wu Z. Toy K. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. RhoC impacts the metastatic potential and abundance of breast cancer stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e40979Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both SUM149 shRhoC pGIPZ and pSM2c contain the same shRNA sequence. SUM149 shRhoC pSM2c was used for isotope labeling experiments and extracellular flux experiments. SUM149 shRhoC pGIPZ was used for extracellular flux measurements and RT-qPCR. Cells were grown to ∼60–70% confluence in 6-cm dishes in unlabeled growth media. Prior to the start of the experiment, cells were incubated for 1 h in fresh unlabeled DMEM (except where indicated). Cells were changed to fresh DMEM containing 13C-labeled substrate(s). An equivalent number of additional plates of each cell line were grown in parallel in chemically identical media for total protein analysis. After 5 h (unless otherwise indicated), cells were rapidly washed with double-distilled H2O, quenched with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for subsequent LC-MS and GC-MS analysis. Samples were extracted using an organic solvent/water mixture and analyzed by LC-MS as described previously (23Lorenz M.A. Burant C.F. Kennedy R.T. Reducing time and increasing sensitivity in sample preparation for adherent mammalian cell metabolomics.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 3406-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A second portion of the sample extracts was also used for GC-MS analysis as described previously (24Noguchi Y. Young J.D. Aleman J.O. Hansen M.E. Kelleher J.K. Stephanopoulos G. Effect of anaplerotic fluxes and amino acid availability on hepatic lipoapoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33425-33436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reported metabolites were measured by LC-MS, except pyruvate, glutamine, glutamate, and AKG, which were measured by GC-MS. Reported citrate data represent the sum of citrate and isocitrate pools. M0, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M6 reported from LC-MS and GC-MS analysis indicate the presence of 0–6 13C-enriched atoms. For total metabolite pool sizes, the average of the total peak intensities was normalized by total protein. All data were corrected for natural abundance of stable isotopes (25Young J.D. INCA: a computational platform for isotopically non-stationary metabolic flux analysis.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 1333-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez C.A. Des Rosiers C.

Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For steady-state labeling experiments, 5 h was selected as the treatment time after verification that an isotopic steady state was achieved between 4 and 6 h in the cell lines used in this study. RT-qPCR was carried out essentially as described previously (27Chen Y.C. Allen S.G. Ingram P.N. Buckanovich R. Merajver S.D. Yoon E. Single-cell migration chip for chemotaxis-based microfluidic selection of heterogeneous cell populations.Sci. Rep. 2015; 59980Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For preparation of cDNA, total RNA was isolated from the indicated cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out using the reverse transcription system (Promega) following the protocol of the manufacturer. Quantitative PCR analysis employed the following primers (5′ → 3′): ASPA, CCAAGATATCAGCTCTCAGAACC (forward) and TCCCTCAAATATGCGACCAC (reverse); RIMKLA, CTGATGGACGGATGCAGAG (forward) and AGGAGATCAATGCCACAGAAG (reverse); RIMKLB, GAGGCTGAAGTTCTGGAGTTC and TCATGGCGAATAAGATGGCT (reverse); NAT8L, CGAGCAGTACTACATGAAGCC (forward) and AACGTGAGTCCACAGACATC (reverse); RPL22, TGCTCTTGCTCCTTTCGATG (forward) and GAAGATGGAATCATGGATGCTG (reverse); and RPL30, CACCAGTTTTAGCCAACATAGC (forward) and GATCAGACAAGGCAAAGCGA (reverse). qPCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and a Step-One Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate. Ct values were normalized to RPL22 and RPL30. Analysis of three biological replicate experiments was performed using REST 2009 software (Qiagen). Assays that measured the incorporation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) were carried out as described previously (12van Golen K.L. Wu Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D. RhoC GTPase, a novel transforming oncogene for human mammary epithelial cells that partially recapitulates the inflammatory breast cancer phenotype.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the start of the assay, SUM149 WT and shRhoC cells were plated at 6000 and 5000 cells/well, respectively, and grown in normal growth medium for 48 h. At day 0, cells were changed to DMEM containing either 20 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, or both. Medium was replaced at day 3 to replenish glucose and/or glutamine. Three independent experiments consisting of five technical replicates at each time point were performed. Cells were plated on coverslips and mounted in a flow chamber (Warner Instruments) on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a ×60/1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective. The chamber was perfused at 0.3 ml/min, and the temperature was maintained at 33 °C using inline solution and chamber heaters (Warner Instruments). Excitation was provided by a TILL Polychrome V monochromator set to 10% output. Pyruvate kinase M2 activity reporter (PKAR) mCerulean-mCitrine FRET biosensors (28Merrins M.J. Van Dyke A.R. Mapp A.K.

Fluorescence emission was split with a 495LP dichroic mounted in a DV2 beamsplitter (Photometrics) and reported as the ratio of emission through ET535/30m and ET470/24m bandpass filters (R535/470). A 458LP dichroic (Semrock Inc.) was used to measure NADH and NADPH, collectively referred to as NAD(P)H, excited by 365 nm. Emission through an ET470/24m filter (Chroma) was collected with a Photometrics QuantEM:512SC camera at 0.2 Hz. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). When total protein normalization was performed, reported mean ± S.E. values also include propagated uncertainty from total protein measurements. Glucose uptake and lactate production were measured in MCF10A (normal-like mammary epithelial), MCF7 (estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer), MDA-MB-231 (MDA231, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer), and SUM149 (metastatic triple-negative IBC) cells by quantifying changes in glucose and lactate concentrations in cell culture media after a 24-h incubation period (Fig. 1A). The very aggressive MDA231 and SUM149 cells produced the most lactate over this time period. The 24-h lactate conversion ratio (defined as lactate production rate divided by glucose consumption rate) for SUM149 cells was 1.98 ± 0.08 (n = 3) (Fig. 1B), which is nearly identical to the stoichiometric ratio of 2.0 expected when all glucose taken up by a cell is converted to lactate. These data suggest that very little glucose consumed by SUM149 cells undergoes mitochondrial oxidization. We next probed mitochondrial respiratory capacity using a Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer. Although SUM149 cells exhibited the lowest basal and lowest maximal oxygen OCRs among the tested cell lines (Fig. 1C), these cells also used most of their mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Basal OCR as a proportion of maximal OCR was 81.9% ± 12.3% in SUM149 cells. To further probe glycolytic and metabolic capacity, we measured NADH and NADPH, collectively referred to as NAD(P)H, which are spectrally inseparable metabolites that are strongly fluorescent in their reduced forms (29Rocheleau J.V. Head W.S. Piston D.W. Quantitative NAD(P)H/flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging reveals metabolic mechanisms of pancreatic islet pyruvate response.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31780-31787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). NAD(P)H fluorescence provides a readout of the reduction of NAD and NADP generated by glycolysis, the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, and reactions associated with the TCA cycle in the mitochondria. Potassium cyanide (KCN) treatment rapidly blocks mitochondrial oxygen consumption by strongly inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase/complex IV. Glucose-deprived cells were stimulated with 20 mm glucose followed by addition of 5 mm KCN after 12 min. Compared with MCF10A, the NAD(P)H fluorescence in MCF7 and SUM149 increased at a significantly higher rate immediately following stimulation with 20 mm glucose. However, SUM149 cells were least affected immediately following the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration via KCN (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that SUM149 cells rely heavily on non-mitochondrial NAD(P)H production compared with MCF10A or MCF7 cells. The end products of glycolysis are NADH, ATP, and pyruvate. Pyruvate can be further oxidized in mitochondria or converted to lactate in the cytosol. In either case, glucose-derived carbon is first shunted through a rate-limiting glycolytic reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK) that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Studies show that decreased activity of the M2 isoform of PK (PKM2) promotes cellular proliferation during tumorigenesis (30Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E.

Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Pyruvate kinase type M2 and its role in tumor growth and spreading.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The activity of PKM2 is linked to its quaternary structure. The tetrameric forms of all PK isoforms have high catalytic activity, whereas the monomeric and dimeric forms of the M2 isoform have low catalytic activity (33Gao X. Wang H. Yang J.J. Liu X. Liu Z.R. Pyruvate kinase M2 regulates gene transcription by acting as a protein kinase.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 598-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 34Mazurek S. Pyruvate kinase type M2: a key regulator of the metabolic budget system in tumor cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). PKAR biosensors provide a FRET-based readout of the PKM2 tetramer-to-dimer (or monomer) ratio in living cells (28Merrins M.J. Van Dyke A.R. Mapp A.K. Rizzo M.A. Satin L.S. Direct measurements of oscillatory glycolysis in pancreatic islet β-cells using novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors for pyruvate kinase M2 activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33312-33322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PKAR FRET directly correlated with the extent of lactate production observed in the MCF10A, MCF7, and SUM149 cell lines (Fig. 1E). The highest PKAR FRET was observed in SUM149 cells, indicating that these cells exhibited the most PKM2 oligomerization and, therefore, were inferred to have the highest PKM2 activity. This result is consistent with the high lactate conversion ratio observed in SUM149 cells. To directly probe steady-state intracellular metabolic fluxes, cells were cultured in one of two forms of 13C-labeled growth media identified as either M* or M** to indicate the presence of one or two labeled substrates, respectively, for 5 h. Medium formulations contained 2.5 mm [U-13C]glutamine and either 10 mm unlabeled glucose (M*) or 10 mm [1,2-13C]glucose (M**). Under the M** condition, 13C enrichment is expected in the M2 isotopomer of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) because of the presence of [1,2-13C]glucose. The cleavage of FBP (labeled on the first two carbons) into DHAP and glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP) will result in labeling of the second and third carbon positions of DHAP and no labeling in GAP. If DHAP isomerizes to GAP, then the second and third carbons of GAP become labeled. M2 GAP can then give rise to M2 pyruvate, lactate, and acetyl-CoA via downstream metabolic reactions (Fig. 2A). Under the in M* condition, all four cell lines exhibited a small proportion of 13C enrichment in FBP and little to no 13C enrichment in either lactate or pyruvate. Under the M** condition, all four cell lines exhibited non-negligible levels of 13C enrichment in FBP, lactate, and pyruvate (Fig. 2, B–D). The difference between the M2 fraction of acetyl-CoA under the M* and M** conditions was statistically significant in MCF10A, MCF7, and MDA231 cells. In contrast, there was no statistical difference between the M2 fractions in SUM149 cells. These data indicate that the majority of M2 acetyl-CoA was derived from glutamine in SUM149 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Moreover, the total pool sizes of FBP, pyruvate, and lactate were higher in SUM149 compared with the other cell lines, providing further evidence that SUM149 cells are highly glycolytic relative to the other two breast cancer cell lines studied. Given the high rate of glycolysis, low mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and large glutamine to acetyl-CoA flux of SUM149 cells, we wondered whether there was a defect in mitochondrial pyruvate transport. We therefore performed a separate labeling experiment where cells were exposed to medium containing 10 mm [2,3-13C]pyruvate with unlabeled glucose and glutamine. After 1 h, M2 lactate and M2 acetyl-CoA represented 74.3% ± 2.4% and 40.0% ± 3.4% of the total lactate and acetyl-CoA pools, respectively, in SUM149 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), providing evidence that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate is functional in SUM149 cells. However, the SUM149 citrate pool was completely unlabeled and very small (Fig. 3C) compared with the other cell lines during this time period. These data indicate that, despite lack of evidence of impaired mitochondrial pyruvate transport in SUM149 cells, pyruvate is not a primary source of citrate production in these cells. M4 and M6 citrate are expected to form from the condensation of M4 oxaloacetate (OAA) with M0 or M2 acetyl-CoA, respectively, in the presence of [U-13C]glutamine (Fig. 4A). M5 citrate can form from the reductive carboxylation of M5 AKG with unlabeled CO2 (35Poore B. Siegel N. Park J. Hwang B. Afif I. Le A. Rajendram R. Preedy V.R. Patel V.B.

In SUM149 cells, M5 citrate represented 22.6% and 23.3% of the total citrate pool under the M* and M** labeling conditions, respectively.

We recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of GAPDH by δ protein kinase C (δPKC) inhibits this GAPDH-dependent mitochondrial elimination. δPKC phosphorylation of GAPDH correlates with increased cell injury following oxidative stress, suggesting that inhibiting GAPDH phosphorylation should decrease cell injury. Using rational design, we identified pseudo-GAPDH (ψGAPDH) peptide, an inhibitor of δPKC-mediated GAPDH phosphorylation that does not inhibit the phosphorylation of other δPKC substrates. Unexpectedly, ψGAPDH decreased mitochondrial elimination and increased cardiac damage in an animal model of heart attack. Either treatment with ψGAPDH or direct phosphorylation of GAPDH by δPKC decreased GAPDH tetramerization, which corresponded to reduced GAPDH glycolytic activity in vitro and ex vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2344848937,"Viral infection or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induces expression of a large array of genes, the products of which play a critical role in host antipathogen immunity and inflammation. We have previously reported that the expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) is significantly up-regulated after viral infection or LPS treatment, and this is essential for innate immune signaling. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear. In this study, we found that viral infection-induced up-regulation of Usp25 is diminished in cells lacking interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) or interferon α receptor 1 (IFNAR1) but not p65. Sendai virus- or type I interferon-induced up-regulation of Usp25 requires de novo protein synthesis of IRF7. Furthermore, IRF7 directly binds to the two conserved IRF binding sites on the USP25 promoter to drive transcription of Usp25, and mutation of these two sites abolished Sendai virus-induced IRF7-mediated activation of the USP25 promoter. Our study has uncovered a previously unknown mechanism by which viral infection or LPS induces up-regulation of USP25."

At the cellular level, this event is tightly regulated by UBE2C, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that donates ubiquitin to the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. This, in turn, facilitates anaphase-onset by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of mitotic substrates. UBE2C is an important marker of chromosomal instability and has been associated with malignant growth. However, the mechanism of its regulation is largely unexplored. In this study, we report that UBE2C is transcriptionally activated by the gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53, although it is transcriptionally repressed by wild-type p53. We showed that wild-type p53-mediated inhibition of UBE2C is p21-E2F4-dependent and GOF mutant p53-mediated transactivation of UBE2C is NF-Y-dependent. We further explored that DNA damage-induced wild-type p53 leads to spindle assembly checkpoint arrest by repressing UBE2C, whereas mutant p53 causes premature anaphase exit by increasing UBE2C expression in the presence of 5-fluorouracil.

Therefore, it ensures the fidelity of the cell division as well as protects the cell from cancerous growth. Wild-type p53 gets activated and stabilized in response to a variety of stresses that in turn regulates the transcription of various genes involved in cell growth and survival (2.Vousden K.H.

TP53 gene is mutated in almost half of the human cancers. These are mostly missense mutations in the TP53 gene leading to either DNA contact-defective or conformation-defective p53 mutants. These mutated forms of p53 are highly stable and expressed in human cancers (12.Weisz L. Oren M. Rotter V. Transcription regulation by mutant p53.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2202-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Extensive investigations have established that mutant p53 can contribute to malignancy by providing selective growth advantage to cancer cells and resistance to anticancer therapy (13.Blandino G.

Med. 1996; 2: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The growing description of biochemical and biological functions of mutant p53 shows that it not only loses the tumor-suppressive functions of its wild-type counterpart but also acquires novel oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) properties (12.Weisz L. Oren M. Rotter V. Transcription regulation by mutant p53.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2202-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that mutant p53 interacts with the CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y, and this complex serves to up-regulate NF-Y target genes such as CCNA, CCNB, CDK1, CDC25C, and EFNB2 to promote cell cycle progression and chemoresistance following drug treatment (4.Di Agostino S.

Surprisingly, wild-type p53 has been shown to interact with the same transcription factor NF-Y (16.Imbriano C. Gurtner A. Cocchiarella F. Di Agostino S. Basile V. Gostissa M. Dobbelstein M. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Direct p53 transcriptional repression: in vivo analysis of CCAAT-containing G2/M promoters.Mol. Cell.

However, the regulation of wild-type p53 is often exactly reciprocal to that mediated by GOF mutant p53 (4.Di Agostino S. Strano S. Emiliozzi V. Zerbini V. Mottolese M. Sacchi A. Blandino G.

It has been shown that in response to DNA damage, wild-type p53 and mutant p53 recruit different cofactors, mainly epigenetic modifiers to regulate differentially (4.Di Agostino S. Strano S.

Anaphase initiation is regulated by antagonistic ubiquitination and deubiquitination activities.Nature. 2007; 446: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Central to the checkpoint control is the ubiquitin pathway consisting of an E3 ligase, the APC/C, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2C, and their mitotic substrates securin and cyclin-B1 (23.Yu H.

Biol. 1996; 6: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). APC/C brings about mitotic exit by initiating anaphase onset through the proteolysis of these substrates by binding to an adaptor protein, Cdc20. This association is fostered by UBE2C, which ubiquitinates Cdc20 to facilitate its binding to APC/C leading to activation of the latter (24.Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W. Ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation.Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).

In this study, we examine the dichotomy between wild-type and mutant p53 in relation to the newly uncovered p53 target UBE2C. We started by confirming that UBE2C is a bona fide target of wild-type and mutant p53 and that they control its expression in an opposite manner. We worked out the mechanistic details of the regulation. Furthermore, we also show wild-type p53 causes SAC arrest in response to DNA damage, whereas mutant p53 activates the SAC prematurely.

Pancreatic cancer cell line MIAPaCa2 was a kind gift from Prof. Chitra Mandal (CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India). HCT116p53+/+, SW480, C33A, MIAPaCa2, and HepG2 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), and HCT116p53−/−, Saos-2, SKBR3, and HCT116p21−/− were maintained in McCoy's 5A modified medium (Gibco). All the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v) (Gibco) and antibiotics (Gibco). Different deletion constructs of the UBE2C promoter containing the −693/+39, −321/+39, or −141/+39-bp fragments across the transcription start site were prepared as described previously (34.Nath S.

Scrambled siRNA was purchased from Ambion. pGIPZ lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for human TP53 and non-silencing control were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL) and were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. SW480 cells were infected with lentiviral shRNA, and stable cells were selected for the experiments after puromycin (Gibco) selection. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, etoposide, anacardic acid, and proteasomal inhibitor MG115 were purchased from Sigma. Thymidine and Nocodazole were purchased from United States Biologicals (USB, Cleveland, OH). Transient transfections using various expression plasmids and reporter constructs were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cells were harvested after 48 or 72 h. The total amount of DNA was held constant for all the transfection experiments using corresponding empty vectors. All the transfections were performed at least three times with independent plasmid preparations. Total RNA was isolated from different cell lines using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Five micrograms of total RNA was treated with DNase-I (Promega, Madison, WI) in a total of 10 μl of reaction volume. 2 μl of this mixture was used for cDNA preparation using random hexamer (Invitrogen) and Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (Promega). For semi-quantitative analysis, the cDNA was then PCR-amplified using the following primer sets: p53, forward 5′-CCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCG-3′ and reverse 5′-AATCATCCATTGCTTGGGACG-3′; UBE2C, forward 5′-TGGTCTGCCCTGTATGATGT-3′ and reverse 5′-AAAAGCTGTGGGGTTTTTCC-3′; and GAPDH, forward 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGT-3′. Real time PCR was performed on the 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with the same primers for UBE2C and GAPDH as mentioned above. The comparative threshold cycle method (ΔΔCt) was used to quantify the relative amount of UBE2C transcripts at different times of 5-FU treatment with respect to the untreated cells. GAPDH was used as an endogenous control. Western blotting analysis was carried out as described previously (35.Mondal G. Sengupta S. Panda C.K. Gollin S.M. Saunders W.S. Roychoudhury S.

The following antibodies were used in this study and were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue number, lot number, and the dilution used): mouse anti-p53 (sc-126, lot no. J1810, 1:100); goat anti-UBE2C (sc-47545, lot no. A0412, 1:100); rabbit anti-p21 (sc-397, lot no. F0608, 1:100); rabbit anti-E2F4 (sc-1082, lot no. C2411, 1:100); mouse anti-cyclin-B1 (sc-7393, lot no. D1813, 1:200), and rabbit anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (S10) (sc-8656-R, lot no. A2113, 1:200). Rabbit anti-acetyl-p53 (K382) (2525, lot no. 10, 1:1000) and rabbit anti-histone H3 (4499, lot no. 3, 1:1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse anti-β-actin (A2228, lot no. 112M4762V, 1:5000) was obtained from Sigma. Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit (A0545, lot no. 022M4811, 1:80.000) or rabbit anti-mouse (A9044, lot no. 112M4816, 1:40,000) or rabbit anti-goat (A5420, lot no. 052M4752, 1:80,000) secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), using West Pico chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific). After transfection and/or treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in the luciferase cell culture lysis buffer provided with the luciferase assay kit (Promega). Lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured as per the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured as relative light units, twice for each lysate using a GLOMAX luminometer (Promega). The total protein concentration in each lysate was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and subsequently used to normalize the luciferase activity. Each assay was done in duplicate and repeated three times. Fold changes were represented as the mean of three experiments. Fold activation or repression indicates the increase or decline in reporter activity following transfection or drug treatment, respectively. ChIP assay was done using the QuickChIP kit from Imgenex Corp. (Bhubaneshwar, India) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification from the immunoprecipitated chromatin was done using primers that were designed from endogenous UBE2C promoter. The sequences are forward 5′- CAGTGGGTAGGTCTAGCAGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCAGAGAGACAGGAACTCG-3′. For transient ChIP assay, checking recruitment of E2F4 on the CHR site in the exogenous UBE2C promoter, the following primers were used: UBE2C_TC_F, 5′-GTCTCATTGGCTGGATCA-3′, and UBE2C_TC_R, 5′-GTGGCTTTACCAACAGTACC-3′. The forward primer was taken from a region upstream of the CHR site in the exogenous UBE2C promoter, and the reverse primer was taken from the pGL3 vector backbone downstream of the CHR site. The following antibodies used for chromatin immunoprecipitation study (catalogue number and the dilution used) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: rabbit anti-p53 (sc-6243, 1:20); rabbit anti-E2F4 (sc-1082, 1:20); rabbit anti-NF-YA (sc-10779, 1:20); rabbit anti-NF-YB (sc-13045, 1:20); rabbit anti-RNA polymerase II (sc-899, 1:20); and rabbit anti-p300 (sc-584, 1:20). Rabbit anti-acetylated histone H3 (K9) (9649, 1:100) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. IgG from rabbit serum (I5006, 1:100) was purchased from Sigma and used as a negative control. Cells under the different treatment conditions were harvested and fixed in cold 70% ethanol. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) in the presence of RNase A (1 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) by incubating in the dark for 30 min. Propidium iodide-stained cells were then analyzed by FACSARIA III (BD Biosciences), and the percentage of cells in different stages of the cell cycle was determined. To determine CHR activity, HCT116p53−/− cells were either transfected with pUBE2C-Luc (−141/+39) or pUBE2C-Luc (−141/+39) CHR mutant constructs. These cells were then incubated for 5 h before replacing transfection medium with DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were cultured for 24 h in this medium. For cell cycle analyses, cells were then starved in DMEM with 0.2% FCS for 60 h. Following this, the cells were harvested at 0-h time points. To analyze cells during their passage through the cell cycle, the remaining cells were stimulated with 20% FCS in DMEM for the given times. Cell lysates were prepared to perform luciferase assays as described previously (21.Banerjee T. Nath S. Roychoudhury S. DNA damage-induced p53 downregulates Cdc20 by direct binding to its promoter causing chromatin remodeling.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2688-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effect of wild-type p53 upon SAC was studied on G1/S-synchronized HCT116p53+/+ cells that were allowed to progress through the cell cycle. To this end, cells were treated with thymidine (2.5 mm) for 16 h. After releasing the cells from the first thymidine block for around 8 h, thymidine was added again for an additional 22 h. Cells from the second thymidine block were released in fresh media, and etoposide (20 μm) was added after release from the second thymidine block at 6 h when most cells reach the G2/M boundary. Cells were either harvested for Western blotting experiment or fixed for microscopic observation. To investigate the role of mutant p53 on SAC, we synchronized SW480 cells as described previously with the following modifications. First, the gap between two thymidine treatments was for 10 h. Second, the last thymidine was released in fresh media containing nocodazole (50 ng/μl). 5-FU (10 μg/ml) was added after release from the second thymidine block at 6 h. Cells were either harvested for Western blotting experiments or fixed for microscopic observation. Synchronized HCT116p53+/+ and SW480 cells were harvested at different time points (as mentioned) after the second thymidine release. Cells were then fixed with ice-cold acetomethanol (1:1) and permeabilized with 0.03% saponin (Calbiochem). After blocking in 3% BSA (USB), rabbit anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (S10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8656-R) was added. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2012) secondary antibody was added, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM 3000). Synchronized SW480 or HCT116p53+/+ cells were harvested at different time points (as mentioned in respective cases) after a second thymidine release. Cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM 3000). Frequencies of mitotic cells were counted among 100–200 cells each time. Mitotic index (MI) was calculated as a percentage of the ratio between p-H3-positive cells and DAPI-positive cells. MI was represented as a mean of three independent experiments. Synchronized SW480 cells were harvested at 10 h after the second thymidine release. Cells were then examined under a super-resolution confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8). Abnormal chromosomes were counted among 40–50 cells each time from three independent experiments and plotted as percentage of mitotic cells with chromosomal abnormalities.

It also interacts with estrogen receptor α to inhibit cell proliferation and regulate pubertal mammary gland development in mice. In the present study, we examined whether and how Zfhx3 regulates lactogenic differentiation in mouse mammary glands. At different stages of mammary gland development, Zfhx3 protein was expressed at varying levels, with the highest level at lactation. In the HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell line, an in vitro model of lactogenesis, knockdown of Zfhx3 attenuated prolactin-induced β-casein expression and morphological changes, indicators of lactogenic differentiation. In mouse mammary tissue, knock-out of Zfhx3 interrupted lactogenesis, resulting in underdeveloped glands with much smaller and fewer alveoli, reduced β-casein expression, accumulation of large cytoplasmic lipid droplets in luminal cells after parturition, and failure in lactation. Mechanistically, Zfhx3 maintained the expression of Prlr (prolactin receptor) and Prlr-Jak2-Stat5 signaling activity, whereas knockdown and knock-out of Zfhx3 in HC11 cells and mammary tissues, respectively, decreased Prlr expression, Stat5 phosphorylation, and the expression of Prlr-Jak2-Stat5 target genes. These findings indicate that Zfhx3 plays an essential role in proper lactogenic development in mammary glands, at least in part by maintaining Prlr expression and Prlr-Jak2-Stat5 signaling activity.

Development of the mammary gland occurs in connection with sexual development and reproduction and is regulated by multiple hormones (e.g. estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin) and growth factors (EGF, FGF, insulin-like growth factor, etc.). It can be divided into six distinct stages: embryonic, prepubertal, pubertal (the linear phase), pregnancy, lactation, and involution (the cyclic phase) (1Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Signaling pathways in mammary gland development.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Information networks in the mammary gland.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Unlike most other organs, 5 of the 6 stages of mammary gland development occur postnatally, providing an ideal model for studying genes in both normal development and neoplastic progression. Mammary glands retain plasticity for undergoing the cyclic phase, which implies the existence of specific molecules that are able to integrate a variety of signals from hormones and growth factors. For example, the STAT genes have been demonstrated to play roles in both hormone response and growth factor signaling (3Silva C.M. Shupnik M.A. Integration of steroid and growth factor pathways in breast cancer: focus on signal transducers and activators of transcription and their potential role in resistance.Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At present, a few factors have been identified and characterized for their roles in mammary gland development in response to hormonal signaling, but many more remain to be discovered (4Brisken C. O'Malley B. Hormone action in the mammary gland.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2a003178Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 5Hynes N.E. Watson C.J. Mammary gland growth factors: roles in normal development and in cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2a003186Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The homeobox gene family contains the homeobox sequence that encodes for the homeodomain, a DNA-binding domain about 60 amino acids long. More than 200 homeodomain-containing proteins have been identified and characterized in a variety of species, most of which act as transcription factors in a wide range of critical activities during normal development and tumorigenesis (6Abate-Shen C. Deregulated homeobox gene expression in cancer: cause or consequence?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Several homeobox genes are expressed in mammary epithelial cells, and their functions as regulators of mammary gland development have been established using genetically modified mice (7Duverger O.

Homeobox genes in mammary gland development and neoplasia.Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For example, loss of Msx2, Hoxc6, Hoxa9, and Pax2 in the mammary gland leads to a series of defects during mammary gland development, including failures in side branching and lobulo-alveolar development (8Lewis M.T.

Zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3), also named ATBF1 for AT motif binding factor 1, is a large transcription factor with 23 zinc finger and 4 homeodomains (10Morinaga T. Yasuda H. Hashimoto T.

Classification and nomenclature of all human homeobox genes.BMC Biol. 2007; 5: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the existence of 4 homeoboxes in ZFHX3 suggests that it has a dynamic function in biological processes (13Yasuda H.

In addition, both estrogen and progesterone, two hormones essential for normal mammary gland development, induce or enhance the transcription of ZFHX3 in human and mouse mammary epithelial cells (21Dong X.Y.

In this study, we examined whether and how Zfhx3 regulates lactogenic development in the mammary gland using both a cell culture model and mouse model. In the HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell line, where prolactin induces morphological and molecular changes indicative of lactogenic differentiation, knockdown of Zfhx3 expression attenuated the effect of prolactin. Consistently, deletion of Zfhx3 in mouse mammary glands prevented proper alveologenesis and lactogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, the effect of Zfhx3 was mediated at least in part by regulating the Prlr-Jak2-Stat5 signaling axis. Wild type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Beijing, China), and breeding was carried out following standard procedures for the collection of mammary tissues at different developmental stages. Breeding, genotyping, and preparation of mice with MMTV-Cre-mediated mammary-specific knock-out of Zfhx3 were previously described (20Li M. Fu X. Ma G. Sun X. Dong X. Nagy T. Xing C. Li J. Dong J.T. Atbf1 regulates pubertal mammary gland development likely by inhibiting the pro-proliferative function of estrogen-ER signaling.PLoS One. 2012; 7e51283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All mice were fed with pathogen-free food and water and were closely monitored and humanely euthanized. At least four mice were used for each genotype at a time point for different analyses, including whole mount analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and real time PCR. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at College of Life Sciences of Nankai University. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T and human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and T-47D were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For prolactin treatment, T-47D cells were first incubated in serum-free medium overnight and then treated with 500 ng/ml recombinant human prolactin (R&D Systems) for indicated times. Mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin (Roche), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, R&D). To induce cell differentiation, HC11 cells were grown to confluence, incubated in medium deprived of EGF for 24 h, and then treated for 5 days with a combination of lactogenic hormones including 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 5 μg/ml insulin, and 5 μg/ml recombinant mouse prolactin (R&D), referred to as DIP. 2The abbreviations used are: DIPdexamethasone, insulin, and prolactinH&Ehematoxylin and eosinIHCimmunohistochemicalPRLRprolactin receptor.

Lentiviral particles were produced in 293T cells by cotransfecting pLKO.1 with pMD2.G and psPAX2 plasmids using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Promega, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On the day after transfection, the medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 days before viral supernatant was collected. Human T-47D or mouse HC11 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and grown to ∼70% confluency, at which time the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma), and 1 ml of lentiviral solution was added dropwise. 6–12 h after viral infection, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium again, and on the following day 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) was added to the medium for 3–5 days to select cells stably expressing shRNAs. RNA was extracted, and protein lysate was prepared for analysis. Cells stably expressing the desired shRNAs were maintained in medium containing 1 μg/ml of puromycin.TABLE 1Sequences of shRNAs against mouse Zfhx3/human ZFHX3 in Sigma PLKO.1 vectorNameSequenceSigma IDshZfhx3-8CCGGGCCAGGAAGAATTACGAGAATCTCGAGATTCTCGTAATTCTTCCTGGCTTTTTGTRCN0000075408shZfhx3-9CCGGCCCGGACAATAAGCCGTTTAACTCGAGTTAAACGGCTTATTGTCCGGGTTTTTGTRCN0000075409shZfhx3-11CCGGCCGGAAGAAGTTAGCGGATATCTCGAGATATCCGCTAACTTCTTCCGGTTTTTGTRCN0000075411shZfhx3-12CCGGGCCATGCTCTTAGACTGTGATCTCGAGATCACAGTCTAAGAGCATGGCTTTTTGTRCN0000075412shZFHX3-2CCGGGCGATGCTCTTAGACTGTGATCTCGAGATCACAGTCTAAGAGCATCGCTTTTTTRCN0000013561shZFHX3-3CCGGGCCAGGAAGAATTATGAGAATCTCGAGATTCTCATAATTCTTCCTGGCTTTTTTRCN0000013558shZFHX3-5CCGGCCCTTTAGTTTCCACAGCTAACTCGAGTTAGCTGTGGAAACTAAAGGGTTTTTTRCN0000013560 Open table in a new tab Total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase system (Promega).

Briefly, the fourth abdominal mammary gland on the left was dissected at lactation day 2, placed between two glass slides and spread by placing weights on top of the slide for 10 min, followed by fixing in 3.7% formalin overnight. Tissues were hydrated, stained with carmine alum, and cleared with xylene. For histological analysis, formalin-fixed tissues were processed for sectioning, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Immunohistochemical staining was performed on sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Briefly, tissue sections were first deparaffinized and rehydrated following standard procedure. Antigen retrieval was carried out by heating in sodium citrate buffer or Tris-EDTA buffer using a pressure cooker for 3 min at full pressure. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °;C overnight and then with the HRP solution and the DAB-chromogen. All sections were counterstained in hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and covered with a coverslip with Eukitt quick-hardening mounting medium (Sigma). Antibodies, dilution factors, and antigen retrieval buffers are listed in Table 3. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). A two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine statistical differences between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance was used to compare three or more groups. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We previously measured Zfhx3 mRNA expression at different stages of mammary gland development and found that the Zfhx3 mRNA level varies at different stages, being the highest in late pregnancy and lactation (20Li M. Fu X. Ma G. Sun X. Dong X. Nagy T. Xing C. Li J. Dong J.T. Atbf1 regulates pubertal mammary gland development likely by inhibiting the pro-proliferative function of estrogen-ER signaling.PLoS One. 2012; 7e51283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we determined Zfhx3 protein expression. Mammary glands were collected from mice at postnatal weeks 3, 6, and 9; pregnancy days 2 and 18; lactation days 1, 7, 14, and 20; and involution day 7. Western blotting demonstrated that the Zfhx3 protein level increased from weeks 3 to 9 after birth, further increased to an intermediate level during pregnancy, increased to and maintained a maximum level during lactation, and then dramatically reduced during involution (Fig. 1A). Even during lactation, the Zfhx3 protein level kept increasing, being higher at days 14 and 20 than at days 1 and 7 (Fig. 1A). This pattern of expression is almost identical to that for Zfhx3 mRNA expression (20Li M. Fu X. Ma G. Sun X. Dong X. Nagy T. Xing C. Li J. Dong J.T. Atbf1 regulates pubertal mammary gland development likely by inhibiting the pro-proliferative function of estrogen-ER signaling.PLoS One. 2012; 7e51283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also performed IHC staining to detect Zfhx3 protein in the mammary gland at each developmental stage (Fig. 1B). We observed that Zfhx3 was expressed in both the epithelial cells and some types of stromal cells and was mainly localized in the nucleus. In a typical terminal end bud structure at postnatal week 3 (prepuberty) mammary gland, we could see two morphologically distinct cell types: the single-layered cap cells (outer layer, giving rise to basal cells) and multiple-layered body cells (centrally located, giving rise to luminal cells) (2Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Information networks in the mammary gland.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We observed that a significant portion of body cells in the terminal end bud were Zfhx3-negative (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1). During the pubertal and the early pregnancy stages when ductal morphogenesis occurs, we observed that some of the ductal luminal cells were also Zfhx3-negative (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1), but in contrast nearly all the mature alveolar luminal cells (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 1) from the late pregnancy stage to the lactation stage were Zfhx3-positive, and at day 7 of involution Zfhx3 expression dramatically decreased. This pattern of expression strongly suggests that Zfhx3 may play a role"
https://openalex.org/W2409393070,"Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3) senses double-stranded RNA intermediates produced during hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, leading to activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) and NF-κB and subsequent antiviral and proinflammatory responses. Yet, how this TLR3-dependent pathway operates in hepatocytes is unclear. Upon fractionating cultured hepatocytes into various cellular organelles, we observed that TLR3 predominantly resides in endolysosomes of hepatocytes. To determine the critical regulators of TLR3 signaling in response to HCV infection in human hepatocytes, we isolated endolysosome fractions from mock-infected and HCV-infected hepatoma Huh7.5 cells that had been reconstituted for TLR3 expression, separated these fractions on two-dimensional gels, and identified up-regulated/down-regulated proteins by mass spectrometry. Approximately a dozen of cellular proteins were found to be differentially expressed in endolysosome fractions following HCV infection. Of these, expression of several molecular chaperone proteins was elevated. Knockdown of one of these chaperones, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), compromised TLR3-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes and chemokines following HCV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation in cultured hepatocytes. Consistent with this finding, GRP78 depletion impaired TLR3-mediated establishment of an antiviral state. Mechanistically, although TLR3 trafficking to endolysosomes was not affected, phosphorylated IRF3 diminished faster following GRP78 knockdown. Remarkably, GRP78 transcript was significantly up-regulated in liver biopsies of chronic hepatitis C patients as compared with normal liver tissues. Moreover, the GRP78 expression level correlated with that of RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) and CXCL10, two inflammatory chemokines most frequently elevated in HCV-infected liver. Altogether, our data suggest that GRP78 contributes to TLR3-mediated, IRF3-dependent innate immune response to HCV in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2340080189,"Damage to the CNS can cause a differential spatio-temporal release of multiple factors, such as nucleotides, ATP and UTP. The latter interact with neuronal and glial nucleotide receptors. The P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R) has gained prominence as a modulator of gliotic responses after CNS injury. Still, the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses in glia are not fully understood. Membrane-raft microdomains, such as caveolae, and their constituent caveolins, modulate receptor signaling in astrocytes; yet, their role in P2Y2R signaling has not been adequately explored. Hence, this study evaluated the role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in modulating P2Y2R subcellular distribution and signaling in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. Recombinant hP2Y2R expressed in 1321N1 cells and Cav-1 were found to co-fractionate in light-density membrane-raft fractions, co-localize via confocal microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitate. Raft localization was dependent on ATP stimulation and Cav-1 expression. This hP2Y2R/Cav-1 distribution and interaction was confirmed with various cell model systems differing in the expression of both P2Y2R and Cav-1, and shRNA knockdown of Cav-1 expression. Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of Cav-1 expression decreased nucleotide-induced increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in 1321N1 and C6 glioma cells without altering TRAP-6 and carbachol Ca2+ responses. In addition, Cav-1 shRNA knockdown also decreased AKT phosphorylation and altered the kinetics of ERK1/2 activation in 1321N1 cells. Our findings strongly suggest that P2Y2R interaction with Cav-1 in membrane-raft caveolae of 1321N1 cells modulates receptor coupling to its downstream signaling machinery. Thus, P2Y2R/Cav-1 interactions represent a novel target for controlling P2Y2R function after CNS injury.

https://openalex.org/W2344824571,"Among the toxic polypeptides secreted in the venom of sea anemones, actinoporins are the pore-forming toxins whose toxic activity relies on the formation of oligomeric pores within biological membranes. Intriguingly, actinoporins appear as multigene families that give rise to many protein isoforms in the same individual displaying high sequence identities but large functional differences. However, the evolutionary advantage of producing such similar isotoxins is not fully understood. Here, using sticholysins I and II (StnI and StnII) from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, it is shown that actinoporin isoforms can potentiate each other's activity. Through hemolysis and calcein releasing assays, it is revealed that mixtures of StnI and StnII are more lytic than equivalent preparations of the corresponding isolated isoforms. It is then proposed that this synergy is due to the assembly of heteropores because (i) StnI and StnII can be chemically cross-linked at the membrane and (ii) the affinity of sticholysin mixtures for the membrane is increased with respect to any of them acting in isolation, as revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. These results help us understand the multigene nature of actinoporins and may be extended to other families of toxins that require oligomerization to exert toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2337207106,"The decoding of histone post-translational modifications by chromatin-binding modules (readers) constitutes one major mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Nuclear antigen Sp100 (SPECKLED, 100 kDa), a constitutive component of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, plays key roles in intrinsic immunity and transcriptional repression. Sp100C, a splicing isoform specifically up-regulated upon interferon stimulation, harbors a unique tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) finger and bromodomain at its C terminus. Combining structural, quantitative binding, and cellular co-localization studies, we characterized Sp100C PHD finger as an unmethylated histone H3 Lys(4) (H3K4me0) reader that tolerates histone H3 Thr(3) phosphorylation (H3T3ph), histone H3 Lys(9) trimethylation (H3K9me3), and histone H3 Ser(10) phosphorylation (H3S10ph), hallmarks associated with the mitotic chromosome. In contrast, whereas H3K4me0 reader activity is conserved in Sp140, an Sp100C paralog, the multivalent tolerance of H3T3ph, H3K9me3, and H3S10ph was lost for Sp140. The complex structure determined at 2.1 A revealed a highly coordinated lysine ϵ-amine recognition sphere formed by an extended N-terminal motif for H3K4me0 readout. Interestingly, reader pocket rigidification by disulfide bond formation enhanced H3K4me0 binding by Sp100C. An additional complex structure solved at 2.7 A revealed that H3T3ph is recognized by the arginine residue, Arg(713), that is unique to the PHD finger of Sp100C. Consistent with a restrictive cellular role of Sp100C, these results establish a direct chromatin targeting function of Sp100C that may regulate transcriptional gene silencing and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body-mediated intrinsic immunity in response to interferon stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2342567625,"Fish remain nearly the same shape as they grow, but there are two different modes of bone growth. Bones in the tail fin (fin ray segments) are added distally at the tips of the fins and do not elongate once produced. On the other hand, vertebrae enlarge in proportion to body growth. To elucidate how bone growth is controlled, we investigated a zebrafish mutant, steopsel (stp(tl28d)). Vertebrae of stp(tl28d) (/+) fish look normal in larvae (∼30 days) but are distinctly shorter (59-81%) than vertebrae of wild type fish in adults. In contrast, the lengths of fin rays are only slightly shorter (∼95%) than those of the wild type in both larvae and adults. Positional cloning revealed that stp encodes Connexin43 (Cx43), a connexin that functions as a gap junction and hemichannel. Interestingly, cx43 was also identified as the gene causing the short-of-fin (sof) phenotype, in which the fin ray segments are shorter but the vertebrae are normal. To identify the cause of this difference between the alleles, we expressed Cx43 exogenously in Xenopus oocytes and performed electrophysiological analysis of the mutant proteins. Gap junction coupling induced by Cx43(stp) or Cx43(sof) was reduced compared with Cx43-WT. On the other hand, only Cx43(stp) induced abnormally high (50× wild type) transmembrane currents through hemichannels. Our results suggest that Cx43 plays critical and diverse roles in zebrafish bone growth."
https://openalex.org/W2343147883,"Heterozygous mutations of the human PHOX2B gene, a key regulator of autonomic nervous system development, lead to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a failure in the autonomic control of breathing. Polyalanine expansions in the 20-residues region of the C terminus of PHOX2B are the major mutations responsible for CCHS. Elongation of the alanine stretch in PHOX2B leads to a protein with altered DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and nuclear localization and the possible formation of cytoplasmic aggregates; furthermore, the findings of various studies support the idea that CCHS is not due to a pure loss of function mechanism but also involves a dominant negative effect and/or toxic gain of function for PHOX2B mutations. Because PHOX2B forms homodimers and heterodimers with its paralogue PHOX2A in vitro, we tested the hypothesis that the dominant negative effects of the mutated proteins are due to non-functional interactions with the wild-type protein or PHOX2A using a co-immunoprecipitation assay and the mammalian two-hybrid system. Our findings show that PHOX2B forms homodimers and heterodimerizes weakly with mutated proteins, exclude the direct involvement of the polyalanine tract in dimer formation, and indicate that mutated proteins retain partial ability to form heterodimers with PHOX2A. Moreover, in this study, we investigated the effects of the longest polyalanine expansions on the homeodomain-mediated nuclear import, and our data clearly show that the expanded C terminus interferes with this process. These results provide novel insights into the effects of the alanine tract expansion on PHOX2B folding and activity."

However, no structural study has been reported to support this Chk1 activation model. Here we used FRET and bimolecular fluorescence complementary techniques to show that Chk1 indeed maintains a closed conformation in the absence of DNA damage through an intramolecular interaction between a region (residues 31–87) at the N-terminal kinase domain and the distal C terminus. A highly conserved Leu-449 at the C terminus is important for this intramolecular interaction. We further showed that abolishing the intramolecular interaction by a Leu-449 to Arg mutation or inducing ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation by DNA damage disrupts the closed conformation, leading to an open and activated conformation of Chk1.

The kinase domain of human Chk1, which lacks the C-terminal half, including the two ATR sites, displayed much stronger catalytic activity than the full-length protein in vitro (7Chen P. Luo C.

In addition, recent studies suggest that Ser-317 phosphorylation is required for phosphorylation at Ser-345 and that maximal phosphorylation at Ser-345 is essential for the full-scale checkpoint activation (6Capasso H.

Further, mutating conserved residues in the kinase-associating domain located at the C terminus of Chk1 results in Chk1 activation without ATR-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-317 or Ser-345 (19Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Activation of Xenopus Chk1 by mutagenesis of threonine-377.FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Pereira E. Chen Y. Sanchez Y.

Rep. 2015; 5: 10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings imply that ATR-dependent phosphorylation may just function as a trigger to disrupt the closed conformation of Chk1 so that the catalytic site is exposed to downstream substrates (Fig. 1A). Although this conformational change model of Chk1 is compelling, several studies have challenged its validity. First, yeast two-hybrid screening failed to detect a direct interaction between the N and C termini of Schizosaccharomyces pombe or Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chk1 (22Kosoy A. Calonge T.M. Outwin E.A.

Second, although the conformational change model indicates a negative role of the C-terminal regulatory domain in Chk1 activation, studies from S. pombe suggest that the C terminus also positively regulates its activation (24Kosoy A. O'Connell M.J. Regulation of Chk1 by its C-terminal domain.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Third, a recent report suggested an intermolecular but not an intramolecular interaction of human Chk1, which is achieved through the interaction between a short splicing variant of Chk1 and full-length Chk1 (25Pabla N. Bhatt K. Dong Z. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)-short is a splice variant and endogenous inhibitor of Chk1 that regulates cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoints.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These conflicting findings suggest that a thorough investigation of the Chk1 activation mechanism is needed. We reasoned that the best way to resolve this issue is to study the structural properties of the Chk1 full-length protein. In this study, we used both FRET and BiFC, two widely used techniques that are powerful in delineating protein conformational changes, to examine the Chk1 full-length protein conformation both under normal growth conditions and during DNA damage. Our results confirmed the intramolecular interaction between the N and C termini and a closed conformation of Chk1 under normal growth conditions. We also found that Chk1 does not form an intermolecular complex. We further established that DNA damage or disrupting the intramolecular interaction opens the conformation of Chk1, consistent with its activation during the DDR. HEK293T and U2-OS cells, obtained from the ATCC and tested for contamination, were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY). Cells were transfected with X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent (Sigma) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. For FRET analysis, we used mTurquoise and SYFP2, the modified versions of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and YFP, respectively. SYFP2 and mTurquoise have enhanced brightness and quantum yields and thus are more suitable for FRET than the regular CFP and YFP (26Goedhart J. van Weeren L. Adjobo-Hermans M.J. Elzenaar I. Hink M.A. Gadella Jr., T.W. Quantitative co-expression of proteins at the single cell level: application to a multimeric FRET sensor.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e27321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, for the purpose of clarity, these are referred to as CFP and YFP in this study. In brief, CFP was engineered at the N terminus of Chk1, and YFP was engineered to the C terminus of the same construct. A linker of two to four Gly residues was added between Chk1 and either CFP or YFP to provide flexibility to these fluorescent proteins. Two steps were used to generate the FRET construct CFP-Chk1-YFP. First, human Chk1 (WT or the L449R mutant) was amplified by PCR using the pCS3 + 6Myc-Chk1 (WT or L449R) (8Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as the template. The restriction enzyme digestion sites EcoRI and AgeI were added to the forward (GCCGAATTCATGGCAGTGCCCTTTGTGGAAGACTG) and reverse (GGCACCGGTCCACCACCTCCTGTGGCAGGAAGCCAAACCTTCTG) primers, respectively. The resulting PCR products were digested with EcoRI/AgeI and ligated to the same sites in the pYFP-N1 vector to produce the WT or L449R mutant Chk1-YFP construct. Next, the full-length CFP was amplified using forward (NheI) GGCGCTAGCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC and reverse (HindIII) GGCAAGCTTCACCACCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAG primers. Then the PCR product was digested and ligated to the same sites of the Chk1-YFP construct to generate the WT or L449R mutant CFP-Chk1-YFP constructs. To generate BiFC constructs, Chk1 (WT or L449R mutant) was amplified as described above but with different forward (HindIII, GCCAAGCTTATGGCAGTGCCCTTTGTGGAAGACTG) and reverse (KpnI, GCCGGTACCTCCACCTCCTGTGGCAGGAAGCCAAACCTTC) primers. The N-terminal (1–155) and C-terminal (156–239) CFPs were PCR-amplified using the N-CFP forward (NheI, GCCGCTAGCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC), N-CFP reverse (HindIII, GCCAAGCTTTCCACCTCCGGCGGTGATATAGACGTTGTCGC), CFP-C forward (KpnI, GCCGGTACCGACAAGCAGAAGAACGGCATCAAGG), and CFP-C reverse (EcoRI, GCCGAATTCTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG) primers. Then the PCR products N-CFP, Chk1 (WT or L449R), and CFP-C were ligated into the accepting vector pcDNA3.1(+) to create the pcDNA3.1-N-CFP-Chk1, pcDNA3.1-Chk1-CFP-C, and pcDNA3.1-N-CFP-Chk1 (WT or L449R)-CFP-C constructs. To generate the double L449R/S345A mutants, the CFP-Chk1-YFP L449R (for FRET) or the N-CFP-Chk1-CFP-C L449R (for BiFC) construct was used to perform mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The following primers were used: forward, CAAGGGATCAGCTTTGCTCAGCCCACATGTCC; reverse, GGACATGTGGGCTGAGCAAAGCTGATCCCTTG. To generate deletion mutants of the Chk1 kinase domain, pCS3 + 6Myc-Chk1 (WT) was used as the template to perform PCR reactions with the following primers: 1–87 forward (BglII), GCCAGATCTATGGCAGTGCCCTTTGTGGAAGAC; 1–87 reverse (XbaI), GCGTCTAGATCAACAGTACTCCAGAAATAAATATTG; 88–124 forward, (BglII) GCCAGATCTAGTGGAGGAGAGCTTTTTGACAG; 88–124 reverse,(XbaI) GCGTCTAGATCAAATACCATGCAGATAAACCAC; 125–182 forward, (BglII) GCCAGATCTATTGGAATAACTCAC AGGGATATTAAAC; 125–182 reverse (XbaI), GCGTCTAGATCATCTTCTCTTCAGAAGTTCTGG; 183–235 forward (BglII), GCCAGATCTGAATTTCATGCAGAACCAGTTGATG; 183–235 reverse (XbaI), GCGTCTAGATCAATCGATTTTTTTCCAAGGGTTG; 236–265 forward(BglII), GCCAGATCTTCTGCTCCTCTAGCTCTGCTGCAT; and 236–265 reverse (XbaI), GCGTCTAGATCAGTACCATCTATCTTTTTTGATG. These PCR products then were cloned into the BglII/XbaI site of the pCS3 + 6Myc vector. Further deletion of the N-terminal kinase domain (residues 1–87) was carried out with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Thermo Fisher) using the following primers: Δ2–30 forward, AGATCTGGGGAATTCATGACTGAAGAAGCAGTC GCA;Δ2–30 reverse, TGCGACTGCTTCTTCAGTCATGAATTCCCCAGATCT; Δ31–60 forward, CTTGCTGTGAATAGAGTAATGCTAAATCATGAAAAT; Δ31–60 reverse, ATTTTCATGATTTAGCATTACTCTATTCACAGCAAG; Δ61–87 forward, GAGATCTGTATCAATAAAAAGCGTGGAAAGCTGAAG; and Δ61–87 reverse, CTTCAGCTTTCCACGCTTTTTATTGATACAGATCTC. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (8Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y.

For immunofluorescence, U2-OS cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-N-CFP-Chk1, pcDNA3.1-Chk1-C, pcDNA3.1-N-CFP-Chk1 plus pcDNA3.1-Chk1-C, pcDNA3.1-N-CFP-Chk1-CFP-C WT or L449R, or CFP-Chk1 constructs for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 1 ml of PBS containing 3.75% formaldehyde and 0.2 m sucrose for 10 min at room temperature and then washed three times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.1 m glycine. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 2% normal goat serum (or 10% FBS) and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% BSA), and then visualized by fluorescence microscopy. For live cell imaging, U2-OS cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-N-CFP-Chk1-CFP-C WT or CFP-Chk1 for 48 h at 37 °C, treated with 100 nm CPT for 2 h, washed, and cultured in drug-free medium for an additional 12 h before imaging by fluorescence microscopy. FRET analysis was performed as described previously with modifications (29Hovan S.C. Howell S. Park P.S. Forster resonance energy transfer as a tool to study photoreceptor biology.J. Biomed. Opt. 2010; 15 (067001)Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected with either a positive control CFP-YFP or various Chk1 constructs (CFP-Chk1, Chk1-YFP, CFP-Chk1-YFP WT, or CFP-Chk1-YFP L449R) for 48 h. Cells were suspended in PBS, and an equal number of cells was placed in a cuvette for FRET analysis with a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). FRET was determined by monitoring the sensitized emission of YFP at 535 nm upon exciting CFP. Samples were excited at 425 nm (2-nm slit), and emission spectra were collected (5-nm slit). The spectrum obtained from non-transfected cells was used as the background. Additionally, the spectrum obtained from cells expressing Chk1-YFP was subtracted from spectra obtained from cells expressing any YFP species. All curves were normalized to the maxima for CFP emission (474 nm). All experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. Several studies have revealed that the N-terminal kinase domain of Chk1 co-immunoprecipitated with the C terminus in vitro or in vivo (8Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y.

These data suggest that Chk1 may form a closed conformation in cells under normal growth conditions (Fig. 1A). To further confirm this model, we performed experiments to map regions or residues critical for the intramolecular interaction of Chk1. We recently reported that two residues (Gly-448 and Leu-449) at the distal C terminus of Chk1 play important roles in Chk1 activation because mutating either one bypasses the requirement of DNA damage for inducing ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 and checkpoint activation (8Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y. Autoregulatory mechanisms of phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results imply that Gly-448 and Leu-449 may be critical in forming the closed conformation of Chk1. To test this idea, we asked whether mutating these two residues (e.g. the L449R mutant) would abolish the ability of the C terminus to interact with the N-terminal kinase domain. Thus, we overexpressed the truncated Myc-tagged Chk1 N-terminal kinase domain (Myc-Chk1 N) with GFP-tagged Chk1 C terminus (GFP-Chk1 C or GFP-Chk1 C L449R) (Fig. 1B) in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated the Myc-Chk1 N proteins with anti-Myc antibodies, and examined the presence of GFP-Chk1 C with anti-GFP antibodies. The results show that Myc-Chk1 N interacted with GFP-Chk1 C (Fig. 1C, lane 3), as reported previously (8Wang J. Han X. Zhang Y.

However, we could not detect GFP-Chk1 C L449R in the anti-Myc IP (Fig. 1C, lane 4), indicating the importance of the Leu-449 residue in the interaction between the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain of Chk1. To further confirm this intramolecular interaction, we next asked which region of the kinase domain of Chk1 is involved in its interaction with the C terminus. The human Chk1 N-terminal kinase domain consists of 265 residues. We generated five Myc-tagged short fragments targeting different regions of the Chk1 kinase domain (Fig. 2A). The Chk1 C terminus mainly resided in the nucleus, whereas the N-terminal kinase was located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B), similar to our previous observations (27Wang J. Han X. Feng X. Wang Z. Zhang Y. Coupling cellular localization and function of checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) in checkpoints and cell viability.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25501-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal kinase domain fragments of Chk1 were mainly expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B), likely because of the lack of a functional nuclear localization signal. Therefore, we took an indirect approach to assess the ability of these N-terminal kinase domain fragments to interact with the C terminus. To do so, we overexpressed these fragments and GFP-Chk1 C fusion proteins in HEK293T cells separately. GFP-Chk1 C fusion proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies and used to pull down those small fragments of the Chk1 kinase domain from the cell lysates. Under these particular experimental conditions, the band representing the Myc-Chk1 N ran almost identical to the heavy chain of rabbit IgG. Nonetheless, we repeatedly observed a band running just below the IgG heavy chain (Fig. 2C, lane 6), confirming the interaction between the N and C termini of Chk1. The middle region (residues 125–183) of the Chk1 kinase domain showed a weak interaction with the C terminus; however, the strongest interaction was observed for the fragment covering the first 87 residues of Chk1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 3). To further narrow down the region (residue 1–87) required for the intramolecular interaction, we generated three additional mutants with deletions of residues 2–30, 31–60, and 61–87, respectively (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W2338595878,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) can appoint mouse bone marrow (MBM) cells to the osteoclast (OC) lineage for osteoclastogenesis. However, whether C/EBPα is also involved in OC differentiation and activity is unknown. Here we demonstrated that C/EBPα overexpression in MBM cells can promote OC differentiation and strongly induce the expression of the OC genes encoding the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, c1 (NFATc1), cathepsin K (Cstk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 (TRAP) with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-evoked OC lineage priming. Furthermore, while investigating the specific stage of OC differentiation that is regulated by C/EBPα, our gene overexpression studies revealed that, although C/EBPα plays a stronger role in the early stage of OC differentiation, it is also involved in the later stage. Accordingly, C/EBPα knockdown drastically inhibits osteoclastogenesis and markedly abrogates the expression of NFATc1, Cstk, and TRAP during OC differentiation. Consistently, C/EBPα silencing revealed that, although lack of C/EBPα affects all stages of OC differentiation, it has more impact on the early stage. Importantly, we showed that ectopic expression of rat C/EBPα restores osteoclastogenesis in C/EBPα-depleted MBM cells. Furthermore, our subsequent functional assays showed that C/EBPα exhibits a dispensable role on actin ring formation by mature OCs but is critically involved in bone resorption by stimulating extracellular acidification and regulating cell survival. We revealed that C/EBPα is important for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced Akt activation, which is crucial for OC survival. Collectively, these results indicate that C/EBPα functions throughout osteoclastogenesis as well as in OC function. This study provides additional understanding of the roles of C/EBPα in OC biology.

Furthermore, while investigating the specific stage of OC differentiation that is regulated by C/EBPα, our gene overexpression studies revealed that, although C/EBPα plays a stronger role in the early stage of OC differentiation, it is also involved in the later stage. Accordingly, C/EBPα knockdown drastically inhibits osteoclastogenesis and markedly abrogates the expression of NFATc1, Cstk, and TRAP during OC differentiation. Consistently, C/EBPα silencing revealed that, although lack of C/EBPα affects all stages of OC differentiation, it has more impact on the early stage. Importantly, we showed that ectopic expression of rat C/EBPα restores osteoclastogenesis in C/EBPα-depleted MBM cells. Furthermore, our subsequent functional assays showed that C/EBPα exhibits a dispensable role on actin ring formation by mature OCs but is critically involved in bone resorption by stimulating extracellular acidification and regulating cell survival. We revealed that C/EBPα is important for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced Akt activation, which is crucial for OC survival. Collectively, these results indicate that C/EBPα functions throughout osteoclastogenesis as well as in OC function. This study provides additional understanding of the roles of C/EBPα in OC biology."

https://openalex.org/W2414447301,"The transport of nascent very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi determines their secretion by the liver and is mediated by a specialized ER-derived vesicle, the VLDL transport vesicle (VTV). Our previous studies have shown that the formation of ER-derived VTV requires proteins in addition to coat complex II proteins. The VTV proteome revealed that a 9-kDa protein, small valosin-containing protein-interacting protein (SVIP), is uniquely present in these specialized vesicles. Our biochemical and morphological data indicate that the VTV contains SVIP. Using confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that SVIP co-localizes with apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB100) and specifically interacts with VLDL apoB100 and coat complex II proteins. Treatment of ER membranes with myristic acid in the presence of cytosol increases SVIP recruitment to the ER in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that myristic acid treatment of hepatocytes increases both VTV budding and VLDL secretion. To determine the role of SVIP in VTV formation, we either blocked the SVIP protein using specific antibodies or silenced SVIP by siRNA in hepatocytes. Our results show that both blocking and silencing of SVIP lead to significant reduction in VTV formation. Additionally, we show that silencing of SVIP reduces VLDL secretion, suggesting a physiological role of SVIP in intracellular VLDL trafficking and secretion. We conclude that SVIP acts as a novel regulator of VTV formation by interacting with its cargo and coat proteins and has significant implications in VLDL secretion by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2340246785,"One mechanism by which oncoproteins work is through perturbation of cellular maturation; understanding the mechanisms by which this occurs can lead to the development of targeted therapies. EVI1 is a zinc finger oncoprotein involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia; previous work has shown it to interfere with the maturation of granulocytes from immature precursors. Here we investigate the mechanism by which that occurs, using an immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cell line, EML-C1, as a model system. We document that overexpression of EVI1 abrogates retinoic acid-induced maturation of EML cells into committed myeloid cells, a process that can be documented by the down-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 and acquisition of responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We show that this requires DNA binding capacity of EVI1, suggesting that downstream target genes are involved. We identify the myeloid regulator Cebpa as a target gene and identify two EVI1 binding regions within evolutionarily conserved enhancer elements at +35 and +37 kb relative to the gene. EVI1 can strongly suppress Cebpa transcription, and add-back of Cebpa into EVI1-expressing EML cells partially corrects the block in maturation. We identify the DNA sequences to which EVI1 binds at +35 and +37 kb and show that mutation of one of these releases Cebpa from EVI1-induced suppression. We observe a more complex picture in primary bone marrow cells, where EVI1 suppresses Cebpa in stem cells but not in more committed progenitors.

Recent studies have shown that the ability of EVI1 to bind DNA via zinc fingers 1–7 (ZF1 domain) is critical for malignant transformation and that a pyrole-imidazole polyamide targeted against the canonical EVI1 binding motif partially inhibits the leukemic phenotype (16Zhang Y.

However, very little is known about which EVI1 target genes are essential in generating disease. In an effort to identify key EVI1 occupancy sites critical for disease, we have recently performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq) along with whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) in two murine myeloid leukemic cell lines (14Glass C. Wuertzer C. Cui X. Bi Y. Davuluri R. Xiao Y.-Y. Wilson M. Owens K. Zhang Y. Perkins A. Global identification of EVI1 target genes in acute myeloid leukemia.PLOS One. 2013; 8e67134Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ChIP-Seq data revealed EVI1 occupancy of a binding site 35 and 37 kb downstream of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (Cebpa) gene in the murine leukemic cell line DA-1. A member of the leucine zipper family of transcription factors, C/EBPα is critical for the transition of a common myeloid progenitor to a granulocyte/monocyte progenitor during early hematopoiesis, and Cebpa−/− mice do not display terminally differentiated granulocytes in the peripheral blood (17Zhang D.E.

Additionally, Cebpa−/− HSCs exhibit enhanced repopulating capability, and the bone marrow of these mice is replete with myeloid blast cells, an observation that indicates a regulatory role in the early progenitor/stem cell compartment (18Zhang P.

EVI1 is a known regulator of CEBPA mRNA and protein function; the RUNX1-MDS1-EVI1 (RME) fusion protein (product of the AML-associated t(3;21) translocation) is known to suppress Cebpa translation through up-regulation of calreticulin (23Helbling D.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13312-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); additionally, RME has been shown to bind C/EBPα protein and inhibit its ability to bind DNA and regulate its own transcription, most likely due to the recruitment of histone deacetylases via the CtBP region on the EVI1 portion of RME (24Tokita K. Maki K. Mitani K. RUNX1/EVI1, which blocks myeloid differentiation, inhibits CCAAT-enhancer binding protein α function.Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, no direct transcriptional regulation of the Cebpa gene by EVI1 has been described. Here, we show that EVI1 transduction into immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cell line (EML C1 (25Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S.

We further show that EVI1 binds to and occupies two evolutionarily conserved enhancer elements located 35 and 37 kb downstream of the Cebpa transcriptional start site (TSS) in murine leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors. Finally, we show that Cas-9-mediated disruption of the EVI1 binding site is able to restore Cebpa transcription in EVI1-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells. EML and BHK-MKL cells (25Tsai S.

For [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells were seeded (3 × 105 cells in 0.2 ml) in wells of a 96-well plate with the appropriate growth factor. After 4–6 h, one μCi of [3H]thymidine (ICN) was added in 10 μl to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 18–30 h. Cells were transferred onto a glass fiber filter with a Tomtec harvester. Filters were dried, saturated with scintillation fluid in a sealed plastic bag, and counted on a β-counter. All cells were assayed in triplicate. After background subtraction, values were averaged and expressed as a ratio relative to [3H]thymidine incorporation with no factor. For the Cebpa add-back experiment, EML cells were cultured in 1 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen tamoxifen for 48 h before flow cytometry analysis or concurrently with RA and IL-3 as described previously (25Tsai S.

Nagata S. pEF-BOS, a powerful mammalian expression vector.Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 185322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), as modified by S. Orkin. 5S. Orkin, personal communication. A hemagglutinin tag was added to the C terminus of EVI1 by amplifying bp 3467–3603 of Evi1 with oligonucleotides 5′-CACAGGCATATGCTATGATG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTTAGAGGCTAGCGTAATCCGGAACATCGTATGGGTATACATGGCTTATGGACTGGAT-3′. This 192-bp fragment extends from an NdeI site at bp 3474 to the C-terminal end of Evi1 at bp 3603, adds on a hemagglutinin epitope tag with sequence YPYDVPDYASL, and terminates with a NotI site. After digestion with NotI and NdeI, the 176-bp fragment was inserted into NdeI-NotI-cut pEFneo-Evi1, and from there, Evi1HA was transferred into the EcoRV site of pBluescript as a blunt-ended 3.6-kb EcoRI-NotI fragment.

Medium was changed 8 h later. Viral supernatants were harvested at 24–48 h post-transfection and frozen at −80 °C. EML cells were infected in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Selection was performed in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Total RNA was isolated from cells using either TRIzol (Life Technologies) or an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNA was quantified by UV spectroscopy using a Nanodrop instrument (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCRs (qPCRs) were carried out using a Bio-Rad instrument and Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with protocols and annealing temperatures set according to the manufacturer's instructions. FACSCalibur, LSR II, and FACScan instruments (BD Biosciences) were used for flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting. Analyses of all flow cytometry data were done using FlowJo version 8.5.3 software (TreeStar). All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Sample preparation was carried out as described (32Zhang Y. Stehling-Sun S. Lezon-Geyda K. Juneja S.C. Coillard L. Chatterjee G. Wuertzer C.A. Camargo F. Perkins A.S.

Insertion of the cassette was done via homologous recombination into embryonic stem cells at the University of Rochester Transgenic Core, and proper integration was assessed via Southern blotting with both 3′ and 5′ probes. The allele was deemed nondeleterious to viability via allelism testing. The Evi1TO allele was combined with the Rosa26rtTA allele (35Hochedlinger K. Yamada Y. Beard C. Jaenisch R.

These sequences were chosen using software at the RNAi OligoRetriever Database. These complementary strands were annealed and inserted into BamHI/EcoRI-cut pSIREN-RetroQ. Microarray studies were performed as competitive hybridizations (shRNA-mediated knockdown of EVI1 versus control shRNA) of fluorescently labeled cDNAs on glass slide-based 70-mer oligonucleotide arrays of mouse cDNA sequences as described previously (6Yatsula B.

EML C1 cells (2–20 × 106 cells) were fixed in cell culture medium, 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The fixation reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 m glycine (0.26 m final) and incubation for 5 min at room temperature followed by 15 min on ice. This sample was used for the immunoprecipitation using rabbit polyclonal antibodies and Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific). The negative control for the precipitation was Dynabeads alone. Fold enrichment (or “occupancy”) was calculated as the ratio of Ct values (the ChIP sample (or beads alone) versus input sample). The results were considered valid if enrichment was obtained with the specific antibody and not with beads alone. The plentiCRISPR vector (Addgene number 52961) was created by Feng Zhang’s laboratory (37Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Hartenian E. Shi X. Scott D.A. Mikkelsen T.S. Heckl D. Ebert B.L. Root D.E. Doench J.G.

Infections were carried out by centrifuging virus/cell mixtures for 1 h at 700 relative centrifugal force, 25 °C. At 48 h postinfection, cells were selected in 1 μg/ml puromycin for 72 h. Clones were generated by single-cell sorting into round-bottom 96-well plates. Clones were picked approximately 2 weeks later, and stable clones were analyzed for Cebpa expression and Cas9 modification of the +35 kb enhancer. An N-terminal portion of the EVI1 protein containing ZF1 was cloned into pET-15b. The EVI1 C-terminal portion, containing ZF2, was cloned into pGEX.

The resulting product trans-4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) is of critical importance for the stability and thus function of collagen, with defects leading to several diseases. Prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) are mononuclear non-heme iron α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenases that catalyze Hyp formation. Although animal and plant P4Hs target peptidyl proline, prokaryotes have been known to use free l-proline as a precursor to form Hyp. The P4H from Bacillus anthracis (BaP4H) has been postulated to act on peptidyl proline in collagen peptides, making it unusual within the bacterial clade, but its true physiological substrate remains enigmatic. Here we use mass spectrometry, fluorescence binding, x-ray crystallography, and docking experiments to confirm that BaP4H recognizes and acts on peptidyl substrates but not free l-proline, using elements characteristic of an Fe(II)/αKG-dependent dioxygenases. We further show that BaP4H can hydroxylate unique peptidyl proline sites in collagen-derived peptides with asymmetric hydroxylation patterns. The cofactor-bound crystal structures of BaP4H reveal active site conformational changes that define open and closed forms and mimic “ready” and “product-released” states of the enzyme in the catalytic cycle. These results help to clarify the role of BaP4H as well as provide broader insights into human collagen P4H and proteins with poly-l-proline type II helices.

A double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) comprising of eight anti-parallel β-strands contains the conserved active site residues required for iron and αKG binding (Fig. 1) (14Clifton I.J.

Whereas, C-P4H catalyzes the hydroxylation of proline residues at the Y position of (X-Y-G)n repeats (where, n denotes the number of repeated sequences and X is frequently proline) in collagen and other collagenous domain containing proteins (17Myllyharju J.

The (P-P-G)n repeats found in collagen adopt a poly-l-proline type II (PPII) conformation in each strand of the collagen triple helix. The PPII helical residues are known to interact with proline recognition domains (PRDs) and are involved in a variety of processes including bacterial and viral pathogenesis, elasticity, transcription, cell motility, and self-assembly (23Adzhubei A.A.

Polyproline and triple helix motifs in host-pathogen recognition.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2012; 13: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation of Y proline residues in collagen is of utmost importance in providing stability to the collagen helical structure. Defects in collagen stability due to insufficient hydroxylation or excessive C-P4H activity can cause diseases like scurvy and fibrosis, respectively (1Gorres K.L. Raines R.T. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 106-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because C-P4H is the rate-limiting enzyme in collagen biosynthesis, therefore, it is an attractive target for developing corresponding mechanism-based activators and inhibitors for scurvy and fibrotic disorders. Three C-P4H isoenzymes exist in vertebrates and these are all α2β2 tetramers. The β-subunit is identical to protein-disulfide isomerase and is necessary for preventing the aggregation of α-subunit and to retain it in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P.

The catalytic α-subunit consists of 3 domains: an N-domain responsible for tetramer assembly, a peptide-substrate binding (PSB) domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain containing the active site (22Hieta R.

The crystal structures of the N and PSB domains have been determined in presence of a C-P4H inhibitor (poly-l-proline) and (P-P-G)3 substrate (26Pekkala M. Hieta R. Bergmann U. Kivirikko K.I.

The two peptides adopt a PPII helical conformation and bind to the PSB domain in a groove lined by conserved tyrosines. The PSB domain of C-P4H consists of α-helices that forms tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. The tetratricopeptide repeat motifs are promiscuous in mediating protein-protein interactions and recognize many ligands including proline-rich peptides (28Cerveny L. Straskova A. Dankova V. Hartlova A. Ceckova M. Staud F. Stulik J. Tetratricopeptide repeat motifs in the world of bacterial pathogens: role in virulence mechanisms.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because C-P4H acts on X-P-G repeats in collagen and other proteins with collagen-like sequences, the substrate specificity of this enzyme must arise from residues beyond the conserved region of tetratricopeptide repeat. An open question, which is mainly due to the lack of a structure of C-P4H with an intact catalytic domain, is how the PSB and catalytic domains communicate to position a substrate around the active site for site-specific prolyl hydroxylation. The poor solubility of the α-subunit containing the catalytic site has proved challenging for structural studies and there has been an ongoing effort in pursuit of an improved model for C-P4H. Previous structures of P4Hs have provided initial insights into enzyme structure and function. A viral collagen P4H (vCPH) has been shown to hydroxylate poly-l-proline and prolines in proteins containing (P-A-P-K)n proline-rich repeats (29Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M.

The crystal structures of vCPH with manganese-bound and a zinc-αKG complex show residues involved in metal and αKG binding and related conformational changes when αKG binds (30Longbotham J.E. Levy C.

A structure of an algal P4H from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrP4H) complexed with a (S-P)5 peptide is one of the few P4H crystal structures solved to date with a substrate bound in the active site (33Horita S.

The structure illustrates various enzyme-substrate interactions in the binding groove and in the substrate binding loop (SBL) region adjacent to the active site, with the peptide adopting the PPII helix conformation (34Koski M.K.

Similar to other organisms bacteria contain Hyp, but a distinctive characteristic of bacterial P4Hs is to produce Hyp from free l-proline instead of peptidyl proline (38Adefarati A.A. Hensens O.D.

Antibiot. 1992; 45: 1953-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Bacillus anthracis P4H (BaP4H) is unique among bacterial P4Hs in that it is reported to bind the human collagen peptide (P-P-G)10 with an affinity similar to that of human C-P4H (1Gorres K.L. Raines R.T. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 106-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 36Culpepper M.A. Scott E.E. Limburg J.

Structural alignment of BaP4H with CrP4H and vCPH structures shows conserved secondary structure similarities between various P4Hs (Fig. 1). Examining the proteome of B. anthracis reveals collagen-like proteins that contain stretches of (G-X-Y) repeats. A genome-based study of collagen structural motifs in bacterial and viral proteins showed that bacterial collagen structural motifs favor a (G-P-T) triplet unit rather than the second most prevalent (G-P-Q) repeat unit (40Rasmussen M. Jacobsson M. Björck L. Genome-based identification and analysis of collagen-related structural motifs in bacterial and viral proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32313-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because the proteome of B. anthracis contains (G-P-T) repeats in some proteins, it has been proposed that a possible physiological substrate for BaP4H could be a protein consisting of (G-P-T)n repeats (36Culpepper M.A. Scott E.E. Limburg J. Crystal structure of prolyl 4-hydroxylase from Bacillus anthracis.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Miller M.A. Scott E.E. Limburg J.

Commun. 2008; 64: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the substrate for BaP4H is not yet fully established. The previously reported crystal structure of BaP4H is an apo-form of the enzyme lacking necessary cofactors (36Culpepper M.A. Scott E.E. Limburg J. Crystal structure of prolyl 4-hydroxylase from Bacillus anthracis.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Miller M.A. Scott E.E. Limburg J.

Commun. 2008; 64: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the site-specific prolyl hydroxylation activity of BaP4H, it is important to understand how the active site residues are organized to assemble the cofactors, iron and αKG, for substrate recognition. In the current study we examine cofactor and substrate binding, including site-specific hydroxylation activity of BaP4H by a combination of biochemical, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallographic methods. Attempts toward determining the crystal structure of a substrate-bound form of BaP4H has not been fully successful, therefore molecular docking was used to simulate the binding mode of a collagen-like proline-rich (P-P-G)5 peptide. Here we describe the first biochemical and structural analysis of the cofactor-bound forms of BaP4H, and identified collagen-derived (P-P-G)5,10 peptides as substrates with hydroxylation of proline residues occurring in both X and Y positions. Furthermore, the crystal structures reveal conformational changes upon cofactor binding, and represent “ready” and “product-released” states of the enzyme in the catalytic mechanism (42Robert X. Gouet P. Deciphering key features in protein structures with the new ENDscript server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W320-W324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar). All buffers, media ingredients, and other reagents were acquired from Sigma and, unless otherwise stated, were of the highest purity available. Solutions were prepared using Nanopure deionized water. N2 (99.98%), NO (>99%), and liquid helium (>99%) were obtained from Praxair (Cedar Rapids, IA). The bap4h gene was synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ), and then subcloned into the pET28a expression vector using restriction sites NcoI and NdeI. The BaP4H plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 star DE3 pLysS cells (Life Technologies). Apo-BaP4H was expressed and purified with a slight modification as reported previously (41Miller M.A. Scott E.E. Limburg J. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray studies of a prolyl-4-hydroxylase protein from Bacillus anthracis.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The BaP4H-(P-P-G)3 construct was made by PCR using appropriate primers to extend the C terminus end to contain a (P-P-G)3 peptide. The PCR product was cut with NcoI and BamHI and ligated back into pET28a. This new plasmid was transformed, expressed, and purified as above. To prevent any turnover, all UV-visible measurements were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres, Hawthorne, CA) using an Ocean Optics DH-2000-BAL light source (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL). Anaerobic solutions were made from dry stocks in a glovebox. Spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl in a 100-μl quartz cuvette. The spectrum of Fe(II)-BaP4H was measured after adding equimolar concentrations of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 776 μm apo-BaP4H. To detect any spectral changes associated with αKG binding, stoichiometric aliquots of Fe(II) and αKG were added to a 776 μm solution of apo-BaP4H and spectra were recorded after each addition. The difference spectrum of Fe(II)-BaP4H-αKG ternary complex (solid line, Fig. 2A), was obtained by subtracting the Fe(II)-BaP4H spectrum (dashed line, Fig. 2A) from the original ternary complex spectrum to highlight the absorption maximum at 520 nm characteristic of αKG-dependent non-heme iron dioxygenases (43Ryle M.J.

Studies with small molecule inhibitors of FLAP have led to the discovery of a drug binding pocket on the protein surface, and several pharmaceutical companies have developed compounds and performed clinical trials. Crystallographic studies and mutational analyses have contributed to a general understanding of compound binding modes. During our own efforts, we identified two unique chemical series. One series demonstrated strong inhibition of human FLAP but differential pharmacology across species and was completely inactive in assays with mouse or rat FLAP. The other series was active across rodent FLAP, as well as human and dog FLAP. Comparison of rodent and human FLAP amino acid sequences together with an analysis of a published crystal structure led to the identification of amino acid residue 24 in the floor of the putative binding pocket as a likely candidate for the observed speciation. On that basis, we tested compounds for binding to human G24A and mouse A24G FLAP mutant variants and compared the data to that generated for wild type human and mouse FLAP. These studies confirmed that a single amino acid mutation was sufficient to reverse the speciation observed in wild type FLAP.

FLAP cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pFASTBac1 (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal His6 tag according to standard techniques. After virus production and amplification, Sf9 cells were infected for 48 h and harvested by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and frozen at −80 °;C. Subsequently, the cells were suspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in ice-cold TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 mm DTT and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Sigma). The cells were lysed by sonication (Branson) on ice with a large probe for 20 s at 50% duty cycle, setting 5, until the cells reached quantitative lysis (as monitored, intermittently, by phase contrast microscopy). Lysates were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were harvested and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Ti70 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in TE with sonication, as above, and maintained at a protein concentration of >5 mg/ml. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen after the addition of glycerol to 20% and stored at −80 °;C. The compounds were diluted to 4× final concentration in assay buffer (PBS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100) such that the final DMSO concentration was not greater than 1.25%. Then a 4× HTRF mixture was prepared by diluting FITC-labeled MK-591 first to 10 μm in DMSO, from a 10 mm DMSO stock, and then to 100 nm in cold assay buffer in combination with 25 μg/ml terbium-labeled anti-His6 (catalog no. 61HISTLA; Cisbio). The membranes were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml (2× final concentration) in cold assay buffer. The following were added to a black 384-well, non-binding, plate (catalog no. 784900; Greiner): 5 μl of compound or buffer, 5 μl of HTRF mixture, and 10 μl of membrane preparation. After sealing, the plate was incubated with shaking for 2 h and read on a laser-equipped Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data are presented as an HTRF ratio of FITC fluorescence (HTRF signal) divided by terbium fluorescence × 10,000, and specific signals were typically 10-fold greater than background. IC50 values were calculated with a non-linear single site competition model (Y = bottom + (top − bottom)/(1 + 10 ∧ (X-LogEC50))), and inhibition constant (Ki) with the standard Cheng-Prusoff transformation (23Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (KI) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 per cent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12259) Google Scholar) (Ki = IC50/1+[L]/Kd), where the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of FITC-591 was determined previously by standard one-site non-linear regression analysis (Y = Bmax * X/(Kd + X)) of a FITC-labeled MK-591 dose response versus the different FLAP isoforms (not shown). Freshly drawn whole blood collected into sodium heparin tubes was diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1620 medium (catalog no. SH30096.01; HyClone). 200 μl of the diluted blood were dispensed to each well of a 96-well round-bottomed plate. Compounds were diluted in RPMI to 11× final concentration, 20 μl of this working solution were added to the diluted blood, followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °;C (5% CO2). Calcium ionophore A23187 (catalog no. C7522-10MG; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100% DMSO to generate a 1.67 mg/ml stock solution, which was further diluted 1–10 times dropwise with vortexing into deionized water to generate a working solution. At the end of the compound preincubation, 9 μl of the ionophore working solution was added to each well, and the plate was returned to 37 °;C for 30 min. The final DMSO concentration was 0.68%. Following incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min, supernatants were removed, and LTB4 was quantitated by ELISA (catalog no. ADI-900-068; Enzo Life Sciences). For in vivo studies, compounds may be formulated in 20% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and dosed to animals. Blood was sampled by jugular venipuncture into collection tubes containing sodium heparin prior to and at various time points following oral or intravenous dosing in dogs and then diluted 1:1 in RPMI before plating. Calcium ionophore stimulation and quantification were performed as described above. To enable computational studies, we evaluated the available crystal structures. Two public crystal structures of FLAP were known and registered as 2Q7M and 2Q7R in the Protein Data Bank (14Ferguson A.D. McKeever B.M. Xu S. Wisniewski D. Miller D.K. Yamin T.T. Spencer R.H. Chu L. Ujjainwalla F. Cunningham B.R. Evans J.F. Becker J.W. Crystal structure of inhibitor-bound human 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.Science. 2007; 317: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Both have a relatively low resolution of ∼4 Å. In each asymmetric unit there are two protein assemblies, and a molecule of MK591 (in 2Q7M) or an analog of MK591 (in 2Q7R) is bound to the interface of each pair of monomers (three in each protein assembly). Thus, there were 12 different conformations of the MK-591 binding site available for docking. Molecular Operating Environment (2010.10; Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada) was used to align the human, mouse, rat, dog, and pig sequences of FLAP; to identify residues near to the MK-591 binding site; and to dock novel compounds. Novel compounds were manually docked into the MK-591 structure, and the MMFF94 force field was used to refine the resulting ligand poses, holding the protein fixed. The SAR shown in Fig. 2 yielded a simple pharmacophore needed for activity of the biaryl amino-heteroarenes. For example, compound 7 (see Table 2), which has a methyl group instead of an amino group, was inactive, whereas compound 9, which is N-methylated, shows activity comparable with that of compound 3, suggesting that only a single donor is required. Compound 5, in which the pyrazine of compound 3 is replaced with a pyridine, is active, but the alternate pyridine replacement, in compound 6, is inactive, suggesting that only a single acceptor is required. At the other end of the molecule, reducing the lipophilicity of the t-butyl group to a methyl, as in compound 4, also resulted in a loss of activity. We therefore hypothesized that a single donor acceptor pair on the biaryl amino-heteroarenes was important, as well as a hydrophobic group on the opposite end of the molecule. We examined the 12 different crystallographic conformations of the FLAP binding pocket. There was significant variation of the loop in the back of the pocket among the 12 structures, but we were able to identify a conformation that could plausibly provide the complementary hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pair needed to explain the pharmacophore. Compound 3 was docked into the pocket occupied by MK-591 using this pharmacophore as a guide in Molecular Operating Environment. The t-butyl group of compound 3 was superposed onto the t-butyl of MK-591, and the critical donor-acceptor pair of the amino-pyrazine were positioned in the interior of the pocket, where they were able to make hydrogen-bonding pairs with the backbone amides of residues Tyr112 and Phe114 (Fig. 3, C and D). In support of this idea, compounds 1 and 3 were tested in FLAP ligand displacement HTRF assays with membranes containing human FLAP carrying an Y112A mutation. Compound 1 had a pKi versus human wild type FLAP of 8.2 ± 0.4 and 7.2 ± 0.1 m at Y112A FLAP, whereas compound 3 had a pKi versus human wild type of 6.9 ± 0.1 and 5.7 ± 0.26 m at Y112A FLAP (samples run in duplicate, n = 4 for compound 1; n = 2 for compound 3). Therefore, the substantial loss in binding affinity observed for these compounds between wild type FLAP and Y112A FLAP supports the proposed hydrogen bond requirement at Tyr112 and the subsequent docking model. Next, we examined the human, mouse, dog, rat, and pig sequences of FLAP, which show high amino acid sequence homology between these species (Fig. 1). Despite this high degree of conservation, there is a single residue difference between human and mouse that occurs near the MK-591 binding site: Gly24 (human and dog) or Ala24 (mouse, rat, and pig; see Fig. 1). We then used the proposed docking model to compare the binding mode of various compounds in wild type and G24A human FLAP. A close examination of compounds bound to human and G24A FLAP using this docking model suggested that compounds from the biaryl amino-heteroarene series were likely to be in closer proximity to Ala24 than was MK-591. The computational mutation of G24A predicts a steric clash that would be introduced in the predicted binding mode of the biaryl amino-heteroarenes, but not of MK-591. As shown in Fig. 3, MK-591 (green) avoids any steric hindrance by sitting higher in the binding pocket (Fig. 3B). Conversely, when compound 3 is modeled in the binding pocket of WT and G24A FLAP, its phenyl ring appears to clash with the surface of the protein at Ala24. In addition, the closest atom of compound 1 to Ala24 is predicted to be 3.12 Å, whereas that of compound 3 is predicted to be 2.65 Å (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, these computational results offered plausible rationale for the lack of activity of the biaryl amino-heteroarene series against mouse FLAP. To functionally characterize compound-FLAP interactions, we adopted an HTRF probe displacement assay, using a modified version of established methods (Ref. 24Miller D.K. Yamin T.T. Cummings R.T. Zhao A. Wisniewski D. Development of a high capacity HTRF assay for measurement of antagonists of 5-lipoxygenase activation protein (FLAP).in: Proceedings of the Inflammation Research Association: 12th International Conference of the IRA, Bolton Landing, NY, October 3–7, 20142004Google Scholar; see “Experimental Procedures”). With this system, we first determined the Kd of FITC-labeled MK591 (FITC-591) for binding to wild type human and mouse FLAP, as well as the variants hG24A and mA24G (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). The FITC-591 ligand had a very similar Kd for human wild type and G24A FLAP isoforms at 30 ± 14 and 21 ± 18 nm, respectively. FITC-591 had somewhat lower affinity for the mouse isoforms of FLAP with Kd of 80 ± 41 and 55 nm for wild type and A24G, respectively. Next, we evaluated the Ki of a number of compounds from the literature, as well as our molecules. A known substituted indole, exemplified by MK-591 (compound 1; Table 2), did show some loss of potency when tested in the mouse FLAP binding assay (human pKi = 8.2 versus mouse pKi = 6.5), as did a distinct substituted benzimidazole, such has compound 2, pKi 8.3 versus 6.7 (Fig. 4 and Table 2). In contrast, biaryl amino-heteroarenes identified in our screening efforts (for example, compound 3), and an optimized ter-aryl amino-heteroarene (Table 2, compound 10) (20Song J. Liu X. Zhu J. Tootoonchi M. Keith J.M. Meduna S.P. Dvorak C.A. Eccles W. Krawczuk P.J. Blevitt J.M. Wu J. Rao N.L. Lebsack A.D. Milla M.E.

Screen. 2016; 21: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), were inactive against mouse FLAP (Fig. 4 and Table 2).TABLE 1Kd values of FITC-labeled MK 591 at human, mouse, and FLAP variantsHumanMouseHuman G24AMouse A24GKd30.3 (14.1; n = 5)80.2 (41; n = 3)20.7 (18.2; n = 4)55.4 (n = 1)aInsufficient membrane preparations for additional runs.a Insufficient membrane preparations for additional runs. Open table in a new tab To test the hypothesis that mouse Ala24 prevents biaryl amino-heteroarenes compounds from accessing the binding pocket in FLAP, human G24A and mouse A24G variants were prepared for comparison with wild type in the HTRF probe displacement assay. Benzimidazoles (Table 2, compound 2), as well as the literature compound MK-591 (compound 1), did show some loss of activity when tested in mouse and the human G24A variant. Importantly, however, biaryl amino-heteroarenes inactive in wild type mouse were also inactive in the mutant human G24A FLAP (compounds 3 and 10, Fig. 4; and compounds 3–10, Table 2). Likewise, compounds had similar potency between mouse A24G and wild type human (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Because compounds from the biaryl amino-heteroarene series were inactive in mouse binding and whole blood assays, an alternative path was required to assess their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD). Thus, we evaluated FLAP orthologs and found that canine FLAP met the criteria for choosing an appropriate species for preclinical profiling because it also contains a Gly residue at position 24 and is, overall, highly homologous to human FLAP (96% sequence identity). In addition, canines are a commonly utilized species for preclinical development studies (25Lin J.H. Species similarities and differences in pharmacokinetics.Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1008-1021PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we established a canine whole blood assay and confirmed that representative compounds from the different series, including mouse inactive biaryl amino-heteroarenes, had similar potency in blocking LTB4 production in human and dog whole blood (Table 2). Next, we developed a canine PK/PD model to enable the advanced profiling of lead compounds. To that end, dogs were dosed with compound 10 (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), and blood samples were drawn at various time points to quantify plasma drug levels and perform ex vivo whole blood activity assays. In this model, compound 10 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of A23187-induced LTB4 production after administration, which correlated closely with the human and canine ex vivo whole blood assays (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Thus, these data support the utilization of canines for whole blood assays and PK/PD models, as well as the choice of this species as an adequate substitute for rodents in the establishment of pharmacodynamics parameters. FLAP is an essential component of the eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway that leads to the generation of the pro-inflammatory leukotrienes LTB4, the cysteinyl leukotriene C4, and its derivatives leukotrienes D4 and E4. Those are potent bioactive lipids that mediate inflammation, increase in vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction (26Song J. Liu X. Rao T.S. Chang L. Meehan M.J. Blevitt J.M. Wu J.

A number of pharmaceutical companies have placed significant drug discovery resources in search of FLAP inhibitors for asthma and atherosclerosis. Through screening and SAR studies, we found potent and selective inhibitors of FLAP, including benzimidazoles and biaryl amino-heteroarenes (16Bacani, G. M., Eccles, W., Fitzgerald, A.

Screen. 2016; 21: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Profiling of the latter compounds revealed differential pharmacology in rodents. We present evidence indicating that this speciation stems from a single amino acid difference between human and mouse FLAP. Through homology modeling and mutational analysis, we confirmed that amino acid residue 24 in the base of the small molecule binding pocket is likely to be this key residue. FLAP exhibits very high cross-species homology. However, there are subtle, but impactful, differences that can affect compound affinities. Remarkably, an alanine mutational scan of key residues around the MK-591 binding pocket identified several residues important for molecular interactions. For example, mutating Tyr66 and Tyr112 to alanine resulted in significant losses in MK-591 binding activity (14Ferguson A.D. McKeever B.M. Xu S. Wisniewski D. Miller D.K. Yamin T.T. Spencer R.H. Chu L. Ujjainwalla F. Cunningham B.R. Evans J.F. Becker J.W. Crystal structure of inhibitor-bound human 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.Science. 2007; 317: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similarly, the G24A mutation that we describe here did have a slight effect on the activity of indole- and benzimidazole-based inhibitors (Table 2). Using the published crystallographic model of human FLAP, our computational analysis suggested that the benzimidazole (compound 2) maintains activity in mouse by avoiding a clash with Ala24 of murine FLAP, whereas compounds from the biaryl amino-heteroarene family, because of a different binding mode, had no activity in mouse or human G24A FLAP. Together with subsequent mutational analysis, this enabled the discovery that mouse Ala24 is likely the causative residue for a complete loss of activity of this series. Thus, a common theme emerges for the MAPEG family in that the previously described compound binding site that sits at the interface between two monomers is well conserved and that species that lack homology with human, in or around the pocket, have the possibility of being resistant to even the most potent inhibitors. Differential pharmacology between species, or speciation, is a common problem encountered during the course of drug discovery that can severely hamper efficient advancement of clinical candidates. Many examples of speciation that have impacted drug discovery efforts exist in the literature and cover a broad range of protein families including G protein-coupled receptors (27Tichenor M.S. Thurmond R.L. Venable J.D. Savall B.M. Functional profiling of 2-aminopyrimidine histamine H4 receptor modulators.J. Med. Chem. 2015; 58: 7119-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), cytochrome P450 isoforms (28Lewis D.F. Ito Y. Lake B.G. Molecular modelling of CYP2F substrates: comparison of naphthalene metabolism by human, rat and mouse CYP2F subfamily enzymes.Drug Metabol. Drug Interact. 2009; 24: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the MAPEG member microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (29Xu D. Rowland S.E. Clark P. Giroux A. Côté B. Guiral S. Salem M. Ducharme Y. Friesen R.W. Méthot N. Mancini J. Audoly L. Riendeau D.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 326: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), for example. In the simplest of cases, research teams have identified an appropriate preclinical species, with homologous target protein sequence to human, to enable translational models. In more challenging settings, where this is not possible because of the lack of an acceptable preclinical species, the use of humanized mice may be required (30Shultz L.D. Ishikawa F. Greiner D.L. Humanized mice in translational biomedical research.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In our own efforts to combat the issue of speciation, we identified an acceptable species for PK/PD studies, in which the FLAP protein sequence is highly homologous to human, enabling an alternative preclinical development pathway to enable the advancement of an unprecedented series of FLAP inhibitors. Thus, we established a canine whole blood assay, the results from which correlated well with the human whole blood assay, thereby providing a workable translational component to our compound advancement paradigm (Table 2 and Fig. 5). In a particularly compelling example for comparison to our findings, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 inhibitors also demonstrated a dramatic loss in activity when tested in rodents (29Xu D. Rowland S.E. Clark P. Giroux A. Côté B. Guiral S. Salem M. Ducharme Y. Friesen R.W. Méthot N. Mancini J. Audoly L. Riendeau D. MF63 [2-(6-chloro-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)-isophthalonitrile], a selective microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 inhibitor, relieves pyresis and pain in preclinical models of inflammation.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 326: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). With this case, it was shown that in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 of rats and mice, residues 131, 135, and 138 of TM4 block inhibitor access to the enzyme active site, rendering compounds identified by their activity against the human protein, inactive in these two rodent species (31Pawelzik S.C. Uda N.R. Spahiu L. Jegerschöld C. Stenberg P. Hebert H. Morgenstern R. Jakobsson P.J.

Chem. 2010; 285: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To establish translational models in which to test compounds, the authors generated a human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 transgenic mouse strain. An interesting point arises from this comparison in that, for well validated targets for which there is clinical experience, more simplistic translational studies such as whole blood assays coupled with PK/PD can satisfy the institutional requirements for compound advancement. However, for new targets with poorly understood mechanisms of action and no clinical experience, more involved methods are required, such as the use of knock-in mice or exotic species with appropriate sequence homology. In conclusion, we have identified a key residue in mouse FLAP that appears to prevent access of novel biaryl amino-heteroarene-based inhibitors to the previously described small molecule binding pocket of the protein. Computational studies coupled with mutational analyses have demonstrated that Ala24 in mouse FLAP is likely the residue responsible for this speciation effect because of a significant alteration in the floor of the binding pocket. Because both the mouse and rat orthologs contain this amino acid substitution, we adopted alternative methods for compound advancement and successfully implemented a canine whole blood assay and canine PK/PD procedures that enabled the advanced profiling of lead compounds.

https://openalex.org/W2344715629,"Myosin-5a contains two heavy chains, which are dimerized via the coiled-coil regions. Thus, myosin-5a comprises two heads and two globular tail domains (GTDs). The GTD is the inhibitory domain that binds to the head and inhibits its motor function. Although the two-headed structure is essential for the processive movement of myosin-5a along actin filaments, little is known about the role of GTD dimerization. Here, we investigated the effect of GTD dimerization on its inhibitory activity. We found that the potent inhibitory activity of the GTD is dependent on its dimerization by the preceding coiled-coil regions, indicating synergistic interactions between the two GTDs and the two heads of myosin-5a. Moreover, we found that alanine mutations of the two conserved basic residues at N-terminal extension of the GTD not only weaken the inhibitory activity of the GTD but also enhance the activation of myosin-5a by its cargo-binding protein melanophilin (Mlph). These results are consistent with the GTD forming a head to head dimer, in which the N-terminal extension of the GTD interacts with the Mlph-binding site in the counterpart GTD. The Mlph-binding site at the GTD-GTD interface must be exposed prior to the binding of Mlph. We therefore propose that the inhibited Myo5a is equilibrated between the folded state, in which the Mlph-binding site is buried, and the preactivated state, in which the Mlph-binding site is exposed, and that Mlph is able to bind to the Myo5a in preactivated state and activates its motor function."
https://openalex.org/W2337632357,"We previously established a mechanism of negative regulation of transforming growth factor β signaling mediated by the nuclear ADP-ribosylating enzyme poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and the deribosylating enzyme poly-(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), which dynamically regulate ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 and Smad4, two central signaling proteins of the pathway. Here we demonstrate that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway can also be regulated by the opposing actions of PARP1 and PARG. PARG positively contributes to BMP signaling and forms physical complexes with Smad5 and Smad4. The positive role PARG plays during BMP signaling can be neutralized by PARP1, as demonstrated by experiments where PARG and PARP1 are simultaneously silenced. In contrast to PARG, ectopic expression of PARP1 suppresses BMP signaling, whereas silencing of endogenous PARP1 enhances signaling and BMP-induced differentiation. The two major Smad proteins of the BMP pathway, Smad1 and Smad5, interact with PARP1 and can be ADP-ribosylated in vitro, whereas PARG causes deribosylation. The overall outcome of this mode of regulation of BMP signal transduction provides a fine-tuning mechanism based on the two major enzymes that control cellular ADP-ribosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2339570472,"SIN3 is a transcriptional corepressor that acts as a scaffold for a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. The SIN3 complex regulates various biological processes, including organ development, cell proliferation, and energy metabolism. Little is known, however, about the regulation of SIN3 itself. There are two major isoforms of Drosophila SIN3, 187 and 220, which are differentially expressed. Intrigued by the developmentally timed exchange of SIN3 isoforms, we examined whether SIN3 187 controls the fate of the 220 counterpart. Here, we show that in developing tissue, there is interplay between SIN3 isoforms: when SIN3 187 protein levels increase, SIN3 220 protein decreases concomitantly. SIN3 187 has a dual effect on SIN3 220. Expression of 187 leads to reduced 220 transcript, while also increasing the turnover of SIN3 220 protein by the proteasome. These data support the presence of a novel, inter-isoform-dependent mechanism that regulates the amount of SIN3 protein, and potentially the level of specific SIN3 complexes, during distinct developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2342983482,"Eukaryotic topoisomerase 2 (Top2) and one of its interacting partners, topoisomerase IIβ binding protein 1 (TopBP1) are two proteins performing essential cellular functions. We mapped the interacting domains of these two proteins using co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments with truncated or mutant Drosophila Top2 with various Ser-to-Ala substitutions. We discovered that the last 20 amino acids of Top2 represent the key region for binding with Mus101 (the Drosophila homolog of TopBP1) and that phosphorylation of Ser-1428 and Ser-1443 is important for Top2 to interact with the N terminus of Mus101, which contains the BRCT1/2 domains. The interaction between Mus101 and the Top2 C-terminal regulatory domain is phosphorylation-dependent because treatment with phosphatase abolishes their association in pulldown assays. The binding affinity of N-terminal Mus101 with a synthetic phosphorylated peptide spanning the last 25 amino acids of Top2 (with Ser(P)-1428 and Ser(P)-1443) was determined by surface plasmon resonance with a Kd of 0.57 μm In an in vitro decatenation assay, Mus101 can specifically reduce the decatenation activity of Top2, and dephosphorylation of Top2 attenuates this response. Next, we endeavored to establish a cellular system for testing the biological function of Top2-Mus101 interaction. Top2-silenced S2 cells rescued by Top2Δ20, Top2 with 20 amino acids truncated from the C terminus, developed abnormally high chromosome numbers, which implies that Top2-Mus101 interaction is important for maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis."
