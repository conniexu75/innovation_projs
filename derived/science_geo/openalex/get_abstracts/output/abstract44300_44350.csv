https://openalex.org/W1982061874,"Cell division is arrested in many organisms in response to DNA damage. Examinations of the genetic basis for this response in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the RAD9 gene product is essential for arrest of cell division induced by DNA damage. Wild-type haploid cells irradiated with x-rays either arrest or delay cell division in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Irradiated G1 and M phase haploid cells arrest irreversibly in G2 and die, whereas irradiated G2 phase haploid cells delay in G2 for a time proportional to the extent of damage before resuming cell division. In contrast, irradiated rad9 cells in any phase of the cycle do not delay cell division in G2, but continue to divide for several generations and die. However, efficient DNA repair can occur in irradiated rad9 cells if irradiated cells are blocked for several hours in G2 by treatment with a microtubule poison. The RAD9-dependent response detects potentially lethal DNA damage and causes arrest of cells in G2 until such damage is repaired."
https://openalex.org/W2102242413,"In the fission yeast S. pombe, the Mr = 34 kd product of the cdc2+ gene (p34cdc2) is a protein kinase that controls entry into mitosis. In Xenopus oocytes and other cells, maturation-promoting factor (MPF) appears in late G2 phase and is able to cause entry into mitosis. Purified MPF consists of two major proteins of Mr approximately equal to 32 kd and 45 kd and expresses protein kinase activity. We report here that antibodies to S. pombe p34cdc2 are able to immunoblot and immunoprecipitate the approximately equal to 32 kd component of MPF from Xenopus eggs. The Mr approximately equal to 32 kd and 45 kd proteins exist as a complex that expresses protein kinase activity. These findings indicate that a Xenopus p34cdc2 homolog is present in purified MPF and suggest that p34cdc2 is a component of the control mechanism initiating mitosis generally in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2117939247,"In Xenopus, a cytoplasmic agent known as MPF induces entry into mitosis. In fission yeast, genetic studies have shown that the cdc2 kinase regulates mitotic initiation. The 13 kd product of the suc1 gene interacts with the cdc2 kinase in yeast cells. We show that the yeast suc1 gene product (p13) is a potent inhibitor of MPF in cell-free extracts from Xenopus eggs. p13 appears to exert its antagonistic effect by binding directly to MPF. MPF activity is quantitatively depleted by chromatography on a p13 affinity column. Concomitantly, the Xenopus counterpart of the yeast cdc2 protein is adsorbed to the column. A 42 kd protein also binds specifically to the p13 affinity matrix. These findings suggest that the Xenopus cdc2 protein and the 42 kd protein are components of MPF."
https://openalex.org/W2056020967,"A 27-base-long DNA oligonucleotide was designed that binds to duplex DNA at a single site within the 5' end of the human c-myc gene, 115 base pairs upstream from the transcription origin P1. On the basis of the physical properties of its bound complex, it was concluded that the oligonucleotide forms a colinear triplex with the duplex binding site. By means of an in vitro assay system, it was possible to show a correlation between triplex formation at -115 base pairs and repression of c-myc transcription. The possibility is discussed that triplex formation (site-specific RNA binding to a DNA duplex) could serve as the basis for an alternative program of gene control in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518640128,"Abstract We have purified two high molecular weight proteases approximately 400-fold from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Both enzymes hydrolyze 125I-alpha-casein and 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide peptides with tyrosine, phenylalanine, or arginine at the P1 position. Both are inhibited by hemin, thiol reagents, chymostatin, and leupeptin. They differ, however, by other criteria. Degradation of 125I-lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates and succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide by the larger 26 S protease is stimulated by ATP. Based on sedimentation, gel filtration, and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the ATP-dependent protease has a molecular weight of 1,000,000 +/- 100,000 and is a multisubunit complex. The smaller 20 S protease has a molecular weight of 700,000 +/- 20,000 and is composed of 8-10 separate subunits with Mr values between 21,000 and 32,000. It does not require nucleotides for degradation of protein or peptide substrates. This smaller enzyme is similar, if not identical, to the multicatalytic proteinase complex first described by Wilk and Orlowski (Wilk, S., and Orlowski, M. (1983) J. Neurochem. 40, 842-849)."
https://openalex.org/W1976981613,"We have characterized a pre-Golgi, proteolytic pathway for rapid degradation of newly synthesized T cell receptor (TCR) subunits which is insensitive to drugs that block lysosomal proteolysis. The site of degradation in this pathway is either part of or closely related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This “ER” degradative pathway very likely plays an important role in many cells in the removal of unassembled or incompletely assembled membrane protein complexes from the secretory pathway. It is the sole pathway followed by TCR α chains and α-β complexes in transfected fibroblasts. In T cells treated with ionophores, which disrupt transport of the TCR from the ER to the Golgi, all newly synthesized α, β, and δ chains are destroyed by this pathway. A variety of biochemical and morphological techniques have been used to distinguish the “ER” degradative pathway from an alternative, lysosomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1676178724,"Escherichia coli murein, the polymer from which the shape-maintaining structure of the cell envelope is made, shows unexpected complexity. The separation of murein building blocks with high performance liquid chromatography reveals about 80 different types of muropeptides. Their behavior in high performance liquid chromatography and their chemical structure are described. The complexity of E. coli murein is due to the free combination of seven different types of side chains (L-Ala-D-Glu-R with R = -OH, -m-A2pm, -m-A2pm-D-Ala, -m-A2 pm-Gly, -m-A2pm-D-Ala-D-Ala, -m-A2pm-D-Ala-Gly, -m-A2pm-Lys-Arg) with two types of cross-bridges (D-Ala-m-A2pm, -m-A2pm-m-A2pm). The novel type of cross-bridge, A2pm-A2pm, contains an L,D-peptide bond, as shown by Edman degradation and chemical analysis of the reaction products. The A2pm-A2pm cross-bridge is assumed to play a role in the adaptation of the cross-linkage of murein to different growth conditions of the cell. The structural data of E. coli murein agree best with a model of a thin, however multilayered, murein sacculus."
https://openalex.org/W2052639804,"The brlA gene of A. nidulans mediates the developmental switch from the indeterminate, apical growth pattern of vegetative cells to the budding growth pattern of conidiophores. brlA encodes a 432 amino acid polypeptide containing two directly repeated motifs resembling the Zn(II) coordination sites first recognized in Xenopus TFIIIA. Misscheduled expression of brlA in vegetative cells results in transcriptional activation of developmentally regulated genes, cessation of unidirectional hyphal growth, initiation of cellular transformations resembling those that occur during normal conidiophore development, and production of viable conidiospores. We propose that BRLA is a nucleic acid-binding protein whose expression in vegetative cells is sufficient to induce sporulation through its role in regulating expression of conidiation-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1965334884,"A physical map of a genome is the structure of its DNA. Construction of such a map is a first step in the complete characterization of that DNA. The restriction endonuclease Not I cuts the genome of Escherichia coli K12 into 22 DNA fragments ranging from 20 kilobases (20,000 base pairs) to 1000 kilobases. These can be separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The order of the fragments in the genome was determined from available E. coli genetic information and analysis of partial digest patterns. The resulting ordered set of fragments is a macrorestriction map. This map facilitates genetic and molecular studies on E. coli, and its construction serves as a model for further endeavors on larger genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2040734916,"In wild-type yeast the action of the transcriptional activator GAL4 is inhibited by GAL80, and galactose relieves this inhibition. We show that deletion mutants of GAL4 lacking 30 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus activate transcription constitutively, whereas other deletion mutants bearing the carboxy-terminal 30 amino acids are inhibited by GAL80. Moreover, GAL4 fragments bearing these 30 amino acids, when expressed from a strong promoter on multicopy plasmids, free the endogenous GAL4 from inhibition by GAL80. These and other results suggest that GAL80 recognizes the carboxy-terminal 30 amino acids of GAL4, forming a complex that, though bound to DNA, does not activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2081446575,"Transport of alpha-factor precursor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus has been reconstituted in gently lysed yeast spheroplasts. Transport is measured through the coupled addition of outer-chain carbohydrate to [35S]methionine-labeled alpha-factor precursor translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum of broken spheroplasts. The reaction is absolutely dependent on ATP, stimulated 6-fold by cytosol, and occurs between physically separable sealed compartments. Transport is inhibited by the guanine nucleotide analog GTP gamma S. sec23 mutant cells have a temperature-sensitive defect in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport in vivo. This defect has been reproduced in vitro using sec23 membranes and cytosol. Transport at 30 degrees C with sec23 membranes requires addition of cytosol containing the SEC23 (wild-type) gene product. This demonstrates that an in vitro inter-organelle transport reaction depends on a factor required for transport in vivo. Complementation of sec mutations in vitro provides a functional assay for the purification of individual intercompartmental transport factors."
https://openalex.org/W1979266650,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the complete sequence of the heavy chain of tissue factor (TF), the high-affinity receptor responsible for cellular initiation of the coagulation protease cascade. An 885 bp open reading frame encodes a 295 amino acid polypeptide including a leader sequence with alternative cleavage sites. A single 2.3 kb mRNA is identified, and Southern blotting is consistent with a single gene. The coding sequence defines a protein with features characteristic of an integral membrane protein. This receptor appears novel, lacking significant homology with other proteins; however, TF contains the uncommon tryptophan-lysine-serine (WKS) sequence repeated three times, a sequence we find in some serine protease-binding proteins and suggest may represent a functional sequence motif."
https://openalex.org/W1593378565,"Incubation of molybdate-stabilized L cell cytosol with a monoclonal antibody directed against the 100-kDa glucocorticoid-binding protein causes the immune-specific adsorption to protein A-Sepharose of both the 100-kDa glucocorticoid receptor and the 90-kDa murine heat shock protein (hsp90) (Sanchez, E. R., Toft, D. O., Schlesinger, M. J., and Pratt, W. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12398-12401). When the glucocorticoid receptor in cytosol is transformed to the DNA-binding state, hsp90 dissociates. In this paper, we show that temperature-mediated dissociation of hsp90 from the receptor is a hormone-dependent event in the same manner as temperature-mediated transformation to the DNA-binding state. In contrast to temperature-mediated transformation, ammonium sulfate causes both dissociation of hsp90 from the receptor and conversion of the receptor to the DNA-binding form in a manner that does not require the presence of steroid. The untransformed form of the glucocorticoid receptor and the strongly negatively charged hsp90 protein behave similarly on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, suggesting that the hsp90 component may contribute significantly to the net negative charge behavior of the non-DNA-binding form of the receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1976482662,"A protein corresponding to the putative protease of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) has been prepared by total chemical synthesis. This 99 residue synthetic enzyme showed specific proteolytic activity on fragments of the natural gag precursor and on synthetic peptide substrates, two of which released fragments corresponding to the N terminus and C terminus of the protease molecule itself. The observed substrate specificity was not restricted to cleavage at bonds. Inhibition studies provided direct evidence that the HIV-1 protease belongs to the family of aspartic proteases. The availability of the HIV-1 protease as a defined molecular species has important implications for the design of specific inhibitors that do not interfere with the host cell metabolism as a possible route to antiviral agents against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."

https://openalex.org/W2006164030,"Transcriptional regulation in the galactose regulon of yeast is determined by an interplay between a positive regulatory protein, GAL4, and a negative regulatory protein, GAL80. We show that derivatives of GAL4 missing as few as 28 carboxy-terminal amino acids are not responsive to GAL80 regulation, implying that the carboxyl terminus of GAL4 is required for interaction with GAL80. Furthermore, a lesion in GAL4 that genetically defines the GAL80-interactive region maps to the 3′ end of the gene. Since the carboxyl terminus of GAL4 has also been implicated in interaction with a transcriptional factor, we propose a model for negative regulation in which GAL80 and this factor compete for binding a common region of GAL4, and the on/off state of transcription is determined by the relative affinities of the negative regulator and the transcriptional factor for this region."
https://openalex.org/W2082856106,"Partial deletion of the exon 5' to S. cerevisiae intron a5, a self-splicing mitochondrial class II intron, reveals the existence of several sites of intron-exon interaction. We have identified two of the corresponding exon-binding sites in intron a5 by comparative sequence analysis and RNAase H digestion of the intron complexed to a DNA version of its 5' exon. Introduction of mutations in either the intronic sites or the complementary exonic sequences affects splicing in vitro, whereas double mutants in which intron-exon pairings have been restored show normal activity. Some of the mutants accumulate a product that was shown to be the intron-3' exon lariat, a postulated splicing intermediate. The possible role of one of the intronic sites in aligning exons for the ligation step is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2156318036,"A method has been developed for the positional 13C isotope analysis of pyruvate and acetate by stepwise quantitative degradation. On its base, the kinetic isotope effects on the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (enzymes from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for both of the carbon atoms involved in the bond scission (double isotope effect determination) and on C-3 of pyruvate have been determined. The experimental k12/k13 values with the enzyme from E. coli on C-1 and C-2 of pyruvate are 1.0093 +/- 0.0007 and 1.0213 +/- 0.0017, respectively, and, with the enzyme from S. cerevisiae, the values are 1.0238 +/- 0.0013 and 1.0254 +/- 0.0016, respectively. A secondary isotope effect of 1.0031 +/- 0.0009 on C-3 (CH3-group) was found with both enzymes. The size of the isotope on C-1 indicates that decarboxylation is more rate-determining with the yeast enzyme than with the enzyme from E. coli, although it is not the entirely rate-limiting step in the overall reaction sequence. Assuming appropriate values for the intrinsic isotope effect on the decarboxylation step (k3) and the equilibrium isotope effect on the reversible substrate binding (k1, k2), one can calculate values for the partitioning factor R (k3/k2: E. coli enzyme 4.67, S. cerevisiae enzyme 1.14) and the intrinsic isotope effects related to the carbonyl-C (k1/k'1 = 1.019; k3/k'3 = 1.033). The isotope fractionation at C-2 of pyruvate gives strong evidence that the well known relative carbon-13 depletion in lipids from biological material is mainly caused by the isotope effect on the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. In addition, our results indicate an alternating 13C abundance in fatty acids, that has already been verified in some cases."
https://openalex.org/W2007968090,"Mammalian cell lines (BSC-40, NG108-15, and GH4C1) that cannot process the murine neuroendocrine peptide precursor prepro-opiomelanocortin (mPOMC) when its synthesis is directed by a vaccinia virus vector were coinfected with a second recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the yeast KEX2 gene, which encodes an endopeptidase that cleaves at pairs of basic amino acid residues. mPOMC was cleaved intracellularly to a set of product peptides normally found in vivo, including mature gamma-lipotropin and beta-endorphin1-31. In GH4C1 cells (a rat pituitary line), product peptides were incorporated into stored secretory granules. These results suggest that the inability of any particular cell line to process a prohormone precursor is due to the absence of a suitable endogenous processing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2101450731,"The first condensation reaction in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli was rate-limiting as judged by analysis of the relative pool sizes of acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioester intermediates in vivo. Comparable concentrations of acetyl-ACP, malonyl-ACP, and nonesterified ACP were present during logarithmic growth, whereas long-chain acyl-ACP comprised a minor fraction of the total ACP pool. The antibiotic cerulenin was used to irreversibly inhibit both beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II. However, acyl-ACP formation in vivo was not blocked by this antibiotic, and short-chain (4-8-carbon) acyl-ACPs increased to 60% of the total ACP pool in cerulenin-treated cells. These data suggested that existence of a cerulenin-resistant condensing enzyme that was capable of catalyzing the initial steps in chain elongation. A unique enzymatic activity, acetoacetyl-ACP synthase, that specifically catalyzed the condensation of malonyl-ACP and acetyl-ACP was detected in E. coli cell extracts. Acetoacetyl-ACP synthase activity was not inhibited by cerulenin and was present in extracts prepared from a double mutant harboring genetic lesions in beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II (fabB20 fabF3). These data point to the condensation of malonyl-ACP and acetyl-ACP as the rate-controlling reaction in fatty acid biosynthesis and implicate acetoacetyl-ACP synthase as the pacemaker of fatty acid production in organisms and organelles that possess dissociated (Type II) fatty acid synthase systems."
https://openalex.org/W2065102718,"Most epithelial sheets emerge during embryogenesis by a branching and growth of the epithelium. The surrounding mesenchyme is crucial for this process. We report that branching morphogenesis and the formation of a new epithelium from the mesenchyme in the embryonic kidney can be blocked by a monoclonal antibody reacting with a surface glycolipid, disialoganglioside GD3. In contrast, a more than 10-fold excess of antibodies to adhesive glycoproteins (N-CAM, L -CAM, fibronectin) fails to inhibit morphogenesis. Although the anti-GD3 antibody affected epithelial development, the disialoganglioside GD3 was expressed not in the epithelium, but in the mesenchyme surrounding the developing epithelia. The data raise the intriguing possibility that the anti-GD3 antibody inhibits epithelial development by interfering with epithelial-mesenchymal interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1514938122,"We have derived oligosaccharides from the capsular polysaccharide of type III group B Streptococcus by enzymatic hydrolysis of a specific backbone glycosidic bond utilizing an endo-beta-galactosidase from Flavobacterium keratolyticus. Enzymatic digestion of the polysaccharide produced oligosaccharide fragments of one or more pentasaccharide repeating units. On the basis of 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and methylation analyses, it was established that the smallest digestion fragment was alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2→3)-beta-D-Galp-(1→4)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1→6)]- beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1→3)-beta-D-Gal. The isolation of this oligosaccharide is consistent with the susceptibility of the beta-D-Galp-(1→4)-beta-D-Glcp linkage in the backbone of the type III group B streptococcal polysaccharide and confirms that the polysaccharide is composed of a pentasaccharide repeating unit. High resolution 13C NMR spectroscopic studies indicated that, as in the case of the pentasaccharide, the terminal sialic acid residues of the type III group B streptococcal polysaccharide were linked to O-3 and not to O-6 of its branch beta-D-galactopyranosyl residues as had been previously reported (Jennings, H. J., Rosell, K.-G., and Kasper, D. L. (1980) Can. J. Chem. 58, 112-120). This linkage was confirmed in an independent methylation analysis of the type III group B streptococcal polysaccharide. Thin layer chromatogram binding assay and radioactive antigen binding assays with radiolabeled oligosaccharides demonstrated the single repeating unit pentasaccharide oligosaccharide to be poorly antigenic. Increasing oligosaccharide size to a decasaccharide consisting of two repeating units resulted in an 8-fold increase in antigen binding in the direct radioactive antigen binding assay. The results suggest that a region of the immunodeterminant site critical for antibody binding is located in the backbone of the polysaccharide and involves the beta-D-galactopyranose-(1→4) beta-D-glucopyranose bond."
https://openalex.org/W1604326532,"The mechanisms by which insulin deficiency affects muscle glucose transport were investigated. Epitrochlearis muscles from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and from controls were incubated in vitro for 0.5-14 h. The incubation was shown not to impair muscle energy stores or tissue oxygenation. Diabetes decreased basal 3-O-methylglucose transport by 40% (p less than 0.01), and insulin-stimulated (20 milli-units/ml) glucose transport capacity by 70% (p less than 0.001). In vitro incubation gradually normalized insulin responsiveness (3.77 +/- 0.38 before versus 8.97 +/- 0.65 mumol X ml-1 X h-1 after 12 h of incubation). Basal glucose transport remained significantly reduced. The reversal of the insulin responsiveness did not require the presence of rat serum and, furthermore, took place even in the absence of insulin. In fact, insulin responsiveness was higher after incubation (14 h) with no insulin than with 100 microunits/ml insulin (9.85 +/- 0.59 versus 8.06 +/- 0.59 mumol X ml-1 X h-1, p less than 0.05). Glucose at 30 mM did not affect the normalization of the insulin-stimulated glucose transport capacity, whereas incubation in serum from diabetic rats resulted in a slightly (26%) blunted reversal (7.60 +/- 0.39 versus 8.89 +/- 0.45 mumol X ml-1 X h-1 with diabetic versus control serum for 14 h, p less than 0.05; before incubation the value was 3.87 +/- 0.40). Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide blocked the normalization by 80%. These results suggest the presence in diabetic serum of some labile factor that might inhibit the glucose transport system. The results indicate that the decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport capacity, in the insulin-deficient diabetic muscle, is not a direct consequence of the lack of insulin or of high glucose concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2149795002,"The kinetics of inhibitor binding to highly purified recombinant human dihydrofolate reductase (rHDHFR) have been examined. Methotrexate (MTX) binds rapidly (kon = 1.0 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) and tightly (koff/kon = 210 pM) to the preformed complex of rHDHFR with NADPH. The initial association reaction between rHDHFR.NADPH and MTX is followed by an isomerization of the resulting complex (kiso = 0.4 s-1) leading to a new conformer in which MTX is bound even more tightly (Ki = 3.4 pM). Similar results have been obtained with a major metabolite of MTX having four additional glutamate residues for which Ki = 1.4 pM. 7-HydroxyMTX, another major metabolite of MTX, is a weak inhibitor of rHDHFR (Ki = 8.9 nM), and a polyglutamate form of this metabolite is an equally weak inhibitor (Ki = 9.9 nM), so that the addition of glutamate residues to MTX or 7-hydroxyMTX has little effect on their binding. It follows that the significance of MTX polyglutamate formation relates to other roles such as increasing the cytotoxicity of MTX by prolonging intracellular retention of the drug. Another antifolate, trimethoprim, binds tightly to dihydrofolate reductases from bacterial sources, but weakly to rHDHFR in the ternary complex (KD = 0.5 microM). Although the association step is rapid (kon = 0.4 x 10(8) M-1 s-1), the dissociation rate is also rapid (koff = 15 s-1). Furthermore, there is no isomerization of the ternary complex of trimethoprim with rHDHFR, in contrast to the known isomerization of complexes of trimethoprim with bacterial dihydrofolate reductases."
https://openalex.org/W2003531942,"Recent advances in delineating the molecular biology of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have led to innovative approaches to development of a vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, the lack of understanding of mechanisms of protective immunity against HIV-1, the magnitude of genetic variation of the virus, and the lack of effective animal models for HIV-1 infection and AIDS have impeded progress. The testing of AIDS vaccines also presents challenges. These include liability concerns over vaccine-related injuries; identification of suitable populations for phase 3 efficacy studies; balancing the ethical obligation to counsel research subjects to avoid high-risk behavior with the necessity to obtain vaccine efficacy data; and the effect of vaccine-induced seroconversion on the recruiting and welfare of trial volunteers. Several candidate AIDS vaccines are nevertheless currently under development, and some are undergoing phase 1 clinical trials. Rapid progress will depend on continued scientific advancement in conjunction with maximum use of resources, open information and reagent exchange, and a spirit of international collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2023459169,"Gene expression is regulated at many levels, including chromatin structure, transcription initiation, RNA processing, and translation. Recently, a novel mechanism of regulation has been described in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes that involves the synthesis of a single protein from two separate reading frames on an RNA template. The coupling of these reading frames requires that the ribosome correctly shift from one reading frame to the other at a discrete position on the mRNA so as to avoid premature termination of polypeptide synthesis. How the ribosome accomplishes this feat is of interest because it promises to shed light on how the ribosome normally maintains the correct reading frame. The rate of spontaneous frameshifting is usually extremely low, but the recent identification of high-frequency frameshifts demonstrates that the r ibosome’s faithfulness to the reading frame is not absolute. Eukaryotic Systems Frameshifting by eukaryotic r ibosomes has been described in two separate but related systems: in translation of retroviral transcripts, and in translation of the Ty transposon transcripts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the case of retroviruses the most complete description of frameshifting has been provided by Jacks and Varmus (Science 230, 1237-1242, 1985), studying expression of the gag-pal polyprotein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). In many retroviruses the pal gene encodes the integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase enzymes, which are synthesized as a carboxy-terminal fusion protein with the gag gene product; the fusion protein undergoes posttranslational cleavage to form the active enzymes. Since thepolgene is in the -1 reading frame with respect to the gag gene, and since the products of pal apparently do not arise from independent translation initiation events on the mRNA, expression of the gene must depend on either a splicing event or a ribosomal frameshift. Strong evidence for the frameshifting model was provided by synthesizing RNA in vitro from the RSV genomic template and translating the RNA (containing the out-offrame reading frames) in a reticulocyte lysate (Jacks and Varmus, op. cit.). This experiment showed that a single template produces the gag-pal polyprotein, and further that the frameshift is dependent on the template itself and not on factors found in the infected cell. By comparing the amount of gag protein to gag-pal polyprotein it was concluded that frameshifting occurs at a frequency of approximately 5%. More recent data suggest that similar frameshift events occur with other retroviral transcripts, including those of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) (Yoshinaka et al., J. Virol. 57, 826-832, 1986), human T cell leukemia Minireview"
https://openalex.org/W7286325,"To investigate the role of subunit communication in the insulin binding and tyrosine-specific protein kinase activities of the purified human placental insulin receptor, we have developed the methodology to isolate a functional alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptor complex from the native alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric disulfide-linked state. The dissociation of the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor into an alpha beta heterodimer was found to be approximately 50% efficient by treatment with alkaline pH (8.75) and dithiothreitol (2 mM). Removal of the dithiothreitol and pH neutralization (pH 7.60) by rapid Sephadex G-50 gel filtration resulted in the preservation of tracer insulin binding activity. The nondissociated alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric and alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptor complexes could then be effectively separated by Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration. Scatchard analyses of insulin binding to the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric control or dithiothreitol-treated but nondissociated alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor complexes demonstrated a curvilinear binding isotherm with a maximum of 1 mol of insulin bound/mol of alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex. However, binding analyses performed on the isolated alpha beta heterodimeric complex yielded a nearly linear binding curve also, with 1 mol of insulin bound/mol of alpha beta heterodimeric complex at saturation. These data demonstrate that the insulin half-site binding reactivity observed in the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor complex results from either an asymmetric assembly of identical alpha beta heterodimers or from absolute negative cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W2016165380,"The aspartate and maltose responses of E. coli are mediated through a single membrane receptor, yet the responses are independent and additive. Both stimuli cause methylation of the same 4 glutamic acid residues. More extensive methylation occurs when a cell that has adapted to one stimulus is exposed to the second, or when both stimuli are added simultaneously. The degree of methylation, as well as receptor migration on two-dimensional gels, demonstrates that only one type of protein is involved, rather than two different receptors arising from differential processing of a single gene. A conformational “push-pull” mechanism in which binding of stimulus and covalent modification, producing opposing stresses, can explain these diverse results."
https://openalex.org/W104325155,"The cloning of the gene for staphylococcal nuclease A in the pIN-III-OmpA secretion vector results in a hybrid protein which is processed by signal peptidase I, yielding an active form of the nuclease that is secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane (Takahara, M., Hibler, D., Barr, P. J., Gerlt, J. A., and Inouye, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2670-2674). Using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, we have constructed a set of mutants at the cleavage site area of the precursor hybrid protein designed to alter progressively the predicted secondary structure of the cleavage site. Our results show that processing becomes increasingly defective as the turn probability decreases. These results are consistent with the structural requirement that we found for the processing of lipoprotein by signal peptidase II (Inouye, S., Duffaud, G., and Inouye, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10970-10975).

When the processing of the gene products was analyzed in Escherichia coli cells, the rate of processing of the mutant staphylokinase precursor decreased as the net charge became more negative. A net positive charge, but not specific amino acid residues, was required on the amino-terminal segment for efficient processing. Staphylokinase precursor having a net negative charge accumulated in the cytoplasm, tending to bind to the cytoplasmic membrane as determined by subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy. Although a mutant carrying an amino acid substitution in the hydrophobic segment and wild-type staphylokinases had an interfering effect on the processing of other normal secreted proteins, this effect was lost when they also contained charge-altering substitutions in the amino-terminal region. From these results, we concluded that a positive charge on the amino-terminal segment of the staphylokinase signal peptide is required for entrance into the protein export process."

Short-column equilibrium experiments at concentrations in the range 0.015-0.12% at pH 8.5 in 0.04 M Tris/Tris-HCl gave molecular weights corresponding to 3 times the sequence molecular weight both in the presence and absence of 0.1 M NaCl. Long (2.6 mm)-column experiments under the same solvent conditions indicated molecular weights of 51,900 +/- 900 in the absence of added NaCl and 52,600 +/- 700 in the presence of added 0.1 M NaCl. No evidence of any species other than the trimer was found."
https://openalex.org/W1553957248,"The denaturation behavior of bovine lens gamma-crystallin fractions II, III, and IV and their susceptibility to proteolysis in vitro was compared to determine whether differences in their stability could play a role in cataract formation. Tertiary and secondary structure changes induced by increasing concentrations of urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and sodium dodecyl sulfate and by increasingly alkaline pH were followed by near-UV and far-UV circular dichroism, Trp fluorescence emission, and exposure of sulfhydryl groups. Major differences were found in the denaturation and proteolysis behavior of the three gamma-crystallin fractions. In general, the unfolding of gamma-II and gamma-III crystallins is rather gradual, suggesting the presence of intermediate unfolding states; in contrast, the order-disorder transition of gamma-IV crystallin is abrupt. The gamma-IV crystallin fraction is the most stable in urea and guanidine hydrochloride, but is most susceptible to nonspecific proteolysis and alkaline pH denaturation. Differences in denaturation and proteolysis behavior are attributed to the inherent differences in the tertiary structures of these crystallins."

https://openalex.org/W312775700,"Fluid phase interactions between arterial endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) have been studied in vitro to assess the regulation of lipid metabolism in SMC (Hajjar, D. P., Falcone, D. J., Amberson, J. B., and Hefton, J. M. (1985) J. Lipid Res. 26, 1212-1223; Davies, P. F., Truskey, G. A., Warren, H. B., O'Connor, S. E., and Eisenhaure, B. H. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 101, 871-879). To identify EC-derived agonists which may modulate cholesterol metabolism in co-cultured SMC, we assessed the role of EC-derived eicosanoids and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in the regulation of cholesteryl ester (CE) hydrolysis in SMC. The major eicosanoids synthesized by EC include PGI2 and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and, to a lesser extent, prostaglandin E2. Exogenously added PGI2 and 12-HETE stimulated CE hydrolytic activity in SMC by 49 and 35%, respectively, when co-cultured with aspirin-treated EC. Aspirin-treated EC when co-cultured with SMC did not stimulate CE hydrolytic activity in SMC, as was the case with non-aspirin-treated EC, suggesting a role of eicosanoids in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Other humoral agents derived from EC such as PDGFc stimulated CE hydrolytic activity almost 2-fold in SMC cultured alone or co-cultured with EC. Aspirin-treated EC, incubated with 10 ng/ml PDGF, did not stimulate CE hydrolytic activity in co-cultured SMC. These results suggest that growth factor-promoting activity may enhance CE hydrolysis via the PGI2-cyclic AMP-CE hydrolysis cascade. This hypothesis supports our observations that PDGF stimulates PGI2 production in SMC. Elevated PGI2, in turn, can stimulate CE hydrolysis in these cells. Our findings suggest that the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in SMC can involve, at least in part, growth factors and EC-derived eicosanoids. These may play a central role in the regulation of hemostasis and the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1515256599,"We report biochemical, immunological, and genetic studies which demonstrate that an accessory protein with the essential features of mouse egasyn is complexed with and stabilizes a portion of beta-glucuronidase in microsomes of rat liver. The accessory protein exists as a complex with beta-glucuronidase since it coprecipitates with beta-glucuronidase after treatment of extracts with a specific beta-glucuronidase antibody. The two proteins are associated by noncovalent bonds since they are easily dissociated at elevated temperatures. Only 20-25% of total liver accessory protein is complexed with microsomal beta-glucuronidase. The remainder exists as a free form. The molecular weight of the accessory protein is 61 to 63 kDa depending upon the rat strain of origin. This protein, like mouse egasyn, has esterase catalytic activity and is concentrated in microsomes. The accessory protein is genetically polymorphic with at least four alleles. Combined biochemical and genetic evidence indicates it is identical with esterase-3 of the rat. Also, both mouse egasyn and rat esterase-3 react with antisera to egasyn and to rat esterase-3, indicating they are homologous proteins. Several inbred rat strains lack microsomal beta-glucuronidase. The same strains lack the accessory protein, suggesting that stabilization of beta-glucuronidase in rat microsomes requires egasyn."
https://openalex.org/W1510621682,"The genes encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (ileS) and prolipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) of Escherichia coli were previously shown to be co-transcribed (Miller, K. W., and Wu, H. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 389-393). However, the boundaries of this transcriptional unit have not been established. In this regard, DNA sequence determination has shown that ileS and lsp are closely flanked by four open reading frames, i.e. x-ileS-lsp-orf149-orf316-orf304. To define the boundaries of the operon, we applied Northern blotting hybridization and mRNA 5'-end mapping to analyze mRNA from a wild-type strain (SM31) and a mutant strain (SM31-2B4) that exhibits an increased expression of prolipoprotein signal peptidase. Four ileS-lsp co-transcripts were detected in RNA from the strain SM31. In addition to these four mRNAs, two new, highly abundant co-transcripts were also detected in RNA from the mutant. Based upon the determination of the 5'-ends of the mRNAs and analysis of their coding sequences, we conclude that the six mRNAs actually are comprised of three pairs of related mRNAs. The two mRNAs in a given pair have the same 5'-termini (all located upstream of or within gene x), but vary with respect to the identity of their 3'-terminal coding sequence (lsp or orf316). In conclusion, the ileS-lsp operon contains five genes, x-ileS-lsp-orf149-orf316, whose transcription probably is dependent upon promoter(s) located upstream of or within gene x. The next gene downstream, orf304, apparently does not reside in the operon."
https://openalex.org/W1571692640,"A simplified method is given for the purification of a 64-kilodalton protein kinase from spinach or pea thylakoid membranes (Coughlan, S., and Hind, G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11378-11385). In a heterogeneous reconstitution system comprised of purified kinase and washed thylakoids (having their intrinsic kinase inactivated or removed), endogenous light-harvesting pigment protein of photosystem II could serve as a substrate. Its phosphorylation did not require rebinding of kinase to the thylakoid membrane and, like the phosphorylation of solubilized pigment protein, was not under redox control. No reconstitution was observed upon replacing 64-kilodalton protein kinase with 25-kilodalton protein kinase (Coughlan, S., and Hind, G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14062-14068). Tryptic digestion of phosphorylated membranes removed the site of phosphorylation; the phosphorylated amino acid present in light-harvesting pigment protein and its tryptic peptide was threonine. Immunoglobulin from a polyclonal antiserum, raised against the purified enzyme, fully inhibited kinase activity toward solubilized and endogenous pigment protein. At higher titers, the antibody was effective in totally inhibiting the redox-sensitive phosphorylation of thylakoid proteins by endogenous kinase; inhibition profiles for phosphorylation of pigment protein and thylakoid proteins of 32, 16, and 9 kilodaltons were essentially identical. The 64-kilodalton protein kinase would thus appear to be responsible for all of the observed phosphorylation of thylakoid phosphoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1592148225,"The B-protein of phage Mu, which is required for high frequency intermolecular transposition in vivo, shows ATPase activity in vitro, binds nonspecifically to DNA, and stimulates intermolecular strand transfer. To elucidate the structural bases for B-protein function, it was subjected to limited proteolysis with two different proteases, trypsin and chymotrypsin. The resulting fragments were mapped by amino acid sequencing. These data show that the B-protein is organized in two domains: an amino-terminal domain of 25 kDa and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 8-kDa. A fragment analogous to the amino-terminal domain, produced by deleting the 3′ end of a cloned B gene, proved to be insoluble and had to be renatured after elution from a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. The renatured protein retains ATP-binding activity and to a lesser extent the DNA-binding activity of the MuB protein, but is unable to hydrolyze ATP or function in transposition. We also show in this study that efficient DNA-strand transfer by the B-protein occurs even in the absence of a detectable ATPase activity or in the presence of adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S)."

https://openalex.org/W1550113220,"Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was used to study the structure-function relationship of the positively charged amino terminus of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA signal peptide. Mutations were isolated which reduced the overall charge of the amino-terminal region from +2 (wild type) to +1, 0, and -1, as well as one mutation from Thr to Ser at position 4. DNA encoding the wild type and mutant OmpA signal peptides was then fused in-frame to DNA encoding the mature regions of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease A and TEM beta-lactamase. In the case of both the beta-lactamase and nuclease fusions, normal processing was no longer observed when the charge at the amino terminus was reduced to zero or made negative. Differences between the two hybrid proteins were observed in the case of the Thr to Ser mutation. As expected, this mutation had no effect on the beta-lactamase hybrid; however, the processing rate of the nuclease hybrid protein was reduced to nearly one-half. Furthermore, this effect was essentially reversed when a Lys residue at position 3 was deleted. A model is presented which explains the differing effects of a signal peptide mutation on the secretion of different hybrid proteins based on kinetic differences in the translocation of the nuclease and beta-lactamase proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1604914890,"Transcription in organelles is regulated by both organellar and nuclear mechanisms. In order to study further the control of organellar transcription, we have purified and characterized the RNA polymerase from mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified a transcription factor required for promoter recognition. The RNA polymerase can be separated into two forms, selective and nonselective. The nonselective form was purified over 11,000-fold and appears to be active as a monomer with a molecular weight of 150,000. The Mr 150,000 polypeptide acts as a core RNA polymerase, and an Mr 70,000 polypeptide appears to confer selectivity for the promoter upon this core. The Mr 70,000 transcription factor binds specifically to the mitochondrial initiation site in the absence of polymerase and decreases nonselective initiation by the polymerase. The Mr 150,000 polymerase is immunologically related to an Mr 145,000 protein purified from yeast as a primase, although it is thought to be a functional unit of mitochondrial RNA polymerase (Kelly, J. L., and Lehman, I. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10340-10347). Antibodies to the Mr 145,000 protein inhibit transcription by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase purified here."
https://openalex.org/W1570667960,"Dihydrofolate reductase from a methotrexate-resistant subline (R6) of L1210 mouse leukemia cells is activated (i.e. has its catalytic activity increased severalfold) by treatment with (a) sulfhydryl-modifying agents (p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB) or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid], (b) salts (KCl or NaCl), or (c) chaotropes (urea or guanidinium hydrochloride). With b or c activation is rapid (less than 10 s), but with a the process is much slower; at 25 degrees C, pseudo first-order rate constants for activation by excess pCMB or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) are 0.45 and 0.08 min-1, respectively. Activation can also be monitored by conformational changes in the protein as indicated by enhanced fluorescence of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate or by increased intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues in the enzyme. Pseudo first-order rate constants for the pCMB-induced conformational change, measured by these fluorimetric procedures (0.45 min-1 and about 0.4 min-1, respectively), are in good agreement with the value obtained from the increase in catalytic activity. The rate of modification of the single cysteine residue in the enzyme by excess 14C-labeled pCMB, however, is faster than the rate of activation, indicating that the conformational change follows derivatization and is the rate-limiting step in the overall process. Activated forms of the enzyme are more labile to thermal denaturation or proteolysis than the untreated enzyme; the former process, however, is retarded by the presence of bovine serum albumin. Activation by the various agents is considered to involve a common mechanism in which interaction of the enzyme with the agents is followed by conformational changes in the enzyme, producing a series of forms that differ in microstructure, catalytic activity, and lability."

This 24-kDa cytoplasmic protein is modified by a posttranslational methylation reaction. The modified residue has been identified by analysis of radioactively labeled protein from two-dimensional electrophoretograms and Edman degradation of CheZ protein isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-CheZ monoclonal antibodies. The methylated group is an N-monomethylmethionine residue at the amino terminus of CheZ. L16, a ribosomal protein that is required for peptidyltransferase activity during protein synthesis, is also methylated at its amino-terminal methionine (Chen, R., Brosius, J., and Wittmann-Liebold, B.

https://openalex.org/W190828209,"Insulin binding to rat liver plasma membranes promotes proteolysis of the Mr 135,000 alpha subunit of the insulin receptor to a fragment of Mr 120,000 (Lipson, K. E., Yamada, K., Kolhatkar, A. A., and Donner, D. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10833-10838). The enzyme that catalyzes this degradation copurifies with plasma membranes and cannot be identified in any other cellular organelle or in cytosol. The proteinase has optimal activity above pH 7 and is an integral protein based upon its resistance to extraction with 2 M NaCl. After affinity labeling, degraded insulin receptors were identified in plasma membranes isolated from a liver perfused with 1 nM 125I-insulin for 10 min at 37 degrees C, indicating that proteolysis occurs in the hepatocyte cell membrane under physiological conditions. Microsomes do not contain the receptor degrading activity or a detectable amount of degraded receptors under basal conditions. After perfusion of a liver with 125I-insulin, Mr 135,000 and Mr 120,000 complexes were detected in microsomes, suggesting that both intact and degraded receptors can be internalized. The initial absence of degraded receptors in plasma membranes suggests that, following internalization, such sites do not recycle. Thus, hormone-induced proteolysis of the insulin receptor begins at the surface of the rat hepatocyte and can lead to loss of receptors from the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1537618280,"The effects of ionic strength, MgATP, and phosphorylation on the degradation rates of heavy meromyosin (HMM) by papain have been compared to their effects on the sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) to determine the relationship of the degradation rate to the equilibrium between the flexed and the extended forms (Suzuki, H., Stafford, W. F., Slayter, H. S., and Seidel, J. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14810-14817). At 0.025 M NaCl, where HMM is predominantly in the flexed form, MgATP, Mg-adenylyl imidodiphosphate or MgADP reduce kH by 80-90%. MgATP exerts its optimal effect at this ionic strength, where at least 70% of HMM is flexed in the presence or absence of MgATP, suggesting that nucleotides reduce kH by decreasing the proteolytic susceptibility of the flexed form. At 0.5 M NaCl, where HMM is in the extended form, MgATP has no effect on kH. At low ionic strengths phosphorylation decreases kH but increases it in the presence of MgATP. Plots of kH against s20,w determined at various ionic strengths are linear, the data for phosphorylated and dephosphorylated HMM falling on the same line. Thus, raising the ionic strength or phosphorylating the 20-kDa light chain appears to alter kH by increasing the fraction of HMM in the extended form. The degradation rate of the 20-kDa light chain (kL) of dephosphorylated HMM responds to changes in ionic strength in essentially the same way as does kH, suggesting that the response of kL to changes in ionic strength can also be attributed to conversion of HMM to the extended form. However, kL for phosphorylated HMM measured in the presence of MgATP exhibits very little dependence on ionic strength."
