https://openalex.org/W2102304447,"We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function."

We report the catalytic conversion of sugars giving high yield to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a versatile intermediate. Metal halides in 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride are catalysts, among which chromium (II) chloride is found to be uniquely effective, leading to the conversion of glucose to HMF with a yield near 70%. A wide range of metal halides is found to catalyze the conversion of fructose to HMF. Only a negligible amount of levulinic acid is formed in these reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2157787057,"Brain processing depends on the interactions between neuronal groups. Those interactions are governed by the pattern of anatomical connections and by yet unknown mechanisms that modulate the effective strength of a given connection. We found that the mutual influence among neuronal groups depends on the phase relation between rhythmic activities within the groups. Phase relations supporting interactions between the groups preceded those interactions by a few milliseconds, consistent with a mechanistic role. These effects were specific in time, frequency, and space, and we therefore propose that the pattern of synchronization flexibly determines the pattern of neuronal interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2070693578,"A major impediment in the treatment of neurological diseases is the presence of the blood–brain barrier, which precludes the entry of therapeutic molecules from blood to brain. Here we show that a short peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) enables the transvascular delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the brain. This 29-amino-acid peptide specifically binds to the acetylcholine receptor expressed by neuronal cells. To enable siRNA binding, a chimaeric peptide was synthesized by adding nonamer arginine residues at the carboxy terminus of RVG. This RVG-9R peptide was able to bind and transduce siRNA to neuronal cells in vitro, resulting in efficient gene silencing. After intravenous injection into mice, RVG-9R delivered siRNA to the neuronal cells, resulting in specific gene silencing within the brain. Furthermore, intravenous treatment with RVG-9R-bound antiviral siRNA afforded robust protection against fatal viral encephalitis in mice. Repeated administration of RVG-9R-bound siRNA did not induce inflammatory cytokines or anti-peptide antibodies. Thus, RVG-9R provides a safe and noninvasive approach for the delivery of siRNA and potentially other therapeutic molecules across the blood–brain barrier. Since the discovery of gene silencing by naturally occurring small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, the idea that they might be used therapeutically has been up and running. Several reports of systemic delivery of siRNAs have been published, but the brain was not among the targets, because of that old problem, the blood–brain barrier. Now a collaboration between labs in the United States and South Korea has developed a way of delivering siRNAs across the barrier. The method, which is suitable for other types of drug as well as siRNA, makes use of a short peptide derived from the rabies virus as a transporter for the RNA. As well as delivering the RNA into neuronal cells in cell culture, an antiviral siRNA was delivered specifically into the brains of mice infected with encephalitis: about 80% of the mice survived the normally fatal infection. If replicated in humans, this work could lead to the development of noninvasive intravenous treatments for neurological disorders. Attachment of a piece of viral protein to a small RNA achieves transfer of the RNA into neuronal cells in cell culture. This was also able to deliver an antiviral siRNA specifically into the brains of mice infected with encephalitis and achieve 80% protection. This study opens a new potential line of treatment for neuronal disease."

https://openalex.org/W2017341863,"Civil societies function because people pay taxes and make charitable contributions to provide public goods. One possible motive for charitable contributions, called “pure altruism,” is satisfied by increases in the public good no matter the source or intent. Another possible motive, “warm glow,” is only fulfilled by an individual's own voluntary donations. Consistent with pure altruism, we find that even mandatory, tax-like transfers to a charity elicit neural activity in areas linked to reward processing. Moreover, neural responses to the charity's financial gains predict voluntary giving. However, consistent with warm glow, neural activity further increases when people make transfers voluntarily. Both pure altruism and warm-glow motives appear to determine the hedonic consequences of financial transfers to the public good."
https://openalex.org/W2065431388,"Multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling, participate in animal development, stem cell biology, and human cancer. Although many components of the Wnt pathway have been identified, unresolved questions remain as to the mechanism by which Wnt binding to its receptors Frizzled and Low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 6 (LRP6) triggers downstream signaling events. With live imaging of vertebrate cells, we show that Wnt treatment quickly induces plasma membrane–associated LRP6 aggregates. LRP6 aggregates are phosphorylated and can be detergent-solubilized as ribosome-sized multiprotein complexes. Phospho-LRP6 aggregates contain Wnt-pathway components but no common vesicular traffic markers except caveolin. The scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dvl) is required for LRP6 phosphorylation and aggregation. We propose that Wnts induce coclustering of receptors and Dvl in LRP6-signalosomes, which in turn triggers LRP6 phosphorylation to promote Axin recruitment and β-catenin stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2074213282,"Dying cells stimulate inflammation, and this response is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases. Very little has been known, however, about how cell death triggers inflammation. We found here that the acute neutrophilic inflammatory response to cell injury requires the signaling protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88). Analysis of the contribution of Myd88-dependent receptors to this response revealed only a minor reduction in mice doubly deficient in Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2) and Tlr4 and normal responses in mice lacking Tlr1, Tlr3, Tlr6, Tlr7, Tlr9, Tlr11 or the interleukin-18 receptor (IL-18R). However, mice lacking IL-1R showed a markedly reduced neutrophilic inflammatory response to dead cells and tissue injury in vivo as well as greatly decreased collateral damage from inflammation. This inflammatory response required IL-1α, and IL-1R function was required on non–bone-marrow-derived cells. Notably, the acute monocyte response to cell death, which is thought to be important for tissue repair, was much less dependent on the IL-1R–Myd88 pathway. Also, this pathway was not required for the neutrophil response to a microbial stimulus. These findings suggest that inhibiting the IL-1R–Myd88 pathway in vivo could block the damage from acute inflammation that occurs in response to sterile cell death, and do so in a way that might not compromise tissue repair or host defense against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2128897591,"The inflammatory toxicity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of bacterial cell walls, is driven by the adaptor proteins myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain–containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF), which together mediate signaling by the endotoxin receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) is a low-toxicity derivative of LPS with useful immunostimulatory properties, which is nearing regulatory approval for use as a human vaccine adjuvant. We report here that, in mice, the low toxicity of MPLA's adjuvant function is associated with a bias toward TRIF signaling, which we suggest is likely caused by the active suppression, rather than passive loss, of proinflammatory activity of this LPS derivative. This finding may have important implications for the development of future vaccine adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W2147054306,"Protein kinases control cellular decision processes by phosphorylating specific substrates. Thousands of in vivo phosphorylation sites have been identified, mostly by proteome-wide mapping. However, systematically matching these sites to specific kinases is presently infeasible, due to limited specificity of consensus motifs, and the influence of contextual factors, such as protein scaffolds, localization, and expression, on cellular substrate specificity. We have developed an approach (NetworKIN) that augments motif-based predictions with the network context of kinases and phosphoproteins. The latter provides 60%–80% of the computational capability to assign in vivo substrate specificity. NetworKIN pinpoints kinases responsible for specific phosphorylations and yields a 2.5-fold improvement in the accuracy with which phosphorylation networks can be constructed. Applying this approach to DNA damage signaling, we show that 53BP1 and Rad50 are phosphorylated by CDK1 and ATM, respectively. We describe a scalable strategy to evaluate predictions, which suggests that BCLAF1 is a GSK-3 substrate. Protein kinases control cellular decision processes by phosphorylating specific substrates.

We describe a scalable strategy to evaluate predictions, which suggests that BCLAF1 is a GSK-3 substrate. The dynamic behavior and decision processes of eukaryotic cells are controlled by posttranslational modifications such as protein phosphorylation. These, in turn, can modify protein function by inducing conformational changes or by creating binding sites for protein interaction domains (for example, SH2 or BRCT) that selectively recognize phosphorylated linear motifs (Seet et al., 2006Seet B.T. Dikic I. Zhou M.-M. Pawson T. Reading protein modifications with interaction domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Decades of targeted biochemical studies and recent experiments employing mass spectrometry (MS) techniques have identified thousands of in vivo phosphorylation sites (Aebersold and Mann, 2003Aebersold R. Mann M. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5280) Google Scholar). These are collected in the Phospho.ELM database, which currently contains 7207 phosphorylation sites in 2540 human proteins (Diella et al., 2004Diella F. Cameron S. Gemünd C. Linding R. Via A. Kuster B. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Blom N. Gibson T.J. Phospho.ELM: a database of experimentally verified phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins.BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, which of the approximately 518 human protein kinases (Manning et al., 2002Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (5789) Google Scholar) is responsible for each of these phosphorylation events is only known for just over a third of sites identified thus far (35% [Diella et al., 2004Diella F. Cameron S. Gemünd C. Linding R. Via A. Kuster B. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Blom N. Gibson T.J. Phospho.ELM: a database of experimentally verified phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins.BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar]), and this fraction is decreasing in the wake of additional proteome-wide studies. As a consequence, there is an ever-widening gap in our understanding of in vivo phosphorylation networks, which is difficult to close in a systematic way by current experimental methods, despite advances in high-throughput in vitro assays (Ptacek et al., 2005Ptacek J. Devgan G. Michaud G. Zhu H. Zhu X. Fasolo J. Guo H. Jona G. Breitkreutz A. Sopko R. et al.Global analysis of protein phosphorylation in yeast.Nature. 2005; 438: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) and selective kinase inhibitors (Bain et al., 2003Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. The specificities of protein kinase inhibitors: an update.Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Our understanding of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks is therefore still fragmentary. The desire to map phosphorylation networks has motivated the development of computational methods to predict the substrate specificities of protein kinases, based on experimental identification of the consensus sequence motifs recognized by the active site of kinase catalytic domains (Hjerrild et al., 2004Hjerrild M. Stensballe A. Rasmussen T.E. Kofoed C.B. Blom N. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Larsen M.R. Brunak S. Jensen O.N. Gammeltoft S. Identification of phosphorylation sites in protein kinase A substrates using artificial neural networks and mass spectrometry.J.

Costantini A. et al.ELM server: A new resource for investigating short functional sites in modular eukaryotic proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3625-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, these motifs often lack sufficient information to uniquely identify the physiological substrates of specific kinases. For example, the sites phosphorylated by different kinases from the CDK or Src families cannot be distinguished by their sequences, although consensus motifs of these kinases have been determined by in vitro experiments (Manke et al., 2005Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E.H. Yaffe M.B. MAPKAP kinase-2 is a cell cycle checkpoint kinase that regulates the G2/M transition and S phase progression in response to UV irradiation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, the recognition properties of the active site alone are typically insufficient to reproduce the substrate specificities of protein kinases observed in living cells (Dar et al., 2005Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Higher-order substrate recognition of eIF2alpha by the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR.Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Specificity in protein kinase signaling is also achieved through additional effects such as subcellular compartmentalization, colocalization via anchoring proteins and scaffolds (e.g., A-kinase anchoring proteins and Ste5 [Bhattacharyya et al., 2006Bhattacharyya R.P. Reményi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar]), substrate capture by noncatalytic interaction domains (e.g., SH2 domains), temporal and cell-type specific coexpression, kinase-docking motifs within substrates (e.g., for MAP kinases [Reményi et al., 2005Reményi A. Good M.C. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. The role of docking interactions in mediating signaling input, output, and discrimination in the yeast MAPK network.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar]), and regulatory subunits (e.g., cyclins). Such information, which we term contextual, may therefore enhance the accuracy with which the in vivo substrates of protein kinases can be predicted. To explore the possibility of using context to enhance the identification of kinase substrates, we developed an integrative computational approach, NetworKIN. This combines consensus sequence motifs and protein association networks to predict which protein kinases target experimentally identified phosphorylation sites in vivo (Figure 1). The algorithm consists of two stages. In the first step, we use neural networks and position-specific scoring matrices to assign each phosphorylation site to one or more kinase families, based on the intrinsic preference of kinases for consensus substrate motifs (Hjerrild et al., 2004Hjerrild M. Stensballe A. Rasmussen T.E. Kofoed C.B. Blom N. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Larsen M.R. Brunak S. Jensen O.N. Gammeltoft S. Identification of phosphorylation sites in protein kinase A substrates using artificial neural networks and mass spectrometry.J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Obenauer et al., 2003Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Scansite 2.0: Proteome-wide prediction of cell signaling interactions using short sequence motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In the second stage, the context for each substrate is represented by a probabilistic protein network extracted from the STRING database (von Mering et al., 2005von Mering C. Jensen L.J. Snel B. Hooper S.D. Krupp M. Foglierini M. Jouffre N. Huynen M.A. Bork P. STRING: known and predicted protein-protein associations, integrated and transferred across organisms.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D433-D437Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), which integrates information from curated pathway databases, cooccurrence in abstracts, physical protein interaction assays, mRNA expression studies, and genomic context (see Experimental Procedures). Within this context network, kinases of the appropriate families are identified through sequence similarity searches against an annotated database of kinase-domain sequences (Figure 1). This approach captures both direct and indirect interactions; for example, phosphorylation events mediated by scaffolds are predicted, as the scaffolding protein provides a path in the probabilistic network between the substrate and kinase. The use of indirect links between kinases and their substrates enables nonobvious predictions that would be very difficult to spot by manually inspecting the available evidence. To test the method, we analyzed the ability of NetworKIN to correctly predict which kinases are responsible for modifying each of 282 known in vivo phosphorylation sites from four well-studied kinase families (Figures 2 and S2; Table S1) and compared this with the results of purely motif-based methods (Hjerrild et al., 2004Hjerrild M. Stensballe A. Rasmussen T.E. Kofoed C.B. Blom N. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Larsen M.R. Brunak S. Jensen O.N. Gammeltoft S. Identification of phosphorylation sites in protein kinase A substrates using artificial neural networks and mass spectrometry.J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Obenauer et al., 2003Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Scansite 2.0: Proteome-wide prediction of cell signaling interactions using short sequence motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). We measured prediction accuracy (the fraction of predictions known to be correct) and sensitivity (the fraction of known sites that are correctly predicted). Using only consensus motifs, we obtained a prediction accuracy of 25% (173 out of 693 predictions identified the correct kinase family) and a sensitivity of 61% (the correct kinase family was found for 176 of 282 sites). Although the kinase families used for benchmarking have by necessity been studied more than most kinases, the predictive power of the consensus sequence motifs for CDK, PKC, PIKK, and INSR are representative for many other kinase families (Figure S1). By incorporating contextual information, the prediction accuracy more than doubled to 64% (148 of 233 predictions), with only a slight drop in sensitivity to 52% (148 of 282 sites). Moreover, of the 148 correct kinase-family predictions made when contextual information was included, the specific kinase gene product could be pinpointed in 72 cases (49%). In contrast, motif-based methods alone are generally not able to go beyond predicting the family of the responsible kinase (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). These results highlight the importance of including contextual information in predicting kinase-substrate relationships. The probabilistic networks around substrates permit us to estimate the degree to which context contributes to in vivo specificity from a computational perspective. Since sequence motifs alone give only 20% accuracy for well-characterized kinases (Figure 2), up to 80% of the ability to predict substrate specificity could come from contextual information. Conversely, the 2.5-fold increase in accuracy when including context (Figure 2) shows that the context must account for at least 60% ([0.64 − 0.25]/0.64 = 0.6) of the molecular information yielding precise predictions. By inference, the association of kinases and substrates in cells, for example by coexpression or through scaffolding proteins or regulatory subunits, plays a major role in delimiting the sites that are actually phosphorylated by kinase catalytic domains in vivo. The algorithm currently covers 112 human kinases from 20 families (Figure 3). We applied it to the complete curated (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) in vivo human phosphoproteome in Phospho.ELM (in total 7207 sites on 2540 proteins, including large-scale mass spectrometry data [Diella et al., 2004Diella F. Cameron S. Gemünd C. Linding R. Via A. Kuster B. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Blom N. Gibson T.J. Phospho.ELM: a database of experimentally verified phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins.BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar]). This resulted in a human phosphorylation network (HPN) consisting of 7143 site-specific kinase-substrate interactions (see Figure S3) between 1759 substrates and 68 kinases with predictions for 4488 phosphorylation sites (average 70 substrates per kinase; Figure S4). These data can be accessed at http://networkin.info and in the Supplemental Data. A topological analysis suggests that networks predicted by NetworKIN are nonrandom in nature (see Figure S5 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The resulting clustering coefficients and topology coefficients indicate that the HPN bears more resemblance to physical protein-protein interaction networks (see Supplemental Data) than the context network used for prediction. This was even more evident if the same comparison was performed using only high-throughput data (data not shown). Transient interactions can be under-represented in high-throughput protein interaction screens (Aloy and Russell, 2002Aloy P. Russell R.B. The third dimension for protein interactions and complexes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 633-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); thus, one might not a priori expect the HPN and protein interaction networks to share topology. Further, the topology of the HPN does not simply reflect that of the context network on which it is based, which gives more confidence in the algorithm. Protein phosphorylation can control intracellular translocation and trafficking of proteins (Seet et al., 2006Seet B.T. Dikic I. Zhou M.-M. Pawson T. Reading protein modifications with interaction domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Considerable progress has been made in determining subcellular localization of proteins both on a systematic level (Foster et al., 2006Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Xie X. Mootha V.K. Mann M. A mammalian organelle map by protein correlation profiling.Cell. 2006; 125: 187-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and individually. As the STRING database does not currently use localization data for predicting protein associations, we can independently test if the computed phosphorylation networks are consistent with the localization of the kinases and their predicted substrates. We mapped localizations from Swiss-Prot to the HPN, which resulted in 1005 phosphoproteins that are described as localizing to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus (but not both). Since each of these proteins may contain multiple phosphorylation sites that are targeted by different kinases, NetworKIN predicted 2287 kinase-substrate interactions. Based on these interactions, we found 17 kinases that show a statistically significant preference for either cytoplasmic or nuclear substrates (Figure 4 and Table S5). For membrane-associated kinases (such as EGFR, INSR, and the Src family kinases), we almost exclusively predict cytoplasmic substrates. Although receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can occasionally translocate to the nucleus, we predict very few nuclear substrates. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the available phosphorylation data sets do not currently cover the cellular states where RTKs are active in the nucleus. In contrast, we find no kinases that are predicted to exclusively phosphorylate nuclear proteins. For the kinases that are primarily localized to the nucleus (ATM, CDK1, CDK2, CK1ɛ, and CK2α), we predict only 2- to 3-fold more nuclear than cytoplasmic targets (Table S5). There are at least three possible explanations for this: (1) all nuclear kinases are synthesized in the cytosol and may phosphorylate cytosolic proteins prior to entering the nucleus, (2) nuclear kinases may have access to cytosolic substrates during mitosis when the nuclear membrane is absent, and (3) many kinases may shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol. This is exemplified by MAPK9 (Jnk2) and MAPK10 (Jnk1), which, upon activation, translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus or the perinuclear region (Mizukami et al., 1997Mizukami Y. Yoshioka K. Morimoto S. Yoshida K. A novel mechanism of JNK1 activation. nuclear translocation and activation of JNK1 during ischemia and reperfusion.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16657-16662Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Whitmarsh et al., 2001Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. et al.Requirement of the JIP1 scaffold protein for stress-induced JNK activation.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we predict 3-fold more nuclear MAPK9/10 substrates than cytoplasmic ones. Conversely, PKAβ and PKCα are both fairly pleiotropic kinases, which in the phosphorylation network show a weak preference for cytoplasmic substrates. Despite the caveats of possible biases in the various data sets, the predicted kinase-substrate interactions are consistent with localization data for the substrates and kinases. The cell membrane-linked kinases show clear preference for cytoplasmic substrates, the predominantly nuclear kinases are biased toward nuclear substrates, and the kinases that shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus exhibit a more even distribution of substrates. Using the HPN as a resource, we investigated protein phosphorylation within the DNA-damage response (DDR) network of human cells (Figures 5 and S6). An effective DNA-damage response is critical for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing malignant transformation. The response to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) is primarily regulated by the kinase ATM, a member of the PIKK family (Shiloh, 2006Shiloh Y. The ATM-mediated DNA-damage response: taking shape.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Of the 45 sites in 16 known ATM substrates, we correctly predicted 39. In addition, we predicted 12 new ATM sites in DSB response- and apoptosis-related proteins (Figure 5), 8 of which are found in 6 proteins not previously known to be ATM substrates. One of these novel predicted ATM substrates is Rad50, a component of the MRN complex that helps to stabilize broken chromosomes and, together with Nbs1 and Mre11, acts as a sensor of DNA damage and contributes to ATM recruitment to DSBs and activation of ATM by autophosphorylation (Shiloh, 2006Shiloh Y. The ATM-mediated DNA-damage response: taking shape.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). S635 of Rad50 was shown to be phosphorylated in a large-scale mass spectrometry study (Beausoleil et al., 2004Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villén J. Li J. Cohn M.A. Cantley L.C. Gygi S.P. Large-scale characterization of HeLa cell nuclear phosphoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12130-12135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The NetworKIN algorithm predicts it to be a potential ATM substrate site because it matches the consensus sequence of ATM and its relatives and because the context network links Rad50 and ATM by primary experimental evidence, manually curated pathways, and literature mining (Figure 1). The latter reflects the knowledge that ATM interacts with the MRN complex and copurifies with Rad50 as part of the BASC supercomplex (Wang et al., 2000Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. BASC, a super complex of BRCA1-associated proteins involved in the recognition and repair of aberrant DNA structures.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939PubMed Google Scholar), a sensor of DNA damage. To test this prediction, we assayed the phosphorylation of Rad50 in response to DNA damage in wild-type (ATMwt/wt; Figure 6A) and ATM null (ATM−/−; Figure 6B) lymphoblast cells using a phospho-S/T-Q -specific antibody that recognizes the ATM phosphorylation sites. Treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitor doxorubicin induced the phosphorylation of Rad50 at the ATM-specific phosphorylation site in wild-type cells but not in ATM null cells (Figure 6), which indicates that ATM is required for Rad50 phosphorylation induced by DNA damage as predicted. We also immunoprecipitated Rad50 from doxorubicin-treated wild-type cells and analyzed its phosphorylation by mass spectrometry. The MS/MS fragmentation spectra (Figure S7) confirmed the phosphorylation of Rad50 at the predicted ATM substrate site, S635, in agreement with published data (Beausoleil et al., 2004Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villén J. Li J. Cohn M.A. Cantley L.C. Gygi S.P. Large-scale characterization of HeLa cell nuclear phosphoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Together, these data validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in predicting specific kinase-substrate relationships in vivo. We predicted additional novel ATM targets, including components of the NF-κB pathway (NF-κB2, IKKβ, and NEMO) and regulators of apoptosis (Bcl-2, BAD, and PIN1) (Figure 5) and the cell cycle (Cdc25A). The predictions that ATM phosphorylates NF-κB-related proteins are far from obvious; in the context network, these proteins are only linked to ATM indirectly via two other proteins, namely IκBα and p53. While this manuscript was in preparation, it was demonstrated that ATM (located in the nucleus) indeed phosphorylates the site (S85) predicted by NetworKIN on the NEMO protein and that, following phosphorylation, both ATM and NEMO translocate to the cytosol (Wu et al., 2006Wu Z.-H. Shi Y. Tibbetts R.S. Miyamoto S. Molecular linkage between the kinase ATM and NF-kappaB signaling in response to genotoxic stimuli.Science. 2006; 311: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This intriguing observation provides some independent support for other predictions that ATM may phosphorylate cytosolic substrates (e.g., Cdc25A and IKKβ). ATM is known to contribute to cell-cycle arrest and to indirectly regulate apoptosis by activating the proapoptotic transcriptional program of p53 and the antiapoptotic transcriptional program of NF-κB (Rashi-Elkeles et al., 2006Rashi-Elkeles S. Elkon R. Weizman N. Linhart C. Amariglio N. Sternberg G. Rechavi G. Barzilai A. Shamir R. Shiloh Y. Parallel induction of ATM-dependent pro- and antiapoptotic signals in response to ionizing radiation in murine lymphoid tissue.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1584-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We predict (Figure 5) that ATM contributes directly to the regulation of apoptosis by phosphorylating the proapoptotic protein BAD and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Consistent with a role for ATM in apoptosis, ATM phosphorylates the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member BID, which contributes to the S phase checkpoint after DNA damage (Kamer et al., 2005Kamer I. Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Niv H. Oberkovitz G. Regev L. Haimovich G. Lerenthal Y. Marcellus R.C. Gross A.

A direct role for ATM in apoptosis would constitute a significant expansion of ATMs regulatory activity. For an annotated list of ATM predictions covering 72 target proteins, see Table S5. Although focused on ATM, Figure 5, Figure 6 also contains novel predictions for other kinases. For instance, we predict several kinases for the 53BP1 protein that has been shown to accumulate at DNA damage-induced foci and to be hyperphosphorlylated in an ATM-dependent manner (Anderson et al., 2001Anderson L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Deletion of 53BP1 abrogates the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint and compromises tumor suppression, classifying 53BP1 as a bona fide DNA-damage checkpoint protein (Ward et al., 2003Ward I.M. Minn K. van Deursen J. Chen J. p53 binding protein 53BP1 is required for DNA damage responses and tumor suppression in mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). DNA-damage checkpoints inhibit cell-cycle progression by targeting the core proteins that drive cell-cycle progression, CDKs. Thus, the prediction of 53BP1 as a substrate for CDK1 and/or CDK2 (Figure 5) is interesting, as CDKs have previously been implicated in the DNA-repair response by experiments showing that inhibition of CDKs in budding yeast results in defects in DNA damage-induced arrest and in homologous recombination repair pathways (Ira et al., 2004Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D. Wan L. Hollingsworth N.M. et al.DNA end resection, homologous recombination and DNA damage checkpoint activation require CDK1.Nature. 2004; 431: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To assess phosphorylation by CDKs, we analyzed 53BP1 in human U2OS osteosarcoma cell cultures that had been subjected to stimuli, such as mitotic arrest, that differentially modify the levels of CDK1 and CDK2 activity. As seen in Figure 6C, cells arrested in prometaphase with paclitaxel showed a slower migrating 53BP1, implying increased phosphorylation. These cells are inactive for CDK2 as reflected by the degradation of cyclin A, the most prominent cyclin partner of CDK2 in G2/M cells (Figure 6C; lane 3). To investigate whether cyclin B/CDK1 is responsible for mitotic 53BP1 phosphorylation, we employed the MPM-2 antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated CDK1/2 consensus sites. 53BP1 immunoprecipitated from mitotic cells was recognized by MPM-2, indicating that CDK1 is responsible for 53BP1 phosporylation in vivo (Figures 6C and 6D; lane 3). Consistent with this view 53BP1 was phosphorylated by cyclin B/CDK1 in vitro (data not shown). To further investigate the involvement of CDK1 in mitotic phosphorylation of 53BP1, we utilized the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. Following treatment with roscovitine, cells exit from mitosis, as shown by the degradation of cyclin B (Figure 6D; lane 4). Incubation of mitotic cells with roscovitine efficiently reversed both the mobility shift and MPM-2 reactivity of 53BP1, indicating that CDK activity is required for the phosphorylation of 53BP1 that results in its altered mobility and recognition by the MPM-2 antibody (Figure 6D; lane 4). As controls, we analyzed unsynchronized cells and cells that were prevented from entering mitosis by treatment with doxorubicin prior to paclitaxel to activate the G2/M-DNA damage checkpoint (Figures 6C and 6D; lanes 1 and 2, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2121325716,"The karyotypic chaos exhibited by human epithelial cancers complicates efforts to identify mutations critical for malignant transformation. Here we integrate complementary genomic approaches to identify human oncogenes. We show that activation of the ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways cooperate to transform human cells. Using a library of activated kinases, we identify several kinases that replace PI3K signaling and render cells tumorigenic. Whole genome structural analyses reveal that one of these kinases, IKBKE (IKKepsilon), is amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumors. Suppression of IKKepsilon expression in breast cancer cell lines that harbor IKBKE amplifications induces cell death. IKKepsilon activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway in both cell lines and breast cancers. These observations suggest a mechanism for NF-kappaB activation in breast cancer, implicate the NF-kappaB pathway as a downstream mediator of PI3K, and provide a framework for integrated genomic approaches in oncogene discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2098188064,"Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, and NFkappaB. These factors bind cooperatively to the IFN-beta enhancer and recruit coactivators and chromatin-remodeling proteins to the IFN-beta promoter. We describe here a crystal structure of the DNA-binding domains of IRF-3, IRF-7, and NFkappaB, bound to one half of the enhancer, and use a previously described structure of the remaining half to assemble a complete picture of enhanceosome architecture in the vicinity of the DNA. Association of eight proteins with the enhancer creates a continuous surface for recognizing a composite DNA-binding element. Paucity of local protein-protein contacts suggests that cooperative occupancy of the enhancer comes from both binding-induced changes in DNA conformation and interactions with additional components such as CBP. Contacts with virtually every nucleotide pair account for the evolutionary invariance of the enhancer sequence."

The causes of MPS are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mice deficient for retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ), develop MPS induced solely by the RARγ-deficient microenvironment. RARγ−/− mice had significantly increased granulocyte/macrophage progenitors and granulocytes in bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, and spleen. The MPS phenotype continued for the lifespan of the mice and was more pronounced in older mice. Unexpectedly, transplant studies revealed this disease was not intrinsic to the hematopoietic cells.

These data show that loss of RARγ results in a nonhematopoietic cell-intrinsic MPS, revealing the capability of the microenvironment to be the sole cause of hematopoietic disorders. Studies of the roles of the hematopoietic microenvironment have markedly increased in recent years, primarily due to the identification of the bone-forming osteoblast as being a critical component of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, the place where HSCs reside and are primarily regulated (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. et al.Osteoblastic cells regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche.Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L.

Feng J.Q. et al.Identification of the haematopoietic stem cell niche and control of the niche size.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). In addition to this important role in regulating HSC self-renewal and differentiation, the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has been proposed to consist of various other niches, first termed hematopoietic inductive microenvironments (Trentin, 1971Trentin J.J. Determination of bone marrow stem cell differentiation by stromal hemopoietic inductive microenvironments (HIM).Am. J. Pathol. 1971; 65: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar), which are areas of the BM that are highly specialized for the development of different maturing hematopoietic cell types. This concept has been supported by the recent identification of specific niches for B lymphocytes (Tokoyoda et al., 2004Tokoyoda K. Egawa T. Sugiyama T. Choi B.I. Nagasawa T. Cellular niches controlling B lymphocyte behavior within bone marrow during development.Immunity. 2004; 20: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and megakaryocytes (Avecilla et al., 2004Avecilla S.T. Hattori K. Heissig B. Tejada R. Liao F. Shido K. Jin D.K. Dias S. Zhang F.

Med. 2004; 10: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) in the BM. The hematopoietic microenvironment is not only supportive for the development of hematopoietic cells but is also known as a highly preferred site for the metastasis of certain cancer cell types, including breast, prostate, and melanoma cancers. A recent report demonstrated that the cytokine receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines, and which is expressed by osteoblasts, recruited epithelial and melanoma cancer cells expressing RANK to the BM, where they subsequently lodged and formed secondary tumors (Jones et al., 2006Jones D.H. Nakashima T. Sanchez O.H. Kozieradzki I. Komarova S.V. Sarosi I. Morony S. Rubin E. Sarao R. Hojilla C.V. et al.Regulation of cancer cell migration and bone metastasis by RANKL.Nature. 2006; 440: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A similar chemoattractant role for nonhematopoietic cancer cells has been described for the chemokine, CXCL12 (Muller et al., 2001Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. et al.Involvement of chemokine receptors in breast cancer metastasis.Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4258) Google Scholar), which is also expressed by osteoblasts and is known to be an important mediator of the homing of HSCs to the BM (Lapidot et al., 2005Lapidot T. Dar A. Kollet O. How do stem cells find their way home?.Blood. 2005; 106: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances, however, virtually nothing is known about the potential involvement of the BM microenvironment in the initiation of different diseases of hematopoietic origin, or the underlying factors that influence the development of these disorders. Myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS) are a heterogeneous subclass of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms for which, with the exception of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), hypereosinophilic syndrome, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, the causes remain largely unknown (Van Etten and Shannon, 2004Van Etten R.A. Shannon K.M. Focus on myeloproliferative diseases and myelodysplastic syndromes.Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 547-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To date, MPS have been considered to be of hematopoietic origin (Kogan et al., 2002Kogan S.C. Ward J.M. Anver M.R. Berman J.J. Brayton C. Cardiff R.D. Carter J.S. de Coronado S. Downing J.R. Fredrickson T.N. et al.Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.Blood. 2002; 100: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and the involvement of Bcr-Abl in CML (Van Etten and Shannon, 2004Van Etten R.A.

Brady G. Iscove N.N. Overexpression of PDGF-B in murine hematopoietic cells induces a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome in vivo.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, the molecular basis of a significant subset of other MPS, such as myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), remains unknown. Likewise, it is unclear as to whether the hematopoietic (BM) microenvironment may play an active part in promoting and/or supporting the development of MPS. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) have been associated with many different diseases, including cancer, and retinoid-based therapies are increasingly being utilized to treat such disorders (Altucci and Gronemeyer, 2001Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. The promise of retinoids to fight against cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). There are three RAR subtypes: RARα, RARβ, and RARγ, all of which are highly conserved amongst species. The vitamin A derivative, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is the naturally occurring ligand for all RARs. The RARs are nuclear hormone receptors that act as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators; in their liganded state, they activate transcription, whereas in the nonliganded form, they repress transcription of their target genes (Minucci and Pelicci, 1999Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Retinoid receptors in health and disease: co-regulators and the chromatin connection.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RARs have numerous direct target genes which have retinoic acid response elements in their promoter region (Balmer and Blomhoff, 2002Balmer J.E. Blomhoff R. Gene expression regulation by retinoic acid.J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1773-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, Balmer and Blomhoff, 2005Balmer J.E. Blomhoff R. A robust characterization of retinoic acid response elements based on a comparison of sites in three species.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 96: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The generation of RAR-specific mutant mice has allowed delineation of the different roles of the RARs in organogenesis. We have recently shown that RARγ, but not RARα, null mice have 3-fold reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H. Walkley C.R. Fabb S.A. Collins S.J. Chambon P. RAR{gamma} is critical for maintaining a balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here, we show that loss of RARγ also results in a myeloproliferative-like disease. This MPS was not intrinsic to the hematopoietic cell, but was induced by the RARγ null microenvironment. These novel findings reveal that the microenvironment can play a dominant role in both inducing and supporting the progression of hematopoietic diseases such as MPS and potentially leukemias. We have observed that RARα and RARγ, but not RARβ isoforms are widely expressed in immature and maturing hematopoietic cell types (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H. Walkley C.R. Fabb S.A. Collins S.J. Chambon P. RAR{gamma} is critical for maintaining a balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar; and unpublished data). Furthermore, the natural ligand for RARs, ATRA, has potent effects on enhancing HSC self-renewal and promoting differentiation of more mature granulocyte/macrophage progenitors, which we have previously demonstrated are likely due to the different actions of RARα and RARγ on hematopoietic cells (Purton et al., 1999Purton L.E. Bernstein I.D. Collins S.J.

Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RARα−/− mice do not have any observable hematopoietic defects in vivo (Kastner et al., 2001Kastner P. Lawrence H.J. Waltzinger C. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Chan S. Positive and negative regulation of granulopoiesis by endogenous RARalpha.Blood. 2001; 97: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H.

Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas RARγ−/− mice have significantly reduced numbers of HSCs accompanied by increased numbers of immature progenitor cells in their BM (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H. Walkley C.R. Fabb S.A. Collins S.J. Chambon P. RAR{gamma} is critical for maintaining a balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine if loss of RARγ also affected the production of mature hematopoietic cells, we examined the cellularity and hematopoietic composition of peripheral blood (PB), BM, spleen, and thymus preparations obtained from RARγ null, heterozygous, and wild-type mice. Eight-week-old RARγ−/− mice had significantly elevated PB and BM leukocytes compared to their wild-type littermates (Figure 1A). The elevated leukocyte levels were comparable to those achieved by oncoretroviral overexpression-induced models of MPD in C57Bl/6 background strains (Wernig et al., 2006Wernig G. Mercher T. Okabe R. Levine R.L. Lee B.H. Gilliland D.G. Expression of Jak2V617F causes a polycythemia vera-like disease with associated myelofibrosis in a murine bone marrow transplant model.Blood. 2006; 107: 4274-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Spleen leukocyte numbers were also elevated in RARγ−/− mice, but this increase was not significant compared to the wild-type mice. Eight-week-old RARγ−/− mice also presented with splenomegaly, with spleen weights significantly increased (1.5- to 3-fold) compared to their wild-type littermates. In contrast, the thymic cellularity was significantly reduced (25%) in RARγ−/− mice compared to their wild-type littermates (Figure 1A). RARγ−/− mice have a growth deficiency (Lohnes et al., 1993Lohnes D. Kastner P. Dierich A. Mark M. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Function of retinoic acid receptor gamma in the mouse.Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and at 8 weeks of age were approximately 20% smaller than their wild-type littermates (Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). When normalized to body size, the thymocyte cellularity was similar to that of wild-type mice; however, there were significant increases in BM and spleen cellularity in RARγ−/− mice. We used immunophenotypical analysis to further explore the effects of loss of RARγ on the production of mature hematopoietic cell lineages. There were marked increases in the numbers of CD11b+ Gr-1+ granulocytes in the PB (Figure 1B and Table S2), BM (Figure 1C and Table S2), and spleen (Figure 1D and Table S2) of RARγ−/− mice compared to their wild-type littermates. These increases occurred in both the immature and mature granulocyte compartments in the BM (Walkley et al., 2002Walkley C.R. Yuan Y.D. Chandraratna R.A. McArthur G.A. Retinoic acid receptor antagonism in vivo expands the numbers of precursor cells during granulopoiesis.Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C and Table S2). There were also significant reductions in the numbers of B lymphocyte subsets and erythrocytes in the BM of the RARγ−/− mice (Tables S1 and S2); however, the numbers of these cells were unaltered in the PB and spleen (Table S1). In contrast to RARγ−/− mice, RARγ+/− mice did not have altered numbers of mature hematopoietic cells (Figure 1 and Table S1). We further focused on investigating the mechanisms behind the increased granulopoiesis in the RARγ−/− mice. Both the immature (CD11b+ Gr-1 dim) and mature (CD11b+ Gr-1 bright) granulocyte subsets were significantly elevated in the BM, suggesting that the increase in granulocytes was arising from an immature progenitor population (Walkley et al., 2002Walkley C.R. Yuan Y.D. Chandraratna R.A. McArthur G.A. Retinoic acid receptor antagonism in vivo expands the numbers of precursor cells during granulopoiesis.Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that RARγ−/− mice have increased numbers of immature colony-forming cells (CFU-GEMM), which likely arise from accelerated differentiation of HSCs into progenitor cells (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H. Walkley C.R. Fabb S.A. Collins S.J. Chambon P. RAR{gamma} is critical for maintaining a balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the numbers of more committed granulocyte progenitors in the BM of RARγ−/− mice. The numbers of day 7 GM-CSF, SCF+G-CSF, and G-CSF-responsive colony-forming cells (CFCs) were significantly increased in RARγ−/− BM compared to that of wild-type littermates (Figures 2A and 2B). The numbers of more mature day 3 cluster-forming cells were also significantly increased in these mutants compared to wild-type mice (Figure 2C). The PB and spleen of RARγ−/− mice also had increased numbers of mature myeloid CFCs (CFU-GM) (Figures 2C and 2D), but the numbers of immature CFCs (CFU-GEMM) and immunophenotypic HSC/progenitor cells in these organs were not significantly different to RARγ+/+ mice (Table S3). These data demonstrated that there were increased numbers of committed myeloid progenitors in the BM, spleen, and PB of RARγ−/− mice. In contrast, the lack of CFU-GEMM and HSC/progenitor cells in spleen and PB suggested that RARγ−/− mice were not presenting with an HSC mobilization phenotype. To determine if the increased numbers of progenitors could be due to altered cytokine sensitivity, we investigated the numbers of BM CFCs formed in submaximal and supramaximal concentrations of G-CSF (Walkley et al., 2002Walkley C.R. Yuan Y.D. Chandraratna R.A. McArthur G.A. Retinoic acid receptor antagonism in vivo expands the numbers of precursor cells during granulopoiesis.Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both RARγ−/− and RARγ+/+ BM cells showed a similar cytokine response, hence it did not appear that the progenitor cells had altered sensitivity to cytokines (Figure 2F). A similar result was also observed in response to IL-3 (unpublished data). It was possible that the increased numbers of CFCs were due to increased survival of these progenitors. To assess this, we established CFC assays and delayed cytokine addition to 24 and 48 hr. The numbers of CFCs that formed were then assessed at 7 days postinitiation. There were no differences in the survival of progenitors stimulated with G-CSF (Figure 2G), suggesting that the myeloid expansion was not a secondary response due to altered cell death of granulocyte progenitors. Finally, we assessed the frequencies of common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP), and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEP) in RARγ−/− and RARγ+/+ BM (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). The frequency of GMPs was significantly increased (1.8-fold) in RARγ−/− BM compared to that of their wild-type littermates (Figure 2H). Given that RARγ−/− mice also had significantly increased BM leukocyte cellularity compared to RARγ+/+ mice (Figure 1A), this resulted in an overall significant 2.1-fold increase in absolute numbers of GMPs in RARγ null BM compared to wild-type BM. The elevated granulopoiesis in RARγ−/− mice could be compensatory if these cells had impaired functional capacity, hence we tested several of their functional properties. The oxidative bursts response was similar in BM samples of either genotype (Figure S1). Furthermore, recruitment of cells after intradermal injection of Zymosan A (which elicits an acute inflammation response) was similar in RARγ−/− mice compared to their wild-type littermates (Figure S1), and there was no difference between the morphology of the cell types that were recruited to the ear in response to Zymosan A (data not shown). Finally, there was no difference in the percentage of BM granulocytes undergoing apoptosis when assessed by annexin V staining (Figure S1). These data suggested that RARγ−/− granulocytes had similar functional potential to those of RARγ wild-type granulocytes. We have recently reported that small numbers of RARγ−/− mice survive to approximately 12 months of age (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H. Walkley C.R. Fabb S.A. Collins S.J. Chambon P. RAR{gamma} is critical for maintaining a balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine if the increased granulocyte phenotype persisted for the lifespan of RARγ−/− mice we investigated the cellularity and hematopoietic composition of different organs obtained from 12-month-old RARγ−/− and RARγ+/+ mice. The average PB leukocyte counts of the older RARγ−/− mice were dramatically increased compared to their wild-type littermates (RARγ+/+ = 10.54 ± 0.51; RARγ−/− = 29.6 ± 3.32 × 103/μl blood, p < 0.005). This was accompanied by significantly increased numbers of granulocytes in the PB, spleen and BM (Figures 3A–3C). Platelets were also significantly elevated in the PB of these older knockout mice (RARγ+/+ = 1480 ± 46.7; RARγ−/− = 1888 ± 66.7 × 103/μl blood, p < 0.005). In contrast, erythrocyte numbers were significantly reduced in the PB of these aged mutant mice (RARγ+/+ = 9.77 ± 0.32; RARγ−/− = 8.87 ± 0.15 × 106/μl blood, p < 0.05). Analysis of immature progenitors in these mice revealed that RARγ−/− mice had significantly increased numbers of CFU-GEMM and CFU-GM in their PB and spleen (Figures 3D, 3F, 3G, and 3I), accompanied by strikingly elevated numbers of lineage-restricted granulocyte/macrophage CFCs in their bone marrow (Figures 3E and 3H). Significantly reduced numbers of mature B cells and erythrocytes were also observed in the bone marrow of the 12-month-old RARγ−/− mice (Figure 3J). The frequencies of the lineage-negative, c-kit-positive, Sca-1-negative (LKS−) progenitor cells were significantly increased in BM and spleens of 12-month-old RARγ−/− mice (Table S4). The HSC-containing lineage-negative, c-kit-positive, Sca-1+ (LKS+) cells were also markedly elevated in the spleens of these mice (Table S4). Histological analysis of different organs of 9- to 12-month-old mice revealed that the bone marrow of the RARγ−/− mice was extremely hypercellular compared to their wild-type littermates (Figures 4A and 4B). The trabecular bones were virtually absent, and the cortical bones were dramatically thinner in these older RARγ−/− mice (Figure 4B). Bone marrow cells of the RARγ−/− mice were predominantly developing myeloid cells, with some megakaryocytes also obvious (Figures 4B and 4D). Reduced B lymphocyte foci were also evident in the spleens of the RARγ−/− mice compared to their wild-type littermates (Figure S2). Myeloperoxidase staining revealed that extramedullary hematopoiesis was occurring in the liver of the RARγ−/− mice, however we did not observe significant numbers of hematopoietic cells in their kidneys compared to their wild-type littermates (Figure S2). Strikingly, there were large foci of immature and maturing hematopoietic cells (including granulocytes, monocytes, megakaryocytes, and erythrocytes) developing in adipose tissue in these older of the RARγ−/− mice, but not in their wild-type littermates (Figures 4E–4H). During their lifespan, however, none of the animals developed leukemia or lymphoma. Given the significantly increased myeloid compartment in the mice with tissue infiltration, together with lack of evidence of malignant transformation, the phenotype of the RARγ−/− mice best corresponds with that of a myeloproliferative-like disease (MPD-like, or MPS) (Kogan et al., 2002Kogan S.C. Ward J.M. Anver M.R. Berman J.J. Brayton C. Cardiff R.D. Carter J.S. de Coronado S. Downing J.R. Fredrickson T.N. et al.Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.Blood. 2002; 100: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Myeloproliferative-like diseases are thought to arise from hematopoietic cells (Kogan et al., 2002Kogan S.C. Ward J.M. Anver M.R. Berman J.J. Brayton C. Cardiff R.D. Carter J.S. de Coronado S. Downing J.R. Fredrickson T.N. et al.Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.Blood. 2002; 100: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we investigated the HSC frequency in the RARγ−/− BM (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E. Dworkin S. Olsen G.H. Walkley C.R. Fabb S.A. Collins S.J. Chambon P. RAR{gamma} is critical for maintaining a balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). During the 6 months of monitoring recipient mice posttransplant, we did not observe a MPS in wild-type mice that were transplanted with BM from the RARγ−/− mice. However, these transplants were performed with competing BM from wild-type congenic mice, which may have masked or prevented the occurrence of the myeloproliferation. Therefore, we repeated the transplants using whole BM without competing cells and compared the hematopoietic phenotypes to that of 8-week-old RARγ null mice (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast to the MPS observed in RARγ−/− animals, at 8 weeks posttransplant all wild-type recipients of either RARγ+/+ or RARγ−/− BM had similar PB leukocyte and granulocyte counts (Figures 5C and 5D). The PB cellularity did not increase during the 6 months the mice were monitored posttransplant (at 6 months posttransplant, leukocytes: RARγ+/+ = 13.72 ± 0.93; RARγ−/− = 11.5 ± 0.61 × 103/μl blood; granulocytes: RARγ+/+ = 0.91 ± 0.17; RARγ−/− = 0.80 ± 0.12 × 103/μl blood). Bone marrow and spleen cellularity and lineage contribution were also comparable between the recipients of the two genotypes (data not shown). Complete reconstitution by RARγ+/+ or RARγ−/− cells was confirmed by immunophenotypical analysis at each time point of analysis, hence these results were not due to an inability of the RARγ−/− BM cells to engraft in the congenic recipients. These data therefore demonstrate that the myeloproliferation did not occur when RARγ−/− hematopoietic cells were supported by a wild-type microenvironment. To determine if the microenvironment of the RARγ null mice was inducing the MPS we performed reciprocal transplants. Congenic wild-type cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated RARγ+/+ or RARγ−/− recipient mice. By 5 weeks posttransplant, RARγ−/− mice transplanted with wild-type cells had significantly elevated PB leukocytes and granulocytes (Figures 5E and 5F, Table S5). The increases in leukocytes and granulocytes were even more profound compared to 8-week-old nontransplanted RARγ−/− mice (Figures 5A and 5B, Table S2). Immunophenotypical analysis confirmed the hematopoietic cells were of wild-type origin rather than endogenous recovery of RARγ null hematopoietic cells. In addition to the markedly elevated granulocytes in these transplant recipients, BM B lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis were also significantly suppressed when the wild-type congenic BM was transplanted into the RARγ−/− mice (Figure 5G, Table S5). This was also more profound compared to the B lymphocyte and erythrocyte phenotype observed in the BM of 8-week-old RARγ−/− mutants (Tables S1 and S2). Hence, the myeloproliferative-like disease observed in RARγ−/− mice was not intrinsic to the hematopoietic cells, but was induced by the RARγ deficient microenvironment. We have previously reported that 8-week-old RARγ−/− mice have 3-fold reduced numbers of HSCs accompanied by increased numbers of progenitors, including day 12 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) (Purton et al., 2006Purton L.E.

https://openalex.org/W2136746857,"The appearance of a spontaneous mutation in mice in a University of Michigan research laboratory has led to the identification of the gene responsible for a form of the inherited neurodegenerative disease called Charcot–Marie–Tooth disorder. The pale tremor mice, which develop a multi-organ neurodegeneration, are mutated in a homologue of the yeast gene Fig4, which is required to maintain normal levels of the signalling lipid PtdIns(3,5)P2. Prior to this work, there had been no indication that the low abundance signalling compound PtdIns(3,5)P2 had a specific role in neuronal maintenance. This manuscript provides A first description of a new spontaneous mouse mutant, called pale tremor, with a retrotransposon inserted into the gene encoding the phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase (PtdIns(3,5)P2) Fig4. The phenotype includes early neurodegeneration, abnormal pigmentation, altered phosphoinositide levels, and the presence of large vacuoles in affected cells. Membrane-bound phosphoinositides are signalling molecules that have a key role in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells1. Proteins that bind specific phosphoinositides mediate interactions between membrane-bounded compartments whose identity is partially encoded by cytoplasmic phospholipid tags. Little is known about the localization and regulation of mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), a phospholipid present in small quantities that regulates membrane trafficking in the endosome–lysosome axis in yeast2. Here we describe a multi-organ disorder with neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system, peripheral neuronopathy and diluted pigmentation in the ‘pale tremor’ mouse. Positional cloning identified insertion of ETn2β (early transposon 2β)3 into intron 18 of Fig4 (A530089I17Rik), the homologue of a yeast SAC (suppressor of actin) domain PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase located in the vacuolar membrane. The abnormal concentration of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in cultured fibroblasts from pale tremor mice demonstrates the conserved biochemical function of mammalian Fig4. The cytoplasm of fibroblasts from pale tremor mice is filled with large vacuoles that are immunoreactive for LAMP-2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2), consistent with dysfunction of the late endosome–lysosome axis. Neonatal neurodegeneration in sensory and autonomic ganglia is followed by loss of neurons from layers four and five of the cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and other localized brain regions. The sciatic nerve exhibits reduced numbers of large-diameter myelinated axons, slowed nerve conduction velocity and reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. We identified pathogenic mutations of human FIG4 (KIAA0274) on chromosome 6q21 in four unrelated patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. This novel form of autosomal recessive Charcot–Marie–Tooth disorder is designated CMT4J."
https://openalex.org/W1972299875,"Attention helps us process potentially important objects by selectively increasing the activity of sensory neurons that represent the relevant locations and features of our environment. This selection process requires top-down feedback about what is important in our environment. We investigated how parietal cortical output influences neural activity in early sensory areas. Neural recordings were made simultaneously from the posterior parietal cortex and an earlier area in the visual pathway, the medial temporal area, of macaques performing a visual matching task. When the monkey selectively attended to a location, the timing of activities in the two regions became synchronized, with the parietal cortex leading the medial temporal area. Parietal neurons may thus selectively increase activity in earlier sensory areas to enable focused spatial attention."
https://openalex.org/W2100063372,"Hematopoiesis is maintained by stem cells (HSCs) that undergo fate decisions by integrating intrinsic and extrinsic signals, with the latter derived from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Cell-cycle regulation can modulate stem cell fate, but it is unknown whether this represents an intrinsic or extrinsic effector of fate decisions. We have investigated the role of the retinoblastoma protein (RB), a central regulator of the cell cycle, in hematopoiesis. Widespread inactivation of RB in the murine hematopoietic system resulted in profound myeloproliferation. HSCs were lost from the BM due to mobilization to extramedullary sites and differentiation. This phenotype was not intrinsic to HSCs, but, rather, was the consequence of an RB-dependent interaction between myeloid-derived cells and the microenvironment. These findings demonstrate that myeloproliferation may result from perturbed interactions between hematopoietic cells and the niche. Therefore, RB extrinsically regulates HSCs by maintaining the capacity of the BM to support normal hematopoiesis and HSCs."

Bacillus subtilis has been the organism of choice for the production of several important industrial products, including antibiotics, enzymes, nucleosides, and vitamins. Several aspects of the biochemistry, genetics, and physiology of B. subtilis have been studied extensively making B. subtilis the best characterized prokaryote second only to Escherichia coli (1Sonenshein A.L.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5179-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), proteomic (4Eymann C. Dreisbach A. Albrecht D. Bernhardt J. Becher D. Gentner S. Tam L.T. Buttner K. Buurman G. Scharf C.

This wealth of experimental data enables the development of a genome-scale metabolic in silico model that can be used not only for quantitative interpretation and structured integration of such extensive data sets but also as a tool for hypothesis generation and engineering of B. subtilis metabolism. To date, constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) 4The abbreviations used are: COBRAconstraint-based reconstruction and analysisGPRgene-protein-reaction associationORFopen reading frameKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes. of cellular metabolism has been employed successfully to develop organism-specific genome-scale in silico models that have enabled numerous applications (6Reed J.L. Famili I. Thiele I. Palsson B.O. Nat. Rev. Genetics. 2006; 7: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Unlike other modeling strategies such as kinetic (7Loew L.M. Schaff J.C. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 401-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), stochastic (8Arkin A.P. Ross J. McAdams H.H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1633-1648PubMed Google Scholar), and cybernetic (9Varner J. Ramkrishna D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) methods, the COBRA approach does not attempt to compute precisely what a biochemical network does; rather, it seeks to distinguish between the network states that are achievable from those that are not, based on a detailed reconstruction of metabolism and incorporation of physiological parameters that are consistent with known experimental information. The COBRA approach is based on the successive imposition of governing physicochemical constraints on genome-scale reconstructions. The COBRA approach has been employed to generate genome-scale in silico models from each of the three major domains of the tree of life: archaea (i.e. Methanosarcina barkeri (10Feist A.M. Scholten J.C.M. Palsson B.O. Brockman F.J. Ideker T. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)), bacteria (i.e. E. coli (11Reed J.L. Vo T.D. Schilling C.H.

For B. subtilis, a stoichiometric model consisting of around 35 reactions in the central metabolism and the purine metabolism has been constructed previously (13Dauner M. Sauer U. Biotech. Bioeng. 2001; 76: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Sauer U. Cameron D.C. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 59: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The model has been used to obtain information on the intracellular flux distribution based on fractional carbon isotope labeling (15Sauer U. Hatzimanikatis V. Bailey J.E. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wuthrich K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and for the estimation of the P/O ratio (16Sauer U. Bailey J.E. Biotech. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the prediction of maximum theoretical yields of commercial biochemical products (14Sauer U. Cameron D.C. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 59: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we describe the reconstruction of a highly detailed and validated genome-scale metabolic network for B. subtilis, which reconciles established genomic and physiological data with high-throughput phenotyping data generated herein. The process used for the reconstruction illustrates the iterative nature of model development. Furthermore it demonstrates how the model can be used to highlight conflicts and discrepancies between various experimental data sets, and design experiments to resolve any gaps in our understanding of cellular metabolism, thereby accelerating biological discovery. Metabolic Network Reconstruction—The reconstruction procedure followed the approach outlined in Edwards and Palsson (17Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The reconstruction was carried out in SimPheny (Genomatica, Inc., San Diego, CA), a platform for development of cellular metabolic models. Lists of the genes, proteins, and reactions, corresponding literature information, definitions of the metabolite abbreviations, and a list of the exchange fluxes are described in the supplemental material (Bacillus subtilis Model Excel file). All the gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations are provided in a GPR Associations zip file as JPEG images, which can be obtained from the authors, and a detailed document describing how to interpret these images is available elsewhere (11Reed J.L. Vo T.D. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biomass Composition—An equation for biomass formation was developed to account for the drain of precursors and building blocks into biomass. Biomass synthesis was incorporated as a linear combination of six macromolecular components (protein, DNA, RNA, lipid, lipoteichoic acid, and cell wall components) along with ions and metabolites, which were considered to account for the overall biomass composition. Lipoteichoic acid is a polymer of glycerolphosphate 24-33 units long, linked by phosphodiester bonds with a 3-gentiobiosyldiglyceride as the membrane anchor, and protrudes through the cell wall (18Foster S. Popham D.L. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. From Genes to Cells. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 21-41Google Scholar). The detailed calculation of the biomass composition is provided in the supplemental Biomass Composition Word file. In Silico Computations—The metabolic capabilities of the B. subtilis network were calculated by using flux balance analysis and linear optimization (17Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). For growth simulations, biomass synthesis (see above) was selected as the objective function to be maximized, and optimization was solved using Linear Programming techniques in the SimPheny platform. In addition to the metabolic reactions, reversible exchange reactions for all external metabolites were also included in the simulations to allow external metabolites to cross the system boundary. All flux values during simulation are in millimoles/g cell/h. For simulation of aerobic growth on minimal media, the following external metabolites were allowed to freely enter and leave the network: K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, CO2, H2O, and H+ (exchanges fluxes, -1 × 106 to 1 × 106 mmol/g cell/h). Aerobic conditions were simulated by setting the lower and upper limits for the O2 exchange flux to -1 × 106 mmol/g cell/h and 0, respectively. All other external metabolites, except for the substrates tested, were only allowed to leave the system (exchanges fluxes, 0 to 1 × 106 mmol/g cell/h). Growth on different substrates was simulated by allowing corresponding external metabolites to enter the system with a maximum uptake rate of 5 mmol/g cell/h if not specified (exchange flux, -5to1 × 106 mmol/g cell/h). For simulation of growth on complex Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, the chemical composition of LB medium was approximated based on typical analysis of the yeast extract and Tryptone provided by the manufacturers (see supplemental Complex Medium Composition Word file). The threshold of specific growth rate for cell viability was assumed to be 10-8 h-1. All simulation conditions are detailed in the supplemental Simulation Conditions Excel file. Biolog Phenotyping Experiments—B. subtilis 168 (ATCC 23857) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Biolog's Phenotype MicroArray™ technology (19Bochner B.R. Gadzinski P. Panomitros E. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) was used for the phenotypic analysis of B. subtilis. It permits assays of 190 carbon (PM1- and PM2A-Microplates), 95 nitrogen (PM3B-Microplate), and 59 phosphorus and 35 sulfur source (PM4A-Microplate) utilizations at once. A defined medium containing 25 mm sodium pyruvate, 25 mm glucose, 5.0 mm NH4Cl, 2.0 mm NaH2PO4, 0.25 mm Na2SO4, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 7.1), 0.05 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm FeCl3, and 0.01% tetrazolium violet was used for the Phenotype Microarrays™ tests. The (PM) plates contained various carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur sources, which are omitted from the defined medium. The microplates were incubated at 37 °C, and the absorbances were measured both at 570 and 750 nm after 24- and 48-h incubations, respectively, resulting in a total of 8 measurements. The detailed experimental conditions were described elsewhere (20Zhou L. Lei X.-H. Bochner B.R. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4956-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The colorimetric assay was considered as positive when the absorbance corresponding to the reduced dye (indicating substrate utilization) was 1.2 times higher than that of negative control. This threshold was chosen based on the calculation of standard deviations of the absorbance of the reduced dye in the negative control wells (S.D. was ∼19%). The confidence levels for the data were determined based on the number of positive reactions out of the 8 measurements: high-confidence (growth, 8; no growth, none), medium-confidence (growth, 6 or 7; no growth, 1 or 2), and low-confidence (3 to 5). Low-confidence data were used for in silico analysis only if corresponding experimental data were available from the literature. Lists of the compounds, confidence level on data, predicted growth rates, and corresponding literature information are detailed in the supplemental Table S1. Metabolic Reconstruction—The overall iterative model development procedure of genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for B. subtilis was based on established reconstruction methods augmented with high-throughput substrate utilization experiments and large-scale gene essentiality data sets (Fig. 1). First, a B. subtilis metabolic network (modelv1 in Fig. 1) was reconstructed based on the annotated genome sequence (21Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G.

The metabolic network was expanded in size to 1015 unique reactions (modelv2 in Fig. 1) based on high-throughput Biolog phenotyping data (see “Experimental Procedures”) and network-based gap analyses. Metabolic modelv2 computed the qualitative outcome of substrate utilization data with 74% agreement (200 in 271 cases). Finally, metabolic modelv2 was compared with a large-scale gene essentiality study (22Kobayashi K. Ehrlich S.D. Albertini A. Amati G. Andersen K.K. Arnaud M. Asai K. Ashikaga S. Aymerich S.

Zuber U. Ogasawara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4678-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), and this analysis led to the addition of five metabolic reactions to modelv2. This expanded model could qualitatively predict the effect of gene deletions on growth with 94% accuracy (720 in 766 cases) (modelv3 in Fig. 1, and see details in the following sections). Characteristics of the Reconstructed Network—The characteristics of the reconstructed B. subtilis metabolic network are detailed in Fig. 2. The completed reconstruction (metabolic modelv3) accounted for 844 open reading frames (ORFs) and consisted of 1020 reactions and 988 metabolites (Fig. 2A). The details of the list of genes, reactions, and the GPR associations in the reconstruction are available as supplemental information. The functional classification of the 844 ORFs included in the reconstruction is summarized in Fig. 2B. The majority of the ORFs are associated with the transport of metabolites indicating the abundance of various classes of transporters in B. subtilis. 191 of 244 transporters included in the reconstruction were identified based on genomic and biochemical information, but 53 were based on high-throughput Biolog phenotyping and gene-essentiality analyses. For example, Biolog phenotyping indicated that d-malic acid, l-arabitol, glyoxylic acid, or dulcitol could be utilized by B. subtilis as a carbon source, and its corresponding transporter was incorporated into the biochemical-reaction network (see supplemental Tables S2 and S3 for lists of transporters). The basic capabilities of the in silico model to predict quantitatively aerobic growth on various carbon sources were determined (Fig. 2C). A growth demand function was formulated based on biomass composition detailing the required metabolites in the appropriate ratios (see supplemental Biomass Composition Word file). This demand function was used as the objective function for flux balance analysis analysis. The growth rates for different substrate uptake rates were computed based on minimal media (see “Experimental Procedures” for simulation conditions) and compared with the experimental results of aerobic chemostat cultivation (13Dauner M. Sauer U. Biotech. Bioeng. 2001; 76: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Dauner M. Sonderegger M. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wuthrich K. Hohmann H.-P. Sauer U. Bailey J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the model used the caa3 terminal oxidase activity as part of the optimal flux distribution and resulted in higher in silico growth rates than experimental results (Fig. 2, C and D). However, when the flux through caa3 oxidase reaction was restricted to zero under the same conditions to reflect the experimentally observed repression of caa3 oxidase in the presence of glucose (see below), the in silico model could correctly compute the experimental growth rates of B. subtilis. In B. subtilis, four different terminal oxidases are known to exist, which catalyze the transfer of electrons to O2 with different energy-coupling efficiencies (16Sauer U. Bailey J.E. Biotech. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. From Genes to Cells. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 163-179Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Three oxidases accept electrons from menaquinone and one oxidase from cytochrome c. The main electron flow in glucose-grown B. subtilis is via the aa3 oxidase (25Santana M. Kunst F. Hullo M.F. Rapoport G. Danchin A. Glaser P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10225-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the bd oxidase appears to be relevant mainly at low O2 tension (26Winstedt L. Yoshida K.-I. Fujita Y. von Wachenfeldt C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6571-6580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ythA and ythB genes of B. subtilis are likely to encode a terminal oxidase related to the bd-type oxidases (24von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. From Genes to Cells. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 163-179Google Scholar), and, in this study, the H+/e- stoichiometry was assumed to be 1.0. The cytochrome c branch, which contains the energy-coupling menaquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc complex; H+/e-, 1.5) and caa3 oxidase (H+/e-, 2), is most energetically favorable. However, the expression of caa3 oxidase-encoding ctaCDEF genes is inhibited by catabolite control protein A, and therefore, the flow of electrons via cytochrome c branch is undetectable in glucose-grown B. subtilis (27Liu X. Taber H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6154-6173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This example highlights the utility of the integrated modeling and experimental approach in uncovering potential novel regulatory interactions that affect cellular metabolism. Analysis of High-throughput Substrate Utilization—The in silico computations and high-throughput phenotyping data from Biolog's Phenotyping MicroArray™ technology (Biolog Hayward, Inc., CA (19Bochner B.R. Gadzinski P. Panomitros E. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar)) were compared (Fig. 3). 271 of 379 substrates tested (190 for carbon, 95 for nitrogen, 59 for phosphorus, and 35 for sulfur sources) were identified as data with sufficient confidence (see “Experimental Procedures” for determining the confidence) and were analyzed for consistency using the B. subtilis model. In the case of nitrogen and sulfur sources, obtaining high confidence data was difficult due to the high background of negative control, and 44% (42 in 95) and 49% (17 in 35) of the compounds tested could not be used for in silico analyses, respectively. A list of substrates, confidence levels of data, model refinements, predicted growth rates, and literature information for corresponding substrates, are described in supplemental Table S1. Growth on substrates was simulated by fixing its specific uptake rate at 5 mmol/g cell/h under aerobic conditions based on minimal media (see “Experimental Procedures” for simulation conditions). However, it should be noticed that the assumption of utilization rate of substrate might affect growth prediction (see below). The network (metabolic modelv1 in Fig. 1), which was developed only based on genomic and biochemical information, could predict qualitatively the outcomes of Biolog data with 52% accuracy (140 in 271), but, after network expansion and metabolic gap analysis, overall prediction accuracy (metabolic modelv2 in Fig. 1) was considerably improved to 74% (200 in 271) (Fig. 3A). However, 14 disagreements (7 for carbon, 4 for nitrogen, and 3 for sulfur sources) were observed (Fig. 3B), and out of these 14, 8 cases were compared with experimental growth data available in the literature by Medline search for the corresponding substrates (Fig. 3C). Biolog phenotyping result and Mortl et al. (29Mortl M. Diederichs K. Welte W. Molla G. Motteran L. Andriolo G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29718-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicated together that glycine could not be utilized by B. subtilis as a sole carbon source, but the model showed growth, although the predicted growth was low at 0.036 h-1 for a specific uptake rate of 5 mmol/g cell/h. However, it should be noticed that for a lower specific uptake rate of 1 mmol/g cell/h no growth was predicted. Glycine is converted to glyoxylate, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia by glycine oxidase (30Molla G. Motteran L. Job V. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide is toxic, and its production during glycine fermentations at 25 mm (Biolog phenotyping) and 20 mm (29Mortl M. Diederichs K. Welte W. Molla G. Motteran L. Andriolo G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29718-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) might also inhibit cell growth of B. subtilis. For other cases, relatively higher growth rates were predicted and accordingly presented in supplemental Table S1 without further computations. Direct comparison of present Biolog results and growth data from literature is difficult, because fermentation conditions, including medium composition, can affect significantly cell growth. In addition, in many reports the experimental conditions have been poorly defined. Nevertheless, for the remaining cases, in silico predictions generally agreed with experimental data from the literature but not with the phenotype micro-arrays. For example, B. subtilis does not have a glyoxylate shunt, a pathway that allows acetate to be used as a sole carbon source (31Sonenshein A.L. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. From Genes to Cells. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 151-162Google Scholar). Bryan et al. (32Bryan E.M. Beall B.W. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that no growth was observed for B. subtilis with acetate as a sole carbon source. The metabolic network could produce NADH and ATP (namely aerobic respiration), but not biomass from acetate. In the high-throughput phenotype data, all of eight measurements for acetate indicated positive growth compared with that of the negative control (see supplemental Table S1). Biolog phenotyping system is based on colorimetric assay utilizing chemical reduction (purple color formation) of tetrazolium dye by NADH as a reporter system (19Bochner B.R. Gadzinski P. Panomitros E. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). However, NADH is an important electron carrier both in respiration and cell growth events, and cell respiration can occur independent of cell growth. The growth predictions of the in silico model for the Biolog substrates evaluated as low-confidence data were also compared with the data available in the literature by Medline search for the corresponding substrates. For 18 out of the 108 low-confidence cases, corresponding experimental growth data were available from biochemical literature, and the model could correctly predict the utilization of these substrates in 94% accuracy (17 of 18 cases) (Fig. 3D). Incorrect prediction for d-serine was further analyzed. Fisher and Debarobuille (33Fisher S.H. Debarobuille M. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. From Genes to Cells. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 181-191Google Scholar) indicated no growth with d-serine as a sole nitrogen source, although the growth condition was not defined, the model simulations suggested the growth was possible. In the biochemical network, dsdA gene was assumed to encode d-serine deaminase (EC 4.3.1.18) based on a sequence similarity, which is necessary for utilizing d-serine as a sole nitrogen source (2Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. From Genes to Cells. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002Google Scholar). Therefore, the functionality of dsdA gene product or toxic effect of d-serine on cell growth (34Bloom F.R. Mcfall E. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could be the subject of further experimental investigations. The examples of glycine and serine utilization illustrate the capability of the COBRA approach to pinpoint potential gaps in the understanding of metabolism and to guide experimental design. As a result of the high-throughput substrate utilization experiments, the B. subtilis network was expanded in size from 940 to 1015 unique reactions through the use of network gap analysis to identify additional reactions that would reconcile the model with the experimental data. Network gap analysis first finds metabolites that are either consumed only or produced only, and therefore, violate the material balance on the metabolites. Then the candidate reactions that could fill the gap are identified by analyzing the online pathway data base such as Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and/or biochemical literature, and metabolic pathway(s) on the basis of physiological information such as"

In mice, we found the molecular association of alpha-Klotho (alpha-Kl) and Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+-ATPase) and provide evidence for an increase of abundance of Na+,K+-ATPase at the plasma membrane. Low concentrations of extracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]e) rapidly induce regulated parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in an alpha-Kl- and Na+,K+-ATPase-dependent manner. The increased Na+ gradient created by Na+,K+-ATPase activity might drive the transepithelial transport of Ca2+ in cooperation with ion channels and transporters in the choroid plexus and the kidney. Our findings reveal fundamental roles of alpha-Kl in the regulation of calcium metabolism."

Identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 marks a key advance in understanding the genetic defects responsible for breast cancer (Miki et al., 1994Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M.

Several other genes, such as TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN, have also been implicated in familial and sporadic cancers (Samuels et al., 2004Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H.

Riggins G.J. et al.High frequency of mutations of the PIK3CA gene in human cancers.Science. 2004; 304: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar, Wooster and Weber, 2003Wooster R. Weber B.L. Breast and ovarian cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2339-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). However, the genetic defects for breast cancer have yet to be fully elucidated. There is an important distinction between autosomal and X-linked genes, as many genes in the latter category are subject to X inactivation, making it easier to fulfill Knudson's two-hit theory (Knudson, 1971Knudson Jr., A.G. Mutation and cancer: statistical study of retinoblastoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5203) Google Scholar). As such, X-linked tumor suppressor genes can potentially be more important, as LOH or mutation of a single allele can in effect functionally silence the gene (Spatz et al., 2004Spatz A. Borg C. Feunteun J. X-Chromosome genetics and human cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, essentially all tumor suppressor genes are autosomal (Spatz et al., 2004Spatz A. Borg C. Feunteun J. X-Chromosome genetics and human cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although tantalizing evidence concerning abnormalities in the X chromosome, including LOH, skewed inactivation, and selective loss, has been reported in breast cancer samples (Kristiansen et al., 2005Kristiansen M. Knudsen G.P. Maguire P. Margolin S. Pedersen J. Lindblom A. Orstavik K.H. High incidence of skewed X chromosome inactivation in young patients with familial non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer.J. Med.

Cytogenet. 2002; 135: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HER-2/Neu/ErbB2 is one of the first oncogenes to be identified (Schechter et al., 1984Schechter A.L. Stern D.F. Vaidyanathan L. Decker S.J. Drebin J.A. Greene M.I. Weinberg R.A. The neu oncogene: an erb-B-related gene encoding a 185,000-Mr tumour antigen.Nature. 1984; 312: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to be expressed in a large proportion of cancer cells (Garcia de Palazzo et al., 1993Garcia de Palazzo I. Klein-Szanto A. Weiner L.M. Immunohistochemical detection of c-erbB-2 expression by neoplastic human tissue using monospecific and bispecific monoclonal antibodies.Int. J. Biol. Markers. 1993; 8: 233-239PubMed Google Scholar). The level of HER-2/NEU is an important prognostic marker (Slamon et al., 1987Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Human breast cancer: correlation of relapse and survival with amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene.Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9449) Google Scholar). Anti-HER-2/NEU antibody Herceptin has emerged as an important therapeutic for patients with overexpressed HER-2/NEU on cancer tissues (Slamon et al., 2001Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. et al.Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (8842) Google Scholar). Given the clinical and therapeutic significance of Her-2/Neu/ErbB2 overexpression, it is important to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the overexpression. A well-established mechanism responsible for HER-2 overexpression in human cancer is gene amplification (Slamon et al., 1987Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Human breast cancer: correlation of relapse and survival with amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene.Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9449) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether gene amplification alone is sufficient to cause HER-2 overexpression. Moreover, a significant proportion of human cancers with moderate overexpression of HER-2 does not show gene amplification (Bofin et al., 2004Bofin A.M. Ytterhus B. Martin C. O'Leary J.J. Hagmar B.M. Detection and quantitation of HER-2 gene amplification and protein expression in breast carcinoma.Am. J. Clin.

Comparison between immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridization in assessing HER-2 status in breast cancer.Pathol. Int. 2005; 55: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is therefore of great interest to identify regulators for HER-2 expression in breast cancer. In this context, Xing et al., 2000Xing X. Wang S.C. Xia W. Zou Y. Shao R. Kwong K.Y. Yu Z. Zhang S. Miller S. Huang L. Hung M.C. The ets protein PEA3 suppresses HER-2/neu overexpression and inhibits tumorigenesis.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar reported that DNA-binding protein PEA3 specifically targets a DNA sequence on the HER-2/neu promoter and downregulates the promoter activity. It is less clear, however, whether genetic lesions of PEA3 can cause HER-2 overexpression. Foxp3 was identified during position cloning of Scurfin, a gene responsible for X-linked autoimmune diseases in mice and humans (immune dysregulation, polyendopathy, enterophathy, X-linked, IPEX) (Bennett et al., 2001Bennett C.L.

Our systemic analyses reported herein demonstrate that the Foxp3 gene is a mammary tumor suppressor in mice and humans. Moreover, Foxp3 represses the transcription of the HER-2/ErbB2 gene via interaction with forkhead DNA-binding motifs in the ErbB2 promoter. The mutant BALB/c mice we used for the initial study carried mutations in two closely linked X chromosome genes, Foxp3sf and Otcspf. During the course of the study, a spontaneous segregation of Otcspf allowed us to obtain a BALB/c Otcspf/+ strain. Meanwhile, we obtained an independent line of Scurfy mice that had never been crossed to the Spf mutant mice and we backcrossed the Scurfy mutant allele (Foxp3sf) for more than 12 generations into the BALB/c background (Chang et al., 2005Chang X.

Cancer incidences in the littermate controls and a line of congenic mice with a mutation in Otc but not Foxp3 were comparable with each other (Figures 1A and 1B). About 60% of the tumors were mammary carcinomas (Figures 1A and 1C), although other tumors, such as lymphoma, hepatoma, and sarcoma were observed. Histological analyses revealed lung metastasis (Figure 1A; lower panels, based on expression of ER and/or PR, data not shown) in about 40% of the mice with mammary cancer. More than a third of the tumor-bearing mice had multiple lesions in the mammary glands. Most, although not all, mammary carcinomas expressed the estrogen receptor (ER+, 14/18) and progesterone receptor (PR+, 12/18). In order to focus on mammary cancer, we treated the mice with a carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA), in conjunction with progesterone. Mice heterozygous for Foxp3sf, but not those heterozygous for Otcspf, showed substantially increased susceptibility to mammary cancer, as revealed by earlier onset and increased incidence (Figure 1D) and multiplicity (data not shown) of the breast tumors. These data demonstrate that a mutation of Foxp3, but not Otc, results in a major increase in susceptibility to mammary carcinoma. Since expression of Foxp3 has not been reported in mammary tissue, we isolated normal and cancerous cells by laser-capture microdissection (Figure S1A) and compared expression of Foxp3 and Otc by real-time RT-PCR and histochemistry. The complete absence of the cd3 transcripts (Figure S1B) indicated that the microdissected samples were devoid of T cells, the main cell types known to express Foxp3 (Fontenot et al., 2005Fontenot J.D. Rasmussen J.P. Williams L.M. Dooley J.L. Farr A.G. Rudensky A.Y. Regulatory T cell lineage specification by the forkhead transcription factor foxp3.Immunity. 2005; 22: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). A representative profile and summarized data of Foxp3 expression in Foxp3sf/+Otcspf/+ mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) control mice are shown in Figure 2A. Foxp3 mRNA was detected in normal mammary epithelium from both the WT and Foxp3sf/+Otcspf/+ mice, but not in mammary cancer cells from the same Foxp3sf/+Otcspf/+ mice. Immunohistochemical staining (Figure 2B) confirmed the loss of expression of Foxp3 in the mammary carcinoma generated from the Foxp3sf/+Otcspf/+ mice. Foxp3 is an X-linked gene that is subject to X-chromosomal inactivation (Fontenot et al., 2005Fontenot J.D. Rasmussen J.P. Williams L.M. Dooley J.L. Farr A.G. Rudensky A.Y. Regulatory T cell lineage specification by the forkhead transcription factor foxp3.Immunity. 2005; 22: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). We carried out an anchored RT-PCR and cloned the low levels of Foxp3 mRNA in the breast tissues. We sequenced the cDNA clones from pooled samples after ruling out potential T cell contamination (based on a lack of T cell specific cd3 transcripts; Figure S1B). As shown in Figure 2C, 100% of the Foxp3 transcripts in the cancerous tissues were from the mutant alleles, which indicate that the wild-type allele was silenced in the tumor cells. In contrast, the transcripts from the mutant allele constituted 15% of the transcripts in the normal mammary samples from the same mice. Thus, the expression pattern of Foxp3 fulfills another criterion for a tumor suppressor gene. Our characterization of the mammary tumors in the mutant mice revealed widespread upregulation of ErbB2, in contrast to those rare tumors from WT mice, as shown in Figure 3A and Table S1. Using real-time RT-PCR, 8- to 12-fold more ErbB2 mRNA was found in the cancer cells than in normal epithelium (Figure 3A). There was also more ErbB2 mRNA in the Foxp3sf/+spf/+ epithelium than in that of the WT female mice (Figure 3A), which indicates a potential gene dosage effect of Foxp3 on the regulation of ErbB2 expression in vivo. Transfection of the TSA cell line with Foxp3 cDNA repressed ErbB2 levels on the TSA cell line (Figure 3B). Analysis of the 5′ sequence of the ErbB2 gene revealed multiple binding motifs for the forkhead domain (Figure 3C). To test whether Foxp3 interacts with the ErbB2 promoter, we used anti-V5 antibody to precipitate sonicated chromatin from the TSA cells transfected with the Foxp3-V5 cDNA and used real-time PCR to quantitate the amounts of the specific ErbB2 promoter region precipitated by the anti-V5 antibodies in comparison to those that bound to mouse IgG control. As shown in Figure 3C, the anti-V5 antibodies pulled down significantly higher amounts of ErbB2 promoter DNA than the IgG control, with the highest signal around 1.6 kb 5′ of the transcription starting site. To test whether the binding correlated with the suppression by Foxp3, we produced luciferase reporter using the 1.8, 1.2, and 0.8 Kb upstream of the ErbB2 TSS and tested the ability of Foxp3 to repress ErbB2 promoter activity. In three separate cell lines, we observed that the region with the strongest ChIP signal was required for optimalrepression by Foxp3 (Figure 3D). Furthermore, we deleted two potential Foxp3 binding sites based on intensity of ChIP signal, abundance of consensus binding sites, and conservation between mouse and human (Figure S2) by site-directed mutagenesis and measured the effect on Foxp3-mediated repression. As shown in Figure 3E, deletion of either binding site substantially increased the ErbB2 promoter activity in the presence of Foxp3 and thus alleviated Foxp3-mediated repression. Since the region deleted in Mut B is 100% conserved between mouse and man and since this deletion completely wiped out repression, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to determine whether the forkhead DNA-binding motifs in region B bound to Foxp3. As shown in Figure 3F, the nuclear extracts from the Foxp3-expressing cells specifically retarded migration of the WT but not mutant 32P-labeled probes compared with control cells. While mutant cold probes did not affect Foxp3-binding activities, WT cold probes significantly diminished them, establishing that the binding of these complexes is specific to forkhead DNA-binding motifs. We therefore carried out site-directed mutagenesis to replace the 12 nucleotides (Mut C) within the ErbB2 promoter and compared the promoter activity and Foxp3-repression by luciferase assays. While the wild-type promoter was repressed by Foxp3, no repression by Foxp3 was observed when the mutant promoter was used. Moreover, in contrast to the deletional Mut B, the mutations had no impact on the basal activity of the ErbB2 promoter (Figure 3G). Taken together, our new data make a compelling case that Foxp3 represses the ErbB2 promoter via specific forkhead-binding motifs. We analyzed the levels and isoforms of the FOXP3 transcripts in a panel of normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), an immortalized but nonmalignant cell line (MCF-10A), and ten malignant breast cancer cell lines differing in ER/PR and HER-2 status. Early passage of HMEC with no methylation in the CpG island of the P16 promoter (Figure S3) was used to avoid effects associated with P16 inactivation in postsenescence HMEC cultures (Romanov et al., 2001Romanov S.R. Kozakiewicz B.K. Holst C.R. Stampfer M.R. Haupt L.M. Tlsty T.D. Normal human mammary epithelial cells spontaneously escape senescence and acquire genomic changes.Nature. 2001; 409: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4A, similar levels of FOXP3 transcripts were observed in two independent isolates of HMEC and in the immortalized cell line MCF-10A. Each of the ten tumor cell lines had a different degree of reduction in FOXP3 mRNA levels in comparison to HMEC and MCF-10A. Among them, two were completely devoid of FOXP3 mRNA, while the others had a 1.5- to 20-fold reduction. We then used anchored primers spanning exons 1–12 to amplify the FOXP3 transcripts, and then we sequenced the PCR products. As shown in Figure 4, none of the tumor cell lines expressed full-length FOXP3 transcripts. The HMEC expressed the same two isoforms as observed in the T cells, while MCF-10A expressed the exon 3-lacking isoforms. The same isoform was also found in four tumor cell lines at much lower levels. In addition, three tumor cell lines expressed an isoform lacking both exons 3 and 4. The alternative splicing resulted in a frameshift beginning at codon 70 and an early termination at codon 172. Furthermore, two tumor cell lines expressed a FOXP3 isoform lacking exons 3 and/or 8. Exon 8 encodes the leucine-zipper domain that is frequently mutated in IPEX patients (Ziegler, 2006Ziegler S.F. FOXP3: Of mice and men.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Thus, FOXP3 is abnormal in breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with a role for FOXP3 in repressing HER-2 expression, the majority of the breast cancer cell lines had higher levels of HER-2 in comparison to normal HMEC (Figure 4, lower panel). However, additional changes are also likely required for HER-2 overexpression, as three cell lines did not overexpress HER-2 even though the FOXP3 transcripts were greatly reduced. We took three approaches to determine whether the findings in the mutant mice and human breast cancer cell lines are relevant to the pathogenesis of human breast cancer. First, we used immunohistochemistry to determine expression of FOXP3 in normal versus cancerous tissue. As shown in Figure 5A, while about 80% of the normal breast samples expressed FOXP3 in the nuclei of the epithelial cells, only about 20% of the cancerous tissue showed nuclear staining. Second, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine whether the FOXP3 gene was deleted in the breast cancer samples. The minimal common region of deletion was identified using flanking p-telomeric and centromeric clones. Out of 223 informative samples, we observed 28 cases (12.6%) with deletions in any of the three loci. Interestingly, deletion of the FOXP3 locus was found in all of the 28 cases (Figure 5B and Table S2). These data suggest that FOXP3 is likely within the minimal region of deletion in the Xp11 region studied. Although all deletions were heterozygous, the FOXP3 protein was undetectable in 26 out of 28 cases. Thus, it appears that for the majority of the breast cancer samples, LOH alone was sufficient to inactivate the locus, perhaps due to X-chromosomal inactivation. The two cases with both deletion and FOXP3 expression had X polysomy with three and four X chromosomes, respectively (Table S2). Thirdly, we isolated DNA from matched normal and cancerous tissues (50 cases with formalin-fixed samples and 15 cases of frozen samples) from patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and amplified all 11 coding exons and intron-exon boundary regions by PCR. Two independent PCR products were sequenced in order to confirm the mutations. Unless the bulk sequencing data were unambiguous (Figures S4A and S4C), the PCR products were cloned, and five to ten independent clones from each reaction were sequenced (Figure S4B). Among the formalin fixed samples, we only used the cases in which the normal tissue samples gave unambiguous sequencing data that matched the wild-type FOXP3 sequence. When the cancerous tissues were compared with normal tissues from the same patient, 36% (18 out of 50 formalin-fixed samples and 5 out of 15 frozen samples) showed somatic mutations (Table S3). Loss of the wild-type allele was found in 6 out of 23 cases (38%) of cancer samples with somatic FOXP3 mutations (see Figure S4C for an example). The other cases had heterozygous mutations (Figure S4A). Eighteen mutations resulted in the replacement of amino acids. Most are likely to be critical for FOXP3 function, as judged from the pattern of mutation in IPEX patients (Ziegler, 2006Ziegler S.F. FOXP3: Of mice and men.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) or in the conserved zinc finger domain that has so far not been implicated (Figure 5C). Although most samples had a single mutation of the FOXP3 gene, we did observe two cases with multiple mutations. In the first sample (Figure S4B; case 3 in Table S3), the two mutations occurred in consecutive codons, resulting in two nonconservative replacements of amino acid residues. Clonal analysis revealed that both mutations occurred in the same clone (Figure S4B). In the second sample (Table S3; case 16), three mutations occurred in intron 11. Since this case lacked a WT allele (Figure S4D), it is likely that all of the mutations occurred in the same allele. The possibility of a mismatch in the cancer and normal samples was ruled out by comparing the normal and cancer samples for polymorphism of two unrelated genes (data not shown). To directly test whether FOXP3 mutations affect the repressor activity for the HER-2 gene, we chose two representative somatic FOXP3 mutants isolated in the cancer cells and tested their repressor activity for the HER-2 promoter. One mutation (338P > L) resided in the signature forkhead domain, which is often mutated in the IPEX patient, while the other double mutation (204C > R205E > K) was from the zinc finger domain that has not been implicated in IPEX patients. As shown in Figure 5E, both mutations significantly reduced the repressor activity of FOXP3. The reduced repression of the HER-2 promoter correlates with a significantly reduced inhibition of HER-2 mRNA (Figure 5D). Four cases had mutations in introns that may potentially affect RNA splicing. We used laser-guided microdissection to isolate normal and cancerous epithelial cells from one case with a mutation in intron 6 (case 23; Table S3). RNA was isolated and tested for the potential effects of the mutation on RNA splicing (using primers on exons 5 and 8) and total FOXP3 transcript, as quantitated by real-time PCR using primers spanning exons 10–12. Tissues from another patient with a mutation in exon 7 were used as control. As show in Figure 5E's left panel, primers spanning exons 5 and 8 failed to detect FOXP3 mRNA from the cancerous tissue of case no. 23. Furthermore, primers spanning exons 10–12 also failed to detect any FOXP3 transcripts. Substantial levels were detected in the normal epithelial cells of the same patients as well as in normal and cancerous tissues from case no. 22. Since the wild-type allele had been lost in the cancer cells of case no. 23, it is likely that the mutation in intron 6 inactivated FOXP3. With an intron of 944 nucleotides, a mutation that prevented splicing of intron 6 would cause premature-termination codon-mediated RNA decay, which is operative in the FOXP3 gene (Chatila et al., 2000Chatila T.A. Blaeser F. Ho N. Lederman H.M. Voulgaropoulos C. Helms C. Bowcock A.M. JM2, encoding a fork head-related protein, is mutated in X-linked autoimmunity-allergic disregulation syndrome.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R75-R81Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). To demonstrate a role for FOXP3 defect in HER-2 overexpression, we first silenced the FOXP3 gene in early passage of primary HMEC (Supplemental Fig. S3) using a lentiviral vector expressing FOXP3 siRNA. As shown in Figure 6A, the FOXP3 siRNA reduced FOXP3 expression by more than 100-fold while increasing HER-2 mRNA by 7-fold. A corresponding increase in cell surface HER-2 was also observed (Figure 6B). These results implicate FOXP3 as a repressor of HER-2 in human breast epithelial cells. Second, since a major mechanism for HER-2 upregulation in breast cancer is gene amplification (Kallioniemi et al., 1992Kallioniemi O.P. Kallioniemi A. Kurisu W. Thor A. Chen L.C. Smith H.S. Waldman F.M. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 5321-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), an intriguing issue is whether FOXP3 is capable of repressing HER-2 in cancer cells with an amplified HER-2 gene. We produced a Tet-off line of BT474, a breast cancer cell line known to have HER-2 gene amplification (Kallioniemi et al., 1992Kallioniemi O.P. Kallioniemi A. Kurisu W. Thor A. Chen L.C. Smith H.S.

After drug selection, the cells were cultured either in the presence or absence of doxycycline. While the cells cultured with doxycycline did not express FOXP3 (data not shown), removal of doxycycline resulted in induction of FOXP3 in a significant fraction of the cancer cells, which allowed us to compare HER-2 levels in the FOXP3+ and FOXP3− cells in the same culture by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 6C, FOXP3− cells had about a 5- to 10-fold higher level of the HER-2 protein on the cell surface in comparison to the FOXP"

By analyzing DNA fingerprinting (amplified fragment-length polymorphism) of nine plant species, we show that long-distance colonization of a remote arctic archipelago, Svalbard, has occurred repeatedly and from several source regions. Propagules are likely carried by wind and drifting sea ice. The genetic effect of restricted colonization was strongly correlated with the temperature requirements of the species, indicating that establishment limits distribution more than dispersal. Thus, it may be appropriate to assume unlimited dispersal when predicting long-term range shifts in the Arctic."

While this core region is highly structured, the N- and C-terminal regions appear to be less ordered, with the C terminus being largely unfolded. Surprisingly, it was found that the borders of the core region extend significantly beyond the NAC region (residues 61–95). Various studies suggest that the core region begins somewhere in the range of residues 31–39 and ends around residues 95–109 (24Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol.

Despite these results and the initial assignment of secondary structure for selected parts of the core region by ssNMR (26Heise H. Hoyer W. Becker S. Andronesi O.C. Riedel D. Baldus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15871-15876Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), the precise extent of the core region and its three-dimensional structure remain unknown. In the present study, we applied EPR spectroscopy, together with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) (28Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 29Margittai M. Langen R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 122-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), to further investigate the structure of α-synuclein fibrils. We generated 83 different spin-labeled derivatives of α-synuclein, including a nitroxide scan wherein each residue of α-synuclein (from 30–101) was replaced by spin label R1 (Fig. 1), one amino acid at a time. EPR analysis of fibrils grown from these derivatives was performed in order to: (a) define the precise location of the core region, (b) assign secondary structural elements within the core region, and (c) investigate the reported parallelism within α-synuclein fibrils (24Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Generation of α-Synuclein Single Cysteine Mutants—A truncation mutant (115ter) of human α-synuclein, containing residues 1–115, was generated by adding two stop codons between residues 115 and 116. The original wild-type human α-synuclein construct (in pRK172) that was used for this modification was provided by Dr. M. Goedert (Medical Research Council Laboratory, Cambridge, UK). No native cysteines exist in human α-synuclein. Single cysteines were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification of 115ter α-Synuclein—Proteins were expressed and purified based upon the previously described protocol for the full-length protein (24Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The only notable difference was that the steps after acid precipitation and centrifugation were modified. At this point, the 115ter proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, then loaded onto a HiTrap SPXL column (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were then eluted in 0–1 m NaCl gradient, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing 115ter α-synuclein were subsequently pooled and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added. Protein purity was >95% according to Bio-Safe™ Coomassie Stain (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration was determined by using a Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Spin Labeling and Fibril Assembly of 115ter α-Synuclein—Recombinant α-synuclein was filtered through an Amicon YM-100 spin filter (MWCO 1 × 105, Millipore) to remove any pre-aggregates. Immediately before spin labeling, dithiothreitol was removed by loading the protein solution onto a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, then eluted using the same buffer. α-Synuclein was labeled with 10-fold molar excess of R1 MTSL spin label [1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl]methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) or with a mixture of diluted R1 spin label and the diamagnetic analog, R1′ [1-acetyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl]-methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals) (see Fig. 1) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess label was removed using PD-10 columns with the aforementioned elution buffer. Spin-labeled proteins were washed twice with elution buffer, concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (MWCO 5 × 103, Millipore), and assembled into fibrils as described previously (24Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Spin-labeled proteins (100 μm or higher) were incubated in the aforementioned elution buffer at 37 °C under constant agitation for 3–5 days. Fibrils were harvested by ultracentrifugation and washed twice with the same elution buffer. The quality of the fibrils was monitored by electron microscopy (EM) of negative-stained samples, by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and by thioflavin T fluorescence spectroscopy as described (31Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48420-48425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The truncated synuclein formed fibrils much faster than did the full-length wild-type (8 h versus 48 h). Fibril dimensions were similar to that of wild-type, although increased lateral aggregation of the 115ter-based fibrils was noted. Seeding R1-labeled 115ter with full-length wild-type α-synuclein fibrils was performed as reported previously (32Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). X-band EPR Spectroscopy and Data Analysis—The derivatized proteins were loaded into quartz capillaries (0.6-mm inner diameter × 0.84-mm outer diameter, VitroCom, Mt. Lakes, NJ) or TPX capillaries (for accessibility measurements), and EPR spectra were recorded on X-band Bruker EMX spectrometers (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA). Full spectral scans were performed using an ER 4119HS resonator, and accessibility measurements were performed using an ER 4123D dielectric resonator at room temperature. The spectral scans obtained at room temperature using the ER 4119HS resonator had a scan width of 150 Gauss at an incident microwave power of 12 milliwatt. All EPR spectra shown were normalized to the same amount of spins, using double integration, and are presented as normalized. For distance measurements, EPR spectra were obtained at 233 K using a Bruker N2 temperature controller (ER4131VT), and were recorded at 200 Gauss scan width. The O2 accessibility Π (O2) of fibrils from 25% R1-labeled 115ter α-synuclein was determined using the standard power saturation method (33Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded as a function of microwave power (from 100.58 to 1.59 milliwatt) in the presence of pure O2 and N2 at room temperature. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the central line was plotted as a function of incident microwave power and fitted to obtain the P1/2 parameters for O2 and N2 (33Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The dimensionless quantity Π (O2) was obtained from the difference of the respective P1/2 values divided by the peak-to-peak line width of the given sample. To correct for variations in resonator properties, we also applied the normalization using the diphenyldipicrylhydrazide standard as described in reference (33Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Sample stability was verified in control experiments, which demonstrated that EPR spectra and accessibilities did not change over the time course of one month. Simulation of dipolar broadening was performed using software generously provided by Drs. Altenbach and Hubbell, as described previously (34Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Exchange Narrowing Reveals Parallel, In-register Structure with Physical Contact between the Same Residues in Core Region of α-Synuclein Fibrils—Previous SDSL studies on α-synuclein have shown that same sites from different molecules come into close proximity (24Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The accuracy of this analysis, however, was not sufficient to fully distinguish whether parallelism occurred between sheets (∼10 Å apart) or strands (4.7 Å apart), and it was not clear whether the spin-spin interactions arose from the proximity of two or more spin labels. With sufficient spectral quality, such a distinction can be made by EPR as the close proximity between same sites in multiple parallel strands can give rise to characteristic exchange narrowed, single line EPR spectra (35Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 36Margittai M. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37820-37827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because exchange narrowing is defined by single-line EPR spectra (37Molin Y.N. Salikhov K.M. Zamaraev K.I. Spin Exchange. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1980Crossref Google Scholar), the presence of hyperfine (outer) peaks can easily obscure this spectral line shape. To optimize spectral quality and minimize components from unpolymerized protein or other background labeling (possibly due to codon mistranslation (38Masuda M. Dohmae N. Nonaka T. Oikawa T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)), we employed a C-terminal truncation mutant of α-synuclein, containing residues 1–115. The highly negatively charged C terminus of α-synuclein remained unstructured in the fibril and was inhibitory to fibril formation in vivo and in vitro (23Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8870-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous studies, we found that the C-terminal truncation mutant formed fibrils much more readily. According to thioflavin T fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopy, fibrils formed in ∼8 h as compared with 48 h for the full-length protein (data not shown). Although the truncation mutant had a greater tendency to aggregate laterally, its fibrils had a highly similar morphology to that of wild-type α-synuclein, giving rise to fibril diameters of 6–12 nm; this is in agreement with previously published results for wild-type α-synuclein as well as for C-terminal truncation mutants (40Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 41Murray I.V. Giasson B.I. Quinn S.M. Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8530-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We therefore generated singly R1-labeled 115ter derivatives and used EPR spectroscopy to investigate their structures in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Spectra of all 115ter derivatives in solution were highly similar to each other. As illustrated with the representative examples of 25R1, 52R1, and 103R1 (Fig. 2A, plotted at ×1/10 scale), the spectra have very sharp and narrowly spaced lines. These spectral features arise from a high degree of mobility (R1 rotational correlation time in the subnanosecond time scale), and are in agreement with the previously noted disordered structure in solution (24Der-Sarkissian A.

Soc. 2005; 127: 476-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, B–D, fibril formation induced significant spectral changes. Spectra derived from sites within the N terminus (Fig. 2B: R1-labeled positions 25, 30, and 32) have multiple components of varying mobility, which is in agreement with the notion that the structure in this region is likely to be heterogeneous (24Der-Sarkissian A.

Woods Jr., V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15477-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). While spectra from the C terminus (Fig. 2D, R1-labeled positions 103, 108, and 109) are also heterogeneous, yet are dominated by sharp lines of high mobility, these components are still broader than those from the soluble protein (for example, compare position 103 spectra between 2A and 2D). Overall, the data from the C-terminal sites are consistent with the previously reported presence of highly dynamic structure in this region (24Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37530-37535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 25Del Mar C. Greenbaum E.A. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Woods Jr., V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2005; 102: 15871-15876Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Most spectra derived from sites located within the core region (Fig. 2C: R1-labeled positions 52, 60, 71, 80, and 90) are almost completely free of hyperfine lines (the remaining outer peaks amounts to less than 0.3% of the signal, as estimated by spectral simulations). The single-line EPR spectra obtained from these sites are reminiscent of those previously recorded from tau fibrils and clearly indicate the presence of spin exchange narrowing. Similar results were also obtained when R1-labeled 115ter derivatives were seeded with full-length wild-type α-synuclein fibrils (data not shown), suggesting that the full-length fibrils and 115ter α-synuclein adopt similar fibrillar structures. Thus, these data argue that, α-synuclein fibrils must generate a highly specific structure in which multiple, equivalent residues from different polypeptide chains come into direct contact. To further investigate the effects of spin exchange narrowing, and to illustrate that such exchange narrowing requires simultaneous contact between multiple spin labels, we performed a series of spin-dilution experiments. In this set of experiments, fibrils were assembled from protein labeled at position 52 with various mixtures of R1 and its diamagnetic analogue, R1′ (Fig. 1). The rationale for this spin-dilution experiment is that the presence of R1′ will increase the distance between R1 groups and thereby decrease the effects of spin-spin interactions, in particular that of exchange narrowing. As shown in Fig. 3A (the integrals/absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 3B), increasing dilution with R1′ successively promotes the formation of three-line EPR spectra with clear hyperfine structure and the resulting spectral features that are indicative of strong immobilization. These data clearly show that the single-line EPR spectra observed for the fully R1-labeled fibrils are caused by spin-spin interactions. Next, we systematically investigated the effect of spin dilution on the EPR spectra of 52R1/R1′ fibrils (Fig. 3A) by recording the normalized spectral amplitude as a function of spin dilution (Fig. 3C, black dots connected by solid line). At lower percentages of R1 (≤50%) the dipolar spin-spin interaction increases with increasing amounts of R1 and causes progressive line and spectral broadening as well as a loss in signal amplitude. This behavior is typically observed for dipolar broadening (50Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol.

Deficiency in NPC2 is the cause of Niemann-Pick type C2 disease, a fatal neurovisceral disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. Here we report the crystal structure of bovine NPC2 bound to cholesterol-3-O-sulfate, an analog that binds with greater apparent affinity than cholesterol. Structures of both apo-bound and sterol-bound NPC2 were observed within the same crystal lattice, with an asymmetric unit containing one molecule of apoNPC2 and two molecules of sterol-bound NPC2. As predicted from a previously determined structure of apoNPC2, the sterol binds in a deep hydrophobic pocket sandwiched between the two β-sheets of NPC2, with only the sulfate substituent of the ligand exposed to solvent. In the two available structures of apoNPC2, the incipient ligand-binding pocket, which ranges from a loosely packed hydrophobic core to a small tunnel, is too small to accommodate cholesterol. In the presence of sterol, the pocket expands, facilitated by a slight separation of the β-strands and substantial reorientation of some side chains, resulting in a perfect molding of the pocket around the hydrocarbon portion of cholesterol. A notable feature is the repositioning of two aromatic residues at the tunnel entrance that are essential for NPC2 function.

Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is central to the distribution of dietary cholesterol for utilization in membrane synthesis, synthesis of sterol hormones and derivatives, creation of lipid storage droplets, and regulation of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. Dietary cholesterol, in the form of cholesterol esters in low density lipoprotein particles, enters cells via low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis. Low density lipoprotein particles are transported to lysosomes, where acid lipase converts cholesterol esters to free cholesterol. This cholesterol then leaves lysosomes and is subsequently targeted to other intracellular and extracellular locations to meet specific cellular needs.Insight into the proteins that mediate egress of cholesterol from lysosomes has come from identification of genes involved in Niemann-Pick type C disease, a fatal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. Two genes are associated with the disease: NPC1 and NPC2. Similar phenotypes have been observed in mice deficient in either one or both genes, leading to the hypothesis that NPC1 and NPC2 function together in a single pathway to transport cholesterol out of lysosomes. NPC1 is a large transmembrane protein that contains an intramembranous sterol-sensing domain and belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division permease superfamily. NPC2 is a 130-amino acid lysosomal glycoprotein and belongs to the MD-2-related lipid recognition domain family of lipid-binding proteins (1Inohara N. Nuñez G. Trends Biochem.

However, unlike the structures of these proteins in the absence of ligands, apoNPC2 lacks a large preformed internal hydrophobic cavity for lipid binding. In its place is a loosely packed hydrophobic core that was proposed to be an incipient sterol-binding pocket that expands to accommodate cholesterol. Further support for the proposed binding site was provided by mutagenesis studies that showed three conserved residues lining the pocket to be essential for cholesterol binding (6Ko D.C. Binkley J. Sidow A. Scott M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2518-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and by the identification of a mutated residue at the base of the pocket in a patient with late onset NPC2 disease (11Kluönemann H.H.

Neurol. 2002; 52: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).We have determined the crystal structure of bovine NPC2 bound to cholesterol-3-O-sulfate. The ligand-binding pocket is positioned as postulated previously and is formed by subtle repositioning of β-strands and side chains within the hydrophobic interior, creating a tunnel that appears to be molded to fit around the sterol. The malleable nature of the pocket suggested by this tight fit is consistent with the observed tolerance of structural and chemical variations, both in the sterol ligand and in residues that line the binding cavity. NPC2 exhibits a unique composite of specific features observed in different lipid-binding proteins from diverse families.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSterol Binding Analysis—Delipidated endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-deglycosylated bovine NPC2 was prepared as described previously (7Friedland N.

For each analysis, 68 μm NPC2 in 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, was incubated with 1.5 mol eq of the indicated sterol (the addition of 4.8% volume of 2.5 mm sterol dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 30 min at 20 °C. For competition assays, NPC2 was incubated with cholesterol for 30 min, cholesterol sulfate was added, and incubation was continued an additional 30 min. Sterol binding was assessed by shifts in retention time of NPC2 during cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S column (GE Healthcare) as described previously (12Liou H.L. Dixit S.S. Xu S.

After 10 min at 20 °C, the mixture was filtered (0.2 μm) and applied to a Mono S 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare), and the complex was eluted using a linear 60-column volume gradient of 0.01-0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. The complex was concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml and buffer-exchanged into 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. Crystals were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion with equal volumes of protein complex and reservoir (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). Rod-shaped crystals with a width of ∼0.1 mm appeared in 1 week.Data Collection and Structure Determination—A crystal was cryoprotected in 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 85 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 15% glycerol and frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream. A complete data set at 1.81 Å resolution was collected from a single crystal at beam line X29C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using the HKL suite (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (14McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Strong electron density was observed in 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps at the predicted sterol-binding sites in molecules B and C but not in molecule A. Two cholesterol sulfate molecules were added to the model, and it was subjected to multiple rounds of manual rebuilding using XtalView (16McRee D.E. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCholesterol Sulfate Binding to NPC2—Numerous attempts to crystallize bovine NPC2 bound to cholesterol were unsuccessful. NPC2 formed a stable 1:1 complex with cholesterol that showed no detectable loss of ligand over several weeks (data not shown). Crystals were readily obtained under a variety of conditions, but all crystals had cubic morphology similar to apoNPC2 crystals (7Friedland N. Liou H-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and upon structure determination, all were found to lack cholesterol. Thus, it appeared that this crystal lattice selectively favored apoNPC2.Human and bovine NPC2 bind a variety of cholesterol derivatives, including cholesterol-3-O-sulfate (12Liou H.L. Dixit S.S. Xu S. Tint G.S. Stock A.M. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36710-36723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Cholesterol sulfate binds tightly, with an apparent affinity greater than that of cholesterol. NPC2 selectively binds cholesterol sulfate from an equimolar mixture of the two sterols (data not shown), and cholesterol sulfate can completely displace previously bound cholesterol from NPC2 (Fig. 1).FIGURE 1Chromatographic analysis of ligand binding to NPC2. Bovine NPC2 was incubated in the absence (green) or presence of cholesterol (blue), cholesterol-3-O-sulfate (red), or cholesterol followed by cholesterol-3-O-sulfate (black) and subjected to cation exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Decreased retention time is correlated with ligand binding (12Liou H.L.

Under similar conditions, crystals of a different morphology were occasionally obtained. A single data set to 1.81 Å resolution was collected from a rare rod-like crystal that was subsequently found to represent a new crystal form. Using the structure of apoNPC2 as a search model, the structure was solved by molecular replacement methods. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The asymmetric unit contained three molecules of NPC2 (MolA, MolB, and MolC). Difference electron density maps revealed strong density compatible with cholesterol sulfate located within the proposed ligand-binding sites of two NPC2 protomers (MolB and MolC) but not in the third (MolA) (Fig. 2). The lack of ligand in MolA can be rationalized by inspection of crystal packing. The protruding sulfate of a bound cholesterol sulfate ligand in MolA cannot be accommodated within the crystal lattice due to steric collisions with symmetry-related NPC2 protomers.FIGURE 2Electron density at the ligand-binding site. A difference electron density map (Fo - Fc) calculated at 1.8 Å resolution with phases from the final model with ligand omitted and contoured at 2.5σ reveals electron density consistent with cholesterol-3-O-sulfate within the interior of MolB (A) but not in MolA (B). The Cα traces for NPC2 MolB (blue) and MolA (green) and a stick representation of cholesterol sulfate in MolB (carbon in gold, oxygen in red, sulfur in yellow) from the final model are shown superimposed with the density maps.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Apo- and Sterol-bound States of NPC2—Both apo-bound and sterol-bound structures exhibit the same seven-stranded β-sandwich fold, stabilized by three disulfide bonds connecting residues Cys-8-Cys-121, Cys-23-Cys-28, and Cys-74-Cys-80 (Fig. 3A). An N-acetylglucosamine moiety, the residual of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase Hf deglycosylation, modifies Asn-39, the single site of glycosylation in bovine NPC2. Cholesterol sulfate binds as postulated previously (7Friedland N. Liou H-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) in a deep hydrophobic tunnel that penetrates into the protein core from an opening rimmed by βD and the βE-βF loop with only the sulfate substituent at the 3-hydroxyl of the sterol exposed to solvent.The conformation of apoNPC2 (MolA) is distinct from that of sterol-bound NPC2 and also different from the previously determined structure of apoNPC2 (7Friedland N. Liou H-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The conformations of the two NPC2 proteins with bound sterol are very similar, with an r.m.s.d. 3The abbreviation used is: r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. of 0.37 Å for all 130 aligned Cα atoms. Henceforth, MolB will be used as a representative of cholesterol sulfate-bound NPC2. Pairwise alignment of the two apoNPC2 structures and cholesterol sulfate-bound NPC2 in all combinations yielded r.m.s.d.s of 0.8-1.1 Å for all Cα atoms. Superpositioning of the three structures reveals that substantial backbone displacements (r.m.s.d. > 0.4 Å) are localized to a small region near the sterol-binding pocket, corresponding to portions of βB (residues 31-37), βD (residues 61-70), βE (residues 93-102), and adjacent loops (Fig. 3B). Within this region, the two apoNPC2 structures are more “closed” than sterol-bound NPC2 with a closer positioning of the β-strands from opposing β-sheets. The apoNPC2 structure observed in MolA is intermediate between the fully closed previously described apoNPC2 structure (7Friedland N. Liou H-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2512-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and the fully “open” structure exhibited by sterol-bound NPC2. Surface residues near the binding pocket of MolA make several intermolecular contacts with a symmetry related MolB, raising the possibility that the crystal lattice stabilizes the intermediate conformation of MolA.The Sterol-binding Pocket—Comparison of surfaces and volumes of the binding pockets in the different apoNPC2 and sterol-bound NPC2 structures indicates that the pocket is fully formed only in the presence of bound ligand (Fig. 4). The incipient binding site in closed apoNPC2 contains only a cluster of small cavities with a total volume of 180 Å3, whereas the intermediate conformation of apoNPC2 contains an almost continuous cavity with a total volume of 310 Å3, calculated using the CASTp web server (18Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (-W118): W116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The cavity in sterol-bound NPC2 is 720 Å3, just large enough to accommodate the hydrophobic portion of cholesterol, which occupies a total volume of 740 Å3. The cavity is nearly identical in both sterol-bound NPC2 molecules, with similar conformations of cholesterol sulfate (r.m.s.d. of 0.13 Å for all sterol atoms) and tunnels that are molded tightly around the hydrophobic portion of the ligand. The creation of a molded-to-fit hydrophobic tunnel by expansion of a minimal incipient cavity has been previously observed in a glycosphingolipid transfer protein, which binds the lipid chains of lactosylceramide in a tunnel sandwiched between two α-helical layers (19Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, this mode of interaction is relatively rare among lipid-binding proteins, which typically contain large preformed cavities that have volumes substantially greater than the ligands and can often accommodate a variety of lipids and different binding orientations (8Wright C.S.

Approximately half of these residues are positioned differently in the closed and open tunnels, either as a result of backbone displacements alone or in combination with side chain reorientations. The other residues occupy similar positions in both structures. Interestingly, with only two exceptions (Val-20 and Phe-66), these two classes of static and displaced residues are segregated onto different faces of the β-sandwich (Fig. 5A). Thus, the tunnel appears to be constructed from one fixed and one mobile wall.FIGURE 5Ligand-binding site residues.

The sulfate moiety sits at the mouth of the tunnel, fully accessible to solvent. It is presumed that cholesterol binds in an analogous manner with the 3β-hydroxyl group exposed. The oxygen of cholesterol sulfate that corresponds to the hydroxyl of cholesterol forms no hydrogen bonds with the protein. Notably, there are no interactions with the side chain of Lys-97, which was previously postulated to interact with the hydroxyl group of bound sterol (6Ko D.C. Binkley J. Sidow A. Scott M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In NPC2, the lysine side chain is oriented away from the tunnel entrance with the side chain of Tyr-100 blocking its access to the ligand (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the observation that substitution of alanine for Lys-97 has little effect on sterol binding (6Ko D.C. Binkley J. Sidow A. Scott M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2518-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).FIGURE 6Entrance to the sterol-binding tunnel.

Thus, unlike the case of the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α ligand-binding domain, for which increased affinity for cholesterol sulfate relative to cholesterol was attributed to three additional hydrogen bonds between the protein and the sulfate (27Kallen J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14033-14038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of NPC2 provides no structural rationale for the apparent higher affinity for cholesterol sulfate. It therefore seems likely that the higher apparent affinity of cholesterol sulfate relative to cholesterol reflects its greater solubility, providing a higher concentration of non-micellar ligand available for binding to the protein (12Liou H.L.

https://openalex.org/W2078263362,"The stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) are regulated by the post-translational hydroxylation of specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues. We show that the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), also catalyzes hydroxylation of highly conserved asparaginyl residues within ankyrin repeat (AR) domains (ARDs) of endogenous Notch receptors. AR hydroxylation decreases the extent of ARD binding to FIH while not affecting signaling through the canonical Notch pathway. ARD proteins were found to efficiently compete with HIF for FIH-dependent hydroxylation. Crystallographic analyses of the hydroxylated Notch ARD (2.35A) and of Notch peptides bound to FIH (2.4-2.6A) reveal the stereochemistry of hydroxylation on the AR and imply that significant conformational changes are required in the ARD fold in order to enable hydroxylation at the FIH active site. We propose that ARD proteins function as natural inhibitors of FIH and that the hydroxylation status of these proteins provides another oxygen-dependent interface that modulates HIF signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2074589989,"Intracellular Ca(2+) regulates numerous proteins and cellular functions and can vary substantially over submicron and submillisecond scales, so precisely localized fast detection is desirable. We have created a approximately 1-kDa biarsenical Ca(2+) indicator, called Calcium Green FlAsH (CaGF, 1), to probe [Ca(2+)] surrounding genetically targeted proteins. CaGF attached to a tetracysteine motif becomes ten-fold more fluorescent upon binding Ca(2+), with a K(d) of approximately 100 microM, <1-ms kinetics and good Mg(2+) rejection. In HeLa cells expressing tetracysteine-tagged connexin 43, CaGF labels gap junctions and reports Ca(2+) waves after injury. Total internal reflection microscopy of tetracysteine-tagged, CaGF-labeled alpha(1C) L-type calcium channels shows fast-rising depolarization-evoked Ca(2+) transients, whose lateral nonuniformity suggests that the probability of channel opening varies greatly over micron dimensions. With moderate Ca(2+) buffering, these transients decay surprisingly slowly, probably because most of the CaGF signal comes from closed channels feeling Ca(2+) from a tiny minority of clustered open channels. With high Ca(2+) buffering, CaGF signals decay as rapidly as the calcium currents, as expected for submicron Ca(2+) domains immediately surrounding active channels. Thus CaGF can report highly localized, rapid [Ca(2+)] dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2169151715,"Genetically engineered mice provide powerful tools for understanding mammalian gene function. These models traditionally rely on gene overexpression from transgenes or targeted, irreversible gene mutation. By adapting the tetracycline (tet)-responsive system previously used for gene overexpression, we have developed a simple transgenic system to reversibly control endogenous gene expression using RNA interference (RNAi) in mice. Transgenic mice harboring a tet-responsive RNA polymerase II promoter driving a microRNA-based short hairpin RNA targeting the tumor suppressor Trp53 reversibly express short hairpin RNA when crossed with existing mouse strains expressing general or tissue-specific 'tet-on' or 'tet-off' transactivators. Reversible Trp53 knockdown can be achieved in several tissues, and restoring Trp53 expression in lymphomas whose development is promoted by Trp53 knockdown leads to tumor regression. By leaving the target gene unaltered, this approach permits tissue-specific, reversible regulation of endogenous gene expression in vivo, with potential broad application in basic biology and drug target validation."
https://openalex.org/W2046134480,"In dividing cells, kinetochores couple chromosomes to the tips of growing and shortening microtubule fibres and tension at the kinetochore-microtubule interface promotes fibre elongation. Tension-dependent microtubule fibre elongation is thought to be essential for coordinating chromosome alignment and separation, but the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. Using optical tweezers, we applied tension to a model of the kinetochore-microtubule interface composed of the yeast Dam1 complex bound to individual dynamic microtubule tips. Higher tension decreased the likelihood that growing tips would begin to shorten, slowed shortening, and increased the likelihood that shortening tips would resume growth. These effects are similar to the effects of tension on kinetochore-attached microtubule fibres in many cell types, suggesting that we have reconstituted a direct mechanism for microtubule-length control in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081614212,"In Arabidopsis the NRT2.1 gene encodes a main component of the root high-affinity nitrate uptake system (HATS). Its regulation has been thoroughly studied showing a strong correlation between NRT2.1 expression and HATS activity. Despite its central role in plant nutrition, nothing is known concerning localization and regulation of NRT2.1 at the protein level. By combining a green fluorescent protein fusion strategy and an immunological approach, we show that NRT2.1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane of root cortical and epidermal cells, and that several forms of the protein seems to co-exist in cell membranes (the monomer and at least one higher molecular weight complex). The monomer is the most abundant form of NRT2.1, and seems to be the one involved in NO3− transport. It strictly requires the NAR2.1 protein to be expressed and addressed at the plasma membrane. No rapid changes in NRT2.1 abundance were observed in response to light, sucrose, or nitrogen treatments that strongly affect both NRT2.1 mRNA level and HATS activity. This suggests the occurrence of post-translational regulatory mechanisms. One such mechanism could correspond to the cleavage of NRT2.1 C terminus, which results in the presence of both intact and truncated proteins in the plasma membrane.

One such mechanism could correspond to the cleavage of NRT2.1 C terminus, which results in the presence of both intact and truncated proteins in the plasma membrane. The NRT2.1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana is part of a small multigene family comprising 7 members, which with the exception of NRT2.7, are predominantly expressed in the roots (1Orsel M. Filleur S.

In all plant species investigated to date, the NO3− HATS displays a saturable activity, with a Vmax generally reached for NO3− concentrations comprised between 0.2 and 0.5 mm (3Forde B.G. Biochim.

Although the functional characterization of almost all higher plant NRT2 transporters remains to be done, it is now well documented that NRT2.1 is a major component of the HATS in A. thaliana as shown by the fact that (i) of the seven NRT2 members, only NRT2.1 transcript abundance showed significant correlation (r2 = 0.74) with HATS activity (2Okamoto M. Vidmar J.J. Glass A.D. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 304-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 11Zhuo D. Okamoto M. Vidmar J.J. Glass A.D.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) have lost up to 75% of the high-affinity NO3− uptake activity. As a consequence, growth of these mutants is severely impaired at low NO3− concentration (15Li W. Wang Y. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Orsel M. Chopin F. Leleu O. Smith S.J. Krapp A. Daniel-Vedele F. Miller A.J.

Planta. 2004; 219: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but not at high NO3− concentration when low-affinity transporters, most probably those of the NRT1 family (3Forde B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 12Crawford N.M. Glass A.D.M.

Biol. 2001; 52: 659-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), are active. Despite its firmly established role in root NO3− uptake, several aspects of NRT2.1 function remain enigmatic. First, unlike the Aspergillus nidulans or Chlorella sorokiniana NRT2 transporters (CRNA or ChNRT2.1, respectively) (21Zhou J.J. Trueman L.J. Boorer K.J. Theodoulou F.L. Forde B.G. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39894-39899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Koltermann M. Moroni A. Gazzarini S. Nowara D. Tischner R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 52: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but similarly to NRT2 proteins of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, NRT2.1 does not seem to be able to mediate NO3− transport on its own. In Xenopus oocytes, CrNRT2 and AtNRT2.1 (as well as its Hordeum vulgare homologue, HvNRT2.1) need to be co-expressed with a NAR2 protein, to yield NO3− transport (19Orsel M. Chopin F. Leleu O. Smith S.J. Krapp A. Daniel-Vedele F. Miller A.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 1304-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Zhou J.J. Fernandez E. Galvan A. Miller A.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Tong Y. Zhou J.J. Li Z. Miller A.J. Plant J. 2005; 41: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This has suggested that the actual transport system corresponds in fact to a dual component (NRT2/NAR2) transporter (19Orsel M. Chopin F. Leleu O. Smith S.J. Krapp A. Daniel-Vedele F. Miller A.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 1304-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Tong Y. Zhou J.J. Li Z. Miller A.J. Plant J. 2005; 41: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Indeed, a crucial role of the NRT2.1 putative partner, NAR2.1 (also called NRT3.1), is confirmed by the observation that mutants disrupted in the NAR2.1 gene (At5g50200) display an even stronger defect in HATS activity than the NRT2.1 mutants in Arabidopsis (19Orsel M. Chopin F. Leleu O. Smith S.J. Krapp A. Daniel-Vedele F. Miller A.J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 1304-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 25Okamoto M. Kumar A. Li W. Wang Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Crawford N.M. Glass A.D. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A second surprising aspect of NRT2.1 function is that it seems to be involved in the control of lateral root initiation, in a way that is independent from its transport activity (16Little D.Y. Rao H. Oliva S. Daniel-Vedele F. Krapp A. Malamy J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 26Remans T. Nacry P. Pervent M. Girin T. Tillard P. Lepetit M. Gojon A. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 909-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Because NO3− is not only a major nitrogen source for nutrition of the plants, but also acts as a signal to modulate plant metabolism and development (27Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 28Stitt M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), this gave rise to the hypothesis that NRT2.1 may also be a NO3− sensor, or a signal transducer (16Little D.Y. Rao H. Oliva S. Daniel-Vedele F. Krapp A. Malamy J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The regulation of NRT2.1 expression has been thoroughly investigated at the mRNA level. NRT2.1 transcript accumulation predominantly occurs in epidermis and cortex of the mature root regions (29Nazoa P. Vidmar J.J. Tranbarger T.J. Mouline K. Damiani I. Tillard P. Zhuo D. Glass A.D. Touraine B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 52: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and is affected by a wide range of environmental changes. Expression of NRT2.1 is induced by low NO3− concentration (2Okamoto M. Vidmar J.J. Glass A.D. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 304-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Filleur S. Daniel-Vedele F. Planta. 1999; 207: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Zhuo D. Okamoto M. Vidmar J.J. Glass A.D.

Plant J. 1999; 18: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), feedback repressed by NH4+ and amino acids (11Zhuo D. Okamoto M. Vidmar J.J. Glass A.D. Plant J. 1999; 17: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29Nazoa P. Vidmar J.J. Tranbarger T.J. Mouline K. Damiani I. Tillard P. Zhuo D. Glass A.D. Touraine B. Plant Mol.

Plant J. 1999; 18: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31Gansel X. Munos S. Tillard P. Gojon A. Plant J. 2001; 26: 143-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and stimulated by light and sugars (30Lejay L. Tillard P. Lepetit M. Olive F. Filleur S. Daniel-Vedele F. Gojon A. Plant J. 1999; 18: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 32Lejay L. Gansel X. Cerezo M. Tillard P. Muller C. Krapp A. von Wiren N. Daniel-Vedele F. Gojon A. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2218-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are postulated to modulate root NO3− uptake as a function of both nitrogen and carbon status of the plant. More recently, NRT2.1 has been shown to be down-regulated by NO3− itself, through a mechanism independent of the feedback repression exerted by nitrogen metabolites, but specifically triggered by the dual-affinity NRT1.1 NO3− transporter (33Munos S. Cazettes C. Fizames C. Gaymard F. Tillard P. Lepetit M. Lejay L. Gojon A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2433-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 34Krouk G. Tillard P. Gojon A. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The NO3− HATS is subjected to the same controls, and in all cases, a strong correlation was found between the changes in NRT2.1 transcript level and those in NO3− HATS activity, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of NRT2.1 expression plays a major role in governing root high-affinity NO3− uptake. However, a yet limited number of reports suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of NRT2 transporters may also participate to the modulation of root NO3− uptake in response to environmental changes. In Nicotiana plumbaginifolia ectopic overexpression of the NpNRT2.1 gene did not prevent the inhibition of root e NO3− uptake by exogenous NO3− supply (35Fraisier V. Gojon A. Tillard P. Daniel-Vedele F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 489-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, in barley NH4+ accumulation in roots of plants treated with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor methionine sulfoximine decreased root NO3− uptake but did not change HvNRT2.1 transcript level (36Vidmar J.J. Zhuo D. Siddiqi M.Y. Schjoerring J.K. Touraine B. Glass A.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Further evidence for post-translational control of NRT2 transporters is provided by the recent report on YNT1 in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, showing that this protein undergoes trafficking to the vacuole and proteolysis in response to glutamine supply (37Navarro F.J. Machin F. Martin Y. Siverio J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13268-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To gain further insights on NRT2.1 at the protein level in Arabidopsis we initiated the biochemical characterization of its localization and regulation, by combining a GFP fusion strategy and an immunological investigation. Our results provide strong evidence that NRT2.1 is predominantly localized in the plasma membrane of root cortical and epidermal cells of the mature regions of the roots, and show that NAR2.1 is essential for NRT2.1 expression. They also reveal that several forms of the protein seem to co-exist in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, treatments, which rapidly modulate both NRT2.1 transcript level and NO3− HATS activity, are shown to yield only very slow responses of the NRT2.1 protein, suggesting the occurrence of important post-translational regulatory mechanisms. One such putative mechanism is unraveled, which could be associated with partial proteolysis of NRT2.1 resulting in the cleavage of the C terminus of the protein. Production of the PNRT2.1-NRT2.1-GFP Construct—Cloning of PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 (3114 bp, including the 1335-bp 5′ untranslated region and promoting sequence upstream the ATG) and fusion with GFP coding sequence at the 3′ end of NRT2.1 was performed using Gateway™ Technology, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Gateway cloning manual, Invitrogen). The primers NRT2.1 GATE forward (CACCCACGTCAGCGAGATTGATCG) and NRT2.1 GATE reverse (AACATTGTTGGGTGTGTTCTCAGGC) were used to amplify the PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 complete DNA sequence from the bac clone T6D22 (ARBC, Columbus, OH). After gel purification of the PCR product with the Nucleo Spin® Extract Kit (Machery Nagel), PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 was cloned into the pENTR™/D-Topo vector (Invitrogen) to create an entry clone. After transformation of One Shot TOP10 thermocompetent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) the vector was sequenced. LR (Invitrogen) reaction was performed to transfer PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 from entry clone to the destination binary vector pGWB4 (no promoter, C-sGFP) obtained from Tsuyoshi Nakagawa (Research Institute of Molecular Genetics, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan). Following the LR reaction thermocompetent DH5α E. coli were transformed and positive clones were selected with hygromycin. Prior transformation of Agrobacterium, part of the expression construct was sequenced to verify the translational fusion of PNRT2.1-NRT2.1 with the GFP tag. In addition we used plants, called P43NRT2.1, transformed with NRT2.1 fused to GFP in N-terminal, under the control of the 35S promoter as described in Chopin et al. (38Chopin F. Wirth J. Dorbe M.F. Lejay L. Krapp A. Gojon A. Daniel-Vedele F. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2007; (, in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Plant Transformation—Binary vectors containing the GFP fusion construct were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GC3101. A. thaliana nrt2.1-1 mutant plants, ecotype Wassilewskija (18Filleur S. Dorbe M.F. Cerezo M. Orsel M. Granier F. Gojon A. Daniel-Vedele F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), were transformed by dipping the flowers in the presence of Silwet L77 (39Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on a medium containing 30 mg/liter of hygromycin. For further analyses, T1 segregation ratios were analyzed to select transformants with one T-DNA insertion and to isolate T3-homozygous plants. Growth Conditions—For all experiments, except those devoted to confocal imaging, plants were grown hydroponically using the experimental set-up described previously (30Lejay L. Tillard P. Lepetit M. Olive F. Filleur S. Daniel-Vedele F. Gojon A. Plant J. 1999; 18: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Briefly, seeds were sown directly on the surface of wet sand in modified 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, with the bottom replaced by a metal screen. The tubes supporting the seeds were placed on polystyrene floating rafts, on the surface of a 10-liter tank filled with tap water. The culture was then performed in a controlled growth chamber with 8 h/16 h day/night cycle at 24/20 °C. Light intensity during the light period was at 250 μmol m-2 s-1. One week after sowing, the tap water was replaced by nutrient solution until the age of 6-7 weeks depending on the size of the plants. The basal nutrient solutions supplied to the plants are those described by Gansel et al. (31Gansel X. Munos S. Tillard P. Gojon A. Plant J. 2001; 26: 143-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained either 0.3 mm NO3−, 1 mm NO3−, 5 mm NO3−, or 10 mm NH4NO3 as nitrogen source. The nutrient solution was replaced every week during this period and the day before the experiment. For confocal imaging, plants were grown in sterile conditions in vertical agar plates (12 × 12 cm) on the same basal medium as used for hydroponic cultures plus 2.5 mm MES and 1.2% (w/v) agar type A (Sigma, product A4550). It contained 1 mm NO3− as nitrogen source and either 3% sucrose (w/v) or no sugar. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 with KOH. After sowing, the plates were transferred in a growth chamber with 16 h/8 h day/night cycle at 21/18 °C and 70% relative humidity. Light intensity during the light period was at 125 μmol m-2 s-1. Observations were performed after 14 days of growth. In Vivo Protein Cross-linking—According to Rohila et al. (40Rohila J.S. Chen M. Cerny R. Fromm M.E. Plant J. 2004; 38: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in vivo protein cross-linking was performed by adding formaldehyde to the nutrient solution of hydroponically grown plants to get a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Plants were treated during 45 min before harvesting the roots for plasma membrane (PM) extraction. Confocal Microscopy—GFP images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 axiovert 200M inverted microscope. GFP (excitation/emission maxima ∼488/507 nm) was excited with the 488 nm line of an Argon laser and detected via a 505-530 nm bandpass filter (green). Autofluorescence was detected via a 650-nm long pass filter (red). Dichroic mirrors used were HFT 488 and NFT 545. To visualize the different plant cell membranes, several stains were used. Images of the plasma membrane and the tonoplast were obtained after 5 min and at least 16 h of incubation with 8.2 μm of the endocytic tracer FM4-64 (Invitrogen, product F34653), respectively. The endoplasmic reticulum was visualized after 30 min staining with 5 μm endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Tracker (Blue-White DPX, Invitrogen). FM4-64 was visualized with the microscope used for GFP imaging. FM4-64 (excitation/emission maxima ∼515/640 nm) was excited with the 543-nm line and detected via LP 650 and LP 585, respectively. Dichroic mirrors used were HFT 488/543 and NFT 545. ER Tracker (excitation/emission maxima ∼347-640 nm) images were obtained with the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axioplan 2 microscope. ER Tracker was excited with the diode 405-nm laser for blue dye and detected via a 420-480 BP filter (blue). Dichroic mirrors used were HFT 405/488/543 and NFT 490. NRT2.1 Immunodetection and Membrane Purification—Root total proteins were extracted as described by Santoni et al. (41Santoni V. Bellini C. Caboche M. Planta. 1994; 192: 557-566Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Microsomes were prepared as described by Giannini et al. (42Giannini J.L. Gildensoph L.H. Reynolds-Niesman I. Briskin D.P. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plasma membrane vesicles were purified from microsomes by aqueous two-phase partitioning, as described by Santoni et al. (43Santoni V. Vinh J. Pflieger D. Sommerer N. Maurel C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on denaturing SDS-PAGE followed by an electrotransfer at 4 °C onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm, Sartorius, Goöttingen, Germany). NRT2.1 was detected using two different anti-NRT2.1 antisera produced by Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) against either the synthetic peptide TLEKAGEVAKDKFGK (anti-NRT2.1 19) or CKNMHQGSLRFAENAK (anti-NRT2.1 20) (Fig. 2A). The two polyclonal anti-sera were affinity purified by Eurogentec. The immunodetection was performed with a chemiluminescent detection system kit (SuperSignal, Pierce). For ELISA, serial 2-fold dilutions in a carbonate buffer (30 mm Na2CO3, 60 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.5) of 500 ng of PM proteins were loaded in duplicate on Maxisorb immunoplates (Nunc, Denmark) and left overnight at 4 °C. The immunodetection was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary anti-NRT2.1 20 antibody (1:2500 dilution) and a secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody were successively applied for 2 h at 37 °C.A linear regression between the absorbance signal due to oxidized 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt, as read with a multiplate reader (Victor, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the amount of proteins was obtained for each sample and used for relative comparison between samples. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription—RNA extraction was performed on roots as described previously (44Lobreaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using guanidine hydrochloride and lithium chloride. Subsequently 40 μg of RNA were treated with DNase (RNase Free DNase Kit, Qiagen) and purified (RNeasy MinElute™ Cleanup Kit, Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The absence of genomic DNA was verified by PCR using specific primers spanning an intron in the gene APTR (At1g27450). Reverse transcription was performed with 4 μg of purified RNA and oligo(dT)18 primers. The mixture was heated for 5 min at 72 °C and progressively (-1 °C per 10 s) cooled down to allow hybridization of the primers. The reaction was carried out in a volume of 20 μl in the presence of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C during 90 min. The quality of the cDNA was verified by PCR using the primers for the gene APTR. Quantitative PCR—Real-time amplification was performed in a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) with the kit SYBR Green (LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green1, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 1 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 10 μl. The following conditions of amplifications were applied: 10 min at 95 °C; 45 cycles of 5 sat 95 °C; 7 sat 65 ° C; and 8 sat 72 °C. A melting curve was then performed to verify the specificity of the amplification. Successive dilutions of one sample were used as a standard curve. Amplification efficiency was around 1. All the results presented were standardized using the housekeeping gene Clathrin (At4g24550). The primers used were: NRT2.1 forward, AACAAGGGCTAACGTGGATG; NRT2.1 reverse, CTGCTTCTCCTGCTCATTCC; Clath forward, AGCATACACTGCGTGCAAAG; Clath reverse, TCGCCTGTGTCACATATCTC. Root NO3− Influx Measurements—Root 15 NO3− influx was assayed as described by Dehlon et al. (45Delhon P. Gojon A. Tillard P. Passama L. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1585-1594Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plants were sequentially transferred to 0.1 mm CaSO4 for 1 min, to complete nutrient solution, pH 5.8, containing 0.2 mm 15 NO3− (99 atom % excess 15N) for 5 min, and finally to 0.1 mm CaSO4 for 1 min. Roots were then separated from shoots, and the organs dried at 70 °C for 48 h. After determination of their dry weight, the samples were analyzed for total nitrogen and atom % 15N using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a C/N elemental analyzer (model ANCA-MS; PDZ Europa, Crewe, UK) as described in Clarkson et al. (46Clarkson D.T. Gojon A. Saker L.R. Wiersema P.K. Purves J.V. Tillard P. Arnold G.M. Paans A.J.M. Vaalburg W. Stulen I. Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 859-868Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each influx value is the mean of 6 to 12 replicates. Tissular and Subcellular Localization of NRT2.1—To investigate the localization of NRT2.1 in the roots, NRT2.1-GFP transgenic lines were generated by expressing a GFP-tagged NRT2.1 protein (C-terminal translational fusion) in the nrt2.1-1 knock-out mutant of NRT2.1. The GFP coding sequence was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the NRT2.1 gene under the control of its own promoter. Two transgenic lines (GFP10 and GFP12) displayed both a correct regulation of the expression of the transgene and a functional complementation of the mutant phenotype (supplemental materials Fig. S1). In these lines, the expression of PNRT2.1-NRT2.1-GFP was induced by both light and sucrose in the roots, as it was the case for NRT2.1 in WT plants. The NO3− HATS activity, determined by root 15 NO3− influx assays (0.2 mm external 15 NO3− concentration), was also stimulated by the light/sucrose treatments in both GFP10 and GFP12 plants, and restored at higher values than those measured in the nrt2.1-1 mutant. Cell-type specific expression of NRT2.1-GFP was therefore studied by confocal microscopy in both GFP10 and GFP12 plants grown in vitro. In roots of GFP10 plants, GFP fluorescence was mainly localized in the cortical cells along the primary and secondary roots (Fig. 1, A and C), except in the apical part of these roots where GFP was not present (Fig. 1B). No fluorescence was detected in the stele of the roots (Fig. 1C), and in the leaves (results not shown). These results were confirmed using the GFP12 line (data not shown). In plants grown hydroponically, NRT2.1-GFP was also found in mature regions of the roots, where in addition to the cortex, it was also expressed in the epidermal cells, and in root hairs (Fig. 1D). The subcellular localization of the NRT2.1-GFP protein was investigated in roots of plants grown in vitro, using specific markers for cellular membranes. The PM and the tonoplast were visualized after a short and a long incubation with the red fluorescent dye FM4-64, respectively (47Bolte S. Talbot C. Boutte Y. Catrice O. Read N.D.

We have recently shown that the small GTPase RhoA inhibits this process. Here we demonstrate that a different Rho GTPase family member, Rac1, promotes chondrogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 expression in micromass culture resulted in reduced mRNA levels of the chondrogenic markers collagen II and aggrecan, and decreased accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Expression of the essential chondrogenic transcription factors Sox9, Sox5, and Sox6 was also reduced upon inhibition of Rac1 signaling. In contrast, overexpression of Rac1 in the chondrogenic ATDC5 cell line increased mRNA transcripts of Sox9, 5, and 6, collagen II, and aggrecan. Inhibition of Rac1 resulted in a reduction in the number, size, and organization of cellular condensations and decreased expression of N-cadherin. Overexpression of Rac1 resulted in an increase in N-cadherin expression levels. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Rac1 in primary micromass cultures resulted in reduced expression of chondrogenic markers. Additionally, we provide evidence that Cdc42 also promotes chondrogenesis. Overexpression of Cdc42 in ATDC5 cells resulted in increased expression of Sox5, Sox9, and collagen II but not Sox6, aggrecan, or N-cadherin. Therefore, we demonstrate that Rac1 and Cdc42 are positive regulators of chondrogenesis, but act at least in part through different cellular and molecular mechanisms.

Chondrocytes are the cellular component of cartilage, responsible for generating and maintaining its extracellular environment (1Muir H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cartilage has multiple functions such as providing a cushion on the articular surfaces of joints (2Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis-Research. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), providing a template for the formation of endochondral bone (3Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), and contributing to fracture repair (4Ferguson C.M. Miclau T. Hu D. Alpern E. Helms J.A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The formation of cartilage templates in endochondral ossification begins with condensation of mesenchymal cells, increased expression of the cell adhesion molecules N-cadherin and N-CAM, and therefore increased cell-cell interactions (5Widelitz R.B. Jian T.X. Murray B.A. Chuong C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S.

As cells become chondrogenic, the expression of these adhesion molecules is decreased (8Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells within these condensations commit to the chondrogenic lineage, acquire a spherical cell morphology and induce expression of the essential chondrogenic transcription factor Sox9 (9Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2813-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 10Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Sox5 and Sox6 cooperate with Sox9 to control chondrogenesis and are themselves under the transcriptional control of Sox9 (9Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2813-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 11Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 12Lefebvre V.

Together, these transcription factors activate transcription of the major chondrogenic matrix genes, collagen II and aggrecan (11Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B.

Furthermore, increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 3The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; Chst, chondroitin sulfotransferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PNA, lectin peanut agglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PFA, paraformaldehyde; ROCK, Rho-kinase. content is another marker of the chondrogenic extracellular matrix (1Muir H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The production of glycosaminoglycans are partially regulated by the enzymes chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase 11 (Chst 11) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase 3 (Chst 3), which have been determined to be important for proper cartilage and bone formation (16Thiele H. Sakano M. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Rajab A. Hohne W. Ritter H. Leschik G. Nurnberg P. Mundlos S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Development. 2005; 132: 3989-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although many molecular mechanisms have been shown to regulate the commitment and differentiation of cells to the chondrogenic lineage (3Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 18Karsenty G. Science. 2003; 423: 316-318Google Scholar, 19de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Nakashima K. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), gaining a better understanding of signaling pathways that regulate these molecules is essential. Such knowledge would aid, for example, in the development of therapeutics for the replacement of damaged cartilage in osteoarthritis. As stated above, it is well known that chondrocytes display distinctive spherical cell shape (20Shum L. Nuckolls G. Arthr. Res. 2002; 4: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Forcing spherical cell shape by pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization is sufficient to stimulate dedifferentiated cells to re-express chondrogenic matrix molecules (21Brown P.D. Benya P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Benya P.D. Brown P.D. Padilla S.R. J. Cell.

We therefore speculated that signaling pathways that regulate cell shape also regulate chondrocyte differentiation. Rho GTPases are a family of small G-proteins that have multiple roles in cells including the regulation of the cytoskeleton (26Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y.

Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). In contrast, RhoA acting through Rho-kinase (ROCK) promotes the formation of stress fibers and spindle-shaped cells (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 37Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that RhoA/ROCK signaling inhibits the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the chondrogenic lineage (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 38Woods A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13134-13140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study we wanted to determine the role of Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling in early chondrogenesis. There is strong evidence that Rac1/Cdc42 and RhoA signaling have antagonizing roles in later stages of chondrocyte differentiation (39Wang G. Beier F. J. Bone Min. Res. 2005; 20: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as in other cell types (40Seasholtz T.M. Radeff-Huang J. Sagi S.A. Matteo R. Weems J.M. Cohen A.S. Feramisco J.R.

Furthermore, it has been determined in other cell types that Rac1 and Cdc42 regulation of cortical actin is essential in the stabilization of cadherin dependent cellular junctions (34Noritake J.

Because the formation these junctions is essential for the commitment of cells to the chondrogenic lineage (6Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S.

Dyn. 2002; 225: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Rac1/Cdc42 signaling promotes chondrogenesis, in part through modulation of cell-cell interactions. For our studies we used a Rac1- and Cdc42-overexpressing ATDC5 cells that we described previously (39Wang G. Beier F. J. Bone Min.

Time-impregnated CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All medium components were purchased from Invitrogen or Sigma unless otherwise stated. The Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (45Gao Y.

The following antibodies were used: N-cadherin, cat. no. ab-12221, and β-actin cat. no. A5441 (Sigma). Micromass and ATDC5 Cell Cultures—Mesenchymal limb buds cells were obtained from E11.5 CD1 mice, and cultured in micromass cultures as described (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were suspended in micromass media, 60% F12, 40% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.25% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep), and 0.25% l-glutamine, at a density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml and plated in 10-μl droplets to simulate the high density of chondrogenic condensations. One hour after plating, medium (as above, supplemented with 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid) was added to the cultures and supplemented with ddH20 (vehicle), 50 μm of NSC23766 (Rac1 inhibitor) or Me2SO (vehicle) and 10 μm Y27632 (ROCK inhibitor). Medium and inhibitors were changed every 24 h until harvesting. Rac1-, Cdc42-, and pcDNA3 vector-transfected ATDC5 cells were cultured and induced to differentiate as described (39Wang G. Beier F. J.

Cultures were washed again with PBS, and the PNA was detected colorimetrically by DAB AEC. Brightfield images were taken with a Leica DMRA2 microscope using OpenLab 4.0 software with 10- and 40-fold magnification. Western Blot Analysis—Protein was isolated in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer and concentration was calculated as described (38Woods A. Beier F. J. Biol.

Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schull) and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.01% Tween 20 (BSA-TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1.0 μg/ml anti-N-cadherin, or 0.5 μg/ml anti-β-actin. After washing in TBST, Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in 5% BSA-TBST and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess secondary antibody was rinsed off the membrane with TBST, and signal was detected by the addition of Western blotting detection reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and visualized on a ChemiImager™ 5500 (AlphaInnotech Inc). Immunofluorescence—ATDC5 cells were plated at a density of 16,000 cells/well in a 24-well dish (Falcon) on glass coverslips. Cells were stimulated to differentiate by the addition of insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) (Sigma), and media was changed every other day as described by (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 48Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol.

Cells were washed in PBS, incubated for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X in PBS and rinsed again in PBS. Cells were then incubated in blocking solution containing goat serum (Sigma) in PBS, 1:20, for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies directed to N-cadherin were diluted in blocking solution at a concentration of 1:200 and incubated with coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed in PBS and then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following another wash in PBS, coverslips were mounted in VectaShield anti-fade mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were taken with a Leica DMRA2 fluorescence microscope with 63-fold magnification and analyzed using OpenLab 4.0 software. Mouse Breeding and Genotyping—Rac1fl/fl (49Glogauer M. Marchal C.C.

All procedures involving animals were approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care and Use Committee. For PCR genotyping, tail snips were used to prepare DNA for PCR analysis. PCR genotyping was performed by simultaneous amplification of the wild-type (Rac1+), conditional (Rac1fl/fl), and null (Rac1-) alleles (49Glogauer M. Marchal C.C. Zhu F. Worku A. Clausen B.E. Foerster I. Marks P. Downey G.P. Dinauer M. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) as described. PCR fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Homozygous Rac1fl/fl mice were time impregnated, and mesenchymal cells were isolated at E11.5 mice as described above. Adenovirus Infection—Adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase was obtained as a generous gift from Drs. Collins and Scacheri (National Institutes of Health) through Dr. Dagnino (London, Canada). Adenovirus expressing Cre Recombinase was purified using the Adeno-X™ virus mini-purification kit (Clontech) and incubated with mesenchymal cells from limb buds of CD1 control mice or Rac1fl/fl mice in high density cell suspension (2.5 × 107 cells/ml) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Cells were plated in 10 μl droplets as described above. Four hours after plating, media was added as above. Statistical Analysis—Data collected from real-time PCR are an average of three independent trials of samples run in quadruplicate. Means were quantified relative to GAPDH, and then data were normalized to day 1 of control-treated RNA per trial. Statistical significance was determined by a one or two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post test using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Inhibition of Rac1 Signaling Decreases mRNA Levels of Chondrogenic Matrix Genes and GAG Accumulation—Our recent studies suggested inhibition of chondrogenesis by RhoA (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 38Woods A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13134-13140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and antagonism between RhoA and Rac1/Cdc42 at later stages of chondrocyte differentiation (39Wang G. Beier F. J. Bone Min. Res. 2005; 20: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 48Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the roles of Rac1 and Cdc42 in early chondrogenesis have not been described. In previous studies, we confirm the overexpression of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA in stable transfectants of the ATDC5 cell line, which were used for these studies (39Wang G. Beier F. J. Bone Min. Res. 2005; 20: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 48Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether similar antagonistic mechanisms control chondrogenesis. We first tested the effects of a pharmacological inhibitor of Rac1, NSC23766 (45Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), on chondrogenesis in primary micromass culture. These studies revealed a decrease in the transcript levels of the chondrogenic matrix molecules collagen II and aggrecan upon NSC23766 treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Real-time PCR demonstrated a strong decrease of these mRNAs by day 2 of culture, and expression remained low until day 4 of culture in comparison to the control. Micromass cultures were stained with alcian blue to visualize GAG content after the fourth day in culture with vehicle or NSC23766 (Fig. 1C). Rac1 inhibition resulted in a strong decrease in the amount of alcian blue staining, suggesting a decrease in GAG accumulation. Inhibition of Rac1 Signaling in Micromass Culture Reduces mRNA Levels of Sox5, 6, and 9—We next examined the effects of Rac1 inhibition on the expression of Sox9, Sox5, and Sox6 to investigate whether down-regulation of these transcription factors could be responsible for the observed attenuation of chondrogenesis. Micromass cultures were grown for up to 4 days with vehicle control or 50 μm NSC23766. Inhibition of Rac1 signaling caused a significant decrease in the expression of Sox9 mRNA levels compared with control cultures from day 3 on (Fig. 2A). Sox5 and Sox6 also demonstrated reduced mRNA levels in cultures treated with the Rac1 inhibitor (Fig. 2, B and C). mRNA levels for the transcription factor ATF3 increased strongly during the time course, but were not affected by the Rac1 inhibitor (Fig. 2D), Cycle thresholds for both GAPDH and 18 S rRNA also remained constant (relative to RNA concentration) under all conditions (Fig. 2, E and F), confirming that both probes are suitable as loading controls. Therefore we employed GAPDH throughout this study. These data suggest that Rac1 signaling is required for chondrogenesis through stimulation of Sox9, Sox5, and Sox6 expression. Overexpression of Rac1 and Cdc42 Increases Markers of Chondrogenesis—ATDC5 cells stably transfected with empty vector for control or expression vectors for Rac1 or Cdc42 (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 39Wang G. Beier F. J. Bone Min. Res. 2005; 20: 1022-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were stimulated to differentiate in culture for a 9-day period. Analysis of isolated RNA by real-time PCR revealed that the expression of Sox9 increases until day 9 in control cultures (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of Rac1 or Cdc42 resulted in a higher expression of Sox9 over each day of culture, with significant increases demonstrated on day 9 of culture (Fig. 3A). Sox5 and 6 also demonstrated an increase in expression over the 9-day period of control cultures (Fig. 3, B and C). Overexpression of Rac1 or Cdc42 further increased the expression of Sox5, but only Rac1 increased Sox6 mRNA levels (Fig. 3, B and C). The expression of collagen II similarly increased in the control cells over the culture period and was further enhanced by overexpression of Rac1 or Cdc42 (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, only Rac1 overexpression resulted in significant increase of aggrecan mRNA expression, while Cdc42 overexpression did not affect aggrecan gene expression (Fig. 3E). ATF3 and GAPDH levels were not affected by overexpression of Rac1 or Cdc42 (Fig. 3, F and G). Inhibition of Rac1 Signaling Reduces Mesenchymal Condensations and the Expression of N-cadherin—Because our data demonstrated that Rac1 promotes chondrogenesis, we next asked whether it also controls cellular condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis. Micromass cultures that were fixed and stained with PNA on day 4 of culture demonstrate decreased and diffuse staining upon Rac1 inhibition, suggesting a decrease in cellular condensations in comparison to control cultures (Fig. 4A). Analysis of expression levels of a marker of chondrogenic condensations, N-cadherin, showed a significant decrease of transcripts upon inhibition of Rac1 signaling as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Rac1 inhibition did not affect expression of another cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that Rac1 signaling is essential for normal formation of cellular condensations, an essential determinant of chondrogenesis. Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK Signaling Does Not Affect Cellular Condensations—In previous work, we had demonstrated a negative role for RhoA/ROCK signaling in chondrogenesis (32Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether ROCK signaling would affect cellular condensations, potentially antagonizing Rac1 effects. However, we did not see a change in mesenchymal condensations in response to ROCK inhibition by Y27632 (10 μm), as confirmed by the absence of differences in PNA staining (Fig. 4D) or levels of N-cadherin mRNA or protein (data not shown). These data suggest that RhoA/ROCK signaling regulates chondrogenesis at a stage later than cellular condensations. N-cadherin mRNA and Protein Levels Are Increased by Rac1 Signaling—We next examined the effects of Rac1 on N-cadherin expression in more detail. ATDC5 cells stably overexpressing Rac1 displayed increased mRNA levels of N-cadherin (Fig. 5A) but did not affect levels of N-CAM (Fig. 5B). Western blotting also demonstrated increased levels of N-cadherin protein by day 3 of culture in cells overexpressing Rac1 (Fig. 5C). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that Rac1 overexpression increases staining for N-cadherin, (Fig. 5D). Negative controls reveal minor background fluorescence of cells incubated without the N-cadherin antibody. In contrast to Rac1, Cdc42 overexpression did not affect N-cadherin expression markedly. Genetic Loss-of-function of Rac1 Reduces N-cadherin Expression and Other Chondrogenic Markers—Micromass cultures of wild-type CD1 or Rac1fl/fl mesenchymal cells infected with an adenovirus expressing Cre Recombinase demonstrated ∼70% decrease of Rac1 mRNA transcripts by day 3 of culture (Fig. 6A), thus demonstrating efficient inactivation of the Rac1 gene. Chondrogenic markers were analyzed by real-time PCR, demonstrating that genetic ablation of Rac1 inhibits the increase in mRNA levels of N-cadherin (Fig. 6B) and Sox9 (Fig. 6C), in comparison to wild-type cells. However, expression of the transcription factor ATF3, a known regulator of chondrocyte differentiation and limb development (50Charite J. McFadden D.G. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51James C.G. Woods A. Underhill T.M. Beier F. BMC Mol. Biol. 2006; 7: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), did not change between control and Rac1-deficient cultures (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, the endogenous control GAPDH did not change between control cells and Rac1 fl/fl infected with the Cre-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 6E). These data further confirm the importance of Rac1 in the regulation of chondrogenesis. Matrix Molecules and GAG Enzymes Are Decreased in Response to Genetic Ablation of Rac1—Analysis of Rac1-ablated micromass cultures demonstrated significantly reduced levels of collagen II and aggrecan transcripts (Fig. 7, A and B), similarly to our pharmacological data. In addition, transcripts encoding chondroitin sulfotransferase enzymes Chst3 and Chst11 were both up-regulated during differentiation in micromass culture, but showed decreased levels in response to Rac1 knockdown (Fig. 7, C and D). We demonstrate in the present study that Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling pathways are positive regulators of chondrogenesis. In primary micromass culture of limb mesenchyme, cultures differentiate along the chondrogenic lineage and express the classical chondrogenic markers (46Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 52Ahrens P.B. Solursh M. Reiters R. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that inhibition of Rac1 signaling reduces transcript levels of collagen II and aggrecan, and the amount of alcian blue stain indicating a decrease in glycosaminoglycan accumulation. The reduction in GAG staining is accompanied by reduced expression of the two sulfotransferases Chst3 and Chst11. We also demonstrate a decrease in the transcript levels of the Sox family members Sox9, 5, and 6. Genetic ablation of Rac1 also results in a decrease in collagen II, aggrecan, and Sox9 mRNA levels. Because the effects of pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of Rac1 are so similar, these data suggest that the effect of the inhibitor is specific to Rac1 activity. Conversely, overexpression of Rac1 in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 stimulates an increase in transcript levels of Sox 9, 5, 6, collagen II, and aggrecan, while overexpression of Cdc42 results in an increase in Sox9 and 5 and collagen II. Interestingly, Rac1 overexpression stimulates all markers of chondrogenesis, while Cdc42 overexpression stimulates only some markers of chondrogenesis, indicating that these two GTPases have different modes of action in chondrogenesis. Because the overexpression of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 all result in affecting the expression of different sets of genes, this suggests that the effects seen are not due to unspecific effects of overexpression. In addition, other genes known to be involved in chondrocyte differentiation such as N-CAM and ATF3 were not affected by our manipulations, providing further evidence that the observed effects are specific. We wanted to explore earlier stages of chondrogenesis through the analysis of cellular condensations. The formation of cellular condensations precedes the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the chondrogenic lineage (6Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7DeLise A.M. Tuan R.S. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rac1 signaling resulted in decreased mesenchymal condensation, as confirmed by decreased PNA staining and reduced expression of N-cadherin. Genetic loss-of-function of Rac1 also demonstrates a decrease in N-cadherin mRNA levels. Conversely, overexpression of Rac1 in ATDC5 cells increases N-cadherin transcripts and protein. On the other hand, Cdc42 overexpression did not significantly change N-cadherin expression at both the mRNA and protein level, and ROCK inhibition did not affect PNA staining or N-cadherin expression. Together, these data suggest that Rac1 signaling regulates chondrogenesis by exerting its effects (at least some of them) at the level of forming cellular condensations, while Cdc42 and RhoA regulate chondrogenesis at stages later than condensations (Fig. 8). It is well established that cadherin junction formation is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, due to the interaction of the cytoplasmic portion of cadherins with the actin cytoskeleton, mediated by catenins (53Modarresi R. Lafond T. Roman-Blas J.A. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. Seghatoleslami M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes are similar to chondrocytes in that their differentiation depends on adherens junctions and that keratinocyte cell shape undergoes drastic changes during differentiation. However, differentiated keratinocytes are fibroblastic in cell shape, whereas chondrocytes display spherical cell shape once committed to the chondrogenic lineage (54Furukawa F. Takigawa M. Matsuyoshi N. Shirahama S. Wakita H. Fujita M. Horiguchi Y. Imamura S. J. Dermatol. 1994; 21: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 55Denning M.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rac1 signaling results in removal of cadherins from cellular junctions in keratinocytes and MDCK cells (42Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 44Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), possibly due to the rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. It has also been described that RhoA signaling regulates cadherin-dependent cellular junction formation in keratinocytes (42Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), whereas we demonstrate that ROCK signaling does not affect condensations nor expression of N-cadherin in chondrocytes. Furthermore, the involvement of N-cadherin has also been demonstrated in myoblast differentiation where activation of N-cadherin junction formation results in decreased Rac1 activity and increased RhoA activity (56Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the interplay between Rho GTPases and cadherin junctions appears to be cell type-specific, a conclusion further supported by our data from chondrocyte differentiation. Although there is a fair amount of data suggesting a role of RhoA and Rac1 in the localization of N-cadherin to cellular junctions and in activation of both GTPases by N-cadherin in other cell types, we are (to our knowledge) the first to demonstrate that Rac1 signaling regulates N-cadherin at the level of mRNA expression. It is also noteworthy that while all three prototype RhoA GTPases regulate chondrogenesis, only Rac1, but not RhoA/ROCK or Cdc42, achieves this through regulation of mesenchymal condensations and N-cadherin expression. We demonstrate a disparity of Sox 5, 6, and matrix gene regulation by Rac1 and Cdc42 overexpression. Sox9 is a required factor for chondrogenesis, and expression of Sox5 and Sox6 are required for maximal activity of Sox9 (11Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 38Woods A. Beier F. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In our studies, overexpression of Rac1 increases Sox9, Sox5, and Sox6 expression, matched by an increase in collagen II and aggrecan. However, Cdc42 overexpression only causes an increase expression of Sox9 and Sox5, and not Sox6. Similarly, only collagen II expression is increased upon Cdc42 overexpression, but no change in aggrecan is seen. These data suggest that it is not essential that both Sox5 and Sox6 be increased to stimulate collagen II expression. On the other hand, Sox6 induction might be required for the stimulation of aggrecan expression. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that Rac1 and Cdc42 are positive regulators of chondrogenesis. Additionally, our studies and others demonstrate that it is essential that the role of GTPase signaling is studied in cell type-specific manners. We have demonstrated that Rac1 signaling is a required signaling pathway to generate normal N-cadherin-dependent cellular junctions that are known to be essential for chondrogenesis. We thank Dr. M. Glogauer (Toronto) for the Rac1fl/fl mice and Drs. F. Collins, P. Scacheri (National Institutes of Health), and L. Dagnino (London) for adenovirus-encoding Cre recombinase."

Viral proteins and nucleic acids have been shown to be recognized by pattern recognition receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, triggering downstream signaling cascades that lead to cellular activation and cytokine production. Viral DNA is sensed by TLR9, and TLRs 3, 7, and 8 have been implicated in innate responses to RNA viruses by virtue of their ability to sense double-stranded (ds) RNA (TLR3) or single-stranded RNA (murine TLR7 and human TLR8). Viral and synthetic dsRNAs have also been shown to be a potent adjuvant, promoting enhanced adaptive immune responses, and this property is also dependent on their recognition by TLR3. It has recently been shown that mRNA that is largely single-stranded is a ligand for TLR3. Here we have investigated the ability of single-stranded homopolymeric nucleic acids to induce innate responses by murine immune cells. We show for the first time that polyinosinic acid (poly(I)) activates B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and that these responses are dependent on the expression of both TLR3 and the adaptor molecule, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF).

However two TLRs, TLR3 and TLR4, signal through a pathway that involves an alternative adaptor molecule, TRIF (14Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N.

Signaling through TLR3 exclusively involves TRIF, whereas TLR4 utilizes both MyD88 and TRIF to activate distinctive signaling cascades (16Bowie A.G. Haga I.R. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The TLRs also differ in their subcellular localization. Most are expressed at the cell surface, but those involved in innate responses to viruses by sensing viral nucleic acids (TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9) are localized to intracellular compartments including endosomes (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6747) Google Scholar, 17Matsumoto M. Funami K. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Microbiol.

It has been argued that this distribution maximizes their opportunity to intercept viral ligands while removing them from contact with cellular nucleic acids. This distribution also explains both the sensitivity of responses mediated by these TLRs to agents that prevent endosomal acidification (12Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar, 18Heil F. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Gellert T. Dietrich H. Lipford G. Takeda K. Akira S. Wagner H.

In contrast to ssRNA, poly(I:C) and CpG DNA can induce responses when added extracellularly; it is not clear whether this reflects some expression of TLR3 and TLR9 at the cell surface or the existence of a mechanism responsible for shuttling their respective ligands to intracellularly located TLRs. In addition to poly(I:C) other nucleic acids including mRNAs of microbial and mammalian origin (19Kariko K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) and siRNA (20Kariko K. Bhuyan P. Capodici J. Weissman D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) have also been shown to be TLR3 ligands, possibly by virtue of possession of short double-stranded sections in their secondary structure. To date, ssRNAs have only been shown to be ligands for TLRs 7 (mouse) and 8 (human). In this report we show for the first time that extracellularly presented poly(I) induces innate responses by B cells, DC, and macrophages. Our data demonstrate that these responses are dependent on TLR3, showing that this TLR can sense ssRNA as well as dsRNA. Animals—BALB/c mice, mice deficient in TRIF or TLR3 (on a mixed 129/C57Bl background) and their littermate controls, and mice deficient in MyD88 or TLR4 (C57Bl/6 background) were maintained in our animal facilities. C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Banting and Kingman. Founder animals for the knock-out strains were generously given to us by Prof. S. Akira. Unless otherwise indicated, mice were used at >8 weeks of age. All animal studies were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations for animal care and use. Antibodies and Reagents—We purchased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 055 B5, poly(I), poly(C), poly(G), poly(U), poly(I:C), dextran sulfate, and chloroquine from Sigma, peptidoglycan (Staphylococcus aureus, PGN) from Fluka, and CpG containing oligodeoxyinucleotide 1826 (CpG DNA) from MWG. Antibodies to CD86 (a gift from Dr. D. Flaherty), CD40 (a gift from Dr. J. Andersen), and major histocompatibility complex II were coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate or biotin by standard methods. Preparation of B Lymphocytes and Analysis of Responses—B lymphocytes were purified from the spleens of wild type or deficient mice by treatment with anti-Thy1 antibody and complement as described (21Tasker L. Marshall-Clarke S. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated in the text, experiments were performed on a pool of cells generated from at least two mice. For analysis of modulation of co-stimulatory molecules, B cells were cultured with various stimuli at 1–2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI/10% fetal calf serum for 24 or 48 h before being stained with appropriate antibodies. Expression of co-stimulatory molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan cytometer. Proliferation was assessed by culturing purified B cells (2 × 105/well) with or without stimuli for 48 h, pulsing with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) for the last 6 h of culture, and measuring uptake by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. In some experiments supernatants of stimulated B cells were collected for analysis of interferon production. Preparation of Dendritic Cells and Macrophages and Analysis of Responses—Dendritic cells were derived by culturing murine bone marrow cells at 5 × 105/ml in RPMI/10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 20% v/v of supernatant from J558 cells transfected with the mGM-CSF gene (a gift from Dr. B. Stockinger). After 7 days non-adherent cells were collected, washed, and cultured at 2 × 106/ml in 24-, 48-, or 96-well plates with indicated stimuli for 24 h. After incubation, supernatants were collected and stored at −20 0C for cytokine analysis. Cells were detached by a brief treatment with phosphate-buffered saline/2 mm EDTA, washed, stained with various antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Macrophages were derived by culturing bone marrow cells at 5 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 20% v/v of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) containing supernatant from LADMAC cells (a gift from Dr. S. Hou). After 6 days macrophages were detached using phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA, harvested, washed, and recultured with stimuli as described. Secretion of cytokines and up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules were analyzed as described. Culture of Bronchiolar Epithelial Cells—Cells of the BEAS-2B line, obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum. For experiments, cells were harvested from culture flasks using trypsin/EDTA (Sigma), washed, plated in 24 plates at 5 × 104/well, and cultured overnight before the addition of stimuli as described. After 20 h cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until used. Use of Transfected HEK 293 Cells—HEK 293 cells stably transfected with huTLRs, kind gifts from Dr. K. Fitzgerald (HEK-TLR3 and 4 cells) and Dr. S. Paludan (HEK-TLR8 cells), were seeded into 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) and transfected the next day with expression vectors for a κB-luciferase reporter gene and Renilla luciferase internal control as described previously (22Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). On the following day cells were stimulated as described and reporter gene activity assessed 6 h later. Data are expressed as mean fold induction ± S.D. relative to control levels, for a representative experiment from a minimum of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Cytokine/Chemokine Analysis—Production of IL-12, TNFα, and IP-10 was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Kits for TNF and IL-12 were from Caltag Medsystems and that for IP-10 was from R&D. Type 1 interferon was detected using a bioassay as previously described (23Marshall-Clarke S. Tasker L. Buchatska O. Downes J. Pennock J. Wharton S. Borrow P. Wiseman D.Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). IFNα was detected using an ELISA kit from PBL Laboratories according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both viral RNA and synthetic single-stranded poly(U), (but not poly(I), poly(A), or poly(C)), have been shown to induce innate responses when transfected into plasmacytoid DC but were without effect when presented extracellularly in the absence of the transfection reagent (12Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar). We assessed the effects of homopolymeric nucleic acids on B cells by culturing them with poly(I), poly (U), or known ligands for TLRs 3 and 4 and analyzing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. As expected, poly(I:C) and LPS induced marked up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II, CD86, and CD40. Culture with poly(I) also induced up-regulation of these molecules, but poly(U) was ineffective (Fig. 1A). Culture with single-stranded poly(I) also induced the proliferation of murine B cells as did poly(I:C) and LPS, but poly(U) failed to induce this response (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that, unlike plasmacytoid DC, murine B cells are able to sense extracellular ssRNA and that the molecule or molecules responsible have a different specificity from TLR7 that senses ssRNA transfected intracellularly. To examine whether this difference was related to cell type we examined the responses of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and macrophages to poly(I), poly(U), and TLR ligands. As expected, culture of BMDC with LPS or double-stranded poly(I:C) induced up-regulation of CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 2A). Poly(I) also induced this response, but poly(U) was ineffective. Both BMDC and macrophages secreted TNFα and IL-12 in response to LPS, CpG-containing DNA, and poly(I:C) (Fig. 2B). The secretion of these cytokines was also induced by poly(I), but not by poly(U) (Fig. 2B). Double-stranded poly(I:C) is a classical inducer of the production of type 1 interferons. We therefore investigated the ability of poly(I) to induce interferon secretion from murine B cells and BMDC. As expected, both cell types produced significant amounts of IFN in response to LPS and poly(I:C), and poly(I) was also an effective stimulus for this response (Fig. 2C). Similar bioactivity was detected when supernatants were assayed in the presence of an inhibitory anti-IFNγ antibody (data not shown), indicating that the bulk of the IFN produced was type 1. Taken together, these data show that extracellularly presented single-stranded homopolymeric nucleic acids can induce innate responses by murine B cells, macrophages, and BMDC and that the mechanism involved shows a different nucleotide specificity from that involved in the sensing of transfected ssRNA by TLR7 in murine plasmacytoid DC. It is well established that polyanions, including poly(I), are ligands for class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) (24Peiser L. Gordon S. Microbes. Infect. 2001; 3: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although SR-A ligation has not been shown to lead to innate responses it does trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis. It was therefore possible that responses to poly(I) were dependent on SR-A. To assess this we investigated the effects of other known SR-A ligands on B cell and BMDC responses. We found that neither B cells nor BMDC were activated by either poly(G) or dextran sulfate (data not shown), indicating that responses to poly(I) are not directly mediated by SR-A. Given the roles of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 in sensing microbial nucleic acids, it seemed likely that a TLR family member was responsible for mediating the observed responses to poly(I). To investigate this we examined the responses of B cells and DC from animals deficient in MyD88, the adaptor molecule used by all TLRs except TLR3. We also investigated the responses of cells from TLR4-deficient mice to assess the possible role of TLR4 and to exclude the possibility that the responses seen resulted from endotoxin contamination of the RNA preparations used. The data show that induction of up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and proliferation induced by LPS were abolished in MyD88–/– B cells (Fig. 3, A–C). In contrast, responses to poly(I:C) and poly(I) were MyD88-independent. Neither poly(U) nor poly(C) induced these responses. As anticipated, B cells from TLR4–/– mice failed to respond to LPS. However, these cells did respond effectively to stimulation with both poly(I:C) and poly(I). The responses of BMDC from MyD88- and TLR4-deficient mice were also analyzed (Fig. 3D). BMDC lacking TLR4 failed to respond to LPS but responded as effectively as wild type BMDC to both poly(I:C) and poly(I). Deficiency of MyD88 did not affect the ability of LPS, poly(I:C), or poly(I) to induce the up-regulation of CD86 by BMDC, showing that LPS responses of B cells and BMDC are differentially dependent on this adaptor. These data effectively exclude the participation of TLR4 and the MyD88 adaptor molecule in responses to both poly(I:C) and poly(I). They also show that the responses induced by poly(I) are not the result of contamination of the nucleotide preparations with bacterial endotoxin. The data therefore appeared to suggest that, like poly(I:C), poly(I) could be a ligand for TLR3. To assess this possibility we examined the ability of bronchiolar epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) that preferentially respond to TLR3 ligation to secrete the chemokine IP-10. Culture of BEAS-2B cells with poly(I:C) or poly(I) induced IP-10 secretion, but stimulation with LPS and peptidoglycan (a TLR2 ligand) was ineffective (Fig. 4A). Ligands for murine TLRs 7 and 9 also failed to induce this response (data not shown). These results were consistent with the idea that poly(I) could be a ligand for TLR3 and further excluded any involvement of possible LPS contamination. A characteristic of TLR3 responses is that they are sensitive to inhibition by agents that disrupt endosomal acidification. We therefore examined the effects of chloroquine on B cell responses to nucleic acids and LPS. B cell proliferation induced by CpG DNA was highly sensitive to this agent, and responses to both poly(I:C) and poly(I) were significantly inhibited although LPS responses were unaffected (Fig. 4B). Signaling via TLR3 has been shown to be exclusively dependent on the adaptor molecule TRIF, whereas TLR4 utilizes both MyD88 and TRIF adaptors. The involvement of TRIF in responses to poly(I) was assessed using B cells and BMDC from TRIF-deficient mice. B cells from TRIF–/– mice cultured with CpG DNA up-regulated CD86 as effectively as cells from wild type mice but showed an impaired response to LPS. As expected, TRIF-deficient B cells failed to up-regulate CD86 when stimulated with poly(I: C), and their response to poly(I) stimulation was also drastically impaired (Fig. 5A). When proliferative responses were assessed, B cells from TRIF-deficient mice showed markedly reduced responses to LPS, poly(I:C), and poly(I) whereas the response to CpG DNA was unaffected (Fig. 5B). Thus in B cells double-stranded poly(I:C) and single-stranded poly(I) both signal via a pathway that involves TRIF, but not MyD88, whereas LPS responses are dependent on both adaptors. When responses of BMDC were examined (Fig. 5C), cells from TRIF–/– mice showed impaired responses to LPS, poly(I:C), and poly(I) but responses to CpG DNA were equivalent to those made by BMDC from wild type animals. The data therefore show that responses to both poly(I:C) and poly(I) were exclusively dependent on the TRIF adaptor and those induced by the TLR9 ligand were exclusively dependent on MyD88. Although B cell responses to LPS required both adaptors, MyD88 was not required for up-regulation of CD86 by BMDC. These findings strongly supported a role for TLR3 in the recognition of single-stranded poly(I). To test this directly, we examined the responses of HEK 293 cells transfected with vectors encoding human TLRs 3, 4, and 8 and co-transfected with an NFκB reporter construct. The data (Fig. 6A) show that HEK 293 cells transfected with huT-LRs 4 and 8 responded only to their expected ligands, LPS and R848. Cells transfected with huTLR3 responded as expected to double-stranded poly(I:C) but not to TLR4 or 8 ligands. Responses to poly(I) were only seen in HEK cells transfected with huTLR3. These findings provide evidence that TLR3 is indeed involved in sensing single-stranded poly(I). To confirm them, we examined the responses of B cells and BMDC from mice deficient in TLR3. B cells from TLR3–/– mice showed defective up-regulation of CD86 in response to poly(I:C) and poly(I) (Fig. 6B), but their responses to LPS and CpG DNA were unaffected. Similarly, TLR3–/– BMDC were unable to effectively up-regulate CD86 in response to poly(I:C) and poly(I) but responded normally to the TLR4 ligand LPS (Fig. 6C). TLR3-deficient BMDC also failed to secrete type 1 interferons when cultured with poly(I:C) or poly(I) (Fig. 6, D and E). Our data therefore provide the first evidence that single-stranded poly(I) induces innate responses in B cells, macrophages, and BMDC and that these responses are mediated by the TLR family member TLR3. Recognition of microbial nucleic acids is an important function of the innate immune system, playing a critical role in protection against viral infection. Members of the TLR family have been identified as key elements in the recognition of nucleic acid motifs. To date, it has been widely accepted that TLR9 is involved in sensing microbial DNA and TLR3 plays a vital role in detecting double-stranded RNA. Recently, TLRs 7 and 8 have been implicated in the intracellular recognition of synthetic and viral ssRNA. A role for TLR3 in sensing microbial mRNA has also been demonstrated. Here we show for the first time that murine B cells and BMDC can sense single-stranded polyinosinic acid using TLR3. Recognition of poly(I) triggers similar responses to those induced by the classical TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Evidence for the involvement of TLRs 7 (mice) and 8 (human) in sensing ssRNA is based on experiments in which plasmacytoid DC were transfected with viral RNAs, viral RNA sequences, or synthetic single-stranded homo- or heteropolymeric RNAs (12Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar, 13Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford G. Wagner H. Bauer S. Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). We set out to investigate the responses of B cells and conventional BMDC to homopolymeric RNAs presented extracellularly, the normal route by which responses to dsRNAs and CpG DNA have been examined. We found that B cells, macrophages, and BMDC responded to poly(I) but not to poly(U). This was in contrast to the TLR7- and MyD88-dependent responses of plasmacytoid DC that were elicited by poly(U), but not poly(I) (12Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar, 18Heil F. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Gellert T. Dietrich H. Lipford G. Takeda K. Akira S. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2987-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), suggesting that TLR7 might not be involved. This was confirmed by our finding that B cell and BMDC responses to poly(I) were not dependent on MyD88, the adaptor used by TLRs 7 and 8. Thus, if a TLR were involved in sensing poly(I) it was likely TLR3 or 4 because only these can signal independently of MyD88. Cells deficient in TLR4 were responsive to poly(I), excluding it as the responsible pattern recognition receptor. Our data showed that poly(I) responses of both B cells and BMDC were dependent on the TRIF adaptor. This, taken together with the chloroquine sensitivity of the responses and the fact that HEK cells transfected with huTLR3 (but not TLRs 4 or 8) were responsive, strongly suggested that poly(I) is sensed by TLR3. This was confirmed using TLR3-deficient B cells and BMDC. These differences in the sensing of homopolymeric RNAs could be due to the mode of delivery or to differences related to the cell types involved. Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that extracellularly presented dsRNA fragments of Newcastle disease virus induced IFNα production by human plasmacytoid DC but not myeloid DC (mDC) whereas poly(I:C) induced IFNα from mDC but not plasmacytoid DC (25Loseke S. Grage-Griebenow E. Heine H. Wagner A. Akira S. Bauer S. Bufe A. Scand. J. Immunol. 2006; 63: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), showing that subsets of DC can respond differentially to RNA ligands. In a previous report poly(I) was found to induce TNF and NO production by the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (27Campa V.M. Iglesias J.M. Carcedo M.T. Rodriguez R. Riera J. Ramos S. Lazo P.S. Inflamm. Res. 2005; 54: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that these responses were mediated by SR, based on the ability of dextran sulfate to inhibit poly(I)-induced activation. It seems unlikely, however, that SRs directly mediate the responses we observed because SRs have not been shown to be linked to signaling pathways that result in cytokine production and up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules. Furthermore, we found that SR-A ligands other than poly(I) failed to induce innate responses in B cells and BMDC. Our findings therefore provide novel evidence that extracellular poly(I) induces innate responses by the TLR3-TRIF pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2011888956,"In mammals, identifying the contribution of specific neurons or networks to behavior is a key challenge. Here we describe an approach that facilitates this process by enabling the rapid modulation of synaptic inhibition in defined cell populations. Binding of zolpidem, a systemically active allosteric modulator that enhances the function of the GABAA receptor, requires a phenylalanine residue (Phe77) in the γ2 subunit. Mice in which this residue is changed to isoleucine are insensitive to zolpidem. By Cre recombinase–induced swapping of the γ2 subunit (that is, exchanging Ile77 for Phe77), zolpidem sensitivity can be restored to GABAA receptors in chosen cell types. We demonstrate the power of this method in the cerebellum, where zolpidem rapidly induces significant motor deficits when Purkinje cells are made uniquely sensitive to its action. This combined molecular and pharmacological technique has demonstrable advantages over targeted cell ablation and will be invaluable for investigating many neuronal circuits."

However, importantly, there has been little evidence on oligomer formation of the amyloidogenic proteins in vivo so far, although their oligomer formation in vitro has been well characterized. In this study, we employed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to explore oligomerization of the poly(Q) proteins in cells. FCS is known to be a powerful tool for investigating the dynamics of fluorescent probes and molecules in homogeneous solution at single molecule sensitivity, which cannot be analyzed by conventional microscopy (12Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 13Elson E.L. Traffic. 2001; 2: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Several dynamic properties of the fluorophore, such as the number, diffusion time, and size of the oligomerizing molecules can be obtained (14Terada S. Kinjo M. Hirokawa N.

We here show a time-dependent increase in the diffusion time and particle size of expanded poly(Q)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins expressed in cultured cells by FCS, indicating oligomer formation. Furthermore, we show that the poly(Q)-binding peptide QBP1 (17Nagai Y. Tucker T. Ren H. Kenan D.J. Henderson B.S. Keene J.D. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10437-10442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) suppresses poly(Q)-GFP oligomer formation, whereas Congo red only inhibits the growth of oligomers, but not their initial formation, suggesting that FCS is capable of identifying poly(Q) oligomer inhibitors. We therefore conclude that FCS is a useful technique to monitor the oligomerization of disease-causing proteins in cells as well as inhibition of oligomerization in the conformational neurodegenerative diseases. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Microscopy—COS-7 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for various length pure poly(Q) stretches or poly(Q) stretches with proline insertions fused with enhanced green/yellow/cyan fluorescent protein ((Q)n-GFP/YFP/CFP; n = 19, 45 or 81) (17Nagai Y.

To evaluate the inhibitory effects of the poly(Q)-binding peptide QBP1 (SNWKWWPGIFD) (17Nagai Y. Tucker T. Ren H. Kenan D.J. Henderson B.S. Keene J.D. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. J. Biol.

To evaluate the effects of Congo red, a poly(Q) aggregate inhibitor, on poly(Q) protein oligomerization/aggregation, COS-7 cells transfected with poly(Q)-GFP or GFP expression vectors were treated with 25 μm Congo red. Cells were examined at 12, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h after transfection under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or a laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The percentage of cells with inclusion bodies was calculated by dividing the number of cells with inclusion bodies by the total number of fluorescent cells. At least 200 transfected cells were counted in each experiment, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analysis—At 48 h after transfection, COS-7 cells co-expressing poly(Q)-YFP and poly(Q)-CFP were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, and lysed by gentle sonication. The poly(Q)-YFP/CFP inclusion bodies were then removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatants, which were confirmed to contain no visible inclusion bodies under a fluorescence microscope, were subjected to FRET analyses. The soluble supernatants of the cell lysates (200 μl) each containing the same amount of poly(Q)-YFP or poly(Q)-CFP proteins were placed into a 96-well plate, and then excitation and emission scans were performed using a fluorescence plate reader (SpectraMax Gemini, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Buffer baselines were subtracted and data were plotted against wavelength. FCS Measurement and Data Analysis—COS-7 cells expressing poly(Q)-GFP or GFP with or without QBP1 or SCR, were lysed at 12, 36, 60, and 72 h after transfection with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were gently sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble poly(Q)-GFP inclusion bodies. The resulting supernatants containing no visible inclusion bodies were subjected to FCS measurements. FCS measurements were carried out using the MP-FCS/FCCS system with a ×40 objective (Olympus, NA = 1.15) (19Takahashi Y. Sawada R. Ishibashi K. Mikuni S. Kinjo M. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2005; 6: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell lysate samples (10 μl) were set on an inverted microscope. GFP was excited at the 488 nm laser line of a CW Ar+ laser through a water immersion objective, and the emission was detected at 510–610 nm. FCS measurements were performed for 32 s three times consecutively at room temperature. The intensity fluctuations were detected by an avalanche photodiode. The calculation of the autocorrelation functions was performed during the measurement. After the measurement, the autocorrelation function, G(τ) was fitted to the model as follows (Equation 1), G(τ)=<I(t)I(t+τ)><I(t)>2=1+1NΣFi(1+ττi)−1(1+τs2τi)−1/21 where <I(t)> denotes the average fluorescence intensity (counts per second), N denotes the number of fluorescent particles in the volume element with the radius wxy, and length 2wz, τi denotes the diffusion time of the fraction Fi (i = 1,2), and s denotes the axial ratio of the volume element (wz/wxy). The diffusion time (τi) corresponds to the average time for diffusion of fluorescent particles across the detection area, which reflects the size of the particles. The counts per particle (CPP) is calculated by dividing the average fluorescence intensity (〈I(t)〉) by the number (N), and hence directly reflects the number of the fluorescent molecules per particle (Equation 2). CPP=<I(t)>/N 2 We employed a simple two-component fitting analysis (i = 1,2) using a Gaussian function, where two kinds of molecules distribute in the detection area. Two-component fitting analyses were performed for (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP because their autocorrelation curves fitted well with a two-component model, whereas one-component fitting analyses (i = 1) were performed for GFP and (Q)19-GFP (Fig. 4, A and B). Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells expressing poly(Q)-GFP or co-expressing poly(Q)-GFP with QBP1 or SCR were lysed 48 h after transfection, and separated by 7.5% PAGE under nondenaturing conditions or 12.5% PAGE containing SDS. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by standard Western transfer techniques, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) at a 1:1,000 dilution followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) at a 1:5,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The horseradish peroxidase was detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce), and the membranes were exposed to x-ray films. Assembly of the Soluble Polyglutamine Protein in Cells Detected by FRET—To explore the dynamics of poly(Q) proteins in cells, we expressed poly(Q)-GFP fusion proteins with various poly(Q)-lengths in COS-7 cells, and first analyzed them by conventional laser scanning microscopy. We confirmed that (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP proteins, which are within the pathological range of poly(Q) length, form inclusion bodies in COS-7 cells at 36 h after transfection, whereas GFP and (Q)19-GFP proteins show a diffuse distribution throughout the cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The poly(Q)-GFP protein inclusions were formed in a time- and poly(Q) length-dependent manner, which is consistent with previous studies (17Nagai Y. Tucker T. Ren H. Kenan D.J. Henderson B.S. Keene J.D. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10437-10442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). No inclusions were observed in GFP and (Q)19-GFP expressing cells during the entire experimental period of up to 72 h after transfection. These results suggest that formation of poly(Q) inclusions in COS-7 cells is not interrupted by the fusion of GFP to the poly(Q) stretch. We also examined the effect of QBP1, a peptide that we previously showed to bind the poly(Q) stretch, against poly(Q) inclusion formation, and confirmed significant suppression of poly(Q) inclusion formation by co-expression of QBP1 with poly(Q)-GFP as described previously (17Nagai Y. Tucker T. Ren H. Kenan D.J. Henderson B.S. Keene J.D. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10437-10442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Although it is reported that soluble oligomers are more toxic than mature amyloid fibrils, and that the inclusion body itself is even cytoprotective in the poly(Q) diseases (2Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 6Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S.

Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar), there has been little evidence of oligomer formation of the poly(Q) protein in vivo so far. To analyze intracellular interactions of the soluble poly(Q) proteins that are distinct from formation of insoluble and microscopically visible inclusion bodies, we performed FRET analyses of poly(Q)-YFP and poly(Q)-CFP fusion proteins co-expressed in COS-7 cells. FRET occurs when two poly(Q) proteins interact with each other and exist in close proximity (<100 Å) such that the excited poly(Q)-CFP (donor) can transfer its energy to poly(Q)-YFP (acceptor) resulting in emission from the acceptor molecule (21Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As shown in poly(Q)-GFP expressing cells, (Q)81-YFP and (Q)81-CFP proteins were colocalized into inclusion bodies in COS-7 cells, whereas (Q)19-YFP and (Q)19-CFP proteins remained diffusely distributed (Fig. 2A and data not shown). To analyze the interaction of the soluble (Q)81-YFP and (Q)81-CFP proteins, cells co-expressing (Q)81-YFP and (Q)81-CFP were lysed at 48 h after transfection, centrifuged to remove insoluble inclusions, and the soluble fraction of the lysates containing no microscopically visible inclusions were subjected to FRET analyses. Emission scans of either (Q)81-CFP or (Q)81-YFP alone excited at 436 nm revealed that (Q)81-CFP exhibits a full emission with a maximum at 480–500 nm, whereas (Q)81-YFP exhibits a slight crossover emission with a maximum at 530 nm (Fig. 2B). Notably, we found that the cells co-expressing (Q)81-YFP and (Q)81-CFP exhibit a dramatic increase in the emission with a maximum at 530 nm upon excitation at 436 nm. Moreover, we found a corresponding decrease in the emission with a maximum at 480–500 nm, although the amount of (Q)81-CFP proteins used for the FRET experiments was the same as that of (Q)81-CFP alone. These results indicate that FRET occurs between soluble (Q)81-YFP and (Q)81-CFP proteins. We did not observe any significant FRET between (Q)19-YFP and (Q)19-CFP proteins in the soluble cell lysates (data not shown), confirming that this interaction between (Q)81-YFP and (Q)81-CFP is specific. These results provide the first evidence for assembly of the soluble expanded poly(Q) protein in cultured cells. In earlier studies, FRET has been applied to monitor inclusion body formation of poly(Q) proteins in cell culture (22Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Pollitt S.K. Pallos J. Shao J. Desai U.A. Ma A.A. Thompson L.M. Marsh J.L. Diamond M.I. Neuron. 2003; 40: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, these studies only detected gathering of the poly(Q) proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies, and not the molecular interactions of the soluble poly(Q) proteins. Because inclusion body formation itself is considered to be a cytoprotective response (6Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 7Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), monitoring molecular interactions of the soluble poly(Q) proteins in vivo is critical for understanding cytotoxicity of the poly(Q) proteins and its suppression. Polyglutamine Protein Oligomer Formation in Cells Detected by FCS—Although we clearly demonstrated molecular interactions of expanded poly(Q) proteins in the soluble fraction using FRET, FRET does not provide quantitative information such as the size of the assemblies; i.e. whether they are dimers, trimers, or larger oligomers. In addition, the efficiency of FRET does not always correlate with the quantity of interactions because it also depends on the distance between fluorescent probes (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further characterize and quantify the assemblies, and to explore intracellular oligomer formation of the soluble expanded poly(Q) protein in cells, we employed FCS analyses, which is a highly sensitive technique for investigating the dynamics of fluorescent molecules in solution at single molecule sensitivity (12Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 13Elson E.L. Traffic. 2001; 2: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (supplementary materials Fig. S1). Several dynamic properties of the fluorophore, such as the number, diffusion time, and size of the oligomerizing molecules can be analyzed by FCS (14Terada S. Kinjo M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 141-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Jankevics H. Prummer M. Izewska P. Pick H. Leufgen K. Vogel H.

COS-7 cells expressing poly(Q)-GFP were lysed at certain intervals after transfection and centrifuged to remove inclusions, and the soluble fractions of the lysates containing no microscopically visible inclusions were subjected to FCS measurements. Autocorrelation curves of GFP and poly(Q)-GFP, which indicate the relative distribution of molecules with various diffusion times, are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The autocorrelation curves of both GFP and (Q)19-GFP overlapped with each other until at least 72 h after transfection, suggesting that the mobility of GFP and (Q)19-GFP molecules remained unchanged during the experimental period (Fig. 3A and data not shown). However, we found that the autocorrelation curves of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP at 60 h after transfection were shifted toward the right with increasing length of the poly(Q) stretch. The degree of the rightward shift of the autocorrelation curves of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B and data not shown). These results suggest that the mobility of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP gradually decreased and the size of the (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP particles gradually became larger as compared with GFP and (Q)19-GFP, implying formation of slowly moving oligomeric species. We next analyzed time-dependent changes of the CPP of poly(Q)-GFP, which is the average fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent particles measured, and therefore directly reflects the number of poly(Q)-GFP monomers per oligomer/aggregate. Both the CPPs of GFP and (Q)19-GFP were unchanged until at least 72 h after transfection, suggesting that GFP and (Q)19-GFP molecules remained as a monomer during the experimental period (Fig. 3C). However, importantly, we found that the CPPs of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP significantly increase in a time- and poly(Q) length-dependent manner, indicating that these poly(Q)-GFP molecules gradually assemble into oligomers (Fig. 3C). These results provide the first evidence for soluble oligomer formation of poly(Q) proteins in cultured cells, in which the soluble poly(Q) proteins are diffusely distributed, and not accumulated as inclusion bodies. The CPP value of (Q)81-GFP at 60 h after transfection (58.3) was about 3.5-fold larger than that of (Q)81-GFP at 12 h (16.5), indicating that (Q)81-GFP oligomers at 60 h consist of 3.5 monomers on average. Because the CPP value is simply an average fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent particles, and the (Q)81-GFP particles present in cells at 60 h are assumed to be a mixture of monomers and oligomers of various sizes, the actual (Q)81-GFP oligomers at this time point are expected to be much larger than the CPP value. To further confirm oligomer formation of poly(Q)-GFP proteins by an alternative biophysical method, we performed Western blot analyses of poly(Q)-GFP proteins to see if we could detect any oligomeric species as a ladder pattern. The soluble cell lysates of COS-7 cells expressing poly(Q)-GFP were separated by native PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-GFP antibody. We found intense bands corresponding to poly(Q)-GFP monomers in all samples (Fig. 3D, arrows), and also considerable amounts of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP proteins remaining at the gel top, probably due to their assembly into oligomers/aggregates (Fig. 3D, black arrowhead). Notably, upon long exposure, we successfully detected faint ladder bands in addition to the monomer bands in the lysates of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP expressing cells (Fig. 3D, red arrowheads). Such a ladder pattern was not evident in the (Q)19-GFP cell lysate. These faint ladder bands probably correspond to dimers, trimers, etc., which were detected as increases in the CPP values by FCS. Larger oligomers were not detected probably because they were not separated by native PAGE. Thus, FCS has an advantage over Western blot analysis in detecting these oligomers quantitatively in solution. Quantitative Analyses of Polyglutamine Protein Oligomer Formation by a Two-component Fitting Analysis—We next performed quantitative analyses on the diffusion times of poly(Q)-GFP proteins obtained by FCS, which reflect the size of the poly(Q)-GFP particles. Whereas GFP and (Q)19-GFP showed a simple decay of autocorrelation curves, which fitted with a one-component model, the autocorrelation curves of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP fitted well with a two-component model, suggesting that at least two kinds of fluorescent particles with different mobility exist in the samples (Fig. 4, A and B). We therefore employed a two-component fitting analysis to evaluate the diffusion times of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP. Fig. 4C illustrates a model curve with two components; a fast diffusion component fraction (F1) and a slow diffusion component fraction (F2), with fast diffusion time (DT1) and slow diffusion time (DT2), respectively. Notably, we found that the diffusion times of the fast component (DT1) of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP increased in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that the mobility of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP molecules gradually decreased by assembly into oligomers (Fig. 4D). The DT1 of GFP and (Q)19-GFP were almost unchanged, indicating that these molecules remained as a monomer during the experimental period (Fig. 4D). The DT1 of (Q)81-GFP at 60 and 72 h were 179 and 204 μs, respectively, which are significantly longer than that at 12 h (100 μs). The diffusion time is proportional to the cubic root of the molecular weight ((DTa/DTb) = (MWa/MWb)-3) if the effect of the molecular shape on its diffusion is minimal. Accordingly, we can estimate the size of (Q)81-GFP oligomers at 60 and 72 h to be about 5.7 and 8.5 times larger than that at the beginning, respectively. Similarly, the size of (Q)45-GFP oligomers at 72 h is also estimated to be about 5.4 times larger, because the DT1 of (Q)45-GFP increased from 84 to 147 μs after 72 h. Therefore, the fast diffusion component fraction (F1) is likely to reflect small oligomeric species. These oligomers are thought to be formed from the monomer during the process of aggregate formation, which is a distinct process from inclusion body formation, because inclusion bodies are believed to be formed through an active cellular regulation mechanism for handling misfolded or aggregated proteins (7Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). We also evaluated the diffusion times of the slow component (DT2) of (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP, which were detected in the soluble lysates only when poly(Q) inclusions were observed in cells, from 36 h after transfection (Fig. 4E). The DT2 components were ∼2–3 ms in both (Q)45- and (Q)81-GFP, and were about 20–30 times slower than the DT1 components at 12 h. We can estimate the size of the particles detected as the slow diffusion component to be about 8,000–27,000 times larger than the monomer, and these particles are therefore likely to be large soluble aggregates. These results indicate the remarkable ability of FCS to define monomers, small oligomers, and large aggregates formed in cells at once. We further evaluated the ratio of the slow diffusion component fraction (F2) to tot"
https://openalex.org/W2053931171,"Earth's solid-iron inner core has a low rigidity that manifests itself in the anomalously low velocities of shear waves as compared to shear wave velocities measured in iron alloys. Normally, when estimating the elastic properties of a polycrystal, one calculates an average over different orientations of a single crystal. This approach does not take into account the grain boundaries and defects that are likely to be abundant at high temperatures relevant for the inner core conditions. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, if defects are considered, the calculated shear modulus and shear wave velocity decrease dramatically as compared to those estimates obtained from the averaged single-crystal values. Thus, the low shear wave velocity in the inner core is explained."

Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Apart from the structural and dynamic effects of incorporation into a model membrane, competition for ligand binding between a model membrane and an incorporated protein can alter the apparent affinity and stoichiometry of ligand binding by the protein in equilibrium and kinetic experiments. Parry et al. (2Parry G. Palmer D.N. Williams D.J. FEBS Lett. 1976; 67: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) presented separate analytical equations describing ligand binding to a membrane protein with a solvent-exposed active site or with a membrane-exposed active site. Heirwegh et al. (3Heirwegh K.P. Vermeir M. Zaman Z. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) extended this approach to account for amphiphilic binding sites and multiphasic lipid systems. Both these models assume that only the ligand concentration accessible to the protein is relevant; for solvent-exposed active sites, only the free ligand concentration in bulk solvent needs be taken into account; for lipid-facing sites, only the substrate concentration in the membrane is relevant. This implies that the free ligand approximation holds for both the bulk solvent and lipid phases (i.e. ligand binding to the protein does not significantly deplete ligand from the membrane or from solution), requiring that the protein concentration is lower than the true KD value of the ligand in question, and that the model membrane be present in substantial excess to the protein. This approximation also causes the binding equations to vary depending on the route of ligand access to the active site. A thermodynamically accurate and general equilibrium binding model would predict identical ligand binding behavior regardless of the route or kinetics of ligand binding to a protein. Previous attempts to quantify the effect of the membrane phase on ligand binding and turnover by cytochrome P450s have generally involved measuring binding KD (4Kominami S. Itoh Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2077-2083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kuhn-Velten W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or turnover Km values (6Margolis J.M. Obach R.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for protein incorporated into liposomes, over a range of lipid concentrations. Extrapolation to a lipid-free system provides qualitative information as to how the membrane affects the apparent affinity of a membrane protein for a substrate. Of particular interest is the analysis by Kühn-Velten (5Kuhn-Velten W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) on progesterone binding to CYP17 in liposomes using a combination of absorbance spectroscopy, ultracentrifugation, and equilibrium dialysis to measure the concentration of ligand bound to protein, bound to the membrane, and free in solution. The apparent KD value was some 3 orders of magnitude lower than the true KD value corrected for the free progesterone concentration. It should be noted that the lipid mixtures widely used in CYP3A4 turnover studies (7Lin H.L. Kent U.M. Hollenberg P.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Shaw P.M. Hosea N.A. Thompson D.V. Lenius J.M. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem.

They contain detergents such as cholic acid or CHAPS well below their critical micellar concentrations (10Heerklotz H. Seelig J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Sugihara G. Yamakawa K. Murata Y. Tanaka M. J. Phys. Chem. 1982; 86: 2784-2788Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), along with smaller amounts of phospholipids. These mixtures cannot form canonical mixed micelles with the phospholipids (12Schurholz T. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 58: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Walter A. Kuehl G. Barnes K. VanderWaerdt G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but they are unlikely to exist as liposomes because the detergent concentrations are much higher than the phospholipid concentrations (14Keller S. Heerklotz H. Jahnke N. Blume A. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4509-4521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The consequent uncertainty about the structure and composition of the lipid phase in reconstituted systems greatly complicates attempts to describe small molecule binding to these systems, making a rigorous analysis of their effect on ligand binding to CYP3A4 intractably complex.

Nanodiscs resemble nascent discoidal high density lipoprotein particles (see Fig. 1a) and consist of a POPC bilayer about 10 nm in diameter surrounded by two monomers of a 23-kDa membrane scaffold protein (MSP). The protein coat ensures that Nanodiscs are monodisperse, relatively stable, and consistent between preparations; it also allows the determination of the affinity and stoichiometry with which small molecules bind to the Nanodisc membrane. As an additional benefit, incorporation of CYP3A4 into Nanodiscs prevents its oligomerization, which can affect its reduction kinetics (21Davydov D.R. Fernando H. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. Halpert J.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13902-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and substrate turnover (27Kumar S. Davydov D.R. Halpert J.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we study the binding of four small molecule ligands (TNS, ANF, miconazole and bromocriptine; structures in Fig. 1b) to CYP3A4-Nanodiscs, to determine the true affinity of these compounds to CYP3A4 incorporated into a membrane, and to determine how bound ligand partitions between the CYP3A4 active site and a lipid bilayer. TNS is a well characterized fluorescent probe of protein structure that fluoresces in nonpolar environments but is quenched and red-shifted in solution. ANF is a CYP3A4 substrate and effector of testosterone metabolism, which fluoresces in solution and is quenched and blue-shifted in nonpolar environments. Miconazole is an azole drug that is a known inhibitor of CYP3A4. Bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid used as a dopamine receptor agonist, is also a substrate (28Peyronneau M.A. Delaforge M. Riviere R. Renaud J.P. Mansuy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (29Wynalda M.A. Wienkers L.C. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1997; 25: 1211-1214PubMed Google Scholar). Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Protein Expression and Purification—The CYP3A4 NF14 construct was purified and expressed essentially as described (30Pearson J.T. Hill J.J. Swank J. Isoherranen N. Kunze K.L. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6341-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Gillam E.M. Baba T. Kim B.R. Ohmori S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), except that 2% ANAPOE C12E10 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) was used to solubilized the membrane fraction instead of Emulgen 911. The NF-14 construct lacks residues 3–11 of wild-type CYP3A4, which constitute an N-terminal helical membrane anchor. CYP3A4 was stored in 100 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, with 20% glycerol at -80 °C but was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 100 mm NaCl for all subsequent experiments. MSP1D1(-) was purified and expressed as described previously (17Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Nanodisc and CYP3A4-Nanodisc Preparation—Nanodiscs and CYP3A4-Nanodiscs were prepared essentially as described previously (17Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); see Fig. 2 for schematic. To make Nanodiscs, MSP and POPC were mixed in a 1:65 molar ratio with 50 mm sodium cholate and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. To remove the detergent and initiate Nanodisc self-assembly, washed Amberlite XAD-2 (a hydrophobic adsorbent resin) was added at 0.5 g/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h on ice. The resin was removed using filter columns under gravity flow, and the Nanodiscs were concentrated and purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). To make CYP3A4-Nanodiscs, MSP, POPC, and CYP3A4 were mixed in a 1:63:0.1 molar ratio with 50 mm sodium cholate and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation with 0.8 g/ml Amberlite XAD-2 for 4 h on ice, nickel column chromatography was used to separate CYP3A4-Nanodiscs (which possess a His tag at the CYP3A4 C terminus) from excess Nanodiscs. The 5-fold excess of Nanodiscs to CYP3A4 ensures that only one monomer of CYP3A4 is incorporated into a given Nanodisc. Size exclusion was used to purify the CYP3A4-Nanodiscs and verify stable and monomeric incorporation. The absolute absorbance spectrum of CYP3A4 did not change significantly upon incorporation into Nanodiscs (data not shown). Unless otherwise stated, the concentration of CYP3A4-Nanodiscs in experiments was 1.4 μm. Ligand Binding to Nanodiscs Monitored by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—An SLM-Aminco AB/2 fluorimeter (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) was used for all experiments, and the concentration of Nanodiscs used for titrations was 1.0 μm unless otherwise stated. Data were corrected for the primary and secondary inner-filter effects by the method of Lakowicz (32Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 52-54Google Scholar) and normalized for the change in volume over the course of a titration. TNS fluorescence (λex = 320 nm, λem = 440 nm) increases upon binding to Nanodiscs. To determine the affinity of the first mode of TNS binding to Nanodiscs, TNS fluorescence was monitored, whereas Nanodiscs were titrated into 0.5 μm TNS (Fig. 3a). Data were fit to the hyperbolic binding equation. The fluorescence of tryptophan residues (λex = 295 nm) in MSP is quenched upon TNS binding, via a Forster resonance energy transfer to TNS. Relative quenching of the MSP Trp fluorescence at 340 nm upon addition of TNS to Nanodiscs was used to monitor binding (Fig. 3b). (There are two Trp residues in each MSP monomer, and we assume that they are quenched equally upon ligand binding.) Data were fit to kinetic simulations (see below) of a three-site sequential binding model. ANF fluorescence is quenched upon binding to Nanodiscs. 0.5 μm ANF was mixed with varying concentrations of Nanodiscs between 0 and 12.5 μm and excited at 320 nm. The relative quenching of ANF emission between 400 and 500 nm (Fig. 4a) was fit to the quadratic binding equation, because the apparent KD value was close to the concentration of ANF. ANF binding also quenches MSP Trp fluorescence; ANF was titrated into 0.5 μm Nanodiscs, and the resulting quenching of Trp fluorescence at 340 nm (Fig. 4b) was fit to the multisite quadratic binding to determine the stoichiometry of ANF binding to Nanodiscs. The affinity of miconazole for Nanodiscs was measured using a competitive binding assay with ANF. 1.0 μm Nanodiscs were mixed with 20 μm ANF and excited at 320 nm. The recovery of ANF fluorescence at 440 nm was monitored as aliquots of miconazole were added (Fig. 5a). Data were fit to the hyperbolic binding equation. Bromocriptine also quenches MSP Trp fluorescence upon binding to Nanodiscs. Bromocriptine was separately titrated into 0.83, 1.7, and 3.3 μm Nanodiscs, and the three binding curves (Fig. 6a) were globally fit to kinetic simulations of a fivesite sequential binding model. Ligand Binding to CYP3A4—Ligand binding was monitored by absolute absorbance spectroscopy of the heme Soret band. Data were collected on a Cary 3E spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary, NC). Unless otherwise stated, the sample cuvette contained 1.4 μm total CYP3A4-Nanodiscs, whereas the reference cuvette contained an equal concentration of Nanodiscs. Equal aliquots of ligand were added to both cuvettes, and absorbance was recorded from 350 to 600 nm. Absolute absorbance spectroscopy minimizes interference from any ligand absorbance that overlaps with the heme. This is especially useful for ligands that display environment-sensitive absorbance, such as ANF and TNS. All of the absorbance scans from a titration were smoothed over a 4 nm window, baseline-corrected, corrected for the effect of solvent, and normalized for the change in volume. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the absorbance signal for CYP3A4 alone from each scan in the titration, and the peak-to-trough ΔA was plotted against ligand concentration. Data analysis was performed using scripts written in the Python programming language, and curve fitting was performed using Gepasi (33Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) for kinetic simulations and gnuplot for analytical equations. When fitting to kinetic simulations, Gepasi was used to model the relevant binding scheme. All bimolecular on-rates were set to 1 μm-1 s-1, and suitable selected off-rates and scaling factors were varied so as to minimize the χ2 between steady-state metabolite concentrations and experimental data, using Levenburg-Marquadt, evolutionary programming, and Nelder and Mead fitting algorithms. Because the data are from equilibrium binding experiments, the time scales and the absolute values of rate constants in these simulations are arbitrary. Equilibrium binding constants for any given step are given by the ratios of relevant rate constants. This procedure obviates the need to derive analytical binding equations for complex binding schemes, making it especially useful when the free ligand approximation is inapplicable because of high affinity binding to CYP3A4 or to Nanodiscs. The affinity of an amphiphile binding to a lipid bilayer is traditionally described by a membrane/solvent partition coefficient KP, but equilibrium association (KA) or dissociation constants (KD) can be used instead when the molar volume (Vmemb, with units of concentration-1) of the model membrane can be estimated using the equations KP = KA/Vmemb = 1/(VmembKD) (34Abreu M.S.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9354-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10044-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We describe multiple small molecules binding to the Nanodisc membrane as a series of sequential binding modes, each with an associated KD value. Scheme 1 presents the framework we use to describe ligand binding to CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs and the competition between binding to the membrane and to CYP3A4. K1 is the dissociation constant of ligand binding to the membrane. K1′ is the dissociation constant of ligand binding to the protein, and can be directly compared with KD measurements made using other model membranes, or in the absence of model membranes, inasmuch as all represent the affinity of drug for the active site under those specific conditions. K2 = K1′/K1 is a unitless equilibrium constant describing the ratio of ligand bound to the membrane and to the protein. In cases where multiple ligands can bind the Nanodisc membrane, a different K2 is defined for each occupancy state of the CYP3A4-Nanodisc complex. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy could not adequately distinguish ligand bound to the Nanodisc bilayer from ligand bound to CYP3A4 for any of the small molecules under consideration. Therefore, the same general strategy was used to obtain models for each of the various ligands binding to CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs. Ligand binding to free Nanodiscs (Fig. 3, a and b, Fig. 4, a and b, Fig. 5a and Fig. 6a) was used to determine K1. Binding to CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs (Figs. 3c, 4c, 5b and 6b) was monitored via ligand-induced changes in the absorbance of the heme Soret band. These data were fit to kinetic simulations of suitable binding models, to recover K1′. K2 is given by the ratio between K1′ and K1. TNS—The affinity with which a single TNS molecule bound to a Nanodisc was determined by titrating Nanodiscs into a fixed concentration of TNS, and monitoring the increase in TNS fluorescence at 440 nm as it entered a nonpolar environment (Fig. 3a). A fit to the hyperbolic binding equation yielded a K1 for this first binding mode of 2.9 ± 0.07 μm. In the complementary titration, TNS binding to a fixed concentration of Nanodiscs was monitored via the quenching of Trp fluorescence at 340 nm (Fig. 3b). These data were fit to a model with two additional binding modes, each with a K1 of 6.1 ± 0.1 μm, and with each bound TNS molecule causing one-third of the total quenching. In other words, at least three TNS molecules bind to each Nanodisc, with apparent negative binding cooperativity, the binding of the first TNS molecule altered the properties of the bilayer so as to disfavor subsequent binding events. The overall membrane partition coefficient KP can be calculated from these K1 values by using the equation KP = 1/(VmembK1) for each of the three binding modes and summing the resultant individual partition coefficients. Assuming a molar volume for POPC of 1263 Å3 (39Chiu S.W. Jakobsson E. Subramaniam S. Scott H.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2462-2469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and 130 POPC molecules per Nanodisc, the volume of a Nanodisc is 1.64 × 10-22 liters, and therefore the molar volume Vmemb is 98.9 liters/mol. Consequently, the overall KP for TNS is 6.8 × 103. This closely matches the KP values for TNS-binding phospholipid vesicles (≈6.5 × 103) (37Seelig J. Ganz P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9354-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 40Huang C.H. Charlton J.P. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 41McLaughlin S. Harary H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1941-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), implying that Nanodiscs are suitable model membranes for the study of small molecule binding to lipid bilayers. TNS binding to CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs caused a type II spectral change, with an increase in absorbance at 440 nm and a decrease at 414 nm (Fig. 3c). Data from the optical titration were fit to the model in Scheme 2, incorporating the K1 values obtained from the experiments with Nanodiscs alone. The fit yielded a K1′ value of 4.0 ± 0.4 μm; this is the dissociation constant of TNS binding to the active site of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs. The equivalent value measured for CYP3A4 in solution is 25.4 μm (42Lampe J.N. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12204-12215Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This apparent difference in affinity may be due to structural changes in CYP3A4 caused by incorporation into a lipid bilayer. The K2 values calculated from these K1 and K1′ values vary between 1.4 ± 0.1 (for the singly occupied CYP3A4-Nanodisc complex) and 0.66 ± 0.07 (for doubly and triply occupied complexes). Values of K2 close to 1 indicate that TNS does not have a strong thermodynamic preference for either the Nanodisc bilayer or the CYP3A4 active site. ANF—As for TNS, the affinity with which a single molecule of ANF bound to Nanodiscs was determined by titrating Nanodiscs into a fixed concentration of ANF and monitoring the decrease in integrated ANF fluorescence between 400 and 500 nm (Fig. 4a). Fitting the resulting curve to the quadratic binding equation yielded a K1 of 0.81 ± 0.20 μm. In the converse titration, ANF binding to Nanodiscs was monitored by Trp fluorescence quenching at 340 nm (Fig. 4b) and fit to the multisite quadratic binding Equation 1, Q=Qmax2×[M]×(K1+n×[M]+[ANF]-(K1+n×[M]+[ANF])2-4×n×[M]×[ANF])(Eq. 1) Here [M] is the Nanodisc concentration, and n is the stoichiometry of ANF binding to Nanodiscs. The recovered value of n was 14.3 ± 0.6, indicating that about 14 molecules of ANF bind to each Nanodisc. This value was confirmed by kinetic simulations. Assuming 14 molecules of ANF bind to a Nanodisc, each with a K1 of 0.81 μm, the overall membrane partition coefficient is 1.7 × 105. ANF binding to CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs caused a high spin (type I) spectral change, with an increase in absorbance at 388 nm and a decrease at 417 nm (Fig. 4c). Data from this titration were fit to the model in Scheme 3, and the recovered K1′ value was 5.8 ± 0.4 μm. ANF binding to CYP3A4 in solution has been studied extensively (43Hosea N.A. Miller G.P.

https://openalex.org/W2123793232,"Copper is an essential trace element required by all aerobic organisms as a cofactor for enzymes involved in normal growth, development, and physiology. Ctr1 proteins are members of a highly conserved family of copper importers responsible for copper uptake across the plasma membrane. Mice lacking Ctr1 die during embryogenesis from widespread developmental defects, demonstrating the need for adequate copper acquisition in the development of metazoan organisms via as yet uncharacterized mechanisms. Whereas the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, expresses three Ctr1 genes, ctr1A, ctr1B, and ctr1C, little is known about their protein isoform-specific roles. Previous studies demonstrated that Ctr1B localizes to the plasma membrane and is not essential for development unless flies are severely copper-deficient or are subjected to copper toxicity. Here we demonstrate that Ctr1A also resides on the plasma membrane and is the primary Drosophila copper transporter. Loss of Ctr1A results in copper-remedial developmental arrest at early larval stages. Ctr1A mutants are deficient in the activity of copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase and tyrosinase. Amidation of Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amides, a group of cardiomodulatory neuropeptide hormones that are matured via the action of peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase, is defective in neuroendocrine cells of Ctr1A mutant larvae. Moreover, both the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide maturation and heart beat rate defects observed in Ctr1A mutant larvae can be partially rescued by exogenous copper. These studies establish clear physiological distinctions between two Drosophila plasma membrane copper transport proteins and demonstrate that copper import by Ctr1A is required to drive neuropeptide maturation during normal growth and development. Copper is an essential trace element required by all aerobic organisms as a cofactor for enzymes involved in normal growth, development, and physiology. Ctr1 proteins are members of a highly conserved family of copper importers responsible for copper uptake across the plasma membrane. Mice lacking Ctr1 die during embryogenesis from widespread developmental defects, demonstrating the need for adequate copper acquisition in the development of metazoan organisms via as yet uncharacterized mechanisms. Whereas the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, expresses three Ctr1 genes, ctr1A, ctr1B, and ctr1C, little is known about their protein isoform-specific roles. Previous studies demonstrated that Ctr1B localizes to the plasma membrane and is not essential for development unless flies are severely copper-deficient or are subjected to copper toxicity. Here we demonstrate that Ctr1A also resides on the plasma membrane and is the primary Drosophila copper transporter. Loss of Ctr1A results in copper-remedial developmental arrest at early larval stages. Ctr1A mutants are deficient in the activity of copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase and tyrosinase. Amidation of Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amides, a group of cardiomodulatory neuropeptide hormones that are matured via the action of peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase, is defective in neuroendocrine cells of Ctr1A mutant larvae. Moreover, both the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide maturation and heart beat rate defects observed in Ctr1A mutant larvae can be partially rescued by exogenous copper. These studies establish clear physiological distinctions between two Drosophila plasma membrane copper transport proteins and demonstrate that copper import by Ctr1A is required to drive neuropeptide maturation during normal growth and development. Enzymes are required to carry out a complex orchestration of biochemical reactions, and many of these enzymes require cofactors obtained through the diet. One such cofactor is copper, an essential trace element involved in such diverse biological and developmental processes as energy generation, peptide maturation, free radical detoxification, blood vessel formation and melanin production (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. 1991; (, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York)Crossref Google Scholar, 2Pena M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J.

In addition to the canonical role of copper as a cofactor, data support novel roles for copper in the secretion of growth factors and in modulating neuronal function (4Schlief M.L. Craig A.M. Gitlin J.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Sen C.K. Khanna S. Venojarvi M. Trikha P. Ellison E.C. Hunt T.K. Roy S. Am. J.

Its utility in biological systems, however, is tempered by its ability to catalyze the formation of free radicals that are damaging to cells (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). Thus cells have evolved a homeostatic pathway for the uptake, distribution, and sequestration of copper such that the essential cellular requirements for copper can be achieved while minimizing its toxic potential. Studies in bakers’ yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, facilitated the discovery of many of the components of the copper homeostatic pathway, and these proteins are strongly conserved among species extending all the way to mammals (3Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 8Harris E.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Rees E.M. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Ctr proteins, a family of conserved, high affinity copper transporters, function as a primary means through which individual cells obtain copper (10Lee J. Pena M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Inside cells, copper is escorted to intracellular compartments or proteins by copper chaperone proteins as follows: CCS incorporates copper into Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase; Atx1 delivers copper to the Golgi network where it is then pumped into the lumen of the Golgi via the action of ATP7A and ATP7B and from within the Golgi lumen can be incorporated into copper-dependent proteins, and Cox17 facilitates copper insertion into mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (14Huffman D.L.

Menkes disease, an X-linked copper deficiency disorder caused by mutations in ATP7A that leads to the hyper-accumulation of copper in intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent hypo-accumulation of copper in peripheral tissues, results in early childhood lethality. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper toxicosis disorder caused by mutations in ATP7B that leads to massive hyper-accumulation of copper in the liver and subsequent copper overload in peripheral tissues and can result in liver disease and/or neurological conditions (19Mercer J.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Andrews N.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutations in other components of the copper homeostatic pathway can result in either early embryonic lethality, perinatal lethality, or pathologic conditions. Mutations in Cox17 (21Takahashi Y. Kako K. Kashiwabara S. Takehara A. Inada Y. Arai H. Nakada K. Kodama H. Hayashi J. Baba T. Munekata E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7614-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Ctr1 (22Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whereas systemic Ctr1 knock-out mice die early in embryogenesis accompanied by severe and widespread developmental defects, including poorly developed mesoderm and neural ectoderm layers and impaired neural tube closure, intestinal epithelial cell-specific Ctr1 knock-out mice exhibit marked growth retardation, cardiac hypertrophy, and overall viability defects resulting in postnatal lethality by ∼3 weeks of age (25Nose Y. Kim B. Thiele D.J. Cell Metabolism. 2006; 4: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutations in Sco2, a protein involved in the assembly of copper into cytochrome c oxidase, have been associated with fatal infantile cardiomyopathy (26Papadopoulou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishino I. Sadlock J.E. Krishna S. Walker W. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Coster R.V. Lyon G. Scalais E. Lebel R. Kaplan P. Shanske S. De Vivo D.C. Bonilla E. Hirano M. DiMauro S.

Osmond S. Gigarel N. Mehaye B. Amiel J. Cormier-Daire V. Munnich A. Bonnefont J.P. Rustin P. Rotig A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1104-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations illustrate the importance of copper homeostasis in normal development and physiology. Previously, three Ctr1 genes were identified in the Drosophila genome based on sequence homology of the encoded proteins to mammalian and yeast Ctr1 proteins. Drosophila Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C each possess the following three structural features characteristic of all known Ctr family members: three transmembrane domains, a methionine residue preceding the first transmembrane domain, and an MXXXM motif within the second transmembrane domain. Additionally, expression of each Drosophila Ctr1 protein can rescue a yeast strain deficient in high affinity copper uptake, and expression of Ctr1A and Ctr1B stimulates copper uptake in S2 cells (29Zhou H. Cadigan K.M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48210-48218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that Drosophila Ctr1B is necessary only under growth conditions where copper is limiting or, paradoxically, when copper is in excess (29Zhou H. Cadigan K.M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48210-48218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The focus of this study was to characterize Drosophila Ctr1A. Here we show that ctr1A is an essential gene for Drosophila development. Furthermore, Ctr1A mutant flies exhibit deficiencies in copper-dependent enzyme activities, deficient amidation of a peptide known to have cardiomodulatory properties and copper-remedial defects in heart function. Fly Stocks and Genetics—To generate a Ctr1A mutant, an imprecise P-excision strategy was used (30Cooley L. Kelley R. Spradling A. Science. 1988; 239: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Line G788 was obtained from GenExel, Inc., and the location of the P-insertion was confirmed via inverse PCR. To screen for a potential excision within Ctr1A, a PCR-based strategy was used. Primer A1, which anneals to an intergenic region ∼40 bp upstream of the Ctr1A locus, was used as the forward primer in all test PCRs, and reverse primers were designed ∼500 bp apart that spanned the entire Ctr1A locus as well as an additional 1 kb downstream of the Ctr1A locus. Lines that yielded a PCR product with a smaller than expected size were marked as positive and examined further. Excision line 25 was selected for further analysis; sequencing of the PCR product spanning the excision was done to determine the exact molecular nature of the excision. Generating female germ line Ctr1A mutants was accomplished using the Flip recombinase-dominant female sterile technique (31Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Genetics. 1992; 131: 643-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental Progression Analyses—For hatching efficiencies, embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach. The number of fertilized embryos placed on a grape juice plate were counted, and the number of unhatched embryos remaining after 24 h and again after 48 h were counted. For both embryo and larval cuticle preparation images, embryos were mounted onto slides containing Hoyer’s solution, and a coverslip was placed on top of them. Mechanical devitellinization for the embryos was accomplished by applying gentle pressure onto the coverslip until the vitelline membrane burst. Slides were then baked at 60 °C for 2–3 days. Staging of larvae was based on mouth hook structure, and the presence and appearance of anterior spiracles were as described by Demerec (32Demerec M. The Biology of Drosophila. 1994; (, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 283-288Google Scholar). For the images of tyrosinase-deficient larvae, live larvae were mounted in 70% glycerol; a coverslip was gently placed on top of the animals, and images were taken immediately using a Leica MZFL III fluorescence stereomicroscope mounted with a QImaging Retiga EXi digital camera. Ctr1A Antibody—The rabbit anti-Ctr1A antibody was made by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. Immunoblot—Embryo lysates were prepared by homogenizing dechorionated embryos in a mild lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Protein concentration for this and all subsequent experiments was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with rabbit anti-Ctr1A (1:200 for deficiency immunoblot; 1:1000 for line 25 immunoblot) and mouse JLA20 (Developmental Studies Hybridomas Bank)(1:100). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit and donkey anti-mouse conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) (1:5000). Embryo Staining Protocol—W1118 adult females were allowed to lay eggs overnight. Embryos were fixed according to standard procedures (33Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley S.R. Drosophila Protocols. 2000; (, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 141-173Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-Ctr1A (1:500) and mouse anti-neurotactin (1:10) (BP106; Developmental Studies Hybridomas Bank). Secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit conjugated with rhodamine and donkey anti-mouse conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:1000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Embryos were mounted in Prolong antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Larval Tissue Staining Protocol—Wandering 3rd instar W1118 larvae were dissected and fixed according to standard procedures (33Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley S.R. Drosophila Protocols. 2000; (, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 141-173Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibody incubations and mounting were the same as described for the embryo staining. Mouse anti-actin (JLA20; Developmental Studies Hybridomas Bank) was used at 1:500. Immunohistochemistry Protocol for Dissected Larval Brain—1st instar larvae were dissected in 1× PBS. 3The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PHM, peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase; FMRF-amide, Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Fixation and staining were performed according to methods published previously (34Jiang N. Kolhekar A.S. Jacobs P.S. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Taghert P.H. Dev. Biol. 2000; 226: 118-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Signal was detected using the metal-enhanced DAB substrate kit (Pierce ImmunoPure) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue was mounted onto a slide in 70% glycerol, 1× PBS. Images were taken with a Leica MZFL III fluorescence stereomicroscope mounted with a QImaging Retiga EXi digital camera. Cox Enzyme Activity Assay—To detect cytochrome c oxidase activity, the cytochrome c oxidase assay kit from Sigma (CTYOC-OX1) was used. Preparation of reagents and assay procedure were followed as described in kit protocol. Lysates were prepared by washing larvae in 1× PBS for 10 min and then by homogenizing larvae in Phosphate Buffer, pH 6.8, 0.5% Tween. 20 μg of lysate was used for each sample in the assay. Enzyme activity was calculated using the formula presented in kit’s protocol. Heart Rate Assay—Glass 8-well multitest slides were precoated with polylysine. 1st instar larvae were briefly rinsed in 1× PBS and then placed onto the slide such that the dorsal side of the larvae was facing up. Larvae were given 5–10 min to adjust to the slide prior to heart rate analyses. Slides were viewed using a Zeiss Axio Imager wide field epifluorescence microscope. Heart movement was captured using a Hamamatsu Orca ER monochrome cooled CCD camera with IEEE and MetaMorph software. Heart movement was captured in 5-s intervals with each animal recorded for a total of 15 s (three 5-s intervals). Files were subsequently played back, and the number of contractions was counted. Heart rate was calculated by dividing the number of contractions counted in one 5-s interval by 5 s, and the three 5-s intervals were subsequently averaged to obtain final heart rate for the animal. Statistical significance was determined using single factor analysis of variance analyses. ICP-MS—Larvae were collected in 1× PBS and then washed once with 1× PBS. Wash was removed, and larvae were homogenized in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA). 50 μg of total protein was sent for ICP-MS analysis at a final concentration of 1 μg of total protein per μl. Measurements were done in quadruplicate with the final data representing an average of the measurements. ICP-MS analysis was performed by Dr. Ted Huston, University of Michigan. Ctr1A Localizes to the Plasma Membrane and to Intracellular Vesicles—Earlier work established that the Drosophila Ctr1B copper transporter is inducibly expressed in response to copper deficiency, localizes to the plasma membrane, and has a physiologically important role in copper accumulation and in development under conditions of either copper limitation or copper excess. mRNA blotting experiments demonstrated that in contrast to Ctr1B, Ctr1A mRNA is expressed during all major stages of development and in adult flies (29Zhou H. Cadigan K.M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48210-48218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the relative contributions of Ctr1A and Ctr1B in copper acquisition and homeostasis in Drosophila, Ctr1A subcellular localization was examined in cultured Drosophila cells and in tissues from distinct developmental stages. An anti-Ctr1A peptide antibody was developed specific to a region between the first and second transmembrane domains, but which does not recognize Ctr1B or Ctr1C (Fig. 1A). To ascertain the specificity of the antibody for Ctr1A protein, an immunoblot was carried out using total protein extracts from wild type embryos (homozygous wild type for Ctr1A), deficiency heterozygote embryos possessing only one copy of the Ctr1A locus, and deficiency hemizygous embryos (Ctr1A is on the X chromosome) that had no copies of the Ctr1A locus and thus represents a Ctr1A null mutant. As shown in Fig. 1B, the anti-Ctr1A antibody predominantly recognizes three electrophoretic species of ∼37, ∼66, and ∼85 kDa. Given that Ctr1 proteins from yeast and mammals homotrimerize to form a functional, copper-transporting unit (10Lee J. Pena M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 11Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Sci. 2006; 31: 604-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these three species detected likely represent the monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of Ctr1A, respectively. Whereas the primary translation product of Ctr1A is predicted to have a mass of ∼25.6 kDa, Ctr1 from yeast and mammals is glycosylated, and this modification could explain the deviation from the Drosophila Ctr1A predicted electrophoretic mobility (13Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 37Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J.

J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The anti-Ctr1A antibody shows high specificity for Ctr1A; protein extracts from Ctr1A heterozygous embryos exhibit an approximately half-reduction in Ctr1A protein levels, and no protein bands were detected in the Ctr1A hemizygous mutant embryos. Additionally, peptide competition experiments on fixed, wild type Drosophila embryos demonstrate the specificity of the Ctr1A antibody; incubation of embryos in a primary mixture consisting of the anti-Ctr1A antibody and a peptide specific for Ctr1B does not affect localization or expression of Ctr1A (Fig. 1D, lower left panel), whereas a primary mixture consisting of the anti-Ctr1A antibody and a peptide specific for Ctr1A abolishes the detection of Ctr1A (Fig. 1D, lower right panel). Ctr1 proteins are predominantly localized to the plasma membrane in yeast and in some mammalian cells and tissues and have been shown in intestinal epithelial cells to localize to the apical membrane (22Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 25Nose Y. Kim B. Thiele D.J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In other cells and conditions, mammalian Ctr1 is found in intracellular vesicular compartments (38Klomp A.E.M. Tops B.B.J. Van Den Berg I.E.T. Berger R. Klomp L.W.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Ctr1A in cultured Drosophila S2 cells and in fly tissues was examined using the affinity-purified anti-Ctr1A antibody. In cultured S2 cells, Ctr1A was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C), and this localization was not altered by incubation of these cells in the presence of 400 μm copper (data not shown). Ctr1A localization was evaluated in whole embryos and 3rd instar larval salivary glands and found to co-localize with plasma membrane markers (Fig. 1D) in addition to showing punctate intracellular staining. Moreover, Ctr1A steady state protein levels were not responsive to a 24-h incubation with the Cu(I)-specific chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate, or with 100 μm copper (data not shown). One interesting observation is that in embryonic amnioserosal cells, a nonpolarized cell type Ctr1A co-localizes with neurotactin. However, in the embryonic epithelia, a polarized cell type Ctr1A does not co-localize with neurotactin, which is found at the basolateral membrane, but instead is preferentially localized to the apical membrane (arrow in Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Drosophila Ctr1A copper transporter, like Ctr1B (29Zhou H. Cadigan K.M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48210-48218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Selvaraj A. Balamurugan K. Yepiskoposyan H. Zhou H. Dieter E. Georgiev O. Thiele D.J. Schaffner W.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is largely localized to the plasma membrane. Ctr1A Is Essential for Drosophila Development—Ctr1A and Ctr1B are plasma membrane proteins that stimulate copper uptake when overexpressed in cultured Drosophila S2 cells and can substitute for loss of the high affinity copper uptake system in baker’s yeast (29Zhou H. Cadigan K.M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48210-48218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Flies lacking Ctr1B grow and develop normally but arrest at distinct developmental stages in response to both copper deprivation (1st instar larvae) and copper toxicity (pupae). Additional studies suggest that Ctr1B is the primary larval intestinal copper importer that functions on the apical membrane (41Balamurugan K. Egli D. Hua H. Rajaram R. Seisenbacher G. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whereas Ctr1B is strongly regulated at the level of transcription by copper availability and the MTF-1 transcription factor and clearly plays important roles in response to copper deprivation, little is known about the physiological role of Drosophila Ctr1A. We evaluated the consequences of specific loss of Ctr1A in Drosophila utilizing P-element-mediated imprecise-excision mutagenesis (30Cooley L. Kelley R. Spradling A. Science. 1988; 239: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Inverse PCR and sequence analysis demonstrated that the P-element insertion line G788 harbors a P-element inserted 90 bp into the first noncoding exon of the ctr1A gene (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A, one of the excision lines generated from the P-element mutagenesis, line 25, yielded a 5,148-bp deletion that removed most of the coding sequence of Ctr1A but left the upstream gene, CG3224, intact. PCR analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that CG3224 genomic integrity and mRNA expression levels were unaffected by the line 25 excision (data not shown). Analysis of the mutant line showed that hemizygous Ctr1A line 25 mutants, hereafter referred to as ctr1A25, arrest as either 1st instar larvae (∼40%) or as 2nd instar larvae (∼60%). Line 25 can be rescued both by a Y chromosome carrying a fragment of translocated X chromosome, which includes the Ctr1A locus, and by transgenic flies that express Ctr1A expressed under the control of the yeast GAL4 upstream-activating sequence promoter (data not shown). Rescue by the transgenic flies could occur without the use of a Gal4 driver line suggesting that low levels of Ctr1A protein, because of leaky expression from the upstream activating sequence promoter, are sufficient to restore viability to Ctr1A mutants. We have used line 25 as a loss-of-function mutation in Ctr1A for the experiments described here. As shown in Fig. 2B, immunoblot analyses of Ctr1A levels are consistent with the excision of Ctr1A in line 25. Ctr1A protein levels in embryonic lysates show ∼50% the level of Ctr1A protein in line 25 heterozygous embryos as compared with wild type embryos. Very low levels of Ctr1A are present in ctr1A25 hemizygous embryos, suggesting the possibility that Ctr1A may be maternally loaded in oocytes. Cuticle preparations of wild type 1st and 2nd instar larvae (Fig. 2C) demonstrate the strong pigmentation of mouth hook structures and spiracles because of the copper-dependent enzyme tyrosinase. In contrast, 1st and 2nd instar larvae from ctr1A25 hemizygotes (Fig. 2C) demonstrate significant pigmentation defects in these structures. Studies have shown that yeast Ctr1 mutant growth and viability on nonfermentable carbon sources can be rescued by adding exogenous copper to growth media, demonstrating that the growth phenotype is because of a copper deficiency (11Puig S.

https://openalex.org/W1964930922,"A mutagenic analysis of the amino acid residues His-104 and Cys-166, which are involved in the bi-covalent attachment of FAD to berberine bridge enzyme, was performed. Here we present a detailed biochemical characterization of the cysteine link to FAD observed in this recently discovered group of flavoproteins. The C166A mutant protein still has residual activity, but reduced to ∼6% of the turnover rate observed for wild-type berberine bridge enzyme. A more detailed analysis of single reaction steps by stopped-flow spectrophotometry showed that the reductive half-reaction is greatly influenced by the lack of the 6-S-cysteinyl linkage, resulting in a 370-fold decrease in the rate of flavin reduction. Determination of the redox potentials for both wild type and the C166A mutein revealed that the difference in the redox potential observed can fully account for the change in the kinetic properties. The wild-type protein exhibits a midpoint potential of +132 mV, which is the highest redox potential determined for any flavoenzyme so far. Removal of the cysteine linkage to FAD in the C166A mutein leads to a redox potential of +53 mV, which is in the expected range for flavoproteins with a single covalent attachment of FAD to a His residue via its 8-α position. We also show that the biochemical properties of the mutein resemble that of typical flavoprotein oxidases and that deviations from this behavior observed for the wild type are due to the FAD-6-S-cysteinyl bond. In addition, rapid reaction stopped-flow experiments give no indication for a radical mechanism supporting the direct transfer of a hydride from the substrate to the cofactor.

Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) 2The abbreviations used are: BBE, berberine bridge enzyme ((S)-reticuline: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.21.3.3); MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. 2The abbreviations used are: BBE, berberine bridge enzyme ((S)-reticuline: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.21.3.3); MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. (EC 1.21.3.3) is a central enzyme of alkaloid biosynthesis in plant species capable of producing protopine, protoberberine, and benzophenanthridine alkaloids. Because of the challenging chemical reaction it catalyzes and its involvement in the production of pharmaceutically important chemicals, it has long been of interest to get a detailed understanding of the processes occurring at the molecular level (1Dittrich H.

However, an in-depth biochemical characterization was limited for a long time by the rather low amount of protein available from expression in plant and insect cell cultures. Recently, we have developed an expression system in Pichia pastoris that enabled us to obtain sufficient quantities of purified BBE from Eschscholzia californica, allowing a more detailed characterization. In the course of these studies it was discovered that BBE belongs to a novel group of flavoproteins containing a bi-covalently attached flavin cofactor (3Alexeev I. Sultana A. Maöntsaölaö P. Niemi J.

In addition, sequence alignments reveal that several other proteins reported to possess an 8-α-histidyl bond have the Cys residue involved in binding to position 6 of the cofactor conserved, e.g. Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase from Cannabis sativa (8Sirikantaramas S.

Most of these enzymes with a confirmed or proposed bi-covalently attached flavin have a function in specialized metabolic pathways and catalyze reactions with rather challenging chemistry or substrates. The occurrence of this bi-covalent FAD attachment raises the question of its role in enzyme catalysis. Several explanations for the occurrence of covalent flavinylation have been given for different enzymes, ranging from prevention of cofactor modification in the case of trimethylamine dehydrogenase (4Huang C-H.

In addition to this variety of explanations for the existence of a covalent linkage, the situation is further complicated by the occurrence of covalent flavoenzymes having isoenzymes bearing a dissociable cofactor but still exhibiting a similar kinetic behavior (13Gadda G. Wels G. Pollegioni L. Zucchelli S. Ambrosius D. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This clearly shows that the explanations for the covalent attachment of flavins to proteins might be manifold and very much depend on the enzyme and the environment where it occurs in nature. As far as bi-covalently flavinylated enzymes are concerned, so far no studies addressing the importance of this type of linkage have been performed. To provide answers to these issues, we have mutated the residues involved in generation of the bi-covalent linkage of FAD to BBE and have studied the influence on the spectral and kinetic parameters as well as the redox potential. Here, we demonstrate that the 6-S-cysteinyl bond is responsible for the atypical behavior of wild-type BBE compared with other related flavoprotein oxidases (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that this linkage modulates the flavin redox potential, strongly affecting the rate of flavin reduction in the oxidation of the substrate (S)-reticuline. Reagents and Enzymes—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified oligos were obtained from VBC-Biotech, and the QuikChange® XL kit for site-directed mutagenesis was from Stratagene. Milk xanthine oxidase was of Grade I purity and purchased from Sigma. Thymolindophenol was from TCI Europe. (S)-Reticuline was from the natural product collection of the Department of Natural Product Biotechnology of the Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Halle/Saale, Germany. Sequencing grade modified trypsin for MALDI mass spectrometry sample preparation was from Promega. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and of the highest quality available. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was carried out directly with the expression vector pPICZα BBE-ER described in Ref. 7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar in order to remove the sites of covalent linkage for FAD (His-104 and Cys-166). Replacement of His-104 was accomplished using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides 5′-GATTAAGAAGTGGTGGTXXXAGTTATGAAGGATTATCTTAC-3′ (sense) and the complementary antisense primer where XXX substitutes the replaced codon CAT with either GCT (H104A) or ACT (H104T). The second site of covalent attachment was replaced with an alanine using the primer pair 5′-TTACGGCTGGTTGGGCTCCAACCGTTGGTACTGG-3′ and its complementary oligonucleotide. The underlined nucleotides represent the mutated codon replacing TGT (C166A). Mutagenesis was carried out as described in the QuikChange® XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the introduction of the correct mutation verified by plasmid sequencing. Generation of the double mutant (H104T,C166A) was accomplished using the same procedure described above with pPICZα BBE-ER C166A as the template for polymerase chain reaction and the primer pair described for the H104T mutant. Transformation, Expression, and Purification—All four mutated vectors were transformed into the P. pastoris strain KM71H, generating transformants that, after verification of vector integration into the Pichia genome by colony polymerase chain reaction, were then used for expression of the muteins. All experiments, including scale up from small scale expression trials to the final protein production in a BBI-CT5-2 fermenter and the two-step purification procedure using a hydrophobic interaction chromatography step followed by gel filtration, were performed as described for the wild-type enzyme (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Analytical Experiments—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out with 12.5% separating gels and 5% stacking gels as described by Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). In-gel fluorescence for detection of covalently bound flavin was performed after fixing the gel in 5% (v/v) acetic acid for 5 min (16Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by visualization in a standard UV-transillumination chamber at 302 nm. Staining of gels was conducted with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to verify expression of the correct muteins essentially as described previously (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Specord 205 spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena) using 1-cm quartz cuvettes. All measurements were performed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. The extinction coefficient of covalently bound FAD was estimated by unfolding the enzyme with 0.5% (w/v) SDS and comparing the obtained flavin spectrum with that of free FAD in the case of the C166A mutein. Anaerobic Photoreduction—Photoreduction was carried out as outlined in a previous study (17Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, special quartz cuvettes were rendered anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. EDTA and 5-deazariboflavin were stored in the side arm of the cuvette during this process and illuminated for 5 min prior to mixing with the enzyme solution (final concentrations 1 mm and 1 μm, respectively). A conventional slide projector was used for photoirradiation of the sample, which was cooled to 15 °C during this process. All spectra monitoring the progress of reduction were measured at the same temperature. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—To compare steady-state turnover rates of the mutein with wild-type BBE, the conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine was followed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the reaction mixture as described previously (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the case of BBE-ER C166A, the assay mixture consisted of 98 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 1 μl of 10 mm (S)-reticuline in methanol, and 1 μl of C166A mutein (1.95 μm), resulting in a final substrate concentration that is ∼30 times the reported Km for (S)-reticuline in the case of wild-type BBE. Transient Kinetics—Reductive half-reactions were analyzed with a stopped-flow device from Hi-Tech (SF-61DX2) positioned in a glove box from Belle Technology. Changes in flavin absorbance were either followed with a KinetaScanT diode array detector (MG-6560) or a PM-61s photomultiplier in the case of single wavelength kinetic traces. All concentrations stated in this context are final values after mixing in the flow cell. Samples were rendered anaerobic by flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen followed by incubation in the glove box environment of ∼0.8 ppm oxygen. Apparent rate constants for the reductive half-reaction were measured at five different concentrations of (S)-reticuline for an accurate estimation of the maximal rate of flavin reduction. Fitting of the obtained transients at 445 nm was performed with SpecFit 32 (Spectrum Software Associates) using a function of two exponentials. Rates for the oxidative half-reaction were measured by mixing substrate-reduced enzyme solution with air-saturated buffer (21% oxygen). Lag phases in the reoxidation process were prevented by using substoichiometric amounts of (S)-reticuline for the reduction of enzyme-bound flavin. Redox Potentials—Determination of the redox potential was carried out by the dye-equilibration method using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase electron delivering system as described by Massey (18Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. 1991: 59-66Google Scholar). Concentrations of protein and redox indicator were chosen so that the absorbance changes at the wavelength employed for interpretation of the data were roughly in the same absorbance range. Reactions were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C containing benzyl viologen (5 μm) as a mediator, 250 μm xanthine, and xanthine oxidase in catalytic amounts (1-8 nm). A typical reduction lasted for ∼60 min in order to ensure equilibration between dye and protein. For maintaining anaerobic conditions throughout the experiment, the reduction was carried out in a stopped-flow device (SF-61DX2, Hi-Tech) positioned in an anaerobic glove box (∼0.8 ppm oxygen; Belle Technology) after rendering all solutions anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with nitrogen. Spectra during the course of reduction were recorded with a KinetaScanT diode array detector (MG-6560) from Hi-Tech. Dyes used for analysis and their corresponding redox potentials were 2,6-dichloro indophenol (Em = +217 mV), thymolindophenol (EM = +174 mV), methemoglobin (from beef, EM = ∼+144 mV at I = 0.2 m), toluylene blue (EM = +115 mV), thionin acetate (EM = +64 mV), and toluidine blue (EM = +34 mV). The reduction oxidation potentials were calculated from plots of log([ox]/[red]) of BBE or the C166A mutant protein versus log([ox]/[red]) of the dye according to Minnaert (19Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of BBE Muteins—All variants of BBE generated by site-directed mutagenesis were expressed exactly in the same way as wild-type BBE. However, only the C166A mutein could be detected in the fermentation supernatant in similar amounts as reported for the wild-type protein (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All muteins in which His-104, which is involved in covalently linking FAD via its 8-α-methyl group, is exchanged are expressed in very low levels. Therefore, the H104A and H104T single and H104T,C166A double mutants could not be isolated in amounts necessary for a basic biochemical characterization. Concentrated fermentation supernatants did not show any significant difference with respect to the negative control on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. It was only after tryptic in-gel digestion of gel pieces from the expected region of BBE muteins on SDS gels that the strongest peptide signals from a typical BBE digest could be observed (results not shown). The very low expression level already detected in small scale expression trials could not be increased by scaling up to a fermenter. General Properties—The C166A mutein could be purified according to the protocol established for wild-type BBE (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After applying the two-step purification procedure a bright yellow protein sample was obtained. Because wild-type BBE binds FAD in a bi-covalent manner via its His-104 and Cys-166 residues, it was expected that the C166A mutant protein still binds FAD covalently. To test this assumption, the protein sample was precipitated with 13% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, and after centrifugation no free flavin was detected in the supernatant, indicating a covalent linkage between cofactor and protein. In addition, in-gel fluorescence of unstained SDS gels soaked in 5% (v/v) acetic acid showed that the flavin emission co-migrates with the protein band of C166A, verifying the covalent linkage. Loading the same amount of wild type and C166A mutant protein indicates that the flavin cofactor of the mutein exhibits stronger fluorescence intensity, which would be expected for the removal of the FAD 6-S-cysteinyl bond (20Steenkamp D.J. McIntire W. Kenney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2818-2824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral Data—A comparison of the spectral properties of the covalently attached flavin cofactors is shown in Fig. 1. In its native form the mutein already shows a significant difference compared with the wild type. Whereas the changes around the 450 nm absorption maximum only involve a more detailed fine-structuring of the peak, the absorption at 370 nm changes substantially to a broad maximum ranging from 350-370 nm. Comparison of the denatured spectra reveals a remarkable difference in both absorption maxima. Whereas the spectral characteristics of denatured wild-type BBE already indicate the modification of the flavin in its C6 position, these influences are completely absent in the C166A mutant. For the mutein, the spectral properties after denaturation resemble more that of free FAD (∼450 nm absorption) and the strong hypsochromic shift in the second absorption band (∼350 nm) is indicative for an 8-α-modification of the flavin cofactor (21Singer T.P. Edmondson D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In combination with the verification that C166A contains a covalently attached FAD cofactor, this clearly demonstrates that the bi-covalent linkage via His-104 and Cys-166 observed in wild-type BBE has been replaced by a single amino acid linkage involving His-104 and the 8-α-methyl group of FAD. In addition, MALDI mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments obtained from C166A BBE digestion shows that the peptide harboring Ala-166 can be identified without any modification. Assuming that the absorption coefficient of the unfolded enzyme is comparable with that of free FAD, the extinction coefficient for native C166A mutein can be estimated to 11,700 m-1 cm-1 at 444 nm. Kinetic Characterization—The steady-state turnover rate for C166A BBE was determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of substrate conversion as reported for wild-type enzyme (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A kcat of 0.48 ± 0.05 s-1 was determined for the mutein under identical reaction conditions as used for determination of the wild-type turnover rate. Comparison of the turnover rates shows that the mutein retains ∼6% of the wild-type activity. In the following experiments the catalytic properties were addressed in more detail to allow determination of the reaction step responsible for the deterioration in enzymatic turnover. For the majority of flavoprotein oxidases the rate-limiting step is the reductive half-reaction. To determine whether this step is affected by the introduced mutation, the reductive rates for both wild-type and C166A BBE were measured. Both enzymes were mixed with various concentrations of substrate (S)-reticuline under anaerobic conditions, and the reduction of the cofactor was followed at 445 nm. The obtained transients had a biphasic characteristic consisting of a substrate-dependent fast phase and a second phase that did not correlate with the substrate concentration and could not be assigned to a specific process. A plot of the concentration-dependent phase as a function of (S)-reticuline concentration yields a hyperbolic dependence for both wild-type and mutant protein (Fig. 2). At substrate saturating conditions a limiting reductive rate for wild-type BBE of 103 ± 4s-1 is observed. This is >360-fold faster than for the C166A mutein with 0.28 ± 0.02 s-1. The Kd value is only slightly affected and changes from 8.7 ± 0.8 μm for the wild type to 17 ± 3 μm for the mutein. In comparison with data obtained from steady-state experiments this shows that for the wild-type enzyme another step in catalysis must be responsible for slowing down the overall turnover rate. However, for the C166A mutein the rate of the reductive half-reaction is in the range of the rate-limiting step in enzyme turnover. Characterization of the spectral changes accompanying the reduction of the cofactor by the substrate revealed no indication of a radical species. As depicted in Fig. 3A, the flavin of wild-type BBE is directly converted to its dihydro-reduced form, exhibiting a broad absorption maximum ∼400 nm. Also, the C166A mutein is reduced without detection of radical intermediates to a species with the absorption maximum shifted to ∼365 nm (Fig. 3B). After reduction of the cofactor by the substrate, the flavin is regenerated by reaction with molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and the reoxidation of FAD. The oxidative half-reaction was studied at a single oxygen concentration (10.5% O2, 122 μm O2) for both wild-type and mutant protein. Regeneration of oxidized FAD was monophasic with observed rates for wild-type and C166A BBE of (0.5 ± 0.1) × 105 and (1.0 ± 0.1) × 105 m-1 s-1, respectively. These are in the range of values obtained for other flavoprotein oxidases (22Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Using an oxygen concentration of ∼200 μm (the approximate concentration of oxygen at 37 °C), the observed rate for reoxidation of reduced FAD amounts to 10 ± 2s-1, and therefore it can be concluded that in the case of wild-type BBE the oxidative half-reaction is the rate-limiting step in catalysis (kcat = 8.2 s-1) (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Photoreduction—Reduction of wild-type BBE by light in the presence of EDTA and 5-deazariboflavin followed by reoxidation resulted in a rather atypical reoxidized flavin spectrum that was attributed to the 6-S-cysteinyl link between FAD and Cys-166 (7Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm this interpretation, the C166A mutant was treated in exactly the same way that resulted in spectral changes depicted in Fig. 4. Light illumination leads to the formation of the red anionic semiquinone followed by full reduction, as observed for the wild-type protein. However, upon admission of oxygen virtually the same spectrum as at the beginning of the experiment was regenerated, further substantiating that the unexpected changes for the wild type are indeed based on the cleavage of the 6-S-cysteinyl bond. Redox Potential Determination—To assess the effect of the covalent modification by Cys-166, the redox potential of the FAD was determined for both wild-type and the C166A mutant protein. Reduction was achieved by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system in the presence of suitable redox indicators. For the wild-type enzyme a direct two-electron reduction process could be observed in the presence of toluylene blue (EM =+115 mV). Plotting log(BBEox/BBEred) versus log(dyeox/dyered) as described by Minnaert (19Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allowed the estimation of the redox potential to 132 ± 4 mV (Fig. 5A). The obtained value was verified using beef methemoglobin as indicator (at ionic strength 0.2 m, EM =∼144 mV for the homologue from horse) (23Taylor J.F. Morgan V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 144: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), which also resulted in parallel reduction of both proteins and yielded a similar potential (∼135 mV). This unusually high redox potential was further verified by obtaining the higher and lower limits for the potential of wild-type BBE using the dyes 2,6-dichloro indophenol (EM =+217 mV) and thionin acetate (EM =+64 mV), which were reduced before and after the enzyme cofactor, respectively. For the C166A mutant protein the potential was determined to 53 ± 2 mV after reduction in the presence of thionine acetate. As depicted in Fig. 5B, the spectral changes observed again represent a simultaneous two-electron transfer to the flavin. The same redox potential was obtained after performing the experiment in the presence of toluidine blue (EM =+34 mV). The slopes for the two linear fits in the insets of Fig. 5 are 0.92 and 0.99 for wild-type BBE and mutein, respectively, which is close to the theoretical value of 1 expected for a simultaneous two-electron transfer and indicates that the reaction was in equilibrium. BBE is a member of the recently discovered group of bi-covalently flavinylated enzymes, and so far it is the only protein characterized in detail with respect to its biochemical properties in relation to other flavoprotein oxidases. To gain further insight into the role of bi-covalent linkage of the cofactor, via a 6-S-cysteinyl and an 8-α-histidyl bond, we have addressed the issue by site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues involved in the covalent attachment. Replacement of His-104, which is the residue forming a covalent bond with the 8-α-methyl group of FAD, by either Ala or Thr did not allow the isolation of mutein forms of BBE. In both cases only traces of the protein could be detected in the fermentation supernatant, preventing even a basic characterization with respect to the spectral and kinetic properties. This observation was rather unexpected because for related flavoproteins like vannilyl alcohol oxidase, where FAD is also linked via its 8-α-methyl group to a His of the protein, the removal of the covalent bond resulted in the expression of protein with a dissociable cofactor (11Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H. van Berkel W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2082503272,"Aβ42-lowering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) constitute the founding members of a new class of γ-secretase modulators that avoid side effects of pan-γ-secretase inhibitors on NOTCH processing and function, holding promise as potential disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer disease (AD). These modulators are active in cell-free γ-secretase assays indicating that they directly target the γ-secretase complex. Additional support for this hypothesis was provided by the observation that certain mutations in presenilin-1 (PS1) associated with early-onset familial AD (FAD) change the cellular drug response to Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs. Of particular interest is the PS1-ΔExon9 mutation, which provokes a pathogenic increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and dramatically reduces the cellular response to the Aβ42-lowering NSAID sulindac sulfide. This FAD PS1 mutant is unusual as a splice-site mutation results in deletion of amino acids Thr291–Ser319 including the endoproteolytic cleavage site of PS1, and an additional amino acid exchange (S290C) at the exon 8/10 splice junction. By genetic dissection of the PS1-ΔExon9 mutation, we now demonstrate that a synergistic effect of the S290C mutation and the lack of endoproteolytic cleavage is sufficient to elevate the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and that the attenuated response to sulindac sulfide results partially from the deficiency in endoproteolysis. Importantly, a wider screen revealed that a diminished response to Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs is common among aggressive FAD PS1 mutations. Surprisingly, these mutations were also partially unresponsive to γ-secretase inhibitors of different structural classes. This was confirmed in a mouse model with transgenic expression of the PS1-L166P mutation, in which the potent γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 failed to reduce brain levels of soluble Aβ42. In summary, these findings highlight the importance of genetic background in drug discovery efforts aimed at γ-secretase, suggesting that certain AD mouse models harboring aggressive PS mutations may not be informative in assessing in vivo effects of γ-secretase modulators and inhibitors.

Ongoing efforts to develop disease-modifying therapies mainly aim to block production, to hinder aggregation, or to enhance clearance of Aβ peptides (3Citron M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Because Aβ peptides are generated through sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase, these aspartyl proteases are prime drug targets for pharmacological intervention in AD. γ-Secretase is a multiprotein complex consisting of four essential proteins, presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, Pen-2; the PS proteins seem to harbor the active site of the enzyme (4Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7931-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For γ-secretase, a large number of highly potent inhibitors have been developed, and few have been evaluated in phase I clinical trials (5Beher D. Graham S.L. Expert Opin. Investig.

However, preclinical studies have also revealed substantial mechanism-based toxicity, which can be largely attributed to disruption of processing and function of the γ-secretase substrate NOTCH (5Beher D.

More recently, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ibuprofen and sulindac sulfide were shown to selectively lower production of the highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide (7Beher D.

These compounds induce a shift in γ-secretase activity and concomitantly increase shorter Aβ species such as Aβ38, but they spare processing and function of other γ-secretase substrates including NOTCH (7Beher D.

Although these findings suggested a novel explanation for epidemiological observations that chronic intake of NSAIDs lowers the risk of developing AD (12Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A.

Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), the more significant implication seems to be that these compounds have originated a new class of γ-secretase modulators that could provide a safer alternative to conventional γ-secretase inhibitors (7Beher D.

Weggen S. Neurodegen. Dis. 2006; 3: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). First, similar to pan-γ-secretase inhibitors, Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs are active in cell-free γ-secretase assays (7Beher D. Clarke E.E. Wrigley J.D. Martin A.C. Nadin A. Churcher I. Shearman M.S. J.

Second, studies using fluorescence lifetime imaging have provided indirect evidence that Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs change the conformation of PS1 (17Lleo A. Berezovska O. Herl L. Raju S. Deng A. Bacskai B.J. Frosch M.P. Irizarry M. Hyman B.T. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Finally, some familial early-onset AD (FAD) PS1 mutations, which induce a pathogenic increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, have been shown to modulate the response of cultured cells to Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs (16Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this respect, overexpression of the PS1-M146L mutation profoundly enhances Aβ42 reduction after sulindac sulfide and ibuprofen treatment as compared with wild type PS1. Intriguingly, the exact opposite is observed with the PS1-ΔExon9 mutation, which strongly diminishes Aβ42 reductions after sulindac sulfide treatment (16Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Remarkably similar findings have been reported with the well characterized transition-state γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (18Ikeuchi T. Dolios G. Kim S.H. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7010-7018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ability of L-685,458 to reduce Aβ production from cells expressing PS1-ΔExon9 is also substantially attenuated as compared with wild type PS1, and this effect is even more pronounced for Aβ42 levels with a maximal reduction of 50% at high inhibitor concentrations (18Ikeuchi T. Dolios G. Kim S.H. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7010-7018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the structural or mechanistic basis for these observations has not been determined. The PS1-ΔExon9 mutant is unusual as a splice-site mutation results in deletion of a whole exon comprising amino acids Thr291–Ser319 and an amino acid exchange (S290C) at the exon 8/10 splice junction, whereas virtually all other FAD PS1 mutations are point mutations (19Perez-Tur J. Froelich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F. Roques P. Fuldner R.A. Johnston J. Cowburn R. Forsell C. Axelman K. Lilius L. Houlden H. Karran E. Roberts G.W. Rossor M. Adams M.D. Hardy J. Goate A. Lannfeld L. Hutton M. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in cultured cells suggest that the S290C mutation rather than the deletion Δ291–319 meditates the pathogenic increase in Aβ42 production, as overexpression of PS1 harboring only the Δ291–319 deletion results in normal Aβ42 production (20Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7615-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Δ291–319 region further includes the endoproteolytic cleavage site of PS1 and the PS1-ΔExon9 mutant accumulates as full-length protein (21Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The site of endoproteolysis was originally mapped to amino acids Thr291–Ala299 (22Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H. Seubert P. St George-Hyslop P. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but further analysis has demonstrated that a single point mutation at position 292 (M292D) prevents endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (23Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By genetic analysis of the PS1-ΔExon9 mutation, we now show that the attenuated response to the Aβ42-lowering NSAID sulindac sulfide is partially because of the lack of endoproteolytic cleavage. A strongly diminished response to sulindac sulfide was also observed with several aggressive FAD PS1 point mutations. This behavior further extended to γ-secretase inhibitors of different structural classes and to a mouse model with transgenic expression of the PS1-L166P mutation, in which the potent γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 failed to reduce brain Aβ42 levels. Importantly, these findings indicate that the genetic background of cell lines and animal models is critical to the accurate evaluation of the potency and efficacy of γ-secretase modulators and inhibitors. Drugs and Antibodies—The NSAID sulindac sulfide was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), γ-secretase inhibitors L-685,458 and DAPT were from Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, UK), and γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 was synthesized by standard chemical techniques as described (47Audia J.E.

All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich except when otherwise indicated.

Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated versions of monoclonal antibody 6E10 recognizing amino acids 1–17 of the human Aβ sequence were purchased from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA). cDNAs Constructs—cDNAs encoding mutants PS1-S290C, PS1-M292D, PS1-G384A, PS1-S290C/M292D, and PS1-M292D/M146L were generated with a two-step PCR mutagenesis strategy using the wild type human PS1 cDNA as template. The final PCR products were gel-purified, digested with XhoI and NotI, and cloned into the pLPCX retroviral shuttle plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The constructs encoding PS1-P117L, PS1-L166P, and PS1-Δ291–319 were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using plasmids pLPCX-PS1wt and pLPCX-PS1ΔExon9 as templates. Information about PCR primers and conditions is available upon request. All constructs were sequenced to verify successful mutagenesis. Generation of Retroviral Vectors—For generation of pseudotyped retroviral vectors, GP2-293 packaging cells (Clontech) were transiently co-transfected with retroviral shuttle plasmids and plasmid encoding VSV-G envelope glycoprotein at a 1:1 ratio using Genejuice transfection reagent (Merck Biosciences). The medium was changed 48 h after transfection. Retroviral particles were collected for another 24 h and stored at −80 °C. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells with stable overexpression of wild type human APP751 (APP CHO cells) have been described previously (16Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A.

APP CHO cells were infected with retroviral vectors encoding PS1-S290C, PS1-M292D, PS1-P117L, PS1-L166P, PS1-G384A, PS1-Δ291–319, PS1-S290C/M292D, and PS1-M292D/M146L in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. Medium was changed, and after an additional 24 h in culture selection of cells with 3 μg/ml puromycin was initiated. Stable pools were analyzed in further experiments except for PS1-Δ291–319. For this cell line, the mass culture was subjected to subcloning, and three independent clones with high expression were pooled. APP CHO cell lines with stable expression of wild type PS1 or PS1-ΔExon9 have been described previously (16Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium-pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Comparable PS1 and APP expression in all cell lines was verified by Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and total protein was separated on 10% bis-Tris gels and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies PSN2 or CT-15. Dose-Response Experiments and Statistical Analysis—Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion of individual cell lines after sulindac sulfide or γ-secretase inhibitor treatments were compared in dose-response experiments. All cell lines intended for comparison were cultured and treated in parallel at similar cell densities. Cells were cultured in serum-containing medium and treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of the NSAID sulindac sulfide, γ-secretase inhibitors or Me2SO vehicle. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in conditioned media were then analyzed by Aβ liquid phase electrochemiluminescence assay. Duplicate measurements from each drug concentration were averaged and normalized to Me2SO control condition. These experiments were repeated 3–5 times, and results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post tests and drug concentration as categorical variable. For calculation of EC50 values, cells were treated with 10 increasing concentrations of LY-411575, and sigmoidal curve-fit with variable slope was applied. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Aβ Liquid Phase Electrochemiluminescence Assay (LPECL)—Aβ levels were analyzed by LPECL assay. The biotinylated Aβ-specific antibody 6E10 was used as capture antibody. The C-terminal-specific Aβ antibodies BAP24 and BAP15 were generated as described previously (25Brockhaus M. Grunberg J. Rohrig S. Loetscher H. Wittenburg N. Baumeister R. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and labeled with TAG electrochemiluminescent label according to the manufacturers protocol (Bioveris, Gaithersburg, MD). Labeled antibodies were purified from unincorporated label using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and stored in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% sodium azide at −80 °C. Culture media were collected following conditioning for 24 h, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) was added, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C until quantification by LPECL. Before use, M-280 paramagnetic beads (Invitrogen) were diluted with assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 60 mm NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). For detection of Aβ peptides, conditioned media (10 μl for Aβ40 and 50 μl for Aβ42) were incubated with 50 μl of beads and 25 μl of each labeled antibodies 6E10-bio and BAP24-TAG (for Aβ40) or BAP15-TAG (for Aβ42). Incubation was performed in a final volume of 250 μl for 3 h with gentle shaking. Synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) were used to generate standard curves. These Aβ peptides were solubilized in Me2SO at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, aliquoted, and stored frozen at −80 °C. Immediately before use, peptides were diluted in culture media to 16–2000 pg/ml. Electrochemiluminescence was quantified using an M-Series M8 analyzer (Bioveris). Animals and Dosing—Tg2576 mice expressing “Swedish” mutant APP (KM670/671NL) under the prion protein promoter (26Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F.S. Cole G.

APPPS1 double-transgenic mice expressing Swedish mutant APP and human PS1-L166P under the control of a neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter element have been described (27Radde R. Bolmont T. Kaeser S.A.

Five-month-old Tg2576 mice or 2-month-old APPPS1 mice were orally dosed with 10 mg/kg γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 dissolved in 0.5% tylose or vehicle alone. Mice were sacrificed 3 h post-administration, and brains were homogenized in Tris buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. After centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g, soluble Aβ42 levels in the supernatant were quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercial kits from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determination of soluble Aβ40 levels, monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Sigma) was employed as capture antibody and combined with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled Aβ40-specific detection antibody. All animal studies were performed according to German animal welfare law. Genetic Dissection of the PS1-ΔExon9 Mutation—The PS1-ΔExon9 mutation has been shown to dramatically attenuate the response of cells to the Aβ42-lowering NSAID sulindac sulfide (16Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), but the structural basis of this effect is unknown. We reasoned that three different scenarios could explain the attenuated response and generated mutant PS1 cDNAs representing individual features of the complex PS1-ΔExon9 mutation (Fig. 1). (i) The attenuated Aβ42 response could be caused by the lack of endoproteolytic cleavage of the PS1-ΔExon9 mutation. To investigate this possibility, we introduced the M292D point mutation into the wild type PS1 (PS1-WT) cDNA (Fig. 1). This mutant was previously reported not to undergo endoproteolytic cleavage but was otherwise fully functional in γ-secretase cleavage and displayed a normal Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (23Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). (ii) The attenuated Aβ42 response could be specifically associated with the S290C mutation. To examine this possibility, we generated a PS1 cDNA containing the S290C point mutation (Fig. 1). (iii) The attenuated Aβ42 response could reside in the Δ291–319 deletion or its conformational effects on regions flanking exon 9. To test this idea, we mutagenized the cysteine at position 290 in the PS1-ΔExon9 cDNA to a serine, thereby correcting the S290C point mutation (PS1-Δ291–319; Fig. 1). Subsequently, CHO cells overexpressing wild type APP751 (APP CHO cells) were infected with retroviral vectors for each mutant, and stable pools were selected and used for all further investigations. Previously described cell lines with stable expression of PS1-WT and PS1-ΔExon9 were employed as controls (16Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The Pathogenic Increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 Ratio Induced by PS1-ΔExon9 Is Caused by a Synergistic Effect of the S290C Point Mutation and the Lack of Endoproteolytic Cleavage—Stable expression of the PS1 constructs in APP CHO cells was verified using the human-specific monoclonal antibody PSN2 (Fig. 2A). As expected, three of the mutant proteins, PS1-ΔExon9, PS1-Δ291–319, and PS1-M292D, failed to undergo endoproteolytic cleavage, and only full-length PS1 was detected. In contrast, PS1-WT and PS1-S290C showed endoproteolytic cleavage with detection of full-length protein and the N-terminal fragment of PS1 (PS1-NTF) (Fig. 2A). We then measured the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in conditioned media of the stable cell pools to determine the cause for the pathogenic increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio associated with the PS1-ΔExon9 mutant. In a previous study, stable overexpression of PS1-Δ291–319 in HEK293 cells had failed to change the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio as compared with PS1-WT (20Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7615-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This suggested that the increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio of PS1-ΔExon9 might result from the S290C point mutation rather than from the Δ291–319 deletion or the lack of endoproteolytic cleavage. APP CHO cells with stable overexpression of PS1-ΔExon9 demonstrated a robust 3-fold increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio as compared with PS1-WT control cells, PS1-Δ291–319 cells, or PS1-M292D cells as expected (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, cells expressing PS1-S290C likewise displayed an unchanged Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio as confirmed in three independently generated mass cultures (Fig. 2B). Bec"

Recent biochemical studies have shown that LKB1 activates 14 AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinases including MARKs (microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases) that regulate microtubule dynamics. Here we show in vitro that LKB1 phosphorylates and activates MARK2, which in turn phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein Tau at the KXGS motif and suppresses tubulin polymerization. In cells, forced expression of LKB1 suppresses microtubule regrowth, whereas LKB1 knockdown accelerates it. We further show that the phosphorylation of Tau by the LKB1-MARK signaling triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of Tau. These results indicate that LKB1 is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics through the activation of MARKs.

Phenotypes in Lkb1 knock-out mice further support that LKB1 is a tumor suppressor gene. Specifically, Lkb1+/- mice develop gastrointestinal hamartomas after >20 weeks of age and hepatocellular carcinomas after >50 weeks (7Miyoshi H. Nakau M. Ishikawa T. Seldin M.F. Oshima M. Taketo M.M.

In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, the LKB1 orthologs par-4 and lkb1, respectively, regulate cell polarity (11Kemphues K.J. Priess J.R. Morton D.G. Cheng N. Cell. 1988; 52: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 12Martin S.G. St Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Also in mammalian cells, the LKB1 activity can induce complete cell polarization (13Baas A.F. Kuipers J. van der Wel N.N. Batlle E. Koerten H.K. Peters P.J. Clevers H.C. Cell. 2004; 116: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), suggesting the evolutionary conservation of its role in cell polarity. The molecular mechanism(s) by which LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor and controls cell polarity is poorly understood. However, recent biochemical studies have provided important clues to the mode of action of LKB1. First, full activation of LKB1 requires two accessory subunits, STE20-related adaptor pseudokinase (STRAD) 3The abbreviations used are: STRAD, STE20-related adaptor pseudokinase; Adv, adenovirus; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; KD, kinase-dead type; MARK, microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MT, microtubule; WT, wild-type; TA, T208A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and scaffolding protein MO25 (14Baas A.F.

Second, this complex activates two AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPKs; AMPKα1 and AMPKα2) by phosphorylating the LXT motif in the activation loop (16Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J.

Furthermore, in silico search of human kinome has revealed that other 14 serine/threonine kinases have the LXT motif in the activation loop (5Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 18Lizcano J.M. Goöransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Maökelaö T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In fact, LKB1 does activate 12 of them (MARK1, MARK2, MARK3, MARK4, NUAK1, NUAK2, SAD-A, SAD-B, SIK, SNRK, QIK, and QSK) in addition to two AMPKs (5Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 6 of 14 kinases possibly downstream of LKB1, namely MARK1/2/3/4 and SAD-A/B, have been reported to regulate microtubule (MT) dynamics through phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs; Tau, MAP2, and MAP4) at the conserved KXGS motifs that face the microtubule lattice (20Drewes G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 548-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R.

Dis. 2006; 3: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the other eight downstream kinases affect MT dynamics. The phosphorylation of KXGS motifs reduces the activity of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that stabilize MTs, presumably by weakening the electrostatic interaction between MAPs and MTs (20Drewes G.

Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of D. melanogaster have suggested that Drosophila lkb1 has a functional link to the Drosophila MARK ortholog par-1 that regulates MT dynamics and cell polarity (12Martin S.G. St Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Shulman J.M. Benton R. St Johnston D.

Development. 2003; 130: 3965-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, the genetic studies in C. elegans have revealed that the MARK ortholog par-1, in addition to the LKB1 ortholog par-4, is essential for cell polarization (11Kemphues K.J. Priess J.R. Morton D.G. Cheng N. Cell. 1988; 52: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Despite such circumstantial evidence, roles of LKB1 in MT dynamics have remained elusive. Here we provide both biochemical and cell biological evidence that LKB1 regulates MT dynamics through MARK, especially MARK2 that has been the best characterized in the MT-dependent cellular processes including establishment of cell polarity (26Boöhm H.

Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by Adeno-X Expression System 1 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The titers of the recombinant adenoviruses were determined by the method previously reported by others (37Sandig V. Youil R. Bett A.J. Franlin L.L. Oshima M. Maione D. Wang F. Metzker M.L. Savino R. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Every recombinant adenovirus was infected at a multiplicity between 25 and 50 plaque-forming units/cell. Production of Recombinant MARK2 Proteins in Escherichia coli—To attach GST protein to the amino terminus of MARK2 (wild type (WT)/TA), the SalI/NotI fragment of the full-length cDNA encoding the wild-type or mutant MARK2 (TA) was inserted in the SalI/NotI-digested pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). One liter of LB medium was inoculated with E. coli (BL21 strain) containing the recombinant pGEX-6P-1 plasmid that encodes GST-MARK2 (WT) or GST-MARK2 (TA) and was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin until A600 reached 0.8. To induce expression of the GST-tagged proteins, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at 100 μm. After culture for 24 additional hours at 20 °C, cells were harvested, and the lysates were prepared in the lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After ultrasonic DNA shearing, the debris was removed from the lysates by centrifugation. The recombinant proteins were purified on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and then eluted from the resin by incubation with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) that recognized the specific amino acid sequence between GST and MARK2 at 320 units/ml in the cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Brij-35, 1 mm EGTA, 1mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 5 h. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Phosphorylation reactions were performed at 30 °C in the phosphorylation reaction buffer (8 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP). In Fig. 1A, MARK2 (WT; 800 nm) or MARK2 (TA; 800 nm) was incubated with or without LKB1·STRADα·MO25α (25 nm; Upstate) for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× sample buffer (625 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 25% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). In Fig. 1B, after the phosphorylation reaction of MARK2 (WT/TA; 80 nm) by LKB1/STRADα/MO25α (25 nm) for 15 min, the reaction mixtures were incubated with Tau protein (2 μm; Invitrogen) for 3 min. The reactions were then terminated by the addition of 5× sample buffer. Tubulin Polymerization Assay—Tubulin polymerization assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Polymerization was performed with 30 μm tubulin and 0.3 μm Tau in the polymerization buffer without glycerol. MARK2 (WT; 800 nm) was incubated with LKB1·STRADα·MO25α (25 nm) in the phosphorylation reaction buffer at 30 °C for 15 min. Tau (3 μm) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 15 min. The control reaction containing MARK2 protein (800 nm) was incubated without ATP. The samples were boiled for 3 min to inactivate LKB1 and MARK2 and then used for polymerization reaction. Tau is a heat-stable protein and remains active in the enhancement of tubulin polymerization even after the heat treatment. The turbidity was monitored at 340 nm every minute for 60 min at 37 °C with a thermostatically controlled spectrophotometer Benchmark Plus Microplate Spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Each sample was determined in duplicate polymerization assays in three independent experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA of MEF3-2 was extracted with ISOGEN solution (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR analyses of human Tau and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression were performed with the following primer pairs: Tau sense, 5′-CAAGCTCGCATGGTCAGTAA-3′; Tau antisense, 5′-TTCTCAGTGGAGCCGATCTT-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; GAPDH antisense, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 5mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing Cømplete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1 (Sigma). Lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL membrane (GE Healthcare). After blocking with Blocking One or Blocking One-P (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), the membranes were probed with anti-phospho-MARK1/2/3, anti-MARK2/3, anti-phospho-Tau (Ser-262), anti-LKB1, anti-phospho-AMPKα1/2 (Thr-172), anti-AMPKα1/2, anti-β-actin, anti-V5, Tau-5, or 12E8 antibody. The signals were visualized by Immobilon western detection system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) or ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Establishment of an Lkb1-null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) Cell Line—Lkb1+/- mice (C57BL/6N background) were crossed with outbred ICR mice, and offspring were inter-crossed. Lkb1-null embryos at 9.5 days post-coitum were minced, trypsinized briefly, and placed on 24-well plates. These cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWest, Nuaillé, France) and 50% (v/v) conditioned medium from the MEFs that were derived from wild-type embryos at 12.5 days post-coitum. We obtained a spontaneously immortalized cell line (MEF3) by continuous passages (>3 months) of the Lkb1-null MEFs and further established the subclone MEF3-2 cell line. Finally, we cultured MEF3-2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Vector and Stable LKB1 Knockdown in HepG2 Cell Lines—The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University, and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. As previously described (13Baas A.F. Kuipers J. van der Wel N.N. Batlle E. Koerten H.K. Peters P.J. Clevers H.C. Cell. 2004; 116: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), LKB1-pTER was constructed by inserting the siRNA oligonucleotides against LKB1 (5′-CGAAGAGAAGCAGAAAATG-3′) into pTER vector (38van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Fong M.T.P. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C.P. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). LKB1-pTER was converted into LKB1-pTERlox containing the hygromycin B resistance gene and loxP sites. HepG2 cells were transfected with the LKB1-pTERlox by using Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Stable LKB1 knockdown cell lines were established by the hygromycin B (Invitrogen) selection (250 μg/ml). These clones were infected with recombinant adenovirus containing Cre recombinase or LacZ gene. Clones #15H and #31H (“H” for high level of LKB1 expression) were cultured without hygromycin B, but clones #15L and #31L (“L” for low level of LKB1) were maintained in the presence of hygromycin B (250 μg/ml). To minimize the effect of hygromycin B, #15L and #31L were incubated without hygromycin B for at least 24 h before the microtubule regrowth assays. Proteasome Inhibitors and Lithium Treatment—MG132 (10 μm; Sigma) or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (5 μm; Calbiochem) was added to the MEF3-2 cells 4 h before the harvest. For lithium treatment cells were incubated with 20 mm LiCl or NaCl simultaneously with the recombinant adenovirus infection. Microtubule Regrowth Assay—Serum-starved MEF3-2 cells on the coverslips were treated with 33 μm nocodazole (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C. After 3 washes with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium pre-warmed at 30 °C, the cells were incubated in fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at 30 °C. In experiments using HepG2, fetal bovine serum (10%; v/v) was added to the medium through the entire process. The cells were fixed in -20 °C methanol for 3 min and processed for immunofluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells fixed in -20 °C methanol for 3 min were re-hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After blocking with 10% (v/v) goat serum and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, the coverslips were incubated with anti-β-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The coverslips were then examined with Leica DM6000B fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 40× objective. Images were captured with ORCA-ER cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). High magnification images were collected on Leica TCS SL laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a 63× oil-immersion objective. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad PRISM version 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Suppression of Tubulin Polymerization by LKB1 in Vitro—To examine the potential role of LKB1 in MT dynamics, we first tested whether LKB1 would affect Tau phosphorylation in vitro. LKB1, together with STRADα and MO25α subunits, phosphorylated the activation loop of protein kinase MARK2 at threonine 208 (Fig. 1A, WT) but not the T208A mutant (Fig. 1A, TA), consistent with a report by others (18Lizcano J.M. Goöransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Maökelaö T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We then examined whether LKB1 activity could modulate the activity of MARK2 in phosphorylating microtubule-associated protein Tau at serine 262 of the KXGS motif (39Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J. Schmitt-Ulms G. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E-M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7679-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In MT dynamics, Ser-262 of Tau is reported to be the most important residue that is phosphorylated by MARK2. More specifically, Ser-262 phosphorylation reduces its affinity to MTs by ∼75%, thereby suppressing its effects on tubulin polymerization (39Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J. Schmitt-Ulms G. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E-M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7679-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). As expected, LKB1 increased Tau phosphorylation at Ser-262 through MARK2 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in the absence of LKB1, both wild-type MARK2 (WT) and mutant MARK2 (TA) showed only low and basal-level kinase activity on Tau. In addition, LKB1 failed to activate the mutant MARK2 (TA), and LKB1 by itself did not directly phosphorylate Tau at Ser-262. These results show that LKB1 stimulates Tau phosphorylation through MARK2 in vitro. We, therefore, examined the roles of LKB1 on the in vitro tubulin polymerization reaction in the presence of 0.3 μm Tau protein (Fig. 1C). Under this assay condition, in the absence of Tau, no tubulin polymerization was observed, but the addition of Tau (0.3 μm) into the reaction mixture immediately induced tubulin polymerization (data not shown). As a control, MARK2 in the absence of ATP showed a tubulin polymerization curve with a short nucleation phase followed by a fast growth phase and, finally, a steady phase with the maximum polymer mass (Fig. 1C, open circles). MARK2, in the presence of ATP, significantly inhibited tubulin polymerization due to its basal activity (Fig. 1, C-E, open squares; see below), and further addition of LKB1 markedly enhanced the inhibitory effects of MARK2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, closed circles, open triangles, and closed squares). LKB1 alone exerted only a slight effect on tubulin polymerization in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1C, closed triangles). To quantify the data, we determined the mean initial rate of tubulin polymerization for each curve (Fig. 1D). The basal activity of MARK2 (Fig. 1D, open square) reduced the initial rate by ∼35% of the control (Fig. 1D, open circle). LKB1 significantly enhanced the MARK2-mediated reduction in the initial rates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D, closed circle, by ∼40%; open triangle, by ∼65%; closed square, by ∼80%), although LKB1 alone showed only a minimal effect (Fig. 1D, closed triangle). In addition, we found that these initial rates were inversely correlated with the phosphorylation levels of MARK2 (Thr-208) and Tau (Ser-262), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1E. Collectively, these results indicate that LKB1 suppresses the Tau-mediated tubulin polymerization through the phosphorylation and activation of MARK2. Recombinant-adenoviral Expression of LKB1 and MARK2 in Lkb1-null MEFs—To investigate the role of LKB1 on MT dynamics in living cells, we expressed LKB1 and MARK2, respectively, in the Lkb1-deficient MEF3-2 using recombinant adenoviruses (Fig. 2A). We designed them so that a transcription termination cassette (STOP sequence) (40Sauer B. Methods. 1998; 14: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) should suppress expression of LKB1 or MARK2 during adenovirus production, because LKB1 and MARK2 showed cytotoxic activities in HEK293 host cells. Co-infection of MEF3-2 with Adv-Cre should remove the STOP sequence from Adv-LKB1 and Adv-MARK2, thereby expressing LKB1 and MARK2, respectively (Fig. 2B). As expected, Adv-LKB1 (WT), Adv-LKB1 (KD), Adv-MARK2 (WT), and Adv-MARK2 (KD) all expressed the encoded genes in MEF3-2 (Fig. 2, C and D). The adenovirally expressed LKB1 was functional, because LKB1 (WT), but not LKB1 (KD), phosphorylated the activation loop of the endogenous MARK1/2/3 and AMPKα1/2 in MEF3-2 (Fig. 2C) (16Hawley S.A.

Expression of LKB1 Suppresses MT Regrowth in Lkb1-null MEFs—Adenovirus-induced expression of LKB1 or MARK2 in MEF3-2 did not lead to marked alterations in the steady state MT cytoskeleton morphology, as monitored by the anti-β-tubulin immunofluorescence (data not shown). We then investigated the effects of these kinases on MT regrowth. When incubated for 2 h with 33 μm nocodazole, a MT-destabilizing reagent, all cells showed depolymerization of MTs (Figs. 3A and 4A, 0 min). After washing out nocodazole, MTs re-grew rapidly from centrosomes in the control cells infected with Adv-Cre alone, but infection of Adv-LKB1 (WT) suppressed MT regrowth substantially (Fig. 3,"

An obligatory step in the recombination reaction is the association, or synapsis, of Cre-bound loxP sites to form a tetrameric protein assembly that is competent for strand exchange. Using analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis approaches, we have studied the energetics of Cre-mediated synapsis of loxP sites. We found that synapsis occurs with a high affinity (Kd = 10 nm) and is pH-dependent but does not require divalent cations. Surprisingly, the catalytically inactive Cre K201A mutant is fully competent for synapsis of loxP sites, yet the inactive Y324F and R173K mutants are defective for synapsis. These findings have allowed us to determine the first crystal structures of a pre-cleavage Cre-loxP synaptic complex in a configuration representing the starting point in the recombination pathway. When combined with a quantitative analysis of synapsis using loxP mutants, the structures explain how the central 8 bp of the loxP site are able to dictate the order of strand exchange in the Cre system.

Site-specific recombinases from the tyrosine recombinase family are used by bacteria and yeast to mediate the integration, excision, resolution, and inversion of DNA segments to carry out a wide variety of biological functions (1Nash H.A.

A remarkable property of both the simple and complex systems is their ability to efficiently synapse (associate) recombining sites that can be located far from one another on the same chromosome or, for bacteriophage integration, are in separate DNA molecules. Synapsis of recombining sites has been visualized in tyrosine recombinase systems using a variety of complementary experimental approaches. For example, synaptic λ-int att and Cre-loxP complexes have been observed by electron microscopy (7Hamilton D.L. Abremski K. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and for a truncated λ-int-DNA complex (16Biswas T. Aihara H. Radman-Livaja M. Filman D. Landy A. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2005; 435: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite the fundamental importance of this initial step in the recombination reaction pathway, however, there have been no quantitative studies of the energetics of synapsis in these systems. Cre recombinase has proven to be a useful model system for biochemical and structural investigations (17Van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). During synapsis, Cre sharply bends the loxP sites to form an assembly that is stabilized by protein-protein interactions between Cre subunits bound to the associating sites (14Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Ennifar E. Meyer J.E. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Once this complex is formed, the recombinase subunits are committed to cleavage and exchange of one of the two pairs of DNA strands. As shown in Fig. 1, however, this initial step in the recombination pathway is actually quite complex. There are four distinct synaptic complexes that can form between two Cre-bound loxP sites if the sites are arranged in an approximately co-planar configuration; two of the complexes are anti-parallel (I and II in Fig. 1c) and two are parallel (III and IV in Fig. 1c). Structural, biochemical, and topological data strongly support a model in which only an anti-parallel alignment of sites will lead to efficient strand exchange (2Grindley N.D. Whiteson K.L. Rice P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 567-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 17Van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One might predict that Cre-loxP site-specific recombination should be able to initiate recombination equally well from either of the anti-parallel synaptic configurations. However, several independent experimental approaches have demonstrated that Cre preferentially exchanges the loxP bottom strands (the black strands in Fig. 1) first to generate the Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate, and then exchanges the top (red) strands during HJ resolution to form recombinant products (19Lee L. Sadowski P.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2005; 1: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent data further indicate that preferential formation of complex II in Fig. 1c is responsible for this bias in the order of strand exchanges (23Ghosh K. Lau C.K. Gupta K. Van Duyne G.D. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structural and biochemical bases for this asymmetry in the Cre recombination pathway have only been partially addressed, leaving a number of unanswered questions. For example, why should one of the anti-parallel synapses be preferred over the other? What is the structure of this synaptic complex? What is the binding affinity associated with Cre-loxP synapsis? Is synapsis best viewed as an interaction between the protein surfaces from two rigid Cre-bound loxP sites, or do the dynamics of loxP bending also play a role? One of the primary gaps in our mechanistic understanding of the Cre-loxP recombination pathway has been the lack of an experimental system to quantitatively study the requirements for efficient synapsis. A second issue has been the lack of a structural model that represents the actual starting point in the recombination pathway. Crystal structures of synaptic complexes containing Cre bound to modified loxP sites (14Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Ennifar E. Meyer J.E. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have provided a great deal of general insight but do not provide satisfactory explanations to these questions. Indeed, one of the reported Cre-DNA synaptic complex structures (15Ennifar E. Meyer J.E. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) argues against the currently accepted model for initiation of recombination. Here, we report advances in understanding both the biochemistry and structural biology of synapsis in the Cre-loxP system. Using analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis techniques, we have developed assays to measure equilibrium binding constants for Cre-mediated synapsis of loxP sites. Using these methods, we have examined the effects of pH, divalent ions, Cre mutants, and loxP modifications on synapsis. By using a cleavage-deficient Cre mutant that is able to synapse loxP sites as well as wild-type Cre, we have also determined two independent crystal structures of pre-cleavage Cre-loxP synaptic complexes that reveal the actual starting point for the recombination pathway. Together, the biochemical and structural data explain why Cre preferentially forms a bottom-strand cleavage synaptic complex to initiate recombination and provide new insights into this important first step in the recombination pathway. Protein and DNA Purification—Wild-type Cre and Cre mutants were overexpressed and purified as described (24Ghosh K. Van Duyne G.D. Methods. 2002; 28: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient for Cre at 280 nm was determined to be 49.1 mm-1 cm-1 by comparing protein absorbance before and after denaturation in 3 m guanidine hydrochloride (25Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for ultracentrifugation experiments (loxPcent in supplemental Fig. S1) were synthesized by the Keck Facility at Yale University with the 5′-dimethoxytrityl group attached and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as described (24Ghosh K. Van Duyne G.D. Methods. 2002; 28: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Following detritylation and concentration, oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl (annealing buffer) and further purified on a 5-ml type I hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) with sodium/potassium phosphate elution to remove small amounts of excess single strand DNA. The extinction coefficient at 260 nm was determined experimentally as 661 mm-1 cm-1 for duplex 44-mer loxP sites by comparing the absorbance before and after total DNase digestion, and using literature values for the extinction coefficients of individual nucleotides. For crystallization, oligonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as described above, but the hydroxyapatite column step was omitted. For gel-based synapsis assays, oligonucleotides were gel-purified. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge fitted with an AN-60 Ti rotor and with six-sector centerpieces. To determine synapsis affinities, Cre-loxP complexes were prepared at 0.6, 0.3, and 0.15 μm 44-mer loxP site DNA and 1.8, 0.9, and 0.45 μm Cre, respectively, in standard recombination buffer (20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol; measured density of 1.004 g/cm3). These ratios provide an excess of 0.5 Cre subunits per loxP half-site, which we found to be important in ensuring saturation of loxP sites throughout the experiment. Reference chambers were filled with either buffer alone or buffer containing 0.6, 0.3, and 0.15 μm Cre, respectively. Similar binding constants resulted from both approaches, but the fits were slightly better when the concentration of excess Cre was matched in the reference chambers due to the small absorbance contribution of unbound Cre that affected the absorbance baselines. The data fit in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2 were measured using the latter approach. Samples were centrifuged at 6,000, 9,000, 12,000, and 15,000 rpm, and radial absorbance scans were measured in step mode at 260 nm after 12 and 14 h, at which time equilibrium had been achieved. Radial absorbance data were fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model using the program SEDPHAT (26Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), with a fixed “monomer” molecular mass of 104,000 Da, based on two 38.5-kDa Cre subunits and one 27-kDa loxP-containing 44-mer duplex. The partial specific volume ( v¯) for Cre (0.73 cm3/g) was determined from the protein amino acid composition. The v¯ value for loxP DNA (0.59 cm3/g) was determined from sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the unbound DNA duplex, which behaved as an ideal monomer. The v¯ value of the Cre2loxP monomer (0.69 cm3/g) was estimated as the mass-weighted average of the partial specific volumes for Cre and the loxP site. An estimated error for the equilibrium constant was determined from a 1,000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation, as implemented in SEDPHAT. To examine the effects of buffer composition on synapsis, Cre-loxP complexes were prepared in the appropriate buffers at 400 nm loxP and 1.2 μm Cre. Centrifugation and absorbance scans were performed as described above, and relative synapsis association constants were estimated from global fits of the radial scans. These affinity constants are less well determined than the global fits involving three different Cre-loxP concentrations, but this approach allowed the simultaneous comparison of a large number of buffer conditions in the multichamber centerpieces. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of Cre alone was performed using 6 μm Cre in 20 mm sodium Hepes, pH 7.5, 275 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, with or without 5 mm MgCl2. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000, 15,000, 18,000, and 21,000 rpm, and radial absorbance scans were measured at 280 nm after equilibrium had been reached at 14 h. Absorbance data fit well to a single species model corresponding to a Cre monomer. Synapsis Gel Electrophoresis Assay—Ten picomoles of 54-mer top strand was 5′-end labeled with 32P and annealed to the complementary bottom strand by slow cooling (1 °C/min) in a thermal cycler. Synapsis reactions were carried out in 1× NCB buffer (20 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA). Each reaction in a given titration contained 200 pm radiolabeled 54-mer loxP DNA, 1 μm Cre or Cre mutant, and varying concentrations of unlabeled 54-mer DNA. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C, mixed with loading dye (0.001% bromphenol blue, 0.001% xylene cyanol, and 3% Ficoll) and loaded onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) that had been pre-run at 10 V/cm for 45 min at 20 °C, with constant temperature maintained by a circulating water bath. The gel polymerization and running buffer was 50 mm Hepes acid, 25 mm Tris base, at pH 7.0. Similar results were obtained when 1 mm EDTA was present in the buffers. After electrophoresis at 13 V/cm for 2 h at 20 °C, gels were dried and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays with wild-type Cre and 54-mer loxP DNA performed under identical conditions were used to verify the assignments of free DNA, DNA bound by one or two Cre subunits, and synaptic complex (as annotated in Fig. 3). The fraction synapsed (f) was calculated as the counts in the synaptic complex band divided by the sum of the synaptic complex counts plus the unsynapsed Cre2loxP counts in the corresponding lane and then plotted against the total DNA concentration. A monomer-dimer equilibrium model was utilized to fit the data using Equation 1, f=fmax[1−K4c[1+(8c/K)−1]] 1 where c is the total concentration of 54-mer loxP site, and K is the monomer-dimer dissociation constant. For D = [dimer] = [(Cre2loxP)2] and M = [monomer] = [Cre2loxP], then K = M2/D, c = 2D + M, and f = 2D/(2D + M). The equation used for fitting was derived by expressing M as a function of c and K and substituting this expression into f = (c - M)/c. The fmax term was introduced as an adjustable parameter and was fit to nearly 1.0 in most cases. The binding data cannot be properly fit to a simple binding isotherm, because the approximation that the total monomer concentration is equal to the free monomer concentration is invalid. Data were fit using Origin software (OriginLab Corp.). Structure Determination and Refinement—Cre K201A/loxP crystals were formed by vapor diffusion at 18 °C from solutions containing 13 μm protein and 19 μm 35-mer loxP DNA (the 34-bp loxP site containing 5′-T residues on each strand; supplemental Fig. S1) in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 20 mm CaCl2. Both orthorhombic and trigonal crystal forms grew from the same conditions. Diffraction data were measured at the Advanced Light Source beamline 8.2.1 using a Quantum4 charge-coupled device detector at 100 K and processed using the HKL suite (27Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The trigonal crystal form was sensitive to radiation damage, resulting in a lower completeness and higher overall Rsym value compared with the orthorhombic form (Table 3).TABLE 3Crystallographic data and results for Cre-loxP Synaptic complexesSpace groupC2221P3221Unit cell (a, b, c, Å)107.6, 122.1, 178.7136.8, 136.8, 218.3X-ray sourceALS 8.2.1ALS 8.2.1Resolution (Å)30.5-2.419.9-2.6Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell98.7 (94.3)81.4 (81.6)RsymbRsym = Σh|Ih – 〈I〉h|/ΣIh, where 〈I〉h is the average intensity over the symmetry equivalents5.5 (33.2)9.0 (19.8)RworkcRwork includes 95% of the reflection data used in refinement18.718.0RfreedRfree includes 5% of the reflection data excluded from refinement25.724.3r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.0250.007r.m.s.d. bond angles (deg)2.6741.195a Values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shellb Rsym = Σh|Ih – 〈I〉h|/ΣIh, where 〈I〉h is the average intensity over the symmetry equivalentsc Rwork includes 95% of the reflection data used in refinementd Rfree includes 5% of the reflection data excluded from refinement Open table in a new tab Both synaptic complex crystal forms were initially phased using molecular replacement with AMORE (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) and the recombinase-DNA half-sites from the covalent intermediate structure 1CRX (29Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) as a search model. The resulting starting models were then optimized using rigid-body refinement of the individual protein domains and the 13-bp inverted repeat DNA arms at 3-Å resolution, resulting in correlation coefficients of 0.88/0.81 and R-factors of 0.35/0.38 for the orthorhombic and trigonal crystal forms, respectively. The 8-bp spacer region encompassing positions 4′ through 4 was omitted from the model until these DNA residues could be unambiguously fit into unbiased electron density maps. Iterative cycles of positional refinement with REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar) and model building in O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) were performed as the resolution was gradually increased to the limits of the individual data sets. The σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps showed clear density for the bases and for the backbone of the omitted central 8 bp of the loxP site. This region was initially modeled as (dAdU)4 until the final stages of refinement to avoid bias in the choice of sequence directionality as described before (32Ghosh K. Lau C.K. Guo F. Segall A.M. Van Duyne G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8290-8299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequence assignment was then made based on the presence or absence of difference map densities for Gua-N2 and Thy-C5, which uniquely identifies the direction of the pseudo-palindromic spacer. Electron density maps following refinement of the (dAdU)4 model were consistent with only one direction for the loxP spacer, corresponding to a bottom strand cleavage configuration. Refinement results are summarized in Table 3, and coordinates for the orthorhombic and trigonal forms have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with accession codes 2HOF and 2HOI, respectively. Cre-loxP Synapsis Is pH-dependent but Does Not Require Divalent Cations—Our initial attempts to monitor Cre-loxP synapsis as a function of loxP concentration were based on native PAGE analysis. Slower migrating bands representing higher order complexes have been reported in the Cre system (9Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure & Methods. 1. 1990: 203-213Google Scholar, 33Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36905-36915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and these bands were shown to contain primarily synaptic complexes formed by association of two Cre-bound loxP sites (9Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure & Methods. 1. 1990: 203-213Google Scholar). When we attempted to extract binding constants using this approach, the resulting affinities were weaker than anticipated and the results were difficult to reproduce in separate experiments. After considering a number of plausible explanations (e.g. buffer requirements and stability of the synaptic complex during electrophoresis), we decided to first establish the basic requirements and affinities involved in Cre-loxP synapsis using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (hereafter referred to as AU). The primary advantage of AU is the ability to monitor complex formation under equilibrium conditions using well defined experimental parameters, such as buffer components, pH, and temperature (34Hensley P. Structure. 1996; 4: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The equilibria involved in synapsis of loxP sites are complex if cooperative binding of Cre subunits to the loxP site is also considered. To simplify the analysis, we performed AU experiments with 44-bp loxP sites and saturating concentrations of Cre, taking advantage of observations that Cre binds to the loxP site with a subnanomolar Kd (36Ringrose L. Lounnas V. Ehrlich L. Buchholz F. Wade R. Stewart A.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 363-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the loxP sites are fully occupied with Cre subunits, and synapsis can be modeled as a simple monomer-dimer equilibrium. In this model, two associating 104-kDa Cre2loxP complexes (monomers) associate to form a 208-kDa synaptic complex (dimer) (Fig. 1b). The 44-bp loxP site used (supplemental Fig. S1) dominates absorbance at 260 nm, with Cre contributing only a few percent of the signal at this wavelength. The AU experiment therefore monitors the oligomeric state of the loxP site, to a good approximation. The results of an AU experiment for wild-type Cre-loxP synapsis are summarized in Fig. 2 and in supplemental Fig. S2. Three different loxP concentrations (each with saturating amounts of Cre) were monitored at four different rotor speeds, and the equilibrium binding constant was determined by a global fit to the resulting twelve radial distributions. The excellent fits and randomly distributed residuals indicate that the monomer-dimer model is a good description of loxP site association under these conditions. The experiment described in Fig. 2 was performed using our standard recombination assay buffer, which is at near neutral pH and contains both monovalent (sodium) and divalent (magnesium) cations. To test the effects of different buffer conditions on the ability of Cre to synapse loxP sites, we performed AU experiments using the buffer conditions shown in Table 1. We were particularly interested to learn if divalent ions are required for efficient synapsis. It was originally reported that divalent ions and small polyamines increase the efficiency of the overall Cre recombination reaction (3Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a role for divalent ions in stabilizing the synaptic complex has been suggested (14Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We were therefore surprised to find that divalent ions have only a small effect on synapsis of loxP sites and that a physiological concentration of monovalent cations appears to be sufficient for this stage of the recombination pathway. A role for divalent ions or polyamines in facilitating cooperative Cre-loxP binding has also been suggested (37Rufer A. Neuenschwander P.F. Sauer B. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which would not be manifested in these experiments, because we are forcing full occupancy of the loxP sites by providing Cre in excess.TABLE 1Effects of pH and divalent ions on Cre-loxP synapsis Kd values were determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation of 400 nm Cre2loxP at four rotor speeds as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kd values are relative to the standard buffer condition, which was also used for the experiment in Fig. 2.

In general, the activity of rodent glutathione S-transferase is 10 to 20 times higher than that of humans, which could make the prediction of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in human more difficult. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) mainly regulates de novo synthesis of GSH in mammalian cells and plays a central role in the antioxidant capacity of cells. In this study, we constructed a GSH-depletion experimental rat model for the prediction of human hepatotoxicity. An adenovirus vector with short hairpin RNA against rat γ-GCS heavy chain subunit (GCSh) (AdGCSh-shRNA) was constructed and used to knock down the GCSh. In in vitro study in H4IIE cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, GCSh mRNA and protein were significantly decreased by 80% and GSH was significantly decreased by 50% 3 days after AdGCSh-shRNA infection. In the in vivo study in rat, the hepatic GSH level was decreased by 80% 14 days after a single dose of AdGCSh-shRNA (2 × 1011 pfu/ml/body), and this depletion continued for at least 2 weeks. Using this GSH knockdown rat model, acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity was shown to be significantly potentiated compared with normal rats.

It serves an important function in protecting tissues against the degenerating effects of oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals from endogenous or exogenous compounds (1Reed D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). GSH is synthesized from its precursor amino acids in two steps of enzymatic reactions. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) (3Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar) catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine from glutamic acid and cysteine. GSH synthetase couples glycine to γ-glutamylcysteine to form GSH. γ-GCS is a rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis, and GSH is a feedback inhibitor of γ-GCS activity. γ-GCS is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic subunit (heavy chain, 73 kDa) (4Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a modulatory subunit (light chain, 27.7 kDa) (5Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed by purified γ-GCS suggested that the active site exists in the catalytic subunit, whereas the modulatory subunit increases the affinity of the catalytic subunit for glutamic acid and decreases the sensitivity to feedback inhibition by GSH (4Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, embryos homozygous for the γ-GCS heavy chain (GCSh) mutation fail to gastrulate and die (6Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In contrast, homozygous knock-out mice with targeted disruption of the γ-GCS light chain are viable and fertile although the GSH level is decreased by 87% in the liver, and thus this model could be used as a GSH depletion mouse model in vivo (7Yang Y. Dieter M.Z. Chen Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49446-49452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Rat is the most frequently used experimental animal for pharmacological and toxicological studies in the drug development process because of their body weight and ease of sampling blood or urine. A standard technique of gene knock out in rat has not been established yet. Recently, a nuclear transfer method has been established and this method may be able to produce conditional knock out and gene replacement in the future (8Zhou Q. Renard J.P. Le Friec G. Brochard V. Beaujean N. Cherifi Y. Fraichard A. Cozzi J. Science. 2003; 302: 1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), but this method is very difficult and not available for general use. Recently, recombinant adenovirus methods are being developed and used for the purpose of clinical therapy or gene delivery in vivo (9Peng Z.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 10Chu R.L. Post D.E. Khuri F.R. Van Meir E.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5299-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Kruyt F.A. Curiel D.T. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a small interfering RNA strategy, which has been proven to be more specific and efficient than the full-length antisense cDNA strategy, has been established (12Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). In addition, an adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown approach could reduce the target gene specifically in the liver in mice, resulting in the expected phenotype (13Xu H. Wilcox D. Nguyen P. Voorbach M. Suhar T. Morgan S.J. An W.F. Ge L. Green J. Wu Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, there is no report that adenovirus-mediated shRNA knock down was successfully applied in rats in vivo. In the present study, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus (AdGCSh-shRNA) that could knock down rat GCSh mRNA efficiently in vitro and in vivo. We established the GSH-depleted rats and this rat model, when treated with acetaminophen (APAP), which is known to be biotransformed to quinoneimine (14Dahlin D.C. Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y. Nelson S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 327-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or some other radical species (15Moldeus P. Andersson B. Rahimtula A. Berggren M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), demonstrated hepatotoxicity with high sensitivity compared with normal rats.The activity of rodent glutathione S-transferase (GST) is about 10 to 20 times higher than that in human (16Grover P.L. Sims P. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, active metabolites produced in vivo in rat would be immediately detoxified by GSH conjugation, which would make the prediction of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in human more difficult. From this perspective, the AdGCSh-shRNA-mediated GSH depletion rat model could be useful for predicting the hepatotoxicity caused by unknown active metabolites of drug candidates produced by Phase I enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—APAP and GSH were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). β-NADPH and glutathione reductase were from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan).

Animals were housed in a controlled environment (temperature 25 ± 1 °C, humidity 50 ± 10%, and 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) in the institutional animal facility with access to food and water ad libitum. Animals were acclimatized for a week before use for the experiments. Animal maintenance and treatment were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Animal Welfare of Japan, as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kanazawa University, Japan.Design of Short Hairpin RNA—Rat GCSh (Gene Bank™ accession code J05181 Gene bank) knock down was achieved by RNA interference using an adenovirus vector-based shRNA approach. The sequences of shRNA-targeted GCSh cDNA were designed by B-Bridge (Mountain View, CA). The sequences of GCSh-shRNA are: top strand, 5′-gatccGTGTGAATGTCCAGAGTTAgaagcttgTAACTCTGGACATTCACACttttttggaagc-3′, and bottom strand, 5′-ggccgcttccaaaaaaGTGTGAATGTCCAGAGTTAcaagcttcTAACTCTGGACATTCACACg-3′. As a negative control, the oligonucleotide sequences of the shRNA target for luciferase from a GeneSilencer shRNA Vector kit were used.Recombinant Adenovirus—To generate the recombinant adenovirus vector expressing GCSh-shRNA, pGSU6-GFP plasmids were recombined into the pAxcwit using the cosmide-terminal protein complex (COS-TPC) method according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In brief, double strand oligo DNA for shRNA of GCSh and luciferase were inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of the pGSU6-GFP vector. This product was digested by HincII and inserted into the SwaI site of the pAxcwit vector. This pAxcwit vector and the parental adenovirus DNA terminal protein complex were co-transfected into 293 cells by Lipofectamine 2000. The recombinant adenovirus was isolated and propagated into the 293 cells. An adenovirus containing shRNA of GCSh (AdGCSh-shRNA) and one containing shRNA of luciferase (AdLuc-shRNA) were constructed. The titer was determined by a QuickTiter Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay kit. The titers of AdGCSh- or AdLuc-shRNA were 4.95 × 1011 pfu/ml and 2.98 × 1011 pfu/ml, respectively. The viral stock solution was concentrated with the Amicon Ultra-15 filtration system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for the in vivo study.Cell Culture—The 293 cell line and rat hepatoma cell lines BRL3A and H4IIE were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

BRL3A cells were maintained in Ham’s F12, HLE and Hepa1–6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and H4IIE cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium. All cell lines were infected by the adenovirus in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum.Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis—RNA from the hepatoma cells or from liver specimens was isolated using ISOGEN. Rat GCSh and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were quantified by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Primer sequences used in this study were as follows: rat GCSh, 5′-ATG CAGTATTCTGAACTACC-3′ and 5′-ACAAACTCAGATTCACCTAC-3′; mouse GCSh, 5′-TCTAACAAGAAACATCCGGCA-3′ and 5′-GGTCAGGTCGATGTCATTGTA-3′; human GCSh, 5′-ATTAGAAGAAAATCAGGCTC-3′ and 5′-GTAGCCAACTGATCATAAAG-3′; rat GAPDH, 5′-GTTACCAGGGCTGCCTTCTC-3′ and 5′-GGGTTTCCCGTTGATGACC-3′; mouse GAPDH, 5′-TCACCAGGGCTGCCATTTG-3′ and 5′-CTCACCCCATTTGATGTTAGT; human GAPDH, 5′-CCAGGGCTGCTTTTAACTC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCCCCCTGCAAATGA-3′. For the reverse transcription process, total RNA (2 μg) and 150 ng of random hexamer were mixed and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. RNA solution was added to a reaction mixture containing 100 units of ReverTra Ace, reaction buffer, and 0.5 mm dNTPs in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 1 h, and heated at 98 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. The real-time PCR was performed using the Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). PCR mixture contained 1 μl of template cDNA, SYBR Premix Ex Taq solution, and 10 pmol of sense and antisense primers. The PCR condition for GAPDH and GCSh were as follows. After an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, the amplification was performed by denaturation at 94 °C for 4 s, annealing and extension at 64 °C for 20 s for 45 cycles. Amplified products were monitored directly by measuring the increase of the dye intensity of the SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that binds to double strand DNA amplified by PCR.Western Blot Analysis—The H4IIE cell lysates, 1.5 μg, were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). The specific proteins were detected by rabbit anti-human GCSh polyclonal antibody, cross-reacting to rat GCSh (sc-22755; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:200. The protein bands were developed by biotinylated second antibody-peroxidase reaction. The quantitative analysis of protein expression was performed using ImageQuant TL Image Analysis software (Amersham Biosciences).GSH Level—Cell lysates were mixed in 5% (w/v) metaphosphoric acid and incubated on ice for 10 min. After the addition of 0.125 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 6.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Livers (100 mg) were homogenized with ice-cold 5% sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged at 8,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The GSH concentration in the supernatant was measured as described previously (17Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5502) Google Scholar).Adenovirus Infection and APAP Administration in Rats—Fourteen days after one intravenous injection of AdGCSh-shRNA or AdLuc-shRNA at 2 × 1011 pfu/ml/body, the rats were orally administered APAP suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (0, 300, 1000 mg/kg body weight). Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after the APAP treatment. Twenty-four hours after the administration of APAP, serum samples were collected for assessment of transaminase levels and for APAP metabolite analysis. The liver was fixed in buffered neutral 10% formalin. The fixed samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 2 μm and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for microscopic examination. Rat liver cytosol and microsomes were prepared as described previously (18Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Yun C.H. Yamazaki H. Raney K.D. Their R. Coles B. Harris T.M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102 ((Suppl.): 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the rats were not treated by fasting prior to the APAP treatment or sacrifice.GST Activity and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Content—The cytosolic GST activity was determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as a substrate according to the method of Habig et al. (19Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomal cytochrome P450 content was determined by the method of Omura and Sato (20Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of Plasma Concentrations of APAP and Its Metabolites—The plasma concentrations of APAP and its metabolites were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography method described previously (21Kim Y.C. Lee S.J. Toxicology. 1998; 128: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, plasma was mixed with an aliquot of acetonitrile containing theophylline as an internal standard. After extraction and centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was evaporated under nitrogen. The residue was diluted with distilled water as necessary before being injected into high performance liquid chromatography. APAP and its metabolites, APAP-GSH, APAP-cysteine, APAP-mercapturate, APAP-glucuronide, and APAP-sulfate, were separated in a Mightysil RP-18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; 5 μm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). APAP and the metabolites, eluted with 1.8% aqueous acetic acid-methanol-H2O (66:9:100) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, were monitored at 248 nm.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad Instat version 2.0 computer program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) by Student t-test, Dunnett’s post hoc test, or Bonferroni test.RESULTSChanges of GCSh mRNA Expression and GSH Level in Various Hepatoma Cell Lines—To investigate the knockdown effect on the cells, various hepatoma cells were infected with AdGCSh-shRNA or AdLuc-shRNA (negative control adenovirus) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20 for 3 days. Real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis and GSH assay were performed to examine the GCSh mRNA expression and GSH suppression (Fig. 1). The expression level of GCSh mRNA was significantly reduced to 20–30% in BRL3A, H4IIE, and Hepa1–6 cells. In contrast, AdGCSh-shRNA was less potent, reducing GCSh mRNA to 45% in HLE cells. The GSH level was suppressed only in H4IIE cells by 50%, despite the efficient GCSh mRNA knock down in BRL3A and Hepa1–6 cells. Based on these results, H4IIE cells were used in the next experiments.Time-dependent Knockdown Effect of AdGCSh-shRNA in H4IIE Cells—To investigate the most efficient condition for infection, H4IIE cells were infected with AdGCSh-shRNA at m.o.i. 10 or 20 for 1, 2, 3, and 5 days. GCSh mRNA was reduced after 24 h of infection, and an 80% decrease of GCSh mRNA was achieved after 2 days of infection (Fig. 2A). The decrease of GCSh mRNA was accompanied by a decrease in GCSh protein (Fig. 2B). The GSH level was significantly reduced by 50% after 3 days of AdGCSh-shRNA m.o.i. 20 infection (Fig. 2C). There was no difference between 3 and 5 days of infection. These results suggested that a m.o.i. of 20 and 3 days of infection could be an appropriate condition for cytotoxicity experiments.FIGURE 2Time-dependent knockdown effect in AdGCSh-shRNA-infected H4IIE cells. GCSh mRNA (A), GCSh protein (B), and GSH content (C) were determined in H4IIE cells infected with AdLuc-shRNA or AdGCSh-shRNA. GCSh protein was quantified by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean ± S.D.

H4IIE cells were infected with AdGCSh-shRNA at m.o.i. 20 or with AdLuc-shRNA in the same conditions as a negative control. After 3 days of infection, H4IIE cells were exposed to various concentrations of APAP of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 mm. After 24 h of APAP treatment, AdGCSh-shRNA-infected cells showed no toxic effects compared with control (data not shown).Infection of AdGCSh-shRNA to Rat—To further investigate in vivo in rat, a single tail vein injection to Fisher 344 rats was made to deliver AdGCSh-shRNA. The effects of GCSh knock down were examined 14 days after infection. Control animals were treated with PBS or AdLuc-shRNA. The hepatic GCSh mRNA expression was remarkably decreased dose dependently (Fig. 3A). At the dose of 2 × 1011 pfu/ml/body, GCSh mRNA was significantly decreased by 90%. Consistent with the decrease of GCSh mRNA, the hepatic total GSH level was also reduced to 20% at doses above 2 × 1011 pfu/ml/body (Fig. 3B). The hepatic GSH level in AdLuc-shRNA-infected rat was slightly increased compared with the PBS-treated rats (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Effects of adenovirus infection on hepatic GCSh mRNA (A), GSH level (B), ALT and AST (C) in rats. All experiments were performed 14 days after AdGCSh-shRNA or AdLuc-shRNA infection. Data represent the mean ± S.D.

As shown in Fig. 3C, AST was significantly elevated in the 4.0 and 8.0 × 1011 pfu/ml/body infection by 1.6- and 4.1-fold, respectively, compared with the control. ALT was significantly elevated in only the 8.0 × 1011 pfu/ml/body infection by 2.2-fold compared with the control. The dose of 2.0 × 1011 pfu/ml/body did not affect the AST and ALT, and thus this condition was adopted in the next experiments. The cytochrome P450 content and GST activity slightly increased in AdGCSh-shRNA-treated rats (data not shown).APAP-induced Hepatotoxicity in AdGCSh-shRNA-infected Rat—To determine whether APAP-induced hepatotoxicity was potentiated by the suppression of hepatic GSH, rats were tail vein-injected once with 2.0 × 1011 pfu/ml/body AdGCSh-shRNA or AdLuc-shRNA. After 14 days, APAP was orally administered without previous fasting. The serum AST and ALT levels are shown in Figs. 4, A and B. Twenty-four hours after APAP administration, 300 mg/kg treatment did not result in hepatotoxicity. In contrast, the AdGCSh-shRNA-infected rats treated with 1000 mg/kg APAP demonstrated a significant increase of AST (2159 ± 1156 units/liter) and ALT (924 ± 667 units/liter) compared with AdLuc-shRNA infected rats. Without fasting treatment, the AdLuc-shRNA and normal rats administered 1000 mg/kg APAP did not show hepatotoxicity. The results of the histological examination in 1000 mg/kg APAP-administered rats are shown in Fig. 4C. Remarkable hepatic necrosis, especially around the central vein, was observed in AdGCSh-shRNA-treated rats given 1000 mg/kg APAP, consistent with the elevation of AST and ALT. There was no histological change in the other groups.FIGURE 4Hepatotoxic effect of APAP in AdGCSh-shRNA-infected rats. APAP was orally administered without previous fasting. After 24 h, serum AST (A) and ALT (B) were measured, and hematoxylin-eosin staining (C) was performed in sections of rat liver. Hepatic necrosis was observed only in APAP-administered rats infected with AdGCSh-shRNA. Arrow indicates areas of hepatic necrosis caused by 1000 mg/kg APAP treatment. Data represent the mean ± S.D.

For APAP, APAP-glucuronide, and APAP-sulfate, the maximum plasma concentration was observed 30 min or 1 h after APAP administration. The concentration of APAP-glucuronide was significantly elevated in rats infected with AdGCSh-shRNA compared with AdLuc-shRNA-infected rats (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, APAP-sulfate, a major detoxification product in rats generated directly from APAP, was decreased (Fig. 5C). For APAP-GSH, APAP-cysteine, and APAP-mercapturate, the maximum plasma concentration was observed 1 h after APAP administration in rats infected with AdGCSh-shRNA. As for the rats infected with AdLuc-shRNA, the concentration of APAP-GSH was gradually decreased, whereas the concentrations of APAP-cysteine and APAP-mercapturate were slightly increased.FIGURE 5Changes of the plasma concentrations of APAP and its metabolites in rats infected with the adenovirus.

After 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, the hepatic GSH level was measured (Fig. 6). Hepatic GSH was significantly decreased by 80% at 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The hepatic GSH was reduced by 66 and 45% at 4 and 5 weeks after infection, respectively. In addition, at 7 and 10 days after infection of AdGCSh-shRNA, the hepatic GSH was decreased by 20 and 50%, respectively (data not shown). The effects of the circadian rhythm were also examined 2 weeks after infection with AdGCSh-shRNA (data not shown). The hepatic GSH level was lower than those from PBS-treated rats at all the time points examined, and no effect of the circadian rhythm on the GSH level was observed in rats infected with AdGCSh-shRNA.FIGURE 6Time-dependent changes of hepatic GSH level in rats infected with AdGCSh-shRNA. Rat liver was excised at 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after infection with AdGCSh-shRNA. Data represent the mean ± S.D.

The GSH level was efficiently decreased by 50% only in H4IIE cells infected with AdGCSh-shRNA (Fig. 1). The target sequence of the rat GCSh is the same as mouse, but it differs from that of human. This would probably affect the mRNA knockdown efficiency. The lack of a decrease of GSH in BRL3A cells may be due to differences in the expression levels of coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (22Huang K.C. Altinoz M. Wosik K. Larochelle N. Koty Z. Zhu L. Holland P.C. Nalbantoglu J. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In the cytotoxicity study, APAP treatment did not show a toxic effect in AdGCSh-shRNA-infected cells compared with AdLuc-shRNA-infected cells. APAP is mainly metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, partly by CYP enzymes (23Howie D. Adriaenssens P. Prescott L.F. J. Pharm.

https://openalex.org/W2069490535,"We have examined the kinetics of incorporation of acyclovir triphosphate by the herpes simplex virus-1 DNA polymerase holoenzyme (Pol-UL42) and the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase using transient kinetic methods. For each enzyme, we compared the kinetic parameters for acyclovir to those governing incorporation of dGTP. The favorable ground state dissociation constant (6 μm) and rate of polymerization (10 s−1) afford efficient incorporation of acyclovir triphosphate by the Pol-UL42 enzyme. A discrimination factor of ∼50 favors dGTP over acyclovir triphosphate, mostly due to a faster maximum rate of dGTP incorporation. Once incorporated, acyclovir is removed with a half-life of ∼1 h in the presence of a normal concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, leading to a high toxicity index (16,000) toward viral replication. To assess the potential for toxicity toward the host we examined the incorporation and removal of acyclovir triphosphate by the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase. These results suggest moderate inhibition of mitochondrial DNA replication defining a toxicity index of 380. This value is much higher than the value of 1.5 determined for tenofovir, another acyclic nucleoside analog. The enzymatic therapeutic index is only 42 in favoring inhibition of the viral polymerase over polymerase γ, whereas that for tenofovir is greater than 1,200.

Infection may occur in a variety of different locations including the skin, eye, mouth, central nervous system, and even simultaneously in multiple organs (1Kimberlin D. Herpes. 2004; 11: 65A-76APubMed Google Scholar). A major breakthrough in management of HSV infections occurred more than two decades ago with the discovery of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine (acyclovir), which continues to be the leading treatment. Acyclovir triphosphate (TP) has been shown to compete with dGTP binding to the HSV-1 DNA polymerase and serves as an alternate substrate, resulting in the termination of DNA synthesis (2Elion G.B. Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. de Miranda P. Beauchamp L. Schaeffer H.J. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 147-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Furman P.A. St. Clair M.H. Fyfe J.A. Rideout J.L. Keller P.M. Elion G.B. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 72-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies using steady-state methods suggested that once incorporated onto the 3′ terminus of the primer strand, acyclovir monophosphate (MP) could not be removed by the 3′-5′ proofreading exonuclease function of HSV-1 DNA polymerase (4Derse D. Cheng Y.C. Furman P.A. St. Clair M.H. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11447-11451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that acyclovir-TP can be classified as a suicide inhibitor (5Furman P.A. St. Clair M.H. Spector T. J. Biol.

Orr A. Frame M.C. Murphy M. McGeoch D.J. Marsden H.S. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 818-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using a pre-steady-state single nucleotide incorporation assay suggested that Pol-UL42 has an extremely high misincorporation frequency of about 1 in 300 when comparing correct dTTP incorporation to incorrect dATP incorporation (6Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, further studies revealed that the exonuclease proofreading function contributes greatly to the overall fidelity because Pol-UL42 is unable to extend beyond a mismatch efficiently, thereby altering the kinetic partitioning to favor excision rather than extension (11Song L. Chaudhuri M. Knopf C.W. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18535-18543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study we aimed to more accurately define the kinetic parameters governing the incorporation and the exonuclease removal of acyclovir by Pol-UL42 using transient state kinetic methods (12Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and to compare these kinetic parameters to those for the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ). In these studies we provide a more accurate assessment of the toxicity of acyclovir triphosphate toward the viral enzyme and evaluate the potential for mitochondrial toxicity. Most of the toxic side effects caused by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are a result of mitochondrial dysfunction due to the direct inhibition of Pol γ (reviewed in Refs. 13Carr A.

The kinetic parameters governing incorporation and excision correlate well with the severity of the clinically observed side effects for all FDA-approved nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (14Lee H. Hanes J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) with the possible exception of 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine, which appears to act as a competitive inhibitor of thymidine kinase (18Rylova S.N. Albertioni F. Flygh G. Eriksson S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A detailed evaluation of the ability of Pol γ to discriminate against incorporation of acyclovir-TP during polymerization plus a quantitative analysis of the excision of acyclovir-MP is necessary to fully understand its effectiveness and toxicity. Activation of acyclovir to form the nucleoside triphosphate is dependent upon a promiscuous viral thymidine kinase; the low toxicity of acyclovir is due to the activation of acyclovir only in infected cells and the low inhibition of cellular replication (19Elion G.B.

However, the mitochondrial toxicity of acyclovir triphosphate has not been evaluated. Similar acyclic guanosine analogs, pencilovir, used in the treatment of oral herpes simplex infections, and ganciclovir, used in treating cytomegalovirus infections, both rely upon viral encoded kinases for specificity (reviewed in Ref. 20De Clercq E.

In contrast, three acyclic nucleoside phosphonates are employed that bypass the first phosphorylation step and become activated in all cells: cidofovir, a cytidine analog used against cytomegalovirus, adefovir, an adenine analog used against hepatitis B, and tenofovir, a similar adenine analog used against HIV (23De Clercq E. Expert Rev. Anti-Infect. Ther. 2003; 1: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although tenofovir can be activated to the triphosphate form in any cell, its clinical toxicity is relatively low. Quantitative measurements of incorporation by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase have revealed a human toxicity index of only 1.5 and a rather high therapeutic index toward HIV RT of 1200 (14Lee H. Hanes J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the low toxicity of acyclovir is largely dependent upon the high specificity of the host thymidine kinase that precludes activation in uninfected cells, whereas its effectiveness relies upon the promiscuity of the viral thymidine kinase. However, there have been no quantitative measurements to evaluate the potential mitochondrial toxicity of acyclovir triphosphate or to test whether a phosphonate analog of acyclovir might be equally effective. Therefore, we have examined the relative effectiveness and potential for mitochondrial toxicity of acyclovir by comparing the kinetics of incorporation versus excision of acyclovir triphosphate by the HSV and human mitochondrial DNA polymerases. Reagents—Buffers, salts, and dNTPs were obtained from Sigma. Acyclovir-TP was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Enzymes—HSV-1 Pol-UL42 holoenzyme was purified from Sf9 insect cells co-infected with recombinant baculovirus that express the genes encoding these proteins as detailed previously (24Chaudhuri M. Parris D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10270-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HSV-1 Pol-UL42 used for the studies described herein was determined to be ≥95% pure, and all preparations contained 50–75% active enzyme, based on active site titrations. Exonuclease-deficient holoenzyme (D368A) was used to measure nucleotide incorporation reactions. Mutant D368A has been previously characterized and has been shown to lack any detectable exonuclease activity (11Song L. Chaudhuri M. Knopf C.W. Parris D.S. J. Biol.

Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme was reconstituted at a 1:5 molar ratio of catalytic subunit to accessory subunit. For single nucleotide incorporation experiments, exonuclease-deficient holoenzyme (E200A) was used. Preparation of DNA—All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The primer (25-mer) sequence for correct incorporation of both dGTP and acyclovir-TP was 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′. The 45-mer template sequence for incorporation reactions was 5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACACTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGAGGC-3′. The 26-mer primer sequence used for exonuclease reactions was 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAX-3′, where the bold X signifies the position where dGMP or acyclovir-MP was positioned. The template (45-mer) sequence that was complementary to the primer strand was 5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACACTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGAGGC-3′. The template sequence for the DNA containing eight different bases to create a frayed primer was 5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACAATATCAAGGTTGGACGGCTGCGAGGC-3′. Primers containing 3′-terminal acyclovir-MP were created enzymatically using HIV-1 RT. The reaction was performed using 1 μm RT, 3 μm duplex DNA (coding for G incorporation), and 50 μm acyclovir-TP in the following reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the product was purified using 15% denaturing PAGE to obtain the acyclovir-TP-terminated primer. All primers used were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The reaction was terminated by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min, and excess nucleotide was removed using a Bio-Spin 6 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). Primer was annealed to template by combining at an equimolar ratio, heating to 95 °C, and then slowly cooling to room temperature. Reaction Conditions—A quench-flow apparatus (RQF-3) from KinTek Corporation (Austin, TX) was used for reactions too fast to mix and quench manually. All concentrations stated refer to the final concentrations after mixing. The buffer conditions for kinetic assays using HSV-1 Pol-UL42 were as follows: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 125 mm KCl, and 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The radiolabeled DNA substrate was then added to the holoenzyme and the mixture was incubated for at least 10 min on ice. Reactions for incorporation experiments were initiated by mixing holoenzyme-DNA complex with an equal volume of solution composed of the same buffer plus dGTP or acyclovir-TP and MgCl2 (6 mm Mg2+ after mixing). To start the exonuclease reactions Pol-UL42 holoenzyme-DNA complex was mixed with an equal volume of buffer plus MgCl2, and in two experiments, 100 μm dNTPs. The buffer conditions for kinetic assays using Pol γ were as follows: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The holoenzyme was reconstituted by incubating the two protein subunits for 5 min on ice. The radiolabeled duplex DNA was then added to the holoenzyme and the mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min on ice. Experiments using Pol γ were performed in the same fashion as with Pol-UL42 except that a final concentration of 2.5 mm Mg2+ was used. All reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Products were separated from reactants using 15% denaturing PAGE, imaged on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860, and quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The slightly different buffer conditions for HSV-1 polymerase versus Pol γ, 125 mm KCl versus 100 mm NaCl, respectively, were chosen so that the results on each enzyme would be directly comparable with previous studies. However, these conditions are deemed to be sufficiently similar to afford a comparison between the two enzymes because the salt concentration optimum does not have a steep concentration dependence, and we have not seen any difference between potassium and sodium in previous measurements on Pol γ. Pre-steady-state Single Turnover Reactions—Single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed with various concentrations of dGTP or acyclovir-TP to examine the nucleotide concentration dependence of incorporation rate and amplitude using a KinTek RQF-3 rapid quench-flow instrument. Single-turnover conditions were employed, where the concentration of enzyme was greater than the concentration of DNA. All experiments were performed at least twice but, in all cases, error estimates are based upon nonlinear regression to the fitted curves as described below. These error estimates are comparable with the errors observed in repeating the experiment because other experimental errors (e.g. pipetting) are generally smaller in magnitude. Specific reaction conditions are listed in each figure legend and under “Results.” A time course was performed for each concentration of dGTP or acyclovir-TP. To normalize the data, the integrated amount of product (DNAn+1) was divided by the sum of the substrate and the product (DNAn + DNAn+1) and then multiplied by the concentration of DNA used in the experiment. The concentration of extended product (26-mer) was plotted against time (t) and fit to a single exponential equation using GraFit 5 software (Erithacus Software, Horley Surrey, United Kingdom). [26-mer]=Ae−kt+CEq. 1 The observed reaction rates (k) were then plotted against dGTP or acyclovir-TP concentration ([S]), and the data were fit by non-linear regression using a hyperbola to extract the maximum rate of incorporation (kpol) and the ground state dissociation constant (Kd). Rate=kpol[S]Kd+[S]Eq. 2 For the case of correct dGTP incorporation using HSV-1 DNA polymerase, the reaction rate at the highest concentration of dGTP exceeded our capability to obtain an accurate measurement; therefore, the following hyperbolic equation was used to get the best fit for the initial slope or specificity constant (kpol/Kd) of the following reaction. Rate=(kpol/Kd)[S]1+[S]/Kd=slope⋅[S]1+[S]/KdEq. 3 The exonuclease reactions were also performed under single turnover conditions. For exonuclease reactions involving acyclovir-MP removal, data were analyzed by plotting substrate concentration as a function of time and fitting by non-linear regression to a single exponential equation (Equation 1). Data for exonuclease reactions involving dGMP removal were biphasic and therefore fit to a double exponential equation to obtain the rates (k1 and k2) and amplitudes (A1 and A2) for the two phases. [26-mer]=A1e−k1t+A2e−k2t+CEq. 4 Kinetics of Incorporation of Acyclovir-TP by Pol-UL42—We determined the kinetic parameters governing incorporation of acyclovir-TP by Pol-UL42 using a 25-base DNA primer annealed to a 45-base template such that dGTP would be the next correct base incorporated. All reactions were performed under single turnover conditions, in that the concentration of enzyme was in excess over DNA to prevent multiple enzyme turnovers that complicate the analysis (6Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of the rate of incorporation of the natural nucleotide, dGTP, and of the nucleotide analog, acyclovir-TP, were obtained from a series of experiments performed at various nucleotide concentrations. The concentration dependence defines the apparent Kd for ground state nucleotide binding and the maximum rate of incorporation (kpol). Because nucleotide binding appears to be rapidly reversible and events following incorporation are fast, the ratio kpol/Kd defines the specificity constant for incorporation. These measurements are preferred over steady-state methods that produce anomalous results due to the slow, rate-limiting release of DNA from the enzyme. The identity of kpol/Kd = kcat/Km appears to be generally valid even when the kinetics of incorporation are complex (29Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Exonuclease-deficient (D368A) Pol-UL42 holoenzyme was used to reduce degradation of the primer strand during the polymerization measurements. The time dependence of dGTP incorporation by Pol-UL42 is shown in Fig. 1A. The rate of incorporation was established by fitting the time dependence of product formation to a single exponential equation at each nucleotide concentration. The observed rate of incorporation was plotted as a function of nucleotide concentration (Fig. 1B) providing estimates of kpol = 640 ± 60 s−1 and apparent Kd = 8 ± 2 μm. The maximum rate was at the limit of the time resolution of rapid quench methods so that the values for kpol and Kd are not well defined. Nonetheless, the value of the specificity constant is known accurately from the initial slope of the concentration dependence defining a value of kpol/Kd = 80 ± 5 μm−1 s−1, obtained by fitting the data to Equation 3 eliminating Kd as independent variables. The specificity constant was within a factor of two of the value reported previously for dTTP (kpol/Kd = 45 μm−1 s−1) (6Chaudhuri M. Song L. Parris D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8996-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), even though the maximum rate of incorporation of dGTP was more than 4-fold faster than previously seen for dTTP incorporation (kpol = 137 ± 21 s−1). In general, dGTP is incorporated more rapidly by polymerases and this may explain part of the difference. For example, dGTP is incorporated 1.7- and 1.5-fold faster than dTTP by Taq DNA polymerase and Pol γ, respectively (30Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 31Brandis J.W. Edwards S.G. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2189-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, different primer/template (45/67-mer) combinations used for dTTP and dGTP incorporation may also alter the maximum rate of incorporation due to sequence context effects. To quantify the effectiveness of acyclovir-TP as an inhibitor of viral replication, the concentration dependence of its rate of incorporation was examined. A plot of the concentration of extended product (26-mer) as a function of time for various acyclovir-TP concentrations is shown in Fig. 2A. The concentration dependence of the rate (Fig. 2B) was fit to a hyperbola (Equation 2) to define a kpol of 10.1 ± 0.8 s−1 and a Kd of 6 ± 1 μm. A comparison of the specificity constant for dGTP incorporation to that of acyclovir-TP incorporation (Table 1) demonstrates that the natural nucleotide is preferred by only 50-fold. With a specificity constant of 1.7 μm−1 s−1, acyclovir-TP is a relatively efficient substrate for incorporation catalyzed by Pol-UL42. Interestingly, the apparent Kd of dGTP and acyclovir-TP are not significantly different.TABLE 1Summary of kinetic parameters for HSV-1 DNA polymeraseIncorporationkpolKdSpecificity constantDiscriminations−1μmμm−1 s−1dGTP640 ± 608 ± 280 ± 5aObtained by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 3.

The removal of dGMP was examined under single turnover conditions (100 nm wild type Pol-UL42 and 90 nm DNA). The reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing the preformed E-DNA complex with a solution containing Mg2+ (6 mm after mixing). In addition to measuring the rate of hydrolysis using a complementary DNA primer/template combination, another experiment was performed with a frayed primer/template, in which the template sequence was modified to create eight mispaired bases at the 3′-end of the primer. Shown in Fig. 3A are the results of the two experiments superimposed where the concentration of substrate (26-mer, 3′-terminated with either dGMP or acyclovir-MP) was plotted as a function of time. The excision of correctly paired dGMP was biphasic with a fast phase (12 ± 6 s−1) representing only ∼12.5% (11 nm) of the total reaction amplitude (Table 1), whereas the slower phase accounted for the remainder of the reaction and occurred at a rate of 0.25 s−1. The removal of dGMP from frayed DNA was also biphasic, but in this case, the fast phase represented about 73% of the reaction amplitude and occurred at a rate of 125 ± 7 s−1. The slow phase progressed 100-fold more slowly at only 1.3 ± 0.2 s−1. These results are comparable with those obtained previously with T7 DNA polymerase and Pol γ, in that the rate and amplitude of the fast phase of excision from a frayed primer increases as a function of the number of 3′ mismatches (32Donlin M.J.

The primer strand shuttles between the polymerase and exonuclease sites and greater fraying favors transfer to the exonuclease site."
