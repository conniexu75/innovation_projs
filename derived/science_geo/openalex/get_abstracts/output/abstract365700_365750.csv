https://openalex.org/W2062004524,"The in vitro analysis of intestinal epithelium has been hampered by a lack of suitable culture systems. Here we describe robust long-term methodology for small and large intestinal culture, incorporating an air-liquid interface and underlying stromal elements. These cultures showed prolonged intestinal epithelial expansion as sphere-like organoids with proliferation and multilineage differentiation. The Wnt growth factor family positively regulates proliferation of the intestinal epithelium in vivo. Accordingly, culture growth was inhibited by the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) and markedly stimulated by a fusion protein between the Wnt agonist R-spondin-1 and immunoglobulin Fc (RSpo1-Fc). Furthermore, treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine and neurogenin-3 overexpression induced goblet cell and enteroendocrine cell differentiation, respectively, consistent with endogenous Notch signaling and lineage plasticity. Epithelial cells derived from both leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor-5-positive (Lgr5(+)) and B lymphoma moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region homolog-1-positive (Bmi1(+)) lineages, representing putative intestinal stem cell (ISC) populations, were present in vitro and were expanded by treatment with RSpo1-Fc; this increased number of Lgr5(+) cells upon RSpo1-Fc treatment was subsequently confirmed in vivo. Our results indicate successful long-term intestinal culture within a microenvironment accurately recapitulating the Wnt- and Notch-dependent ISC niche."
https://openalex.org/W2168735820,"Betulinic Acid (BetA) and its derivatives have been extensively studied in the past for their anti-tumor effects, but relatively little is known about its precursor Betulin (BE). We found that BE induces apoptosis utilizing a similar mechanism as BetA and is prevented by cyclosporin A (CsA). BE induces cell death more rapidly as compared to BetA, but to achieve similar amounts of cell death a considerably higher concentration of BE is needed. Interestingly, we observed that cholesterol sensitized cells to BE-induced apoptosis, while there was no effect of cholesterol when combined with BetA. Despite the significantly enhanced cytotoxicity, the mode of cell death was not changed as CsA completely abrogated cell death. These results indicate that BE has potent anti-tumor activity especially in combination with cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2014460069,"Neurons born in the adult dentate gyrus develop, mature, and connect over a long interval that can last from six to eight weeks. It has been proposed that, during this period, developing neurons play a relevant role in hippocampal signal processing owing to their distinctive electrical properties. However, it has remained unknown whether immature neurons can be recruited into a network before synaptic and functional maturity have been achieved. To address this question, we used retroviral expression of green fluorescent protein to identify developing granule cells of the adult mouse hippocampus and investigate the balance of afferent excitation, intrinsic excitability, and firing behavior by patch clamp recordings in acute slices. We found that glutamatergic inputs onto young neurons are significantly weaker than those of mature cells, yet stimulation of cortical excitatory axons elicits a similar spiking probability in neurons at either developmental stage. Young neurons are highly efficient in transducing ionic currents into membrane depolarization due to their high input resistance, which decreases substantially in mature neurons as the inward rectifier potassium (Kir) conductance increases. Pharmacological blockade of Kir channels in mature neurons mimics the high excitability characteristic of young neurons. Conversely, Kir overexpression induces mature-like firing properties in young neurons. Therefore, the differences in excitatory drive of young and mature neurons are compensated by changes in membrane excitability that render an equalized firing activity. These observations demonstrate that the adult hippocampus continuously generates a population of highly excitable young neurons capable of information processing."

To gain insights into protective beta-glucan epitope(s) and protection mechanisms, we studied two anti-beta-glucan monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with identical complementarity-determining regions but different isotypes (mAb 2G8, IgG2b and mAb 1E12, IgM). C. albicans, the most relevant fungal pathogen for humans, was used as a model.Both mAbs bound to fungal cell surface and to the beta1,3-beta1,6 glucan of the fungal cell wall skeleton, as shown by immunofluorescence, electron-microscopy and ELISA. They were also equally unable to opsonize fungal cells in a J774 macrophage phagocytosis and killing assay. However, only the IgG2b conferred substantial protection against mucosal and systemic candidiasis in passive vaccination experiments in rodents. Competition ELISA and microarray analyses using sequence-defined glucan oligosaccharides showed that the protective IgG2b selectively bound to beta1,3-linked (laminarin-like) glucose sequences whereas the non-protective IgM bound to beta1,6- and beta1,4-linked glucose sequences in addition to beta1,3-linked ones. Only the protective IgG2b recognized heterogeneous, polydisperse high molecular weight cell wall and secretory components of the fungus, two of which were identified as the GPI-anchored cell wall proteins Als3 and Hyr1. In addition, only the IgG2b inhibited in vitro two critical virulence attributes of the fungus, hyphal growth and adherence to human epithelial cells.Our study demonstrates that the isotype of anti-beta-glucan antibodies may affect details of the beta-glucan epitopes recognized, and this may be associated with a differing ability to inhibit virulence attributes of the fungus and confer protection in vivo. Our data also suggest that the anti-virulence properties of the IgG2b mAb may be linked to its capacity to recognize beta-glucan epitope(s) on some cell wall components that exert critical functions in fungal cell wall structure and adherence to host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094110777,"Background The management of many pathogens, which are of concern to humans and their livestock, is complicated by the pathogens' ability to cross-infect multiple host species, including wildlife. This has major implications for the management of such diseases, since the dynamics of infection are dependent on the rates of both intra- and inter-specific transmission. However, the difficulty of studying transmission networks in free-living populations means that the relative opportunities for intra- versus inter-specific disease transmission have not previously been demonstrated empirically within any wildlife-livestock disease system. Methodology/Principal Findings Using recently-developed proximity data loggers, we quantify both intra-and inter-specific contacts in a wildlife-livestock disease system, using bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in badgers and cattle in the UK as our example. We assess the connectedness of individuals within the networks in order to identify whether there are certain ‘high-risk’ individuals or groups of individuals for disease transmission within and between species. Our results show that contact patterns in both badger and cattle populations vary widely, both between individuals and over time. We recorded only infrequent interactions between badger social groups, although all badgers fitted with data loggers were involved in these inter-group contacts. Contacts between badgers and cattle occurred more frequently than contacts between different badger groups. Moreover, these inter-specific contacts involved those individual cows, which were highly connected within the cattle herd. Conclusions/Significance This work represents the first continuous time record of wildlife-host contacts for any free-living wildlife-livestock disease system. The results highlight the existence of specific individuals with relatively high contact rates in both livestock and wildlife populations, which have the potential to act as hubs in the spread of disease through complex contact networks. Targeting testing or preventive measures at high-contact groups and individuals within livestock populations would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of disease management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2168730320,"Understanding how the mechanical microenvironment influences cell fate, and more importantly, by what molecular mechanisms, will enhance not only the knowledge of mesenchymal stem cell biology but also the field of regenerative medicine. Mechanical stimuli, specifically loading induced oscillatory fluid flow, plays a vital role in promoting healthy bone development, homeostasis and morphology. Recent studies suggest that such loading induced fluid flow has the potential to regulate osteogenic differentiation via the upregulation of multiple osteogenic genes; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the transduction of a physical signal into altered cell fate have yet to be determined.Using immuno-staining, western blot analysis and luciferase assays, we demonstrate the oscillatory fluid flow regulates beta-catenin nuclear translocation and gene transcription. Additionally, real time RT-PCR analysis suggests that flow induces Wnt5a and Ror2 upregulation, both of which are essential for activating the small GTPase, RhoA, upon flow exposure. Furthermore, although beta-catenin phosphorylation is not altered by flow, its association with N-cadherin is, indicating that flow-induced beta-catenin signaling is initiated by adherens junction signaling.We propose that the mechanical microenvironment of bone has the potential to regulate osteogenic differentiation by initiating multiple key molecular pathways that are essential for such lineage commitment. Specifically, non-canonical Wnt5a signaling involving Ror2 and RhoA as well as N-cadherin mediated beta-catenin signaling are necessary for mechanically induced osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2072602645,"Background In spite of the scale-free degree distribution that characterizes most protein interaction networks (PINs), it is common to define an ad hoc degree scale that defines “hub” proteins having special topological and functional significance. This raises the concern that some conclusions on the functional significance of proteins based on network properties may not be robust. Methodology In this paper we present three objective methods to define hub proteins in PINs: one is a purely topological method and two others are based on gene expression and function. By applying these methods to four distinct PINs, we examine the extent of agreement among these methods and implications of these results on network construction. Conclusions We find that the methods agree well for networks that contain a balance between error-free and unbiased interactions, indicating that the hub concept is meaningful for such networks."
https://openalex.org/W1991053141,"BRAF, a cellular oncogene and effector of RAS-mediated signaling, is activated by mutation in approximately 60% of melanomas. Most of these mutations consist of a V600E substitution resulting in constitutive kinase activation. Mutant BRAF thus represents an important therapeutic target in melanoma. In an effort to produce a pre-clinical model of mutant BRAF function in melanoma, we have generated a mouse expressing BRAF V600E targeted to melanocytes. We show that in these transgenic mice, widespread benign melanocytic hyperplasia with histological features of nevi occurs, with biochemical evidence of senescence. Melanocytic hyperplasia progresses to overt melanoma with an incidence dependent on BRAF expression levels. Melanomas show CDKN2A loss, and genetic disruption of the CDKN2A locus greatly enhances melanoma formation, consistent with collaboration between BRAF activation and CDKN2A loss suggested from studies of human melanoma. The development of melanoma also involves activation of the Mapk and Akt signaling pathways and loss of senescence, findings that faithfully recapitulate those seen in human melanomas. This murine model of mutant BRAF-induced melanoma formation thus provides an important tool for identifying further genetic alterations that cooperates with BRAF and that may be useful in enhancing susceptibility to BRAF-targeted therapeutics in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1964432397,"Background Does diet-induced obesity persist after an obesigenic diet is removed? We investigated this question by providing male C57BL/6 mice with free access to two different obesigenic diets followed by a switch to chow to determine if obesity was reversible. Methodology/Principal Findings Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to five weight-matched groups: 1) C group that continuously received a chow diet; 2) HF group on a 60% high fat diet; 3) EN group on the high fat diet plus liquid Ensure®; 4) HF-C group switched from high fat to chow after 7 weeks; 5) EN-C group switched from high fat plus Ensure® to chow after 7 weeks. All food intake was ad libitum. Body weight was increased after 7 weeks on both obesigenic diets (44.6±0.65, 39.8±0.63, and 28.6±0.63 g for EN, HF, and C groups, respectively) and resulted in elevated concentrations of serum insulin, glucose, and leptin and lower serum triglycerides. Development of obesity in HF and EN mice was caused by increased energy intake and a relative decrease of average energy output along with decreased ambulatory activity. After the switch to chow, the HF-C and EN-C groups lost weight but subsequently maintained a state of persistent obesity in comparison to the C group (34.8±1.2, 34.1±1.2 vs. 30.8±0.8 g respectively; P<0.05) with a 40–50% increase of body fat. All serum hormones and metabolites returned to control levels with the exception of a trend for increased leptin. The HF-C and EN-C groups had an average energy output in line with the C group and the persistent obesity was maintained despite a non-significant increase of energy intake of less than 1 kcal/d at the end of the study. Conclusion Our results illustrate the importance of considering the history of energy imbalance in determining body weight and that a persistent elevation of body weight after removal of obesigenic diets can result from very small increases of energy intake."
https://openalex.org/W1994257433,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential to maintain gene expression patterns during development. Transcriptional repression by PcG proteins involves trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in animals and plants. PRC1 binds to H3K27me3 and is required for transcriptional repression in animals, but in plants PRC1-like activities have remained elusive. One candidate protein that could be involved in PRC1-like functions in plants is LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1), because LHP1 associates with genes marked by H3K27me3 in vivo and has a chromodomain that binds H3K27me3 in vitro. Here, we show that disruption of the chromodomain of Arabidopsis thaliana LHP1 abolishes H3K27me3 recognition, releases gene silencing and causes similar phenotypic alterations as transcriptional lhp1 null mutants. Therefore, binding to H3K27me3 is essential for LHP1 protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2085300356,"With-no-lysine kinase 4 (WNK4) inhibits electroneutral sodium chloride reabsorption by attenuating the cell surface expression of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC). The underlying mechanism for this effect remains poorly understood. Here, we explore how WNK4 affects the trafficking of NCC through its interactions with intracellular sorting machinery. An analysis of NCC cell surface lifetime showed that WNK4 did not alter the net rate of cotransporter internalization. In contrast, direct measurements of forward trafficking revealed that WNK4 attenuated the rate of NCC surface delivery, inhibiting the anterograde movement of cotransporters traveling to the plasma membrane from the trans-Golgi network. The response was paralleled by a dramatic reduction in NCC protein abundance, an effect that was sensitive to the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin, insensitive to proteasome inhibition, and attenuated by endogenous WNK4 knockdown. Subcellular localization studies performed in the presence of leupeptin revealed that WNK4 enhanced the accumulation of NCC in lysosomes. Moreover, NCC immunoprecipitated with endogenous AP-3 complexes, and WNK4 increased the fraction of cotransporters that associate with this adaptor, which facilitates cargo transport to lysosomes. WNK4 expression also increased LAMP-2-positive lysosomal content, indicating that the kinase may act by a general AP-3-dependent mechanism to promote cargo delivery into the lysosomal pathway. Taken together, these findings indicate that WNK4 inhibits NCC activity by diverting the cotransporter to the lysosome for degradation by way of an AP-3 transport carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2127537635,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, is a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel and a regulator of other ion channels and transporters. In epithelial cells CFTR is rapidly endocytosed from the apical plasma membrane and efficiently recycles back to the plasma membrane. Because ubiquitination targets endocytosed CFTR for degradation in the lysosome, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are likely to facilitate CFTR recycling. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to identify DUBs that regulate the post-endocytic sorting of CFTR. Using an activity-based chemical screen to identify active DUBs in human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated that Ubiquitin Specific Protease-10 (USP10) is located in early endosomes and regulates the deubiquitination of CFTR and its trafficking in the post-endocytic compartment. small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of USP10 increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation in lysosomes, and reduced both apical membrane CFTR and CFTR-mediated chloride secretion. Moreover, a dominant negative USP10 (USP10-C424A) increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation, whereas overexpression of wt-USP10 decreased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and increased the abundance of CFTR. These studies demonstrate a novel function for USP10 in facilitating the deubiquitination of CFTR in early endosomes and thereby enhancing the endocytic recycling of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2124268236,"Facial clefts are common birth defects with a strong genetic component. To identify fetal genetic risk factors for clefting, 1536 SNPs in 357 candidate genes were genotyped in two population-based samples from Scandinavia (Norway: 562 case-parent and 592 control-parent triads; Denmark: 235 case-parent triads).We used two complementary statistical methods, TRIMM and HAPLIN, to look for associations across these two national samples. TRIMM tests for association in each gene by using multi-SNP genotypes from case-parent triads directly without the need to infer haplotypes. HAPLIN on the other hand estimates the full haplotype distribution over a set of SNPs and estimates relative risks associated with each haplotype. For isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (I-CL/P), TRIMM and HAPLIN both identified significant associations with IRF6 and ADH1C in both populations, but only HAPLIN found an association with FGF12. For isolated cleft palate (I-CP), TRIMM found associations with ALX3, MKX, and PDGFC in both populations, but only the association with PDGFC was identified by HAPLIN. In addition, HAPLIN identified an association with ETV5 that was not detected by TRIMM.Strong associations with seven genes were replicated in the Scandinavian samples and our approach effectively replicated the strongest previously known association in clefting--with IRF6. Based on two national cleft cohorts of similar ancestry, two robust statistical methods and a large panel of SNPs in the most promising cleft candidate genes to date, this study identified a previously unknown association with clefting for ADH1C and provides additional candidates and analytic approaches to advance the field."
https://openalex.org/W2112649634,"Background An arg120gly (R120G) missense mutation in HSPB5 (α-β-crystallin ), which belongs to the small heat shock protein (HSP) family, causes desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRM), a muscle disease that is characterized by the formation of inclusion bodies, which can contain pre-amyloid oligomer intermediates (amyloid oligomer). While we have shown that small HSPs can directly interrupt amyloid oligomer formation, the in vivo protective effects of the small HSPs on the development of DRM is still uncertain. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to extend the previous in vitro findings to in vivo, we used geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a potent HSP inducer. Oral administration of GGA resulted not only in up-regulation of the expression level of HSPB8 and HSPB1 in the heart of HSPB5 R120G transgenic (R120G TG) mice, but also reduced amyloid oligomer levels and aggregates. Furthermore, R120G TG mice treated with GGA exhibited decreased heart size and less interstitial fibrosis, as well as improved cardiac function and survival compared to untreated R120G TG mice. To address possible mechanism(s) for these beneficial effects, cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing HSPB8 were generated. Overexpression of HSPB8 led to a reduction in amyloid oligomer and aggregate formation, resulting in improved cardiac function and survival. Treatment with GGA as well as the overexpression of HSPB8 also inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria, activation of caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cardiomyocyte death in the R120G TG mice. Conclusions/Significance Expression of small HSPs such as HSPB8 and HSPB1 by GGA may be a new therapeutic strategy for patients with DRM."
https://openalex.org/W1996112172,"Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2) is both a protein cross-linking enzyme and a cell adhesion molecule with an elusive unconventional secretion pathway. In normal conditions, TG2-mediated modification of the extracellular matrix modulates cell motility, proliferation and tissue repair, but under continuous cell insult, higher expression and elevated extracellular trafficking of TG2 contribute to the pathogenesis of tissue scarring. In search of TG2 ligands that could contribute to its regulation, we characterized the affinity of TG2 for heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin, an analogue of the chains of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). By using heparin/HS solid-binding assays and surface plasmon resonance we showed that purified TG2 has high affinity for heparin/HS, comparable to that for fibronectin, and that cell-surface TG2 interacts with heparin/HS. We demonstrated that cell-surface TG2 directly associates with the HS chains of syndecan-4 without the mediation of fibronectin, which has affinity for both syndecan-4 and TG2. Functional inhibition of the cell-surface HS chains of wild-type and syndecan-4-null fibroblasts revealed that the extracellular cross-linking activity of TG2 depends on the HS of HSPG and that syndecan-4 plays a major but not exclusive role. We found that heparin binding did not alter TG2 activity per se. Conversely, fibroblasts deprived of syndecan-4 were unable to effectively externalize TG2, resulting in its cytosolic accumulation. We propose that the membrane trafficking of TG2, and hence its extracellular activity, is linked to TG2 binding to cell-surface HSPG.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2344-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a process reported to affect membrane targeting of non-conventional secreted proteins (25.Muesch A. Hartmann E. Rohde K. Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Rapoport T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 86-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Two main binding partners for TG2, FN and integrin-β1, have both been attributed a possible role in the transport of TG2 to the cell surface (8.Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 26.Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). FN was shown to co-localize with TG2 once released (26.Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and integrin-β1 to co-associate with TG2 in cells induced to differentiate (8.Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). TG2 has also long been known to have some affinity for heparin (27.Signorini M. Bortolotti F. Poltronieri L. Bergamini C.M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1988; 369: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28.Gambetti S. Dondi A. Cervellati C. Squerzanti M. Pansini F.S. Bergamini C.M. Biochimie. (Paris). 2005; 87: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a highly sulfated analogue of heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains, which are abundant constituents of the cell surface/ECM. HS chains are linear polysaccharides consisting of alternating N-acetylated or N-sulfated glucosamine units (GlcNAc or GlcNS), and uronic acids (glucuronic acid GlcA or iduronic acid IdoA residues) (29.Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), which only exist covalently bound to the core protein of cell-surface proteoglycans (syndecans and glypicans) and secreted proteoglycans (29.Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Heparin binding is a property common to many ECM proteins (29.Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), but the level of affinity has never been established for TG2, which makes it difficult to estimate the real biological significance of this interaction. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) bind ECM ligands through the HS chains, influencing their biological activity, trafficking, and secretion. Among the HSPG subfamilies, the syndecans act as co-receptors for both ECM components and soluble ligands (30.Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Bass M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and syndecan-4 has overlapping roles with extracellular TG2 in wound healing and fibrosis (31.Verderio E.A. Scarpellini A. Johnson T.S. Amino. Acids. 2008; 36: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32.Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F. Detmar M. Goetinck P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: R9-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that TG2 has a surprisingly high affinity for heparin and HS, raising the hypothesis that HSPG are involved in its biological activity. We demonstrate that HSPGs are essential for the transamidating activity of TG2 at the cell surface and that syndecan-4 acts as a receptor for TG2, which is involved in the trafficking and cell-surface localization, and thus activity of TG2. A 3000 Biacore system, CM4 sensor chips, amine coupling kit and HBS-P buffer were from Biacore AB. Biotin-LC-hydrazide was from Pierce.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM-F12-HAM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Wild-type and TG2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (34.De Laurenzi V. Melino G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) were donated by G.

Swiss-3T3 cell lines capable of inducible expression of TG2 (clone TG3) (7.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp.

Bass, Manchester University) into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). Transient transfection of pcDNAhS4 into syndecan-4-null MDF was performed by electroporation, using NucleofectorII (Amaxa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was ≥60% when estimated by transfecting the reporter plasmid pEGFPN1 (Clontech). RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy mini-Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription of DNase-treated RNA (1 μg) was performed using Superscript™-II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (Promega). For PCR, the following primers were used (5′→3′): tggaaagctgtggcgtgat and ccctgttgctgtagccgtat (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase); gggggcattctaagtccagt and tatcccgctatccccctacat (mouse syndecan-4); atgatgttccagattatgct and gcgtagaactcattggtgggg (human syndecan-4); agtatgagcatgggcaacga and atacaggggatcggaaagtg (mouse TG2). The amplifications were conducted at 95 °C (60 s), 60 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (30 s), for 30 cycles. For syndecan-4, the annealing temperature was 54 °C. Low molecular mass heparin (4–6 kDa) or HS (12 kDa) was dissolved in PBS and immobilized on 96-well heparin-binding plates (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A concentration of 4.6 μm was shown to be optimal for assaying heparin-binding proteins using these plates (37.Mahoney D.J. Whittle J.D. Milner C.M. Clark S.J. Mulloy B. Buttle D.J. Jones G.C. Day A.J. Short R.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As positive and negative controls, FN (5 μg/ml) and BSA (5 μg/ml) were immobilized on tissue culture plates as described (13.Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42604-42614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The plate was washed three times with PBS and incubated with blocking solution (3% w/v BSA, in PBS, pH 7.4), for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS, plates were incubated with gplTG2 (0–212 nm), diluted in blocking buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, for 2 h at 37 °C. In some instance, EDTA was replaced by 2 mm CaCl2 or supplemented by inactivating concentrations of GTPγ-S (100 μm). The plate was washed with PBS, and the bound TG2 was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type assay using anti-TG2 antibody Cub7402 (13.Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42604-42614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Binding data were fit to “one site specific binding model” (R2 values of 0.95–0.98) using GraphPad Prism 5.0. The returned Bmax values confirmed that the interactions between TG2 and heparin/HS were saturable. Size-defined heparin (6 kDa), was biotinylated at its reducing end with Biotin-LC-hydrazide and immobilized on a Biacore sensorchip. For this purpose, two flow cells of a CM4 sensorchip were activated with 50 μl of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, before injection of 50 μl of streptavidin (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5). The remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of ethanolamine (1 m, pH 8.5). Typically, this procedure permitted coupling of ∼3500 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin. Biotinylated heparin (5 μg/ml) in HBS containing 0.3 m NaCl was then injected across one flow cell to obtain an immobilization level of 50 RU. The other one was left untreated and served as a negative control. For binding assays, 80 μl of purified TG2 (0–586 nm), diluted in EDTA-containing HBS-P buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P 20), at 25 °C, were simultaneously injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min (kinetic mode) across the control and heparin surfaces, after which the formed complexes were washed with running buffer for 5 min. The sensorchip surface was regenerated with a 1-min pulse of 0.025% SDS followed by a 5-min pulse of 2 m NaCl in HBS-P buffer. Control sensorgrams were subtracted on line from the heparin sensorgrams, and results were analyzed using the Biaeval 3.1 software. Confluent cell monolayers were detached using 2 mm EDTA in PBS, to preserve cell-surface proteins, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of heparitinase (30 milliunits/ml) in serum-free medium. Cells were then homogenized in ice-cold hypotonic Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors and after low speed centrifugation (to remove remaining whole cells and nuclei), crude plasma membranes were prepared as previously described (38.Germack R. Dickenson J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein estimation was performed using DC (Folin) assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of membrane proteins (500 μg) were then solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% v/v IGEPAL CA 630, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.5% v/v deoxycholic acid, protease inhibitors and pre-cleared with protein-G-agarose incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Membrane lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubation with rabbit anti-syndecan-4 antibody (against a syndecan-4-endopeptide) (2 μg) or anti-TG2 antibody TG100 or, as a negative control, rabbit anti-gliadin antibody (2 μg). In some instances the syndecan-4 immunoprecipitates were further incubated with 30 milliunits/ml heparitinase in lysis buffer at 37 °C for 1 h prior to further analysis. The immunocomplexes were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and immunoprobed with the antibodies against TG2, syndecan-4, or anti-human plasma FN antibody. Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, bands were revealed by enhanced EZ-ECL chemiluminescence (Geneflow), using Fujifilm image analyzer-3000. Densitometry of the bands was conducted by Aida ID/evaluation 3.44. Non-enzymatically detached cells were fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions as described above. Total and cell fraction lysates (30 μg) were resolved by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, and TG2 was detected by Western blotting using anti-TG2 polyclonal antibody Ab10445/50 (1/1000) in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in TBST). TG2 was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence, after incubation with rabbit anti-goat-horseradish peroxidase (Dako), as described above. Tubulin and Na+/K+-ATPase were revealed as loading controls for cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. For flow cytometry, HOB cell monolayers were detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. Live, non-permeabilized cells in suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) were stained for cell-surface HSPG with anti-HS antibody 10E4 conjugated with FITC (8 μg/ml), in serum-free DMEM medium for 2 h at +4 °C. After washing in serum-free medium, cells were fixed in 0.5% (v/v) formaldehyde, and analyzed in a Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). In some instances, cells in suspension were pre-treated with heparitinase in serum-free medium, or kept in serum-free medium only, for 1 h at 37 °C, prior to staining of HS. TG2 activity associated with the extracellular surface was assayed in live cells in culture by measuring the incorporation of biotin-cadaverine into FN, as described (7.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 39.Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated into 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) precoated with plasma FN (5 μg/ml) in serum-free DMEM (which contains an activating concentration of Ca2+), in the presence of the amine substrate biotinylated cadaverine (0.1 mm). Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C, then washed with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA and incubated with 0.1% deoxycholate in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA. The biotylated cadaverine incorporated into the deoxycholate-insoluble FN matrix was revealed by incubation with ExtrAvidin peroxidase followed by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine at fixed time and stopped by 0.5 m H2SO4. Spectrophotometric absorbances were measured at 450 nm. For detection of TG2 activity in cell homogenates and fractions we used the method described by Balklava et al. (9.Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). TG2 activity in total and cell fraction homogenates was quantified by a modification of the cell-surface TG2 activity protocol, assaying 60 μg of protein lysates. Cell lysates were incubated in FN-coated 96-well plates in the presence of 0.1 mm biotinylated-cadaverine, further supplemented with either 5 mm Ca2+ or 2 mm EDTA. The level of incorporated biotin-cadaverine into FN was revealed as described above. Background TG2 activity values in the presence of EDTA were subtracted from activity values at 5 mm Ca2+. A standard curve of TG2 activity was obtained each time by assaying known quantities of purified TG2, diluted in serum-free DMEM in the same way. For TG2 staining, cells were allowed to adhere on 8-well chamber slides (104 MDF cells/well), in normal culture conditions (10% fetal calf serum-containing medium) for 2 h. Adhered cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Fixed and permeabilized cells were blocked in 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS and then incubated with anti-TG2 antibody clone Cub7402 (2 μg/ml) at +4 °C for 15 h, followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Dako) diluted 1/100 at 37 °C for 2 h (7.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26.Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Specificity of Cub7402 was verified in TG2-null cells. Detection of actin stress fibers and TG2 was achieved by incubation of fixed and permeabilized cells with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (20 μg/ml) in blocking buffer, which was added after incubation with Cub7402, together with the secondary antibody after extensive washings in PBS. Detection of syndecan-4 and TG2 was achieved by incubating the fixed and permeabilized cells with rabbit anti-syndecan-4 antibody (2 μg/ml) and Cub7402, at +4 °C for 15 h, followed by either anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor488 and anti-mouse IgG-Rhodamine RedX (Invitrogen) (MDF cells) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor568 (Invitrogen) and sheep anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Dako) (diluted 1/100) (HOB cells). There is not overlap in emission spectrum of the fluorochromes used. To detect matrix-associated TG2, cells were incubated with the antibody in culture prior to fixation as described (7.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9.Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To visualize TG2 activity in situ, cells were seeded into 8-well glass chamber slides in the presence of 0.5 mm fluorescein-cadaverine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), for a total of 15 h, as previously described (7.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9.Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nuclei were stained using fluorochrome 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or propidium iodide. Fluorescence images were obtained by a Leica TCSNT confocal laser microscope and corresponded to the central optical plane of the basal cell sections. Serum-starved cells (maintained at 0.1% fetal calf serum for 15 h) were allowed to attach in serum-free medium to wells (104 cells/well of 96-well plates) either coated with low molecular mass heparin (2.3–4.6 μm) or HS (1.2–4.6 μm) and, as positive and negative controls, coated with FN and BSA (5 μg/ml), respectively. The attached cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet; after extensive washes in PBS adherent cells were solubilized in 30% (v/v) acetic acid, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) as described (9.Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16"

Our research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to injury or adaptation to hypoxic stress using Drosophila as a model system. Our current genome-wide study is designed to investigate gene expression changes and identify protective mechanism(s) in D. melanogaster after exposure to severe (1% O(2)) intermittent or constant hypoxia.Our microarray analysis has identified multiple gene families that are up- or down-regulated in response to acute CH or IH. We observed distinct responses to IH and CH in gene expression that varied in the number of genes and type of gene families. We then studied the role of candidate genes (up-or down-regulated) in hypoxia tolerance (adult survival) for longer periods (CH-7 days, IH-10 days) under severe CH or IH. Heat shock proteins up-regulation (specifically Hsp23 and Hsp70) led to a significant increase in adult survival (as compared to controls) of P-element lines during CH. In contrast, during IH treatment the up-regulation of Mdr49 and l(2)08717 genes (P-element lines) provided survival advantage over controls. This suggests that the increased transcript levels following treatment with either paradigm play an important role in tolerance to severe hypoxia. Furthermore, by over-expressing Hsp70 in specific tissues, we found that up-regulation of Hsp70 in heart and brain play critical role in tolerance to CH in flies.We observed that the gene expression response to IH or CH is specific and paradigm-dependent. We have identified several genes Hsp23, Hsp70, CG1600, l(2)08717 and Mdr49 that play an important role in hypoxia tolerance whether it is in CH or IH. These data provide further clues about the mechanisms by which IH or CH lead to cell injury and morbidity or adaptation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2024763293,"The endogenous ligands for free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1) are medium and longer chain free fatty acids. However, a range of selective, small molecule ligands have recently been developed as tool compounds to explore the therapeutic potential of this receptor, whereas clinically employed thiazolidinedione “glitazone” drugs are also agonists at FFA1. Each of these classes of agonist was able to promote phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in cells able to express human FFA1 on demand. However, although both lauric acid and the synthetic agonist GW9508X produced rapid and transient ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation, the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone produced responses that were sustained for a substantially longer period. Despite this difference, the effects of each ligand required FFA1 and were transduced in each case predominantly via G proteins of the Gαq/Gα11 family. Different glitazone drugs also displayed markedly different efficacy and kinetics of sustainability of ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation. A number of orthosteric binding site mutants of FFA1 were generated, and despite variations in the changes of potency and efficacy of the three ligand classes in different functional end point assays, these were consistent with rosiglitazone also binding at the orthosteric site. Four distinct polymorphic variants of human FFA1 have been described. Despite previous indications that these display differences in function and pharmacology, they all responded in entirely equivalent ways to lauric acid, rosiglitazone, and GW9508X in measures of ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation, enhancement of binding of [35S]GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate) to Gαq, and elevation of intracellular [Ca2+], suggesting that individuals expressing each variant are likely to respond equivalently to orthosteric agonists of FFA1.

Phospho-specific and total anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA). Antiserum directed against green fluorescent protein and cross-reactive with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) was produced in-house. The Proteome Profiler human phospho-kinase array kit was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human FFA1 was fused via the C terminus to eYFP or Gαq and, in the case of hFFA1-eYFP, subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen), as described previously (30Canals M. Jenkins L. Kellett E. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16757-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Individual binding site mutations and polymorphisms were introduced into pcDNA5/FRT/TO-hFFA1-eYFP or pcDNA3/hFFA1-Gαq using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, catalog number 41965) supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture, and 10 μg/ml blasticidin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1). Inducible Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells were generated for hFFA1-eYFP and the various binding mutants and human polymorphisms. Briefly, cells were transfected with a mixture containing the desired receptor cDNA in pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector and the pOG44 vector (1:9) using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell maintenance and selection were as described elsewhere (30Canals M. Jenkins L. Kellett E. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16757-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Antibiotic-resistant clones were screened for receptor expression by both fluorescence and Western blotting. To induce expression of receptors cloned into the Flp-In locus, cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline as indicated. Cell stimulations and lysates were prepared for Western blotting, AlphaScreen, and Proteome Profiler experiments in a similar manner. Briefly, cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates (6- and 12-well tissue culture grade plates except AlphaScreen, which required 40,000 cells/well of a 96-well plate) and simultaneously induced with 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline as required. Before stimulation, cells were serum-starved either overnight or for 4 h (AlphaScreen) in cell culture medium lacking dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS). Stimulation of cells was arrested on ice, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For detection of hFFA1-eYFP or ERK1/2 by immunoblot, lysates were harvested in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 5% ethylene glycol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Diagnostics, Herfordshire, UK, pH 7.4), rocked for 30 min at 4 °C, and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes for centrifugation at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 15 min to pellet insoluble cell debris. Supernatant was diluted in Laemmli buffer (63 mm Tris, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm SDS, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8, with 0.004% bromphenol blue) and either boiled for 5 min (ERK1/2) or heated to 65 °C degrees (hFFA1 receptor detection). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described recently (31Canals M. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11424-11434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For SureFire pERK1/2 and Proteome Profiler experiments, cells were lysed in appropriate lysis buffers provided with the kits, and samples were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunocytochemistry and live cell imaging, hFFA1-eYFP Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline for incubation times as indicated. To determine localization and extent of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cells were stimulated with ligand as indicated and then fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde solution before immunostaining with the same pERK1/2 antibody as for Western blots and an Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse secondary antibody. Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear staining. For live cell imaging of receptor expression, coverslips were placed into a microscope chamber containing physiological saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4), illuminated with an ultra high point intensity 75-watt xenon arc lamp (Optosource, Cairn Research, Faversham, Kent, UK) at 500 nm, and imaged using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon ×40 oil immersion Fluor objective lens (NA = 1.3) and a monochromator (Optoscan, Cairn Research). Fluorescence emission at 535 nm was monitored using a high resolution interline transfer-cooled digital CCD camera (Cool Snap-HQ, Roper Scientific/Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downing, PA) was used for control of the monochromator and CCD camera and for processing of the cell image data. MetaMorph software was used to analyze the images. Population cell calcium changes were assessed in Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells harboring hFFA1-eYFP and polymorphisms/binding mutants that were treated with or without 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline. Cells were grown in poly-d-lysine-coated wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. 24 h after induction, cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2, as described previously (32Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Jenkins L. Brown A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32913-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the response to FFA1 ligands was assessed using a FLEXStation (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA). For hFFA1 activation experiments, HEK293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of wild type or mutant hFFA1-Gαq fusion receptor cDNA, and membranes were prepared after 24 h, as described elsewhere (21Stoddart L.A. Brown A.J. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding experiments were initiated by the addition of 5 μg of cell membranes to an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm GDP, 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, and 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS) containing the given concentration of agonist. Each reaction was performed in the presence of 10 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin as we have previously demonstrated that this step is required to prevent FFA1 binding of endogenous agonists released by membrane preparation (21Stoddart L.A. Brown A.J. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the above conditions with the addition of 100 μm GTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm ascorbic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 0.2% SDS. Samples were precleared with Pansorbin followed by immunoprecipitation with C-terminal Gq/G11 antiserum CQ (33Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, the immunocomplexes were washed once with solubilization buffer, and bound [35S]GTPγS was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Densitometry was performed on pERK1/2 Western blots and x-ray films from Proteome Profiler experiments using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). All data were quantified and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 and are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05 according to Student's unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons, as appropriate. hFFA1 was C-terminally tagged with eYFP and cloned into the Flp-In locus of Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells as described previously (21Stoddart L.A. Brown A.J. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of hFFA1-eYFP could not be detected in the absence of inducer (supplemental Fig. 1), but the addition of doxycycline (0.5 μg/ml) for varying times resulted in expression of proteins with apparent mass close to 70 kDa in lysates of these cells that were detected by an in-house-generated anti-green fluorescent protein antiserum and that reached maximal levels within 36 h (supplemental Fig. 1A) and were sustained for at least 72 h (data not shown). Fluorescence imaging of these cells showed the expressed eYFP-tagged receptor to be located predominantly at the cell surface (supplemental Fig. 1B). We have previously used these cells (21Stoddart L.A. Brown A.J. Milligan G. Mol.

In both cases, phosphorylation of these kinases was rapid, reaching a maximal level within 5–10 min of exposure to the ligand, and transient, returning to close to basal levels within 60 min (Fig. 1A).

Barriers are largely formed by endothelial cell-cell contacts built up by VE-cadherin and are under the control of RhoGTPases. Here we show that a natural plasmin digest product of fibrin, peptide Bß15-42 (also called FX06), significantly reduces vascular leak and mortality in animal models for Dengue shock syndrome. The ability of Bß15-42 to preserve endothelial barriers is confirmed in rats i.v.-injected with LPS. In endothelial cells, Bß15-42 prevents thrombin-induced stress fiber formation, myosin light chain phosphorylation and RhoA activation. The molecular key for the protective effect of Bß15-42 is the src kinase Fyn, which associates with VE-cadherin-containing junctions. Following exposure to Bß15-42 Fyn dissociates from VE-cadherin and associates with p190RhoGAP, a known antagonists of RhoA activation. The role of Fyn in transducing effects of Bß15-42 is confirmed in Fyn−/− mice, where the peptide is unable to reduce LPS-induced lung edema, whereas in wild type littermates the peptide significantly reduces leak. Our results demonstrate a novel function for Bß15-42. Formerly mainly considered as a degradation product occurring after fibrin inactivation, it has now to be considered as a signaling molecule. It stabilizes endothelial barriers and thus could be an attractive adjuvant in the treatment of shock."

https://openalex.org/W1984739330,"Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into female and male germ cells in vitro. Primate ES cells can also differentiate into immature germ cells in vitro. However, little is known about the differentiation markers and culture conditions for in vitro germ cell differentiation from ES cells in primates. Monkey ES cells are thus considered to be a useful model to study primate gametogenesis in vitro. Therefore, in order to obtain further information on germ cell differentiation from primate ES cells, this study examined the ability of cynomolgus monkey ES cells to differentiate into germ cells in vitro.To explore the differentiation markers for detecting germ cells differentiated from ES cells, the expression of various germ cell marker genes was examined in tissues and ES cells of the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). VASA is a valuable gene for the detection of germ cells differentiated from ES cells. An increase of VASA expression was observed when differentiation was induced in ES cells via embryoid body (EB) formation. In addition, the expression of other germ cell markers, such as NANOS and PIWIL1 genes, was also up-regulated as the EB differentiation progressed. Immunocytochemistry identified the cells expressing stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA) 1, OCT-4, and VASA proteins in the EBs. These cells were detected in the peripheral region of the EBs as specific cell populations, such as SSEA1-positive, OCT-4-positive cells, OCT-4-positive, VASA-positive cells, and OCT-4-negative, VASA-positive cells. Thereafter, the effect of mouse gonadal cell-conditioned medium and growth factors on germ cell differentiation from monkey ES cells was examined, and this revealed that the addition of BMP4 to differentiating ES cells increased the expression of SCP1, a meiotic marker gene.VASA is a valuable gene for the detection of germ cells differentiated from ES cells in monkeys, and the identification and characterization of germ cells derived from ES cells are possible by using reported germ cell markers in vivo, including SSEA1, OCT-4, and VASA, in vitro as well as in vivo. These findings are thus considered to help elucidate the germ cell developmental process in primates."
https://openalex.org/W1973032013,"Wnt5a is a member of the wingless-type patterning regulators important in pre-natal development. The expression and distribution of Wnt5a and its receptors frizzled (fzd) 3 and fzd 5 in adult human skin have not been comprehensively studied to date.We here show that Wnt5a, fzd3, fzd5, as well as fzd6 are restricted to specific layers in normal epidermis, analogous to their zonal distribution in hair follicles, suggesting a role in adult skin differentiation. In line, Wnt5a and fzd5 are both overexpressed and re-distributed in the epidermis of psoriasis which involves disturbed keratinocyte differentiation. Functionally, Wnt5a lowers the concentration of IFN required to induce target genes, and increases the magnitude of IFN target gene induction, suggesting a molecular mechanism underlying IFN hypersensitivity in psoriasis. Finally, we identify nedd8 and the amyloid precursor APP, previously shown to be upregulated in psoriasis, as targets of synergistic IFNalpha/Wnt5a induction.The present data (i) suggest that Wnt5a regulates epidermal differentiation even in adult skin and (ii) identify synergistic induction of type 1 IFN target genes as a novel mode of Wnt5a action. Targeting Wnt5a in the skin may reduce IFN hypersensitivity and be of therapeutical value."
https://openalex.org/W2142125312,"Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease (AIED) is poorly characterized clinically, with no definitive laboratory test. All patients suspected of having AIED are given glucocorticoids during periods of acute hearing loss, however, only half initially respond, and still fewer respond over time. We hypothesized that AIED is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunctional peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) responses to a unique cochlear antigen(s). To test this hypothesis, we examined end-stage AIED patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery and compared autologous perilymph stimulated PBMC from AIED patients to controls. We determined that autologous perilymph from AIED patients was unable to induce expression of a long membrane-bound Interleukin-1 Receptor Type II (mIL1R2) transcript in PBMC as compared with controls, despite similar expression of the short soluble IL1R2 (sIL1R2) transcript (p<0.05). IL1R2 is a molecular decoy that traps interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and does not initiate subsequent signaling events, thereby suppressing an inflammatory response. IL1R2 transcript length is regulated by alternate splicing, and the major inhibitory function is attributed to the full-length mIL1R2. In addition, IL1R2 expression is induced by dexamethasone. Separately, we prospectively examined patients with newer onset glucocorticoid-responsive AIED. Immediately prior to clinical treatment for acute deterioration of hearing thresholds, their PBMC demonstrated a robust induction of mIL1R2 in PBMC in response to dexamethasone in vitro that correlated with a clinical response to prednisone in vivo (p<0.0001) as measured by hearing restoration. In contrast, clinically steroid unresponsive patients demonstrated high basal levels of mIL1R2 in their PBMC and only minimally augmented expression in response to dexamethasone. Thus, induced expression of mIL1R2 appears to be a protective mechanism in hearing homeostasis and warrants further investigation in a large prospective clinical trial to determine if IL1R2 can be used as a specific biomarker for AIED."
https://openalex.org/W2028561024,"Iron stored in phytoferritin plays an important role in the germination and early growth of seedlings. The protein is located in the amyloplast where it stores large amounts of iron as a hydrated ferric oxide mineral core within its shell-like structure. The present work was undertaken to study alternate mechanisms of core formation in pea seed ferritin (PSF). The data reveal a new mechanism for mineral core formation in PSF involving the binding and oxidation of iron at the extension peptide (EP) located on the outer surface of the protein shell. This binding induces aggregation of the protein into large assemblies of approximately 400 monomers. The bound iron is gradually translocated to the mineral core during which time the protein dissociates back into its monomeric state. Either the oxidative addition of Fe(2+) to the apoprotein to form Fe(3+) or the direct addition of Fe(3+) to apoPSF causes protein aggregation once the binding capacity of the 24 ferroxidase centers (48 Fe(3+)/shell) is exceeded. When the EP is enzymatically deleted from PSF, aggregation is not observed, and the rate of iron oxidation is significantly reduced, demonstrating that the EP is a critical structural component for iron binding, oxidation, and protein aggregation. These data point to a functional role for the extension peptide as an iron binding and ferroxidase center that contributes to mineralization of the iron core. As the iron core grows larger, the new pathway becomes less important, and Fe(2+) oxidation and deposition occurs directly on the surface of the iron core."
https://openalex.org/W2037978051,"Background Recurrent climatic oscillations have produced dramatic changes in species distributions. This process has been proposed to be a major evolutionary force, shaping many life history traits of species, and to govern global patterns of biodiversity at different scales. During range expansions selection may favor the evolution of higher dispersal, and symbiotic interactions may be affected. It has been argued that a weakness of climate fluctuation-driven range dynamics at equatorial latitudes has facilitated the persistence there of more specialized species and interactions. However, how much the biology and ecology of species is changed by range dynamics has seldom been investigated, particularly in equatorial regions. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied a three-species symbiosis endemic to coastal equatorial rainforests in Cameroon, where the impact of range dynamics is supposed to be limited, comprised of two species-specific obligate mutualists –an ant-plant and its protective ant– and a species-specific ant parasite of this mutualism. We combined analyses of within-species genetic diversity and of phenotypic variation in a transect at the southern range limit of this ant-plant system. All three species present congruent genetic signatures of recent gradual southward expansion, a result compatible with available regional paleoclimatic data. As predicted, this expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of more dispersive traits in the two ant species. In contrast, we detected no evidence of change in lifetime reproductive strategy in the tree, nor in its investment in food resources provided to its symbiotic ants. Conclusions/Significance Despite the decreasing investment in protective workers and the increasing investment in dispersing females by both the mutualistic and the parasitic ant species, there was no evidence of destabilization of the symbiosis at the colonization front. To our knowledge, we provide here the first evidence at equatorial latitudes that biological traits associated with dispersal are affected by the range expansion dynamics of a set of interacting species."
https://openalex.org/W2039675452,"Notch signaling is activated in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer cells because of overexpression of Notch3, but the role of Notch ligands has not been fully defined. On the basis of gene expression profiling of a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, we found that the predominant Notch ligands were JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, and DLL3. Given that Notch ligands reportedly have overlapping receptor binding specificities, we postulated that they have redundant biological roles. Arguing against this hypothesis, we found that JAG1 and JAG2 were differentially regulated; JAG1 expression was dependent upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation in HCC827 cells, which require EGFR for survival, whereas JAG2 expression was EGFR-independent in these cells. Furthermore, HCC827 cells underwent apoptosis following depletion of JAG1 but not JAG2, whereas co-culture experiments revealed that depletion of JAG2, but not JAG1, enhanced the ability of HCC827 cells to chemoattract THP-1 human monocytes. JAG2-depleted HCC827 cells expressed high levels of inflammation-related genes, including interleukin 1 (IL1) and a broad range of IL1-regulated cytokines, which was attenuated by inhibition of IL1 receptor (IL1R). Our findings suggest that JAG1 and JAG2 have distinct biological roles including a previously undiscovered role for JAG2 in regulating the expression of cytokines that can promote antitumor immunity.

In mammals, there are four Notch homologues (Notch1–4) and five ligands (three Delta-like and two Jagged/Serrate) (1Fiúza U.M. Arias A.M. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 194: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Receptor and ligand are typically presented on neighboring cells; hence, ligand binding is a means of cell-cell communication. Notch participates in key aspects of organogenesis (lateral inhibition, lineage specification, and boundary formation) in the developing embryo, maintains stem cell viability and renewal in the adult, and has been implicated in multiple human cancers (1Fiúza U.M. Arias A.M. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 194: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In the developing lung, Notch receptors and ligands are expressed in a cell type-specific manner, increase in abundance from embryonic day 11.5 into adulthood, and contribute to cell lineage specification (2Collins B.J. Kleeberger W. Ball D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence supports a role for Notch in tumorigenesis. Notch1 was first identified in humans as the Tan1 oncogene, fusing the control region of the T-cell receptor B gene to a truncated, active form of Notch1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3Ellisen L.W.

Subsequently, oncogenic forms of Notch2 were discovered in feline thymic lymphomas, and Notch4 was found to be an insertion site for mouse mammary tumor virus (4Rohn J.L. Lauring A.S.

Unlike the solid body of evidence supporting a role for Notch, less is known about the importance of Notch ligands in cancer. Notch ligands function as Notch signaling agonists through intercellular interactions (trans-interactions) and as Notch signaling antagonists through intracellular interactions (cis-interactions) (13D'Souza B. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5148-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, Notch ligands bind to Notch family members non-selectively; for example, Jagged-1 and Jagged-2 can both bind to Notch1, Notch2, and probably Notch3 (14Shimizu K. Chiba S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting a high degree of redundancy in mammalian cells to maintain Notch activity. However, mice that are null for the genes encoding Jagged-1 (Jag1), Jagged-2 (Jag2), or Delta-like ligand4 (Dll4) exhibit distinct embryonic defects (13D'Souza B. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5148-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), suggesting that these ligands exert unique actions that cannot be explained entirely by their receptor binding activities. Indeed, these ligands have intrinsic ligand signaling activity independent of Notch and undergo multiple post-translational modifications, proteolytic processing, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking (13D'Souza B. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5148-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), all of which may contribute to the multifunctionality of Notch ligands. In this study, we examined Notch ligand expression in a panel of NSCLC cell lines and found that they co-expressed multiple ligands, including JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, and DLL3. Further analysis revealed that the expression of JAG1 and JAG2 was regulated independently, and these ligands had distinct biological roles, including a novel finding that JAG2 regulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, JAG1 and JAG2 have non-redundant functions in NSCLC cells. Gefitinib was a gift (Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE). We purchased a recombinant human IL1RA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen), polyclonal antibodies derived in goat against Jag1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and in rabbits against Jag2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-goat secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and an antibody against β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The NSCLC cell lines used in this study were from the Hamon Center Repository or purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine. The siRNA control (siCTL nontargeting pool) and the siRNA pooled oligonucleotides against human JAG1 and JAG2 were purchased (Dharmacon, Denver, CO). Cells were transfected at 50% confluency using 10 nm of each construct over a 16-h period using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon). The short hairpin RNA plasmid constructs against human JAG2 and corresponding empty vector were purchased (Origene, Rockville, MD). Cells were transfected at 50% confluency using 3 μg of each construct over a 4-h period with TransPass D1 transfection reagent (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, medium was replaced with medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. After 14 days, the cells were trypsinized, seeded on 10-cm plates at low density, and single colonies were selected and expanded. RNAs were labeled and hybridized to the Illumina expression array WG6-V2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The array contains 48,701 probes, which correspond to 26,390 distinct Unigene IDs. Array data were background-corrected using the MBCB R package (16Ding L.H. Xie Y. Park S. Xiao G. Story M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e58Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and quantile-normalized. All genes on the array were BLAST-verified and annotated using recent versions of public National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases, and all cell lines were mycoplasma-tested and DNA-fingerprinted. Heat maps were generated using JavaTreeView (17Saldanha A.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3246-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar) of absolute signal intensities using the equation log2(x + 50) − log2(100). RNA was isolated from the cells transfected with siRNAs against JAG1, JAG2, or scrambled controls by using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 2 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA. Expression profiling of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors was performed with human inflammatory cytokines and receptor RT2 Profiler PCR array (SABioscience, Frederick, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with the ABI Prism 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The ΔΔCt method was used to analyze the expression level of each gene. After PCR, the dissociation curve for each gene was examined to exclude ones with nonspecific amplification or with undetectable expression. The expression profiling of each gene was displayed as a heat map made by using MeV MultiExperiment Viewer 4.1 (18Rhodes D.R. Tomlins S.A. Varambally S. Mahavisno V. Barrette T. Kalyana-Sundaram S. Ghosh D. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The level of mRNA for each gene was measured with SYBR Green-based real-time PCR. The primers used for real-time PCR were designed by using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences used are listed in supplemental Table 1. Each cDNA sample (7 μl after 1:10 dilution with water) was amplified by using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products and their dissociation curves were detected with the ABI Prism 7500 fast real-time PCR system. The level of the housekeeping gene L32 ribosomal gene (Rpl32) was used as an internal control. Quantitative PCR results from triplicate RNA samples were used for calculation of mean expression values for each gene. Gene lists were imported into the HiMAP program (19Saeed A.I. Sharov V.

HiMAP includes both experimentally validated protein-protein interactions (as cataloged in the Human Protein Reference Database, or HPRD) and predicted protein-protein interactions based on a probabilistic model integrating multiple factors, including interactome data from the Database of Interacting Proteins, protein domain data, genome-wide expression data, and functional annotation data from the Gene Ontology Project (GO). Cells were lysed with M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were quantified with 1× Quick Start Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) so that equal amounts of protein (40 μg) could be resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to membranes, samples were processed and visualized with ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All of the Western blotting data were representative of at least three independent experiments. Cells with nuclear fragmentation were quantified by staining with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at room temperature and counting under fluorescence microscopy. Mean values for each condition were calculated based on results from 12 replicates (three independent experiments with quadruplicate samples in each experiment). In vitro migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell unit (BD Biosciences) with polycarbonate filters. HCC827 cells transfected with siRNA for Jag1, Jag2, or control were seeded on the lower compartments of the unit in the complete medium for 16 h. Just before the migration assay, the cells on the lower compartments were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and culture medium was changed to serum-free medium with treatment. THP-1 cells were placed in the upper compartments in serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h. The medium was aspirated after the incubation, and the cells were removed from the upper compartment by scrubbing with a cotton swab. Cells on the underside of the membrane (migrated cells) were stained with SureStain Wright (Fisher) and then washed with water. Cells were counted by microscopy at ×20 magnification. Mean values were calculated from cell counts in five random fields for each filter. Mean values for each condition were calculated based on results from eight replicates (two independent experiments with quadruplicate samples in each experiment). For analysis of treatment effects and differences between genetically modified cells, the Student's t test was used, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We profiled gene expression in a panel of 70 NSCLC cell lines by using Illumina arrays. Of the five Notch ligands, JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, and DLL3 were expressed at levels that varied by up to 15-fold between cell lines, whereas DLL4 expression was uniformly low in all cell lines (Fig. 1). The majority of the cell lines expressed at least two ligands, and some (HCC95, HCC4018, H1755, H1666, and HCC1833) expressed four ligands. Quantitative PCR analysis of JAG1, JAG2, and Notch1–4 was performed on a subset of the cell lines, which confirmed the relative expression levels of JAG1 and JAG2 observed in the expression array studies performed on those cells and revealed that most cell lines expressed multiple Notch family members (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Differential expression of Notch ligands and family members based on EGFR mutational status.

The cell lines in Fig. 2 differ with respect to somatic mutations that constitutively activate EGFR (HCC827, HCC2279, H4006, H3255, and H1975) or N-Ras (H1299) or have neither mutation (H1819) (20Fujimoto N. Wislez M. Zhang J. Iwanaga K. Dackor J. Hanna A.E. Kalyankrishna S. Cody D.D. Price R.E. Sato M. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Peyton M. Tang X. Massarelli E. Herbst R. Threadgill D.W. Wistuba I.I. Kurie J.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11478-11485Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Comparison of their expression levels determined by quantitative PCR analyses revealed that JAG1, NOTCH1, and NOTCH2 were more highly expressed in EGFR mutant cells (p values = 0.025, 0.013, and 0.03, respectively) (Fig. 2A), whereas NOTCH3, NOTCH4, and JAG2 were not differentially expressed (Fig. 2B). Because increased JAG1 expression correlated with the presence of mutant EGFR, we examined whether JAG1 was regulated by EGFR. JAG1 RNA and protein levels decreased sharply in HCC827 cells and H4006 cells treated with the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Fig. 3, A and B). Gefitinib treatment had no effect on JAG1 levels in H1975 cells, which have a resistance mutation (T790M) (18Rhodes D.R. Tomlins S.A. Varambally S. Mahavisno V. Barrette T. Kalyana-Sundaram S. Ghosh D. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) that inhibits EGFR binding to gefitinib (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that the decrease in JAG1 levels by gefitinib required EGFR inhibition. In contrast, gefitinib had no effect on JAG2 levels in these cells (Fig. 3A). To examine the role of EGFR using a different approach, EGFR-wild-type H1299 cells, which expressed low levels of JAG1 and JAG2 (Fig. 2), were treated with EGF or transfected with wild-type EGFR, both of which increased the expression of JAG1 (Fig. 3C) but not JAG2 (data not shown), and gefitinib treatment abrogated EGFR-induced JAG1 expression in H1299 cells, indicating that this effect was EGFR kinase-dependent. Collectively, these findings suggest that EGFR regulates the expression of JAG1 but not JAG2. We next sought to examine the biological roles of JAG1 and JAG2 by transfecting siRNAs to selectively deplete JAG1 or JAG2 from cultured cells. Transfection of HCC827 NSCLC cells with JAG1- or JAG2-specific siRNAs achieved greater than 90% reductions in Jagged-1 and Jagged-2, respectively (Fig. 4A). Of note, Jagged-2 protein levels increased in JAG1 siRNA-transfected cells, and Jagged-1 protein levels increased in JAG2 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4A), indicating that JAG1 and JAG2 levels were regulated reciprocally. Relative to the control transfectants, the JAG1 siRNA-transfected HCC827 cells exhibited a reduction in cell density over time (Fig. 4B) and an increase in nuclear fragmentation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Fig. 4C), which is consistent with apoptotic cell death. In contrast, JAG2 siRNA-transfected cells exhibited minimal evidence of apoptotic cell death based on the absence of PARP cleavage (Fig. 4C) and nuclear fragmentation (data not shown). Collectively, these findings suggest that HCC827 cell survival was dependent upon JAG1 but not JAG2. In addition to their ability to proliferate in an uncontrolled manner, NSCLC cells recruit inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, which constitute the tumor stroma (21Wislez M. Antoine M. Rabbe N. Gounant V. Poulot V. Lavolé A. Fleury-Feith J. Cadranel J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 3518-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These cells are required for tumor growth and metastasis (22Tlsty T.D. Coussens L.M. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 119-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). To determine whether JAG1 and JAG2 are involved in this process, we examined the chemoattraction of THP-1, a human monocytic cell line (23Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar), by HCC827 cells following transfection with JAG1 or JAG2 siRNAs. HCC827 cells and THP-1 cells were seeded into the lower and upper chambers, respectively, of Transwell plates. These chambers were separated by a porous membrane, allowing bidirectional diffusion of secreted, soluble mediators. Following 24 h of incubation, the numbers of THP-1 cells that had migrated across the porous membrane were counted. Relative to control siRNA, JAG2 siRNA transfection enhanced the ability of NSCLC cells to recruit THP-1 cells, whereas JAG1 siRNA had no effect (Fig. 5). Thus, JAG2 inhibited monocytic recruitment by HCC827 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JAG2 inhibits monocyte recruitment, JAG1 and JAG2 siRNA-transfected HCC827 cells were transcriptionally profiled using a quantitative PCR expression array (RT2 Profiler array, SABiosciences) containing 84 inflammation-related genes (gene lists are in supplemental Table 2). Of these, 33 genes were measurable in all three samples (Fig. 6A); the other genes either were undetectable or did not achieve a technically satisfactory amplification in all samples. JAG1 and JAG2 siRNA transfectants exhibited striking differences; relative to the control transfectants, JAG2 siRNA enhanced the expression of the majority of the measurable genes, whereas JAG1 siRNA reduced the expression of a smaller subset (Fig. 6A). Those increased by JAG2 siRNA include, among others, a broad spectrum of CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CXCL9), CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL13, CCL20, and CCL24), interleukins (IL1α, IL1β, IL1F8, IL1F9, and IL17c) and their receptors (IL1RN, IL10Rα, IL13Rα, CCR1, CCR8, and CXCR1). To validate these findings, quantitative PCR was performed on RNA samples from an independent experiment using different primers from those on the array, which confirmed that JAG2 siRNA enhanced the expression of all four genes tested (CCL20, IL1α, IL1β, and CCL5), whereas JAG1 siRNA had no detectable effect on any of them (Fig. 6B). Thus, JAG2 was unique in its ability to regulate the expression of inflammation-related genes. Given the widespread nature of the gene expression changes induced by JAG2 siRNA, we postulated that JAG2 regulates one or more genes that are central nodes in the inflammatory process. To test this, we analyzed their positions within known or predicted global protein interaction networks (interactomes) by using the HiMAP software program. Interactomes identified by this approach are organized into a series of modular structures characterized by centrally located nodes (called hubs) that have multiple connections with other proteins (18Rhodes D.R. Tomlins S.A. Varambally S. Mahavisno V. Barrette T. Kalyana-Sundaram S. Ghosh D. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Although this approach is purely exploratory and carries no statistical weight, findings in yeast show that centrality within a protein interactome predicts the biological importance of a protein (24Jeong H. Mason S.P. Barabási A.L. Oltvai Z.N. Nature. 2001; 411: 41-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (4011) Google Scholar). Of the 33 measurable inflammation-related genes from the RT2 Profiler PCR array, 28 mapped within a single interactome based on HiMAP analysis (Fig. 7). The hubs within the network with the highest number of links (≥10) included TNFα, IL1α, IL1β, IL1R, CCL2, and CCL5, all of which were prominently up-regulated by JAG2 siRNA (Fig. 6A). Based on the centrality of IL1R and its ligands within the network, we postulated that IL1R mediates JAG2-induced suppression of inflammation-related genes. To test this, we examined the effects of treatment with IL1R antagonist (IL1RA), a naturally occurring, physiological inhibitor of IL1R (25Liao Z. Grimshaw R.S. Rosenstreich D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In co-culture assays, IL1RA treatment abrogated the recruitment of THP-1 cells by JAG2 siRNA-transfected HCC827 cells (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, IL1RA treatment attenuated the effects of JAG2 siRNA on three (CCL20, IL1α, and TNFα) of the 10 inflammation-related genes analyzed (IL1R, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL1, IL1α, IL1β, CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, and TNFα) (Fig. 8B). Collectively, these findings suggest that IL1R had a pivotal role in the biological effects of JAG2 in HCC827 cells.FIGURE 8IL1RA treatment inhibits the biological effects of JAG2 in HCC827 cells.

Arias A.M. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 194: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The findings presented in the current study advance our understanding of the role of Notch in cancer by demonstrating that the roles of JAG1 and JAG2 in NSCLC cells are quite distinct, including regulation of diverse proinflammatory cytokines, a biological property of Notch signaling that, to our knowledge, has heretofore not been reported. Given the reports that Jagged-1 and Jagged-2 bind to Notch family members with similar specificities (14Shimizu K. Chiba S. Kumano K. Hosoya N. Takahashi T. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the finding that they had distinct biological functions in HCC827 cells raises the possibility that they mediate their actions in part through Notch-independent mechanisms. Providing further support for this possibility was evidence that treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl))-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, which reportedly inhibits Notch activity (26Geling A. Steiner H. Willem M. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. Embo. Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), only minimally decreased HCC827 cell density (data not shown). All of the Notch ligands, with the exception of Delta-like ligand-3 and Jagged-2, have PDZ-binding motifs at their extreme C termini (27Pintar A. De Biasio A. Popovic M. Ivanova N. Pongor S. Biol. Direct. 2007; 2: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These motifs are dispensable for ligand activation and Notch inhibition (28Ascano J.M. Beverly L.J. Capobianco A.J. J. Biol.

Although it is unclear whether such interactions might have caused the changes in cytokine expression observed here, some PDZ domain proteins such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), Bridge-1, and glutamate receptor interacting protein 1-τ (GRIP1-τ) act as transcriptional activators (32Hsueh Y.P.

We observed that JAG1 and JAG2 were regulated inversely in HCC827 cells. Notch signaling interacts with a number of different signaling systems, and many of these affect Notch ligand expression. In particular, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, vascular endothelial growth factor, hedgehog, and Wnt have been found to modulate Notch ligand expression (13D'Souza B. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5148-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), any of which might have mediated the mutual suppression between JAG1 and JAG2 in HCC827 cells. Equally intriguing is the possibility of a Notch-mediated feed-forward loop that sensed the loss of Notch ligand through the disengagement of Notch trans-interactions, to which it responded by increasing the expression of other Notch ligands. Findings presented here suggest that following JAG2 inhibition, HCC827 cells can induce THP-1 monocyte recruitment. Because the cells in this study were co-cultured in separate compartments and communicated through a porous barrier, we conclude that these interactions were mediated by secreted factors and did not require cell-cell contact. In fact, JAG2 depletion dramatically increased the expression of a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Within the interactome of inflammation-related genes that were regulated by JAG2 depletion, IL1 receptor occupied a central position, and treatment with IL1RA abrogated the recruitment of monocytic cells and the expression of certain inflammatory mediators. Consistent with these findings, IL1 has been reported to regulate the expression of a vast array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (38Allan S.M. Tyrrell P.J. Rothwell N.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that IL1 is a critical mediator of inflammation by JAG2, adding to the complexity of cell-cell interactions known to regulate macrophage function (14Shimizu K.

NSCLC remains the primary cause of cancer-related death in Western countries, which is largely because of the fact that once the disease has metastasized, NSCLC cells are resistant to the current treatment options. Even in the setting of tumors with activating EGFR somatic mutations, which confer a unique sensitivity to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors that leads to rapid and often sustained tumor shrinkage (39Lynch T.J.

The problem of disease recurrence has not been obviated by the addition of standard chemotherapeutic agents to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Given the importance of Notch signaling in the development of a variety of malignancies, pharmacologic strategies are under development to inhibit the Notch signaling pathway in cancer patients. The findings presented here suggest that such strategies may benefit NSCLC patients by inhibiting cancer cell viability and possibly by enhancing antitumor immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2041402908,"There is an urgent need to develop new and effective agents for cancer targeting. In this work, a multivalent antibody is characterized in vivo in living animals. The antibody, termed “trimerbody”, comprises a single-chain antibody (scFv) fragment connected to the N-terminal trimerization subdomain of collagen XVIII NC1 by a flexible linker. As indicated by computer graphic modeling, the trimerbody has a tripod-shaped structure with three highly flexible scFv heads radially outward oriented. Trimerbodies are trimeric in solution and exhibited multivalent binding, which provides them with at least a 100-fold increase in functional affinity than the monovalent scFv. Our results also demonstrate the feasibility of producing functional bispecific trimerbodies, which concurrently bind two different ligands. A trimerbody specific for the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a classic tumor-associated antigen, showed efficient tumor targeting after systemic administration in mice bearing CEA-positive tumors. Importantly, a trimerbody that recognizes an angiogenesis-associated laminin epitope, showed excellent tumor localization in several cancer types, including fibrosarcomas and carcinomas. These results illustrate the potential of this new antibody format for imaging and therapeutic applications, and suggest that some laminin epitopes might be universal targets for cancer targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1970726034,"The flight ability of animals is restricted by the scaling effects imposed by physical and physiological factors. In comparisons of the power available from muscle and the mechanical power required to fly, it is predicted that the margin between the powers should decrease with body size and that flying animals have a maximum body size. However, predicting the absolute value of this upper limit has proven difficult because wing morphology and flight styles varies among species. Albatrosses and petrels have long, narrow, aerodynamically efficient wings and are considered soaring birds. Here, using animal-borne accelerometers, we show that soaring seabirds have two modes of flapping frequencies under natural conditions: vigorous flapping during takeoff and sporadic flapping during cruising flight. In these species, high and low flapping frequencies were found to scale with body mass (mass(-0.30) and mass(-0.18)) in a manner similar to the predictions from biomechanical flight models (mass(-1/3) and mass(-1/6)). These scaling relationships predicted that the maximum limits on the body size of soaring animals are a body mass of 41 kg and a wingspan of 5.1 m. Albatross-like animals larger than the limit will not be able to flap fast enough to stay aloft under unfavourable wind conditions. Our result therefore casts doubt on the flying ability of large, extinct pterosaurs. The largest extant soarer, the wandering albatross, weighs about 12 kg, which might be a pragmatic limit to maintain a safety margin for sustainable flight and to survive in a variable environment."

It has been suggested that amplification and overexpression of stem cell-associated genes, including cyclin-D2, on the human chromosome 12p region are involved in germ cell tumorigenesis. By subtractive cDNA analysis, we identified Ddx1, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, as a gene predominantly expressed in the primordial germ cells of mouse embryos. Knockdown of Ddx1 in a mouse spermatogonia-derived cell line, GC-1spg, by short interference RNA repressed the expression of cyclin-D2, CD9 and GDF3 genes. In the mouse cyclin-D2 gene, a genomic DNA region between -348 and -329 was responsible for transcriptional activation by DDX1 based on reporter and gel shift assays. Similarly, DDX1 knockdown in the human TGCT cell line NEC8 repressed the expression of stem cell-associated genes localized on chromosome 12p13.3, including cyclin-D2, CD9 and NANOG. DDX1-knocked-down TGCT cells could not form solid tumors in nude mice. Furthermore, in situ hybridization revealed that DDX1 mRNA was produced in both seminoma and nonseminoma types of human TGCT samples. We conclude that DDX1 is a critical factor for testicular tumorigenesis."

Systematic expression patterns comparisons with model organisms highlight conservations likely to reflect shared features present in the vertebrate ancestors.

https://openalex.org/W2033059778,"Background Embryonic stem (ES) cells have unlimited proliferation potential, and can differentiate into several cell types, which represent ideal sources for cell-based therapy. This high-level proliferative ability is attributed to an unusual type of cell cycle. The Signaling pathways that regulate the proliferation of ES cells are of great interest. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we show that murine ES cells specifically express brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and its signaling is essential for ES cell proliferation. We found that BNP and its receptor (NPR-A, natriuretic peptide receptor-A) were highly expressed in self-renewing murine ES cells, whereas the levels were markedly reduced after ES cell differentiation by the withdrawal of LIF. Targeting of BNP with short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the inhibition of ES cell proliferation, as indicated by a marked reduction in the cell number and colony size, a significant reduction in DNA synthesis, and decreased numbers of cells in S phase. BNP knockdown in ES cells led to the up-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABAAR) genes, and activation of phosphorylated histone (γ-H2AX), which negatively affects ES cell proliferation. In addition, knockdown of BNP increased the rate of apoptosis and reduced the expression of the transcription factor Ets-1. Conclusions/Significance Appropriate BNP expression is essential for the maintenance of ES cell propagation. These findings establish BNP as a novel endogenous regulator of ES cell proliferation."

In mice, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression is limited to ∼1000 neurons that originate in the olfactory placode then migrate to specific positions scattered throughout the hypothalamus. Coordination of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is dependent upon correct migration of GnRH neurons into the hypothalamus followed by the appropriate synthesis and pulsatile secretion of GnRH. Defects in any one of these processes can cause infertility. Recently, substantial progress has been made in identifying transcription factors, and their cofactors, that regulate not only adult expression of GnRH, but also the maturation of GnRH neurons. Here, we show that expression of Otx2, a homeodomain protein required for the formation of the forebrain, is dramatically up-regulated during GnRH neuronal maturation and that overexpression of Otx2 increases GnRH promoter activity in GnRH neuronal cell lines. Furthermore, Otx2 transcriptional activity is modulated by Grg4, a member of the Groucho-related-gene (Grg) family. Using mutational analysis, we show that a WRPW peptide motif within the Otx2 protein is required for physical interaction between Otx2 and Grg4. Without this physical interaction, Grg4 cannot repress Otx2-dependent activation of GnRH gene transcription. Taken together, these data show that Otx2 is important for GnRH expression and that direct interaction between Otx2 and Grg co-repressors regulates GnRH gene expression in hypothalamic neurons.

In the adult brain, expression of Otx2 is restricted to the cerebellum and GnRH neurons within the hypothalamus (7Kelley C.G. Lavorgna G. Clark M.E. Boncinelli E. Mellon P.L. Mol.

Alternative usage of Otx2 promoters during development allows expression levels of Otx2 to be tightly regulated (17Fossat N. Courtois V. Chatelain G. Brun G. Lamonerie T. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); in addition interactions between Otx2 and cofactors provide a further level of control over Otx2 protein activity. Both Sox2 and Lhx1 have been shown to synergize with Otx2 to increase promoter activation (20Danno H. Michiue T. Hitachi K. Yukita A. Ishiura S. Asashima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Annino A. Tuorto F. Usiello A. Acampora D. Czerny T. Brodski C. Ang S.L. Wurst W. Simeone A. Development. 2004; 131: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Interestingly, we have previously shown that members of the Grg family of co-repressors are important regulators of GnRH transcription (10Rave-Harel N. Miller N.L. Givens M.L. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Grg proteins are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and are expressed at all stages of development (23Koop K.E. MacDonald L.M. Lobe C.G. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Leon C. Lobe C.G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Dehni G. Liu Y. Husain J. Stifani S. Mech.

They interact with multiple transcription factors all of which are involved in mechanisms that regulate processes such as differentiation, cell specification, embryonic patterning, and apoptosis (27Gasperowicz M. Otto F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 670-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to explain how Grg proteins may be acting to switch off transcription, including both HDAC-dependent and independent mechanisms (28Cinnamon E. Paroush Z. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Buscarlet M. Stifani S. Trends.

Grg proteins fall into one of two groups: “long” (Grg1, Grg2, Grg3, and Grg4) or “short” (Grg1-S, Grg3b, Grg5, and Grg6). Long Grgs consist of four distinct domains: an N-terminal glutamine-rich region (Q-domain), a glycine/proline-rich region (GP-domain), a serine/proline-rich region (SP-domain), and the C-terminal region with multiple tryptophan and aspartic acid repeats (WD40 repeats). All of the domains are important for interactions with transcription factors (31Dasen J.S. Barbera J.P. Herman T.S. Connell S.O. Olson L. Ju B. Tollkuhn J. Baek S.H. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G.

Development. 2002; 129: 2835-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Q-domain is required for homo- and heterodimerization of Grg proteins (34Pinto M. Lobe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33026-33031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the GP-domain is involved in the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) (35Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Grg1-S, Grg3b, and Grg5 lack the NLS, SP-domain, and WD40 repeats (24Leon C. Lobe C.G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Miyasaka H.

The WD40 domain is conserved in Grg6, but the N terminus of the protein is truncated and has little similarity to the other Grgs. The short Grgs are proposed to function as dominant-negative forms of long Grgs; however, the exact mechanism by which they influence Grg-mediated repression remains to be resolved (38Swingler T.E. Bess K.L. Yao J. Stifani S. Jayaraman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34938-34947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Wang W. Wang Y.G. Reginato A.M. Glotzer D.J. Fukai N. Plotkina S. Karsenty G. Olsen B.R. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 364-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Herein, we have examined how Otx2 activation of GnRH gene transcription is regulated by the physical interaction of Otx2 with Grg4, a long Grg co-repressor. We show that Otx2 expression is restricted to GT1–7 cells and that Otx2 interacts in vivo with the GnRH promoter. Furthermore, we describe the identification and characterization of Grg4 as a repressor of Otx2-induced activation of GnRH transcription. We report that Otx2-induced activation is repressed by Grg4 through an HDAC-independent mechanism and demonstrate that this repression is mediated by physical interaction between the two proteins via a specific amino acid motif within the Otx2 protein.DISCUSSIONOtx2 is required for regionalization and patterning of the developing brain and plays an important role in establishing the identity and fate of progenitor neurons. The interaction of Otx2 with cofactors, together with a specific spatial and temporal expression pattern, controls the effects of Otx2 on the activity of a given promoter (20Danno H. Michiue T. Hitachi K. Yukita A. Ishiura S. Asashima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5408-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Mochizuki T. Karavanov A.A. Curtiss P.E. Ault K.T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reports detailing the co-localization of Otx2 and GnRH during both development and adulthood, along with data identifying Otx2-target binding sites within the GnRH regulatory region, have established Otx2 as an important factor in the regulation of GnRH transcription (7Kelley C.G. Lavorgna G. Clark M.E. Boncinelli E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1246-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Mallamaci A. Di Blas E. Briata P. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Mech. Dev. 1996; 58: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this report, we have studied the regulation of GnRH expression by Otx2 in more detail and describe for the first time the identification and characterization of Grg proteins as co-repressors of Otx2-induced GnRH transcription.Groucho-related co-repressors (Grg1, -2, -3, and -4) are thought to repress promoter activity by down-regulating the induction of target genes by transcriptional activators, enhancing the effects of transcriptional repressors or converting transcriptional activators to repressors (27Gasperowicz M. Otto F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 670-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal that endogenous Grg4 and Otx2 proteins interact in GT1–7 cells and demonstrate that Grg4 represses Otx2-induced activation of both a GnRH reporter containing the rat enhancer and promoter regions and a reporter consisting of multiple copies of the Otx2 bicoid-like binding site. This suggests that Grg4 is not modulating GnRH transcription by down-regulating Otx2 expression, nor is it only augmenting the effects of known GnRH transcriptional repressors such as Msx1. Rather, these data indicate that Grg4 is either sequestering Otx2 away from the DNA, thus preventing activation of the promoter, or that interaction of Grg4 and Otx2 on the DNA blocks transcription from occurring. Because Grg4, like Otx2, has been shown to interact with the GnRH promoter chromatin in vivo (10Rave-Harel N. Miller N.L. Givens M.L. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that, instead of sequestering Otx2 away from the DNA, Grg4 is recruited to DNA-bound Otx2 resulting in an attenuation of GnRH transcription. Long term repression by Grgs is thought to involve the recruitment of HDACs, via the GP-domain of Grg protein, which is highly conserved between all the long Grgs (35Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, in this report, we demonstrate that a mutant Grg4 protein, in which the GP-domain has been deleted, remains capable of repressing Otx2-induced transcription as efficiently as wild-type Grg4. This suggests that, as in the case of Grg4-mediated repression of Pax2 and Oct-2 activation (61Cai Y. Brophy P.D. Levitan I. Stifani S. Dressler G.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5522-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 62Malin S. Linderson Y. Almqvist J. Ernberg I. Tallone T. Pettersson S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), repression occurs via a HDAC-independent mechanism. In the case of Pax2, phosphorylation of Pax2 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase is blocked by association with Grg4, decreasing the transcriptional activity of Pax2. Analogously, Grg4 may inhibit Otx2 activity by preventing its post-translational modification. However, further investigation is required to determine whether protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, control the activity of Otx2.Interestingly, although Grg4 was able to repress Otx2-induced activation of the GnRHe/p and the −152-bp multimer, it was unable to exert any repressive effects on Otx2 activation of the −198-bp multimer. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that both sites are conserved in various mammals. However, only the binding site at −152 bp is a 100% match to a consensus Otx2-binding site sequence. Otx2 has been shown to bind the core elements contained within both of the sites, but has a greater affinity for the TAATCCC element found at −152 bp (63Briata P. Ilengo C. Bobola N. Corte G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and our in vitro experiments confirmed this. Although we were able to demonstrate that overexpression of Otx2 significantly activates both multimers, and in vitro translated Otx2 protein binds to both sites, we did not see the formation of an Otx2 protein complex on the −198-bp probe when using GT1–7 cell nuclear extracts, suggesting that, although the site is capable of binding Otx2, and being activated by it, it preferentially binds other nuclear proteins in EMSAs. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Otx2 interacts with the GnRH promoter in GT1–7 cells, the proximity of the two sites prevented us from determining whether Otx2 is capable of binding to both sites in vivo and, if so, whether the −152-bp site was preferentially bound. We hypothesize that the differential effects of Grg4 on the two multimers may be explained by the affinity with which Otx2 binds to the DNA, as is observed with the interaction of Pax2 and Groucho (61Cai Y. Brophy P.D. Levitan I. Stifani S. Dressler G.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5522-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Weak binding of Otx2 to the DNA may affect the stability of the Otx2-Grg4 interaction and thus the ability of Grg4 to exert its repressive effects.Previous studies have shown that Hairy-related proteins interact with Grg family members and that deletion of the Hairy protein WRPW motif is sufficient to prevent this physical interaction (57Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Otx2 contains a sequence homologous to the WRPW motif, and we have shown that mutation of this domain relieves Grg4-mediated repression of Otx2-induced GnRH transcription by preventing physical interaction of the two proteins. A recent report shows that the WD40 repeats of Grg4 are required for physical interaction of Grg4 and Otx2 (53Heimbucher T. Murko C. Bajoghli B. Aghaallaei N. Huber A. Stebegg R. Eberhard D. Fink M. Simeone A. Czerny T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that deletion or mutation of the Grg4 WD40-domain would also relieve Grg4-mediated repression of the GnRH promoter. Recently, Buscarlet et al. (56Buscarlet M. Perin A. Laing A. Brickman J.M. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24881-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that the anti-neurogenic properties of long Grg proteins are reliant upon the interaction of the Grg protein WD40-domain, with WRPW motif-containing proteins. Overexpression of long Grg proteins results in the inhibition of neuronal development in vivo and decreases neuronal differentiation of progenitor cells (64Yao J. Liu Y. Lo R. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Stifani S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 65Nuthall H.N. Joachim K. Stifani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8395-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Otx2 has been reported to control the identity and fate of neuronal precursors by suppressing their differentiation (66Puelles E. Acampora D. Gogoi R. Tuorto F. Papalia A. Guillemot F. Ang S.L. Simeone A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5955-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, it has not been established whether this effect is mediated by a co-repressor, or is a consequence of Otx2 acting alone.The anti-neurogenic properties of both long Grg proteins and Otx2 are of particular interest given that GnRH-producing neurons have a unique cellular origin within the olfactory placode. During embryogenesis, they migrate from the olfactory placode, across the cribriform plate, and into the basal forebrain to arrive at their final destination within the hypothalamus (67Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 68Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Jorgenson K.L. Bergen H.T. Weesner G.D. Pfaff D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The factors that specify the onset of GnRH expression and the initiation of these neurons on their migratory pathway have yet to be determined, however, the birth of these cells may be mediated by the spatiotemporal expression of transcription factors. Given that Otx2 expression is observed within the olfactory placode at the time of GnRH neuronal birth, and co-localizes with GnRH during development and into adulthood, it would be interesting to determine the role of Otx2 in GnRH neuronal development and GnRH transcription. However, Otx2-null mice lack the entire forebrain and olfactory placode, preventing analysis of GnRH neurons. In contrast, heterozygotes display highly variable phenotypes with defects in craniofacial, ocular, and olfactory placode development (12Acampora D. Mazan S. Lallemand Y. Avantaggiato V. Maury M. Simeone A. BrÛlet P. Development. 1995; 121: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ang S.L. Jin O. Rhinn M. Daigle N. Stevenson L. Rossant J.

The varying degree of penetrance observed in these mice suggests that correct dosage of Otx2 is critical for normal development to occur, and this hypothesis is supported by data from human patients where a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation can have highly pleiotropic effects within an affected family. Furthermore, both duplication and deletion of the OTX2-containing region of human chromosome 14q22 lead to developmental abnormalities (69Ou Z. Martin D.M. Bedoyan J.K. Cooper M.L. Chinault A.C.

Mutat. 2008; 29: E278-E283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas specific mutations can cause a number of deficiencies including hypopituitarism, which includes low gonadotropins (71Diaczok D. Romero C. Zunich J. Marshall I. Radovick S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 93: 4351-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 72Ragge N.K. Brown A.G. Poloschek C.M. Lorenz B. Henderson R.A.

Fitzpatrick D.R. van Heyningen V. Hanson I.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 1008-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies are utilizing a GnRH-neuron-specific conditional Otx2 knockout approach to determine the role of Otx2 in GnRH neuronal development and regulation of GnRH transcription in the adult. Because expression of Grg family members also co-localizes with GnRH during development (10Rave-Harel N. Miller N.L. Givens M.L. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it would also be interesting to study the influence of Otx2 and Grg protein interactions on the differentiation and migration of GnRH neurons. Unfortunately, the ability to study Grg protein function during development is also complicated due to the presence of multiple family members that are expressed in overlapping domains, making loss-of-function analyses difficult because of redundancy issues. Because long Grg proteins and Otx2 interact via the Grg WD40-domain, this may explain why no difference in GnRH promoter activity was observed when co-transfecting Otx2 with Grg5, which lacks the GP-domain, SP-domain, and WD40 repeats. It also suggests that other long Grg family members could negatively regulate Otx2 activation of the GnRH promoter. Indeed, analysis of mRNA expression reveals that all of the Grg family members, apart from Grg2, are expressed in both GnRH neuronal cell lines, indicating that they may be interchangeable in repression of Otx2.In conclusion, we have explored novel interactions between the homeodomain-containing protein Otx2 and members of the Groucho-related gene family of proteins. We have demonstrated that Grg4 physically interacts with Otx2 resulting in repression of GnRH promoter activity via an HDAC-independent mechanism. We hypothesize that modulation of the interactions of Otx2 with co-repressors and/or co-activators may contribute to the dynamic control of GnRH gene expression that is necessary during development and for reproduction. This modulation of Otx2 activity may be especially critical during puberty and in the control of the estrous cycle. Normal reproductive function requires the precise orchestration and integration of hormonal regulation at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Dysfunction at any of these levels leads to pathophysiologic disorders such as infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

RA activates MAO B promoter in both concentration- and time-dependent manners, which is mediated through retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha). There are four retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) as identified in the MAO B 2-kb promoter, and mutation of the third RARE reduced RA-induced MAO B promoter activation by 50%, suggesting this element is important. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that RARalpha specifically binds to the third RARE both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, transient transfection and luciferase assays revealed that Sp1 enhances but not essentially required for the RA activation of MAO B through two clusters of Sp1-binding sites in the MAO B promoter. RARalpha physically interacts with Sp1 via zinc finger domains in Sp1 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Further, RARalpha was shown to be recruited by Sp1 and to form a transcriptional regulation complex with Sp1 in the Sp1-binding sites of natural MAO B promoter. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the first time showing the stimulating effect of RA on MAO B and new insight into the molecular mechanisms of MAO B regulation by hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2135457913,"Perturbation of cardiolipin (CL) synthesis in yeast cells leads to defective respiratory chain function and mitochondrial DNA loss, both of which have been implicated in aging in mammals. The availability of yeast CL mutants enabled us to directly investigate the role of CL synthesis in aging. In this report, we show that the replicative life span of pgs1Delta, which lacks both CL and the precursor phosphatidylglycerol (PG), was significantly decreased at 30 degrees C. The life span of crd1Delta, which has PG but not CL, was unaffected at 30 degrees C but reduced at 37 degrees C. Life span extension induced by calorie restriction was not affected by the loss of CL. However, mild heat and osmotic stress, which extend life span in wild type cells, did not increase longevity in CL mutants, suggesting that the stress response is perturbed in these mutants. Consistent with this, longevity defects in pgs1Delta were alleviated by down-regulation of the high osmolarity glycerol stress response pathway, as well as by promoting cell integrity with the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol or via genetic suppression with the kre5(W1166X) mutant. These findings show for the first time that perturbation of CL synthesis leads to decreased longevity in yeast, which is restored by altering signaling through stress response pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2088048434,"The FAD-dependent choline oxidase has a flavin cofactor covalently attached to the protein via histidine 99 through an 8alpha-N(3)-histidyl linkage. The enzyme catalyzes the four-electron oxidation of choline to glycine betaine, forming betaine aldehyde as an enzyme-bound intermediate. The variant form of choline oxidase in which the histidine residue has been replaced with asparagine was used to investigate the contribution of the 8alpha-N(3)-histidyl linkage of FAD to the protein toward the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. Decreases of 10-fold and 30-fold in the k(cat)/K(m) and k(cat) values were observed as compared with wild-type choline oxidase at pH 10 and 25 degrees C, with no significant effect on k(cat)/K(O) using choline as substrate. Both the k(cat)/K(m) and k(cat) values increased with increasing pH to limiting values at high pH consistent with the participation of an unprotonated group in the reductive half-reaction and the overall turnover of the enzyme. The pH independence of both (D)(k(cat)/K(m)) and (D)k(cat), with average values of 9.2 +/- 3.3 and 7.4 +/- 0.5, respectively, is consistent with absence of external forward and reverse commitments to catalysis, and the chemical step of CH bond cleavage being rate-limiting for both the reductive half-reaction and the overall enzyme turnover. The temperature dependence of the (D)k(red) values suggests disruption of the preorganization in the asparagine variant enzyme. Altogether, the data presented in this study are consistent with the FAD-histidyl covalent linkage being important for the optimal positioning of the hydride ion donor and acceptor in the tunneling reaction catalyzed by choline oxidase."

In budding yeast, Sgt1 and Hsp90 are required for the binding of Skp1 to Ctf13 (a component of the core kinetochore complex CBF3) and therefore for the assembly of CBF3. We have previously shown that Sgt1 dimerization is important for this kinetochore assembly mechanism.

In this study, we report that protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates Ser361 on Sgt1, and this phosphorylation inhibits Sgt1 dimerization.

The kinetochore generates a signal to arrest cells during mitosis when it is not properly attached to microtubules, thereby preventing chromosome missegregation, which can lead to aneuploidy (3.Sudakin V.

We have previously found that Sgt1 and Skp1 activate Ctf13; thus, they are required for assembly of the CBF3 complex (21.Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol.

Sgt1 has two highly conserved motifs that are required for protein-protein interaction: the tetratricopeptide repeat (21.Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol.

His6-Sgt1 and GST-Sgt1 proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions, as previously described (24.Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Sgt1 was immunoprecipitated from yeast cell lysates using an anti-Myc antibody. Isoelectric focusing was performed with a 17-cm immobilized pH 3–10 gradient strips (Bio-Rad), following the manufacturer's instructions. Gel electrophoresis was performed in a Bio-Rad PROTEAN Plus Dodeca cell. After two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-Myc antibodies. Phosphorylation of recombinant GST-Sgt1 or His-Sgt1 by human protein kinase CK2 was performed in a reaction mixture containing 100 ng to 1 μg of GST-Sgt1 or His-Sgt1 protein and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP). The reactions were started by adding 250 units of CK2 (New England Biolabs) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS buffer. Reaction samples were separated on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYPRO Ruby protein stain (Molecular Probes). After images were taken, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Phosphorylation signals were quantified by a PhosphorImager. Matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that an oligopeptide, 348AGADPDTKRAMMKSF362, is phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. S1). Serine 361 is within the consensus site that is phosphorylated by CK2 (36.Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and this residue is conserved in humans (see Fig. 2B). Therefore, we tested by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis whether Ser361 is phosphorylated in vivo. Immunoprecipitated Sgt1-Myc appeared as two major spots on the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1A, top left), and phosphatase treatment substantially diminished the low pH spot (Fig. 1A, top right), indicating that the low pH spot corresponds to phosphorylated forms. An unphosphorylated mutant sgt1-S361A protein showed a reduced low pH spot, indicating that Ser361 is phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 1A, bottom left). Phosphatase treatment reduced the low pH spot of sgt1-S361A protein, suggesting that there are other phosphorylation sites. We also found that GST-Sgt1 and His6-Sgt1 were phosphorylated by human CK2 in vitro (Fig. 1B and Figs. S2 and S3). Sgt1 was phosphorylated with 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of substrate (Fig. 1C). The Km and Vmax of CK2 for the phosphorylation of Sgt1 were 288 μm and 4.8 μmol/min/mg (Fig. 1D), respectively, which are within the same range as that for known CK2 substrates (37.Carmichael D.F.

CK2 did not efficiently phosphorylate the sgt1-S361A mutant protein (Fig. 2A), indicating that the S361A on Sgt1 is a phosphorylation site for CK2 in vitro. Serine 361 is within the consensus site that is phosphorylated by CK2 (Fig. 2B), and this residue is conserved in humans and corresponds to serine 299 in human SGT1A (Fig. 2B). Nowotny et al.

Human SGT1A-(263–333) oligopeptide containing the E302K mutation was also efficiently phosphorylated, suggesting that the CK2 phosphorylation site might be different from that identified by computer prediction. However, whether Ser299 is a CK2 phosphorylation site has not been directly tested. Therefore, we made the human SGT1A-S299A protein and found that CK2 did not phosphorylate the mutant protein as efficiently as the wild-type protein (Fig. 2C). This finding strongly suggests that Ser299 is a CK2 phosphorylation site in vitro. To examine the possible effect of phosphorylation of Ser361, we generated a nonphosphorylated mutant (S361A) strain and a phosphorylation-mimic mutant (S361D) strain. The S361A mutant protein bound to itself and Skp1 in vivo (Fig. 3A). However, the S361D protein did not bind to either itself or Skp1 efficiently, suggesting that Ser361-phosphorylated Sgt1 cannot form dimers effectively. Interestingly, the sgt1-S361D but not sgt1-S361A mutation was lethal when expressed in vivo as the sole version of Sgt1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser361 inhibits Sgt1 dimerization, Sgt1 dimerization is essential for viability, and thus that CK2 negatively regulates Sgt1 dimerization. To confirm this hypothesis in vivo, we examined whether the CBF3 complex could be formed in sgt1-S361D mutant cells. Because the sgt1-S361D mutation is lethal, we used a conditional SGT1-null mutant by using N-degron-4HA-Sgt1 expressed under the control of a repressible promoter (25.Dubacq C. Guerois R. Courbeyrette R. Kitagawa K. Mann C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to remove the N-degron-wild-type protein but not the Myc-tagged mutant protein from cells that were used for the CBF3 band shift assay (8.Lechner J. Carbon J. Cell. 1991; 64: 717-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this system, copper induces the expression of Ubr1 and Rox1. Ubr1 is a ubiquitin ligase that binds proteins containing an N-degron and facilitates their ubiquitination and subsequent destruction by the 26 S proteasome. Rox1 represses the transcription of the ANB1 promoter controlling the expression of N-degron-Sgt1. Thus, the addition of copper both blocks the expression of N-degron-Sgt1 and triggers its proteolysis. The levels of N-degron-Sgt1 decreased after CuSO4 was added and were substantially lower after a 4-h incubation, but the levels of Myc-tagged Sgt1 and Myc-tagged sgt1-S361D mutant protein did not change (Fig. 3C, right). The cells in which Sgt1-Myc or sgt1-S361D-Myc were expressed and N-degron-Sgt1 was depleted were used for the CBF3 band shift assay. Although the viability after an 8-h incubation was substantially reduced, that after a 4-h incubation appeared to be high enough to assess CBF3 activity (Fig. 3D). The CBF3 complex was not formed efficiently in cell lysates containing only sgt1-S361D-Myc (Fig. 3C, left), suggesting that the phosphorylation of Ser361 inhibits the formation of the CBF3 complex. Next, we examined whether Sgt1 is phosphorylated by CK2. We found that Sgt1 interacted with Cka1 (a subunit of yeast CK2) in vivo (Fig. 4A) and that the low pH spot diminished in cka1Δ (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggest that CK2 phosphorylates Sgt1 in vivo. The phosphorylation of Ser361 appears to negatively regulate Sgt1 dimerization; thus, if Ser361 is phosphorylated by CK2 in vivo, then the amount of Sgt1 dimers should be greater in yeast casein-kinase mutants than in wild-type cells. Indeed, Sgt1 dimerization increased in cka1Δ mutant cells (Fig. 4C), and Skp1 binding also increased (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, sgt1-S361A dimerization or Skp1 binding did not increase in cka1Δ mutant cells, indicating that the stimulation of dimerization by reduction of CK2 activity is dependent on Ser361 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these results, the deletion of cka1 suppressed the benomyl sensitivity of the sgt1–3 mutant (Fig. 4D) (21.Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 30.Bansal P.K. Nourse A. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3586-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that CK2 phosphorylates Sgt1 at Ser361 and negatively regulates Sgt1 dimerization in vivo. In this study, we have shown that Sgt1 dimerization, which is required for kinetochore assembly in budding yeast, is regulated negatively by CK2-mediated phosphorylation. CK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is ubiquitous in eukaryotes (42.Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 43.Poole A. Poore T. Bandhakavi S. McCann R.O. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2005; 274: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of a catalytic subunit a and a regulatory subunit b that form a native a2b2 holoenzyme (42.Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 43.Poole A. Poore T. Bandhakavi S. McCann R.O. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2005; 274: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CK2 of the budding yeast consists of two catalytic subunits, a and a′, and two regulatory subunits, b and b′, which are encoded by the CKA1, CKA2, CKB1, and CKB2 genes, respectively (44.Glover III, C.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Individual deletion of either CKA1 or CKA2 does not show any significant phenotypes, but their simultaneous deletion is lethal (45.Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that Ser361 is phosphorylated by CK2 in vivo, we attempted to generate antibodies against phosphorylated Ser361. However, unfortunately, antibodies produced using a phosphorylated peptide were not specific for the phosphorylated form and recognized the unphosphorylated form even after affinity purification. Therefore, we used indirect approaches to answer this question. Two-dimensional gel analysis revealed that Sgt1 is phosphorylated by CK2. When CK2 activity was altered by deletion of Cka1 but not Cka2 or Ckb2, Sgt1 dimerization and Skp1 binding were stimulated (data not shown). It has been previously reported that different combinations of subunits exhibit properties typical for CK2 but differ in substrate specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors, which suggests that each CK2 isomer may regulate different processes or may have different mechanisms of regulation (46.Domañska K. Zieliñski R. Kubiñski K. Sajnaga E. Masłyk M. Bretner M. Szyszka R. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2005; 52: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of Sgt1 dimerization may be a specific function of Cka1. Because the sgt1-S361D mutant is lethal, we had to perform coimmunoprecipitation experiments to test the dimerization activity of the sgt1 mutant proteins in the presence of endogenous wild-type Sgt1 (Fig. 3A). Since the sgt1-S361D protein presumably binds more efficiently to the wild-type Sgt1 than to sgt1-S361D, the dimerization activity detected by co-immunoprecipitation might be an underestimation. The stimulation of Sgt1 dimerization by deletion of Cka1 was dependent on Ser361. The alteration of CK2 activity by deletion of Cka1 suppressed the benomyl sensitivity of the sgt1–3 mutant, and Sgt1 associated with Cka1 in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that CK2 negatively regulates Sgt1 dimerization by phosphorylating Ser361, which in turn represses kinetochore assembly. However, the biological significance of why Sgt1 dimerization needs to be negatively regulated is unknown and needs further analyses. A monomer form might have a different function. Another interesting observation is that Ser361 is outside the Sgt1 dimerization domain but within the SGS domain (amino acids 307–395). Our binding analysis suggested that an inhibitory region may be present between amino acids 270 and 312 (30.Bansal P.K. Nourse A. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3586-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser361 may enhance this internal inhibitory activity by affecting the structure of the SGS domain. The human homolog of Sgt1 can rescue the yeast sgt1-null mutant (21.Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), suggesting that the function of Sgt1 is conserved between humans and yeast. Sgt1 interacts with Hsp90 in yeast and human cells (28.Niikura Y. Ohta S. Vandenbeldt K.J. Abdulle R. McEwen B.F. Kitagawa K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4133-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 47.Lee Y.T. Jacob J. Michowski W. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16511-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CENP-I, CENP-F, and Hec1, but not CENP-C, are absent from kinetochores in human cells depleted of SGT1 or HSP90 or treated with 17-AAG (an HSP90 inhibitor) (28.Niikura Y. Ohta S. Vandenbeldt K.J.

Faretta M. Musacchio A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This result strongly suggests that the human SGT1-HSP90 complex is crucial for assembly of the human kinetochore. Therefore, the kinetochore function of Sgt1 is evolutionarily conserved between humans and yeast. However, Nyarko et al. (48.Nyarko A. Mosbahi K. Rowe A.J. Leech A. Boter M. Shirasu K. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown by gel filtration chromatography that human SGT1A does not form dimers efficiently. Our recent analytical ultracentrifuge experiments have also revealed that human SGT1A exists mainly as a monomer (30.Bansal P.K. Nourse A. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3586-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

CTIP2 mutant mice die at birth with epidermal differentiation defects and a compromised epidermal permeability barrier suggesting its role in skin development and/or homeostasis. CTIP2 has also been suggested to function as tumor suppressor in cells, and several reports have described a link between chromosomal rearrangements of CTIP2 and human T cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL). The aim of the present study was to look into the pattern of CTIP2 expression in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC).In the present study, we analyzed CTIP2 expression in human HNSCC cell lines by western blotting, in paraffin embedded archival specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in cDNA samples of human HNSCC by qRT-PCR. Elevated levels of CTIP2 protein was detected in several HNSCC cell lines. CTIP2 staining was mainly detected in the basal layer of the head and neck normal epithelium. CTIP2 expression was found to be significantly elevated in HNSCC (p<0.01), and increase in CTIP2 expression was associated with poorly differentiated tumor status. Nuclear co-localization of CTIP2 protein and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker BMI1 was observed in most, if not all of the cells expressing BMI1 in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors.We report for the first time expression of transcriptional regulator CTIP2 in normal human head and neck epithelia. A statistically significant increase in the expression of CTIP2 was detected in the poorly differentiated samples of the human head and neck tumors. Actual CTIP2, rather than the long form of CTIP2 (CTIP2(L)) was found to be more relevant to the differentiation state of the tumors. Results demonstrated existence of distinct subsets of cancer cells, which express CTIP2 and underscores the use of CTIP2 and BMI1 co-labeling to distinguish tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) from surrounding cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2155060795,"HER2-targeted therapy with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has improved disease-free survival for women diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancers; however, treatment resistance and disease progression are not uncommon. Current data suggest that resistance to treatment in HER2 cancers may be a consequence of NF-kappaB overexpression and increased COX2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)). Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown to have anti-tumor properties and to inhibit NF-kappaB activity and COX2.In this study, HER2-overexpressing SKBr3 breast cancer cells were treated with t10c12 CLA. Protein expression of the HER2 receptor, nuclear NF-kappaB p65, and total and phosphorylated IkappaB were examined by western blot and immunofluorescence. PGE(2) levels were determined by ELISA. Proliferation was measured by metabolism of 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and apoptosis was measured by FITC-conjugated Annexin V staining and flow cytometry.We observed a significant decrease in HER2 protein expression on western blot following treatment with 40 and 80 microM t10c12 CLA (p<0.01 and 0.001, respectively) and loss of HER2 protein in cells using immunoflourescence that was most pronounced at 80 microM. Protein levels of nuclear NF-kappaB p65 were also significantly reduced at the 80 microM dose. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in PGE(2) levels (p = 0.05). Pretreatment with t10c12 CLA significantly enhanced TNFalpha-induced apoptosis and the anti-proliferative action of trastuzumab (p = 0.05 and 0.001, respectively). These data add to previous reports of an anti-tumor effect of t10c12 CLA and suggest an effect on the HER2 oncogene that may be through CLA mediated downregulation of COX2-derived PGE(2)."
https://openalex.org/W1963510765,"INI1/hSNF5/BAF47/SMARCB1 is an HIV-1 integrase (IN)-binding protein that modulates viral replication in multiple ways. A minimal IN-binding domain of INI1, S6 (amino acids 183–294), transdominantly inhibits late events, and down-modulation of INI1 stimulates early events of HIV-1 replication. INI1 both stimulates and inhibits in vitro integration depending on IN concentration. To gain further insight into its role in HIV-1 replication, we purified and biochemically characterized INI1. We found that INI1 forms multimeric structures. Deletion analysis indicated that the Rpt1 and Rpt2 motifs form the minimal multimerization domain. We isolated mutants of INI1 that are defective for multimerization using a reverse yeast two-hybrid system. Our results revealed that INI1 residues involved in multimerization overlap with IN-binding and nuclear export domains and are required for nuclear retention and co-localization with IN. Multimerization-defective mutants are also defective for mediating the transdominant effect of INI1-S6-(183–294). Furthermore, we found that INI1 is a minor groove DNA-binding protein.

The inhibitory effect is dependent on IN-INI1 interaction and is abrogated when an IN mutant defective for interaction with INI1 is used (8Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O.

Furthermore, particle production is minimal in cells lacking INI1, and reintroduction of INI1 into these cells can partially correct the defect (6Sorin M. Yung E. Wu X. Kalpana G.V. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results indicate that INI1 is required for HIV-1 late events. Additional studies have indicated that INI1 is selectively incorporated into HIV-1 but not other retroviral and lentiviral particles (9Yung E. Sorin M. Wang E.J. Perumal S. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2222-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Virally encapsidated INI1 is required for post-entry early events of HIV-1 replication prior to integration (6Sorin M. Yung E.

These studies indicate that producer cell-associated as well as virion-associated INI1 is required for HIV-1 replication. Contrary to these proviral functions of INI1, siRNA-mediated knockdown studies indicate that INI1 in the target cells inhibits early events of HIV-1 replication (7Maroun M. Delelis O. Coadou G.

These studies indicate that whereas INI1 in the target cells may act as an antiviral host protein, HIV-1 may subvert the INI1 antiviral effect, and HIV-1 may utilize this host factor for late events in the producer cells and for early preintegration events in the target cells. Interestingly, in an earlier study, we demonstrated that partially purified INI1 both inhibits and stimulates in vitro integration in a manner dependent on IN concentration (3Kalpana G.V. Marmon S.

Further structure-function analysis of INI1 is required to understand this complex and dual role of INI1 during HIV-1 replication.

To gain further insight into the mechanism of its action, we purified INI1 protein to homogeneity and characterized it biochemically. Here we report, for the first time, that INI1 forms dimeric and higher order multimeric structures. We have characterized the multimerization domain of INI1 and found that multimerization and IN binding activities of INI1 are required for inhibition of in vitro integration. Furthermore, we found that the multimerization, IN binding, and nuclear export properties of INI1 are important for transdominant effects. In addition, we found that INI1 possesses a minor groove DNA binding activity and that the nonspecific acceptor DNA binding activity of INI1 may be required for stimulation of in vitro integration. Finally, we found that multimerization of the full-length protein is necessary for its ability to be retained in the nucleus and to co-localize with HIV-1 IN in the nucleus. Thus, our studies provide novel insights into the mechanism by which INI1 regulates HIV-1 replication. The plasmids pGEX-INI1, pGEX-IN, pSH2-INI1, and pGADNotINI1 and deletion fragments pGADNotINI1-(183–294), pSH2IN, pBABEpuro-INI1, pCGNINI1, and pQE32-INI1 have been described previously (18Morozov A. Yung E. Kalpana G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1120-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Details of the construction of pQE32-INI1-(141–304) and generation of the random mutagenesis library of pGADNotINI1-(183–294) are as described in the supplemental material. CFP-INI1, DD5, and DD6 constructs were generated by PCR amplification and subcloning of the subsequent fragments at the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pECFP vector (Clontech). His6-INI1 and His6-INI1-(183–294) were purified to homogeneity as described in the supplemental material. His6-LEDGF was purified as reported (27Vandegraaff N. Devroe E. Turlure F. Silver P.A. Engelman A. Virology. 2006; 346: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) except that His6-LEDGF was not digested with PreScission protease, and two purification steps, viz. Ni-NTA and Mono-S Sepharose, were used. The partially purified protein was dialyzed against IN dialysis buffer (3Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). C-terminal His-tagged IN was purified as described (3Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These tests were performed as described, and details are provided in the supplemental “Materials and Methods” (3Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The details of the methods used are provided in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Briefly, Mono-Q Sepharose eluate of His-INI1 was separated on a 15–35% glycerol gradient at 40,000 rpm (SW41 Ti rotor) for 24 h. Fractions (400–450 μl) were collected and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-His monoclonal antibody as probe. To compare the oligomeric status of wild type and mutant INI1 proteins, the protein was incubated in 500 μl of the buffer for 3 h on ice and then subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation as described above. Gel filtration chromatography was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, with 200 μg of His-INI1-(183–294) eluate from the Mono-Q Sepharose column. Fractions (500 μl) were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-His antibody as probe. The joining assays were performed with 32P-labeled 3′ preprocessed duplex DNA (U5.5 and U5.4) as donor DNA and pcDNA as target DNA as described previously (3Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) using the indicated amounts of proteins except that ∼7 ng of radiolabeled substrate and 100 ng of target DNA were used. Salt concentrations were varied between 10 and 150 mm NaCl. For agarose-based gel retardation assay about 8 and 16 pmol of hydroxylapatite eluate of the wild type INI1 or mutant INI1 were incubated with 200 ng of pcDNA in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MnCl2, and protease inhibitors at 30 °C for 1 h. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. For EMSA ∼7 ng of radiolabeled 3′ preprocessed duplex DNA (U5.5 and U5.4) was incubated with 5 pmol of hydroxylapatite eluate of wild type INI1 in strand transfer reaction buffer and protease inhibitors at 37 °C for 10 min. 10× cold viral LTR DNA was added to the reaction mixture. Minor groove inhibitors were added to the reaction mixture as indicated. About 10 μl of reaction mixture was run on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel made in Tris borate-EDTA, and the gel was run at 10 mA for 2 h. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. These were carried out as described previously, and the details are provided in the supplemental material (8Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Craig E. Zhang Z.K. Davies K.P. Kalpana G.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To understand the structure-function relationships of INI1, we biochemically purified bacterially expressed His-tagged INI1 (His-INI1) through three consecutive chromatography steps, viz. Ni-NTA-agarose, hydroxylapatite, and Mono-Q Sepharose columns (see supplemental “Materials and Methods”). After elution through the Mono-Q Sepharose column, INI1 was purified to near homogeneity (>95%; Fig. 1A). To test whether recombinant INI1 is an active protein, we carried out in vitro strand transfer reactions using different concentrations of purified INI1 and different IN:INI1 molar ratios. Previous reports had indicated that INI1 is able to activate and inhibit in vitro strand transfer activity of HIV-1 IN depending on the IN concentration and IN:INI1 molar ratios (3Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We employed the hydroxylapatite eluate for carrying out IN reactions because of the poor yield after the Mono-Q column purification step. INI1 stimulated joining of the substrate to the target DNA in a dose-dependent manner at low concentrations (0.25 pmol) of IN (Fig. 1B, compare lane 2 with lanes 5 and 8, indicated by arrows) but inhibited strand transfer reaction at higher concentration of IN (1.0 pmol) (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 4 and 7 with lane 10, indicated by arrowheads). At or near the physiological salt concentration (100, 125, and 150 mm) of NaCl, we found that 0.5 pmol of INI1 stimulated integrase activity at lower integrase input (0.25 pmol) and a lower INI1:IN ratio (2:1) but inhibited integrase activity at higher integrase input (0.5 pmol) and a higher INI1:IN ratio (4:1) (Fig. 1C). At physiological salt concentrations, a higher amount of INI1 was required to obtain robust inhibition of integrase activity. Similar results were obtained with another IN-binding protein, LEDGF. We found that purified full-length LEDGF stimulated IN strand transfer activity at a low IN concentration and an IN:LEDGF ratio of 1:4 and inhibited the reaction at a high IN concentration and an IN:LEDGF ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–12). Furthermore, the addition of 5.3 μm IN inhibitor (S-1360) resulted in inhibition of integrase strand transfer activities under these conditions (Fig. 1D, lanes 13–15). During the course of these studies, we observed that INI1 forms a higher order structure and has a tendency to aggregate at high concentration. This and additional observations using in vitro and in vivo binding studies suggested that INI1 is a multimer, as detailed below. To determine whether INI1 exists as a multimer in solution, purified INI1 eluted from the Mono-Q Sepharose column was subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation. Purified marker proteins were run as a control to estimate the apparent molecular weight relative to the fractions. At low concentrations (<5 nm), purified INI1 fractionated in a single peak after BSA (67 kDa) in glycerol gradients (Fig. 1E). However, at higher protein concentrations (>100 nm), INI1 migrated in multiple peaks (Fig. 1F). The first peak of INI1 was observed just after the 79-kDa marker, indicating that it is a dimer. Furthermore, other peaks of INI1 migrated with approximate molecular masses indicative of tetramers and octamers and higher order forms (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these studies demonstrated that recombinant INI1 is a dimer in solution at low concentrations but forms higher order structures at high concentrations. To further confirm that INI1 self-associates, we carried out other in vitro and in vivo interaction assays. A GST pulldown assay was carried out using GST-INI1 and His6-INI1 expressed in bacteria. The bacterial lysates expressing His6-INI1 were treated with DNase I, and the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of ethidium bromide to avoid DNA-mediated association (22Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In this assay, although the control GST bound to beads failed to pull down His-INI1, GST-INI1 was able to interact robustly with His-INI1, confirming that INI1 interacts with itself in vitro (Fig. 1G). To investigate whether INI1 self-associates in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged INI1 (HA-INI1) or FLAG-tagged INI1 (FL-INI1) alone or together. The lysates were pretreated with micrococcal nuclease to avoid scoring for a DNA-mediated association. FLAG-INI1 was able to coimmunoprecipitate HA-INI1 (Fig. 1H, lane 4) but not when expressed alone (Fig. 1H, lane 2). Taken together these results demonstrate that INI1 self-associates both in vitro and in vivo. To determine which domain of INI1 is involved in self-association, a deletion analysis was carried out using the yeast two-hybrid assay. A series of truncation mutants of INI1 as a fusion to GAL4AD (Fig. 2A) were tested for their ability to interact with full-length INI1 fused to the LexADBD (Fig. 2B). GAL4AD-INI1 efficiently interacted with LexADBD-INI1 in yeast (Fig. 2B). Mutants with deletion in the N terminus of INI1 that contained the Rpt1, Rpt2, and HR3 domains retained their ability to interact with full-length INI1, whereas the N-terminal fragment INI1-(1–130) failed to interact with LexADBD-INI1 (Fig. 2B). Deletion fragments INI1-(1–245) and INI1-(262–385), containing either the Rpt1 or Rpt2 motif, respectively, retained their ability to bind LexADBD-INI1 (Fig. 2B) although to a lesser extent (10 and 14%, respectively). Truncation of the C-terminal coiled coil domain of INI1 did not affect the ability of INI1-(1–294) to bind LexADBD-INI1 robustly (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the mutant INI1-(1–294), which retained both the Rpt and the N-terminal domains, exhibited robust activity. These results suggested that although the N-terminal fragment itself is not sufficient for self-association, it may be required for proper folding of INI1 that allows efficient self-association. The fact that INI1-(141–304) retained its ability to bind LexADBD-INI1 (Fig. 2B) demonstrates that the Rpt1 and Rpt2 motifs form the minimal multimerization domain. To determine whether the minimal multimerization domain of INI1 can self-associate in solution, deletion fragment S7 (amino acids 141–304) was expressed in bacteria and purified through three chromatographic columns, viz. Ni-NTA, hydroxylapatite, and Mono-Q Sepharose, respectively. The purified INI1-(141–304) polypeptide migrated in SDS-PAGE as two bands (Fig. 2C, left panel). Our analysis indicated that the faster migrating polypeptide is neither a degradation product of INI1-(141–304) nor a bacterial contaminant because: (i) antibodies against both the N-terminal His epitope tag and the C terminus of INI1 recognized the two polypeptides in the purified INI1-(141–304) preparation (Fig. 2C, middle and right panels), and (ii) mass spectrometric analysis revealed a single polypeptide species in purified preparations (data not shown). We found that the faster migrating polypeptide was an artifact of detergent solubilization, as it was absent when the protein was purified in the absence of IGEPAL, and the single band stained positively with INI1 antibody (Fig. 2D and data not shown). These results indicated that we were able to purify the deletion fragment to apparent homogeneity. To investigate the multimeric form of INI1-(141–304) we subjected the purified protein to gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. INI1-(141–304) eluted from the column soon after ovalbumin (43 kDa) and before chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), demonstrating that it is a dimer (∼42 kDa) (Fig. 2E). Western blot analysis of fractions eluted from the gel filtration column using an antibody against the His epitope tag confirmed that the eluted protein was INI1-(141–304) (Fig. 2E). To investigate the functional significance of multimerization of INI1 in HIV-1 replication, we isolated a panel of mutants of the minimal multimerization domain of INI1, S6 (amino acids 183–294), using a reverse yeast two-hybrid system. A random mutation library of INI1-S6-(183–294) fused to GAL4AD (8Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was screened against LexADB-INI1 to isolate a panel of multimerization-defective mutants with one or two amino acid substitutions (Table 1). These mutations were in either the Rpt1 or the Rpt2 motif and were mostly hydrophobic (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that hydrophobic interactions are likely to be important for INI1 self-association. Furthermore, among the residues mutated, amino acids Phe-204, Trp-206, Phe-233, Ile-237, Ile-263, Ile-264, and Ile-268 were partially or fully conserved phylogenetically (data not shown). In addition, several clusters of mutations were observed in Rpt1, and mutations in the Rpt2 motif overlapped with the nuclear export signal (NES) of INI1 (Fig. 3A). Previously we had identified mutants of INI1-(183–294) that are defective for interaction with IN (8Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that several residues of INI1-(183–294) necessary for IN binding were distinct from those required for INI1 multimerization (Fig. 3A and Table 2). Although IN binding-defective mutants were more frequent in the Rpt1 domain, multimerization-defective mutants were found in both the Rpt1 and Rpt2 regions.TABLE 1Interaction of dimerization-defective S6 with INI1 and INS6cloneMutation in Rpt1Mutation in Rpt2Interaction with INI1aPercentage of β-galactosidase activity representing the interaction of wild type S6 protein with wild type INI1 or IN.Interaction with INaPercentage of β-galactosidase activity representing the interaction of wild type S6 protein with wild type INI1 or IN.%%S6100100DD1F233L33<1DD2F204S33<1DD3V234A,I237T27<1DD4I195T,W206R28<1DD5I263T<510DD6I264T,I268T<110a Percentage of β-galactosidase activity representing the interaction of wild type S6 protein with wild type INI1 or IN.

The first panel consisted of mutants isolated as defective for binding to INI1 using the reverse two-hybrid system.

https://openalex.org/W2010354054,"The oncogenic kinase AKT1 is frequently overexpressed or activated in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers. In human breast tumors, we have previously shown that AKT1 represses homologous recombination (HR) induced by one double-strand break (DSB). To further analyze the impact of AKT1 on HR, we ectopically expressed wild-type or mutant forms of AKT1 in a hamster ovary cell line containing an intrachromosomal substrate for monitoring HR. In this cell line, AKT1 repressed HR induced by different genotoxic stresses including ionizing radiation, UV-C and one single DSB introduced into the intrachromosomal substrate. Consistently, AKT1 disrupted RAD51 foci formation, showing that AKT1 specifically affects gene conversion. Concomitantly, AKT1 represses both BRCA1 foci formation and HR stimulation resulting from BRCA1 overexpression, showing that AKT1 affects BRCA1-mediated HR functions, also in another species (hamster) and in another type of cell tissue (ovary cells). Finally, consistent with the HR defects, active AKT1 expression induces supernumerary centrosomes and aneuploidy. In addition to its impact on cell proliferation and apoptosis, the present data propose a novel oncogenic function for AKT1, by producing genomic instability as a consequence of HR repression."
https://openalex.org/W2023606914,"West Nile virus (WNV) has emerged globally as an increasingly important pathogen for humans and domestic animals. Studies of the evolutionary diversity of the virus over its known history will help to elucidate conserved sites, and characterize their correspondence to other pathogens and their relevance to the immune system. We describe a large-scale analysis of the entire WNV proteome, aimed at identifying and characterizing evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequences. This study, which used 2,746 WNV protein sequences collected from the NCBI GenPept database, focused on analysis of peptides of length 9 amino acids or more, which are immunologically relevant as potential T-cell epitopes. Entropy-based analysis of the diversity of WNV sequences, revealed the presence of numerous evolutionarily stable nonamer positions across the proteome (entropy value of < or = 1). The representation (frequency) of nonamers variant to the predominant peptide at these stable positions was, generally, low (< or = 10% of the WNV sequences analyzed). Eighty-eight fragments of length 9-29 amino acids, representing approximately 34% of the WNV polyprotein length, were identified to be identical and evolutionarily stable in all analyzed WNV sequences. Of the 88 completely conserved sequences, 67 are also present in other flaviviruses, and several have been associated with the functional and structural properties of viral proteins. Immunoinformatic analysis revealed that the majority (78/88) of conserved sequences are potentially immunogenic, while 44 contained experimentally confirmed human T-cell epitopes. This study identified a comprehensive catalogue of completely conserved WNV sequences, many of which are shared by other flaviviruses, and majority are potential epitopes. The complete conservation of these immunologically relevant sequences through the entire recorded WNV history suggests they will be valuable as components of peptide-specific vaccines or other therapeutic applications, for sequence-specific diagnosis of a wide-range of Flavivirus infections, and for studies of homologous sequences among other flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2098756331,"Artemis is a multifunctional phospho-protein with roles in V(D)J recombination, repair of double-strand breaks by nonhomologous end-joining and regulation of cell-cycle checkpoints after DNA damage. Here, we describe a new function of Artemis as a negative regulator of p53 in response to oxidative stress in both primary cells and cancer cell lines. We show that depletion of Artemis under typical culture conditions (21% oxygen) leads to a spontaneous phosphorylation and stabilization of p53, and resulting cellular G1 arrest and apoptosis. These effects are suppressed by co-depletion of DNA-PKcs, but not ATM, indicating that Artemis is an inhibitor of DNA–PKcs-mediated stabilization of p53. Culturing of cellsat 3% oxygen or treatment with an antioxidant abrogated p53 stabilization, indicating that oxidative stress is the responsible cellular stimulus. Treatment with ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide did not cause activation of this signaling pathway, whereas inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport were effective in reducing its activation. In addition, we show that p53-inducible genes involved in reducing reactive oxygen species are upregulated by Artemis depletion. These findings indicate that Artemis and DNA-PKcs participate in a new, signaling pathway to modulate p53 function in response to oxidative stress produced by mitochondrial respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1972015914,"Previously we showed that xenobiotic inducible cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins are bimodally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of delivery of chimeric signal containing CYP proteins to the peripheral and channel-forming mitochondrial outer membrane translocases (TOMs). CYP+33/1A1 and CYP2B1 did not require peripheral TOM70, TOM20, or TOM22 for translocation through the channel-forming TOM40 protein. In contrast, CYP+5/1A1 and CYP2E1 were able to bypass TOM20 and TOM22 but required TOM70. CYP27, which contains a canonical cleavable mitochondrial signal, required all of the peripheral TOMs for its mitochondrial translocation. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of bypass of peripheral TOMs by CYPs with chimeric signals. The results suggested that interaction of CYPs with Hsp70, a cytosolic chaperone involved in the mitochondrial import, alone was sufficient for the recognition of chimeric signals by peripheral TOMs. However, sequential interaction of chimeric signal containing CYPs with Hsp70 and Hsp90 resulted in the bypass of peripheral TOMs, whereas CYP27A1 interacted only with Hsp70 and was not able to bypass peripheral TOMs. Our results also show that delivery of a chimeric signal containing client protein by Hsp90 required the cytosol-exposed NH2-terminal 143 amino acids of TOM40. TOM40 devoid of this domain was unable to import CYP proteins. These results suggest that compared with the unimodal mitochondrial targeting signals, the chimeric mitochondrial targeting signals are highly evolved and dynamic in nature.

Protein targeting to different subcellular compartments is directed by specific NH2-terminal or internal signals, which serve as destination-specific mail delivery codes (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B.

ER-targeted proteins contain a distinct NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal for binding to a signal recognition particle, which in turn targets the emerging nascent chains to the ER (9Gilmore R.

Current models of protein targeting imply that the ER or mitochondrial destination of a protein is determined at the pre-translational level by virtue of the signal sequence that the protein carries. Many mitochondria- and ER-targeted proteins are encoded by a distinct set of genes. In a limited number of cases, characteristic mitochondrial targeting sequences are generated by differential expression of the gene using either alternate transcription/translation start sites or differential splicing of the primary transcripts (11Isenmann S.

Thus, proteins targeted to different cytoplasmic organelles carry a specific signal that directs the protein to a specific organelle. In contrast to the prevailing dogma, studies from our laboratory and other laboratories have shown that a number of proteins are bimodally targeted to different subcellular compartments (14Addya S.

Our results showed that different CYPs, glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoforms, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are targeted to the mitochondria in addition to their well established subcellular locations in the ER, cytosol, and plasma membranes, respectively (21Robin M.A. Prabu S.K.

Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Bimodal targeting of CYPs and APP was facilitated by the NH2-terminal chimeric signal, which consists of a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal, immediately flanking the NH2-terminal ER-targeting signal. By contrast, a COOH-terminal cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal was critical for the mitochondrial translocation of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (21Robin M.A. Prabu S.K. Raza H. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18960-18970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We also showed that mitochondrial targeting of these proteins required the activation of a cryptic mitochondrial signal either by sequence-specific processing by a cytosolic endoprotease as in the case of CYP1A1 (23Boopathi E. Srinivasan S. Fang J.K. Avadhani N.G. Mol.

In contrast, phosphorylation of a tandem PKA/PKC target site close to the COOH terminus was involved in the activation of the mitochondrial targeting signal of GSTA4-4 (21Robin M.A. Prabu S.K.

Proteins with canonical mitochondrial targeting signals specifically bind to the outer membrane protein import complex, TOM, as the critical initial step in mitochondrial protein targeting (13Neupert W.

The COOH termini of TOM20 and TOM70 and the NH2 terminus of TOM22 are exposed to the cytosol and provide receptor sites for binding to client proteins. The small TOMs (TOM7, TOM6, and TOM5), on the other hand, are associated with the channel-forming TOM40 protein, which is embedded in the outer membrane (13Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki H. Kadowaki T. Maeda M. Sasaki H. Nabekura J. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biol.

Current models suggest that the NH2-terminal signal regions of pre-proteins bind to the cytosol-exposed domains of TOM20 and TOM22 through both hydrophobic and ionic interactions. TOM20 and TOM70 exhibit overlapping substrate specificity. TOM22 is believed to regulate the gating activity of the TOM40 channel (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

A recent study suggests the involvement of Hsp70 in the targeting of phosphorylated CYP2E1 to TOM40 (18Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. J.

However, the precise mode of transport of chimeric signal-containing proteins to mitochondria and the interaction of chimeric signals with members of the TOM complex remain unclear. A number of studies have observed low levels of mitochondrial protein import by mitochondria pretreated with proteases or those depleted of peripheral TOMs (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 33Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol.

However, the role of these peripheral TOMs in the mitochondrial import of proteins containing chimeric signals remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the requirement for peripheral TOM proteins for the translocation of CYPMT2a (+5/1A1), CYPMT2b (+33/1A1) (the NH2-terminal truncated forms of CYP1A1), CYPMT4, and CYPMT5 (phosphorylated forms of CYP2B1 and CYP2E1, respectively) that contain NH2-terminal chimeric signals. We found that the activated chimeric signals of these proteins can bypass the peripheral TOM20 and TOM22 receptors. Our results also suggest that differential interaction of chimeric signals with Hsp70 and Hsp90 might be the key discriminating factor in the TOM20/TOM22 bypass mechanism of mitochondrial protein targeting. Strains BY4741 (MATa and MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), tom70Δ (MATa Tom70::KAN his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), and tom20Δ (MATa Tom20::KAN his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) were obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. Strain tom22Δ (his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3-52 trp1-Δ63 tom22::HIS3 rho0) and the control haploid strain OL223 (his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3-52 trp1-Δ63 rho0) were a kind gift from N. Pfanner (Germany). Standard yeast genetic techniques and media were used (37Rose M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rat CYP2E1, CYP2B1, CYP+5/1A1, CYP+33/1A1, and CYP27A1 cDNAs were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned in pGEM7zf (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) plasmid vectors. Full-length rat liver cDNA to TOM40 was purchased from ATCC (IMAGE clone). NH2-terminal truncated TOM40 cDNA (Δ143TOM40) was generated by PCR amplification using full-length TOM40 DNA as a template. Both full-length and truncated TOM40 constructs were cloned in pGEM7zf vector and pET vectors to carry out expression in vitro and bacterial cells, respectively. Wild-type and tom70Δ, tom20Δ, and tom22Δ yeast strains were used for expressing rat CYP cDNAs driven by the elongation factor promoter on either 2-μm or centromeric URA3 plasmids. The cDNAs for full-length CYP2E1, CYP+5/1A1, CYP+33/1A1, and su9-DHFR were cloned into the 2-μm vector, pTEF-URA3, or the centromeric pTEF-URA3 plasmid (38Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). CYP27A1 cDNA was cloned in pYES2 (Invitrogen) vector. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation in H medium (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA), as described previously (39Niranjan B.G. Wilson N.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12495-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and washed three times with the H medium. Mitochondria were subjected to limited Pronase treatment (30 μg/mg protein) at 4 °C for 30 min. Following the addition of a 10-fold excess protease inhibitor, the mitochondrial pellet was re-isolated by passing through 1.2 m sucrose and used for protein import as described below. In vitro translation products were generated in the transcription-linked translation RRL system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of added [35S]Met (40 μCi/50 μl reaction, 1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. In the indicated experiments, CYP2B1 and CYP2E1 translation products were phosphorylated for 45 min at 30 °C by supplementing the translation mix with 10 units/100 μl PKA (Sigma) and 100 μm ATP before using for import assays. Import reactions were performed in 200-μl final volumes containing 200 μg of mitochondria at 28 °C for 60 min. In some experiments the reaction volume for import assays was increased to 500 μl using 500 μg of mitochondria. After import, the samples were treated with 200 μg/ml trypsin for 20 min at 4 °C. Trypsin-treated and untreated samples were mixed with trypsin inhibitor (10× molar excess), and mitochondria were recovered by sedimentation through 1 m sucrose as described previously (18Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

Mitochondrial proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar) for 10 min at 75 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Rat liver mitochondria in H medium containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were incubated with antibodies to TOM20, TOM22, TOM70, and TOM40 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), porin (Calbiochem), or preimmune serum at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to remove excess antibody, and the resultant mitochondria were washed twice with H medium and used in import assays. For immunodepletion, RRL (200-μl each) was incubated with 20 μg of Hsp70 and/or Hsp90 antibodies (Sigma) overnight (12–16 h) at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pulled down by incubation with protein A-agarose (1 h at 4 °C) followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. In parallel experiments, RRL was incubated with preimmune IgG (20 μg/200 μl RRL) as antibody controls. The depleted RRL were used for in vitro translation as described above. Interaction of CYP proteins with cytosolic Hsp70 under in vitro and in vivo conditions was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. For studying in vitro interactions, nascent proteins were synthesized in the presence (for CYP2E1 and CYP2B1) and absence (for CYP+/51A1, CYP+33/1A1, and CYP27A1) of PKA in the RRL system. Interaction of CYP proteins with cytosolic Hsp70 or Hsp90 present in the lysate under these conditions was estimated by co-immunoprecipitation. Reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against the respective CYP proteins. One portion of the immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp70 and -Hsp90 antibodies. The other portion was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were subjected to autoradiography. Full-length and Δ143 TOM40 lacking the NH2-terminal cytosol-exposed Pro-rich domain (25Suzuki H. Kadowaki T.

Liposomes were prepared from azolectin (Sigma, type IVS) in MOPS/Tris (pH 6.9) buffer using a Branson sonifier as described previously (40Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Liposomes were freeze-thawed three times and solubilized by the addition of n-octyl glucopyranoside (6% v/v) on ice for 30 min. Solubilized liposomes (10 mg) were mixed with 9–300 μg of TOM40 and diluted 2-fold with 10 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 6.9) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Reconstitution was performed by dialysis of the mixture at 4 °C for 24 h against the same buffer. 35S-Labeled and phosphorylated RRL translation products (80,000–100,000 cpm) were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with vesicles containing full-length and truncated TOM40 in a buffer containing 20 mm KCl and 2% bovine serum albumin. Liposomes were re-isolated by sedimenting through a 0.4 m sucrose layer by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h. Client 35S-labeled proteins bound to TOM40 vesicles were eluted with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 10–80 mm NaCl. Liposomes and eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, and the amount of radioactivity in the liposomal and post-liposomal fractions was determined by radiometric imaging through the STORM system (GE Healthcare). The orientation and function of reconstituted TOM40 pore were investigated by measuring the release of [14C]sucrose and retention of [3H]dextran (70 kDa) from the proteoliposomes containing WT or NH2-terminal truncated Δ143 TOM40 proteins as described (25Suzuki H. Kadowaki T. Maeda M. Sasaki H. Nabekura J. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50619-50629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1771-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control purified P4501A1, which does not form a channel, was used following reconstitution in lipid vesicles. Reconstituted vesicles were suspended in 2 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NaN3, and 2 mm sucrose. Reaction mixtures were incubated with equal amounts (∼100,000 cpm) of [14C]sucrose (7.5 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Corp.) or [3H]dextran (55 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Corp.) at room temperature for 30 min. Following vortexing, tubes were placed in a bath-type sonic oscillator for 10 s. The tubes were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min and were allowed to cool down to room temperature. The reaction mixture was passed through a Sepharose 4B column, and the vesicles were eluted with 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm NaN3 and assayed for the amount of radioactivity retained by using a Beckman 5000 liquid scintillation counter. Mitochondria were isolated from both the control and tom-deleted yeast strains essentially as described previously (42Sepuri N.B. Schülke N. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1420-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by separation via SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis as described previously (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against CYP2E1, CYP2B1, CYP1A1, monoclonal antibody to CYP27A1, and monoclonal antibodies against cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Sigma) were used. Immunoblots were developed using a chemiluminescence SuperSignal West Femto kit (Pierce), and the blots were imaged and quantitated using a Versadoc system (Bio-Rad). Fig. 1A shows the NH2-terminal chimeric signals of CYP1A1, CYP2B1, and CYP2E1 that encompass the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain and the cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal sequences. We have shown previously that mitochondrial import of these CYPs is dependent on transmembrane potential and energy (14Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J.

In this study, we initially tested whether the major peripheral TOM receptors were needed for the mitochondrial import of these CYPs. For this purpose rat liver mitochondria were subjected to limited Pronase treatment, which is known to remove cytosol-exposed regions of the proteins (33Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 34-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that Pronase treatment degraded most of the cytosol-exposed regions of TOM70, TOM20, and TOM22. This treatment protected the 7-, 3-, and 7-kDa putative transmembrane segments that were detected by antibodies raised against full-length TOM70, TOM20, and TOM22, respectively. Under these treatment conditions nearly full-length 40-kDa TOM40 protein and the 30-kDa porin protein were protected. Although not shown, mitochondrial inner membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CcOI) and matrix protein Hsp70 were also fully protected. Using these protease-treated mitochondria, we tested the import efficiency of CYP proteins. CYP27A1 (44Su P. Rennert H. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R. Zheng Y.M. Addya S. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Avadhani N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which contains a canonical (NH2-terminal cleavable) mitochondrial targeting signal, was used as a positive control. The results of in vitro import showed that nearly intact CYP2B1 protein was imported and rendered resistant to trypsin treatment, although CYP2E1 and CYP+5/1A1 were not imported into Pronase-treated mitochondria (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows that CYP+33/1A1 was imported efficiently into Pronase-treated mitochondria, whereas CYP27A1 was not. These results suggest that different chimeric signal-containing proteins have different requirements for peripheral TOM proteins. In agreement with previously published results from our laboratory (14Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J.

Furthermore, in all cases mitochondria-imported CYPs were extractable with alkaline Na2CO3 indicating that they are mostly membrane extrinsic proteins (supplemental Fig. 1, A–E). The results of import with protease-treated mitochondria were further ascertained using two parallel approaches. In the first approach,"
https://openalex.org/W2063498404,"Tracheal glands (TG) may play a specific role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease due to mutations in the cftr gene and characterized by airway inflammation and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. We compared the gene expression of wild-type TG cells and TG cells with the cftr ΔF508 mutation (CF-TG cells) using microarrays covering the whole human genome. In the absence of infection, CF-TG cells constitutively exhibited an inflammatory signature, including genes that encode molecules such as IL-1α, IL-β, IL-32, TNFSF14, LIF, CXCL1 and PLAU. In response to P. aeruginosa, genes associated with IFN-γ response to infection (CXCL10, IL-24, IFNγR2) and other mediators of anti-infectious responses (CSF2, MMP1, MMP3, TLR2, S100 calcium-binding proteins A) were markedly up-regulated in wild-type TG cells. This microbicidal signature was silent in CF-TG cells. The deficiency of genes associated with IFN-γ response was accompanied by the defective membrane expression of IFNγR2 and altered response of CF-TG cells to exogenous IFN-γ. In addition, CF-TG cells were unable to secrete CXCL10, IL-24 and S100A8/S100A9 in response to P. aeruginosa. The differences between wild-type TG and CF-TG cells were due to the cftr mutation since gene expression was similar in wild-type TG cells and CF-TG cells transfected with a plasmid containing a functional cftr gene. Finally, we reported an altered sphingolipid metabolism in CF-TG cells, which may account for their inflammatory signature. This first comprehensive analysis of gene expression in TG cells proposes a protective role of wild-type TG against airborne pathogens and reveals an original program in which anti-infectious response was deficient in TG cells with a cftr mutation. This defective response may explain why host response does not contribute to protection against P. aeruginosa in CF."

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assays, we show here that Hpr1 and the FG repeats interact with overlapping binding sites on the Mex67 UBA domain. We present the solution structure of the Mex67 UBA domain (UBA-Mex67) complexed with a FXFG nucleoporin peptide and define residues engaged in the interaction and those involved in the FXFG-induced conformational change. We show by NMR titration that the binding of Hpr1 produces analogous changes in chemical shifts in similar regions of the UBA domain. Together the data presented here indicate that both Hpr1 and FXFG nucleoporins may bind in a similar way to the UBA-Mex67 domain. However, whereas binding of Hpr1 allows UBA-Mex67 to interact with tetra-ubiquitin, the complex between UBA-Mex67 and FXFG is unable to bind mono- or tetra-ubiquitin, suggesting that both substrate binding and also the nature of the substrate may influence the affinity of the UBA-Mex67 domain for ubiquitin.

From yeast to human, translocation of fully mature mRNPs to the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complex is thought to be mediated primarily by Mex67/NXF1 (also known as TAP), the primary mRNA export receptor, which forms a heterodimer with Mtr2/NXT1 (P15) that interacts directly with nuclear pore complex proteins (FG nucleoporins) that have characteristic FG sequence repeats (8Strässer K.

Because Mex67/NXF1 has low intrinsic affinity for mRNAs, it is recruited to the mRNP by several RNA-binding adaptors, including members of the THO·TREX complex that couples transcription elongation to mRNA export (2Köhler A.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that the ubiquitin pathway participates in the regulation of several key cellular functions including mRNA nuclear export (17Duncan K. Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 687-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez M.S. Gwizdek C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is a small 76-residue protein that can be covalently linked as a monomer or as a polyubiquitin chain to a lysine residue of a specific substrate (20Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 21Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). This process, known as ubiquitylation, targets the substrate for a range of possible fates. The diverse functions of ubiquitylation are mediated through effector proteins that contain one or several ubiquitin-binding domains. Those domains are classified into different groups according to their structural fold, the best known of which is the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (22Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 23Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the essential mRNA export receptor Mex67/NXF1 has a UBA domain at its C terminus that has been shown to interact with nucleoporin FG repeats (13Grant R.P. Hurt E. Neuhaus D. Stewart M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the UBA domain of Mex67 (UBA-Mex67) is not only required for mRNA nuclear export but also contributes to early co-transcriptional recruitment of the receptor to the mRNP (3Iglesias N. Stutz F. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Gwizdek C. Iglesias N. Rodriguez M.S. Ossareh-Nazari B. Hobeika M. Divita G. Stutz F. Dargemont C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16376-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition to showing that the Mex67 UBA domain was able to bind both ubiquitin and FG nucleoporins, our studies identified Hpr1 as a specific partner of the UBA domain of Mex67. Hpr1 is a component of the THO·TREX complex that links transcription on mRNA export and that is regulated by ubiquitylation in a transcription-dependent manner (25Gwizdek C. Hobeika M. Kus B. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. Rodriguez M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13401-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We proposed that the interaction with the Mex67 UBA domain transiently protects Hpr1 from ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation and thereby coordinates recruitment of the mRNA export machinery with transcription and early mRNP assembly (24Gwizdek C. Iglesias N. Rodriguez M.S. Ossareh-Nazari B. Hobeika M. Divita G. Stutz F. Dargemont C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16376-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Gwizdek C.

Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Xie Y.M. Garfinkel A. Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. Shah N. Hanaoka F. Sawitz D.G. Armstrong R.W. Souza L.M. Chen I.S. J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14103-14112Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, because of its specific interactions with ubiquitinated Hpr1, the Mex67 UBA domain appears to be a promising model for understanding molecular basis of specific substrate recognition by UBA domains. UBA domains share high structural homology and are characterized by the presence of three α helices that are connected by two short loops, forming a compact fold with a hydrophobic core and surface hydrophobic patches implicated in protein-protein interactions. Structural analysis of several UBA domains in complex with ubiquitin has indicated that UBA domains interact with ubiquitin mainly via the C terminus of helix 1, loop 1, and helix 3 (29Ohno A. Jee J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13529-13535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The structure in solution of ubiquitin polymers varies according to the lysine residue implicated in the polyubiquitin chain formation, which leads to different modes of recognition by the UBA domains (32Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). In particular, UBA domains bind to each ubiquitin moiety of Lys63-diubiquitin, whereas it binds simultaneously both ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-diubiquitin (33Trempe J.F. Brown N.R. Lowe E.D.

Cell. 2005; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Unlike other UBA domains, the UBA domain of Mex67/NXF1 contains an additional C-terminal helix, helix H4, which stabilizes the core structure by closing the UBA fold (14Grant R.P. Neuhaus D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We recently found that although helix H4 interferes with the ability of UBA-Mex67 to interact with ubiquitin, it is essential for the interaction of this UBA domain with its specific partner, Hpr1. We thus proposed that the helix H4 acts as a molecular switch that restricts the ubiquitin binding ability of the UBA domain of Mex67 to specific partners (36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In this paper, we characterize the structural requirements for UBA-Mex67 to bind distinct and specific partners. Solution binding studies based on fluorescence titration show that Hpr1 and nucleoporin FXFG interact with UBA-Mex67 with similar affinities and compete for binding. We present the solution structure of the Mex67 UBA domain complexed with a FXFG nucleoporin peptide and characterized, by NMR titration, the residues involved in both the binding of FG repeats and Hpr1 and also those involved in the conformational changes induced by the interaction of the FXFG peptide. In addition, we present evidence indicating that, whereas Hpr1 binding allows UBA-Mex67 to interact with tetra ubiquitin, FXFG binding does not facilitate this interaction. These data indicate that both substrate binding and the nature of the substrate may influence the affinity of the UBA-Mex67 domain for ubiquitin.DISCUSSIONUBA domains have been classified based on whether or not they are able to bind ubiquitin itself, and only a few investigations have assessed the extent to which UBA interactions with ubiquitin depend on the presence of specific partners. One such example, however, is the UBA2 domain of HHR23A that interacts specifically with the VIH-1 protein Vpr (26Withers-Ward E.S. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Xie Y.M. Garfinkel A. Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. Shah N. Hanaoka F. Sawitz D.G. Armstrong R.W. Souza L.M. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9732-9742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NMR solution structure of the HHR23A UBA domain together with analysis of its interaction with Vpr revealed that the amino acid sequence of loop 1 is critical for the binding of HIV-1 Vpr (27Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Withers-Ward E.S. Mueller T.D. Chen I.S. Feigon J.

The UBA2 domain of HHR23A is also able to bind other specific partners, including the human base excision repair protein 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, MPG (51Miao F. Bouziane M. Dammann R. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Pfeifer G. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28433-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the deglycosylating enzyme N-glycanase png1 (52Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21601-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the transcription regulator p300/CBP (53Zhu Q. Wani G. Wani M.A. Wani A.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 64-70PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise binding interface between UBA2 of HHR23A and its different partners remains to be established.The UBA domain of Mex67, which binds specifically the FG repeats of the nucleoporins as well as the export factor Hpr1, provides an interesting model for analyzing way in which a UBA domain interacts with two partners that have different specific functions. The in vitro FRET assays (Fig. 1) show that both Hpr1 and the FXFG peptide bind UBA-Mex67 with comparable affinities. Moreover these different UBA-Mex67 partners compete for the binding to the Mex67 UBA domain, indicating that both of these molecules cannot bind to the Mex67 UBA domain simultaneously (that is to say, their binding is mutually exclusive). The solution NMR structure of the UBA-Mex67 domain in complex with a FXFG peptide together with the NMR titration assays of UBA-Mex67 following FXFG or Hpr1 binding showed that the residues that were perturbed when either partner bound occurred mainly at similar sites. The residues that were perturbed on UBA-Mex67 were quite different to the binding interface between UBA2 of HHR23A and Vpr. Thus, a hydrophobic pocket located between helices 2 and 3 constituted the main interaction site for the FXFG peptide, whereas other examples bind primarily at different sites (22Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 23Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This difference in binding site location suggests that, despite high structural homology between the different UBA domains, they probably use diverse ways to recognize their cognate targets.Based on surface plasmon resonance data, we recently proposed that initial binding of Hpr1 to UBA-Mex67 might be followed by a conformational change of the UBA domain (36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The NMR results presented here clearly showed that the binding of either Hpr1 or the FXFG peptide resulted of small but consistent conformational changes mainly located in loop 1, helix 4, and a region around Trp575 (end of helix H2 and loop2) of the UBA domain. Although deletion of helix H4 or the F596A point mutant greatly reduced interaction of UBA-Mex67 with Hpr1 (36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we found that F596A does not affect the interaction with FXFG. These results are consistent with helix H4 having a regulating role and suggest that the conformational change involving helix H4 could be either required to stabilize interaction of UBA-Mex67 with its partners (rather than for initial binding) or alternatively to maintain, through its interaction with loop 1, the overall conformation of UBA-Mex67 that is compatible with binding to its specific targets.Although the binding sites of UBA-Mex67 for FXFG and Hpr1 appear to share many similarities, interaction with each partner has a different effect on the affinity of the Mex67 UBA domain for ubiquitin. Importantly, whereas binding to Hpr1 promotes binding of the Mex67 UBA domain to bind Lys48-tetra-ubiquitin, binding to nucleoporin FG repeats does not. Further work will be required to determine the atomic structure of the tripartite complex between UBA-Mex67, Hpr1, and ubiquitin to enable the precise molecular details of this interaction to be established. However, there was a suggestion that, relative to the changes seen with the FXFG peptide bound, the perturbation of the region surrounding Trp575 may have been greater when Hpr1 was bound. Although we cannot presently distinguish between direct interactions and more distant conformational changes associated with binding, these data support the idea that the binding sites for these partners are not completely identical. The region near Trp575 corresponds to the region of other UBA domains determinant for their interaction with Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin and not with mono-ubiquitin (33Trempe J.F. Brown N.R. Lowe E.D. Gordon C. Campbell I.D. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3178-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Varadan R. Assfalg M. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to decide whether residues around Trp575 are directly engaged in the interaction with Hpr1, because the resonance changes reported here would be consistent with a conformational change of helix2/loop2 region induced by Hpr1 binding, which would facilitate or stabilize interaction of UBA-Mex67 with poly-ubiquitin.The molecular bases responsible for the selectivity of ubiquitin-binding domains for their specific targets remain poorly described. However, the results presented here on the UBA domain of the mRNA export receptor open several new perspectives on the cross-talk between ubiquitin binding and substrate recognition by ubiquitin-binding domains that influence their cellular functions and may serve as a paradigm for understanding the manner in which several complex cellular processes can be modulated by ubiquitylation.

Recent studies have shown that the ubiquitin pathway participates in the regulation of several key cellular functions including mRNA nuclear export (17Duncan K. Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Curr.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is a small 76-residue protein that can be covalently linked as a monomer or as a polyubiquitin chain to a lysine residue of a specific substrate (20Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 21Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). This process, known as ubiquitylation, targets the substrate for a range of possible fates. The diverse functions of ubiquitylation are mediated through effector proteins that contain one or several ubiquitin-binding domains. Those domains are classified into different groups according to their structural fold, the best known of which is the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (22Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 23Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the essential mRNA export receptor Mex67/NXF1 has a UBA domain at its C terminus that has been shown to interact with nucleoporin FG repeats (13Grant R.P. Hurt E. Neuhaus D. Stewart M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the UBA domain of Mex67 (UBA-Mex67) is not only required for mRNA nuclear export but also contributes to early co-transcriptional recruitment of the receptor to the mRNP (3Iglesias N. Stutz F. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Gwizdek C. Iglesias N. Rodriguez M.S. Ossareh-Nazari B. Hobeika M. Divita G. Stutz F. Dargemont C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16376-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition to showing that the Mex67 UBA domain was able to bind both ubiquitin and FG nucleoporins, our studies identified Hpr1 as a specific partner of the UBA domain of Mex67. Hpr1 is a component of the THO·TREX complex that links transcription on mRNA export and that is regulated by ubiquitylation in a transcription-dependent manner (25Gwizdek C. Hobeika M. Kus B. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. Rodriguez M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13401-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We proposed that the interaction with the Mex67 UBA domain transiently protects Hpr1 from ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation and thereby coordinates recruitment of the mRNA export machinery with transcription and early mRNP assembly (24Gwizdek C. Iglesias N. Rodriguez M.S. Ossareh-Nazari B. Hobeika M. Divita G. Stutz F. Dargemont C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16376-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Gwizdek C.

With the exception of the UBA2 domain of HHR23A, most of the UBA domains studied to date have shown little or no substrate specificity (26Withers-Ward E.S. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Xie Y.M. Garfinkel A. Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. Shah N. Hanaoka F. Sawitz D.G. Armstrong R.W. Souza L.M. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9732-9742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14103-14112Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, because of its specific interactions with ubiquitinated Hpr1, the Mex67 UBA domain appears to be a promising model for understanding molecular basis of specific substrate recognition by UBA domains. UBA domains share high structural homology and are characterized by the presence of three α helices that are connected by two short loops, forming a compact fold with a hydrophobic core and surface hydrophobic patches implicated in protein-protein interactions. Structural analysis of several UBA domains in complex with ubiquitin has indicated that UBA domains interact with ubiquitin mainly via the C terminus of helix 1, loop 1, and helix 3 (29Ohno A. Jee J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13529-13535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The structure in solution of ubiquitin polymers varies according to the lysine residue implicated in the polyubiquitin chain formation, which leads to different modes of recognition by the UBA domains (32Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). In particular, UBA domains bind to each ubiquitin moiety of Lys63-diubiquitin, whereas it binds simultaneously both ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-diubiquitin (33Trempe J.F. Brown N.R. Lowe E.D.

Cell. 2005; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Unlike other UBA domains, the UBA domain of Mex67/NXF1 contains an additional C-terminal helix, helix H4, which stabilizes the core structure by closing the UBA fold (14Grant R.P. Neuhaus D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We recently found that although helix H4 interferes with the ability of UBA-Mex67 to interact with ubiquitin, it is essential for the interaction of this UBA domain with its specific partner, Hpr1. We thus proposed that the helix H4 acts as a molecular switch that restricts the ubiquitin binding ability of the UBA domain of Mex67 to specific partners (36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterize the structural requirements for UBA-Mex67 to bind distinct and specific partners. Solution binding studies based on fluorescence titration show that Hpr1 and nucleoporin FXFG interact with UBA-Mex67 with similar affinities and compete for binding. We present the solution structure of the Mex67 UBA domain complexed with a FXFG nucleoporin peptide and characterized, by NMR titration, the residues involved in both the binding of FG repeats and Hpr1 and also those involved in the conformational changes induced by the interaction of the FXFG peptide. In addition, we present evidence indicating that, whereas Hpr1 binding allows UBA-Mex67 to interact with tetra ubiquitin, FXFG binding does not facilitate this interaction. These data indicate that both substrate binding and the nature of the substrate may influence the affinity of the UBA-Mex67 domain for ubiquitin. DISCUSSIONUBA domains have been classified based on whether or not they are able to bind ubiquitin itself, and only a few investigations have assessed the extent to which UBA interactions with ubiquitin depend on the presence of specific partners. One such example, however, is the UBA2 domain of HHR23A that interacts specifically with the VIH-1 protein Vpr (26Withers-Ward E.S. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Xie Y.M. Garfinkel A. Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. Shah N. Hanaoka F. Sawitz D.G. Armstrong R.W. Souza L.M. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9732-9742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NMR solution structure of the HHR23A UBA domain together with analysis of its interaction with Vpr revealed that the amino acid sequence of loop 1 is critical for the binding of HIV-1 Vpr (27Dieckmann T.

The UBA2 domain of HHR23A is also able to bind other specific partners, including the human base excision repair protein 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, MPG (51Miao F. Bouziane M. Dammann R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28433-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the deglycosylating enzyme N-glycanase png1 (52Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21601-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the transcription regulator p300/CBP (53Zhu Q. Wani G. Wani M.A. Wani A.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 64-70PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise binding interface between UBA2 of HHR23A and its different partners remains to be established.The UBA domain of Mex67, which binds specifically the FG repeats of the nucleoporins as well as the export factor Hpr1, provides an interesting model for analyzing way in which a UBA domain interacts with two partners that have different specific functions. The in vitro FRET assays (Fig. 1) show that both Hpr1 and the FXFG peptide bind UBA-Mex67 with comparable affinities. Moreover these different UBA-Mex67 partners compete for the binding to the Mex67 UBA domain, indicating that both of these molecules cannot bind to the Mex67 UBA domain simultaneously (that is to say, their binding is mutually exclusive). The solution NMR structure of the UBA-Mex67 domain in complex with a FXFG peptide together with the NMR titration assays of UBA-Mex67 following FXFG or Hpr1 binding showed that the residues that were perturbed when either partner bound occurred mainly at similar sites. The residues that were perturbed on UBA-Mex67 were quite different to the binding interface between UBA2 of HHR23A and Vpr. Thus, a hydrophobic pocket located between helices 2 and 3 constituted the main interaction site for the FXFG peptide, whereas other examples bind primarily at different sites (22Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 23Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This difference in binding site location suggests that, despite high structural homology between the different UBA domains, they probably use diverse ways to recognize their cognate targets.Based on surface plasmon resonance data, we recently proposed that initial binding of Hpr1 to UBA-Mex67 might be followed by a conformational change of the UBA domain (36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The NMR results presented here clearly showed that the binding of either Hpr1 or the FXFG peptide resulted of small but consistent conformational changes mainly located in loop 1, helix 4, and a region around Trp575 (end of helix H2 and loop2) of the UBA domain. Although deletion of helix H4 or the F596A point mutant greatly reduced interaction of UBA-Mex67 with Hpr1 (36Hobeika M. Brockmann C. Iglesias N. Gwizdek C. Neuhaus D. Stutz F. Stewart M. Divita G. Dargemont C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we found that F596A does not affect the interaction with FXFG. These results are consistent with helix H4 having a regulating role and suggest that the conformational change involving helix H4 could be either required to stabilize interaction of UBA-Mex67 with its partners (rather than for initial binding) or alternatively to maintain, through its interaction with loop 1, the overall conformation of UBA-Mex67 that is compatible with binding to its specific targets.Although the binding sites of UBA-Mex67 for FXFG and Hpr1 appear to share many similarities, interaction with each partner has a different effect on the affinity of the Mex67 UBA domain for ubiquitin. Importantly, whereas binding to Hpr1 promotes binding of the Mex67 UBA domain to bind Lys48-tetra-ubiquitin, binding to nucleoporin FG repeats does not. Further work will be required to determine the atomic structure of the tripartite complex between UBA-Mex67, Hpr1, and ubiquitin to enable the precise molecular details of this interaction to be established. However, there was a suggestion that, relative to the changes seen with the FXFG peptide bound, the perturbation of the region surrounding Trp575 may have been greater when Hpr1 was bound. Although we cannot presently distinguish between direct interactions and more distant conformational changes associated with binding, these data support the idea that the binding sites for these partners are not completely identical. The region near Trp575 corresponds to the region of other UBA domains determinant for their interaction with Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin and not with mono-ubiquitin (33Trempe J.F. Brown N.R. Lowe E.D. Gordon C. Campbell I.D. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3178-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Varadan R. Assfalg M. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to decide whether residues around Trp575 are directly engaged in the interaction with Hpr1, because the resonance changes reported here would be consistent with a conformational change of helix2/loop2 region induced by Hpr1 binding, which would facilitate or stabilize interaction of UBA-Mex67 with poly-ubiquitin.The molecular bases responsible for the selectivity of ubiquitin-binding domains for their specific targets remain poorly described. However, the results presented here on the UBA domain of the mRNA export receptor open several new perspectives on the cross-talk between ubiquitin binding and substrate recognition by ubiquitin-binding domains that influence their cellular functions and may serve as a paradigm for understanding the manner in which several complex cellular processes can be modulated by ubiquitylation.

However, there is no current information on the preclinical manifestation of those motor deficits in presymptomatic gene carriers. To further understand and characterize the onset of the clinical manifestation in this disease, we tested presymptomatic spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene carriers, and volunteers, in a task that evaluates their motor performance and their motor learning capabilities.28 presymptomatic spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene carriers and an equal number of control volunteers matched for age and gender participated in the study. Both groups were tested in a prism adaptation task known to be sensible to both motor performance and visuomotor learning deficits. Our results clearly show that although motor learning capabilities are intact, motor performance deficits are present even years before the clinical manifestation of the disease start.The results show a clear deficit in motor performance that can be detected years before the clinical onset of the disease. This motor performance deficit appears before any motor learning or clinical manifestations of the disease. These observations identify the performance coefficient as an objective and quantitative physiological biomarker that could be useful to assess the efficiency of different therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2078043563,"Neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease, are characterized by abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. One group of tauopathies, known as frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), is directly associated with mutations of the gene tau. However, it is unknown why mutant Tau is highly phosphorylated in the patient brain. In contrast to in vivo high phosphorylation, FTDP-17 Tau is phosphorylated less than wild-type Tau in vitro. Because phosphorylation is a balance between kinase and phosphatase activities, we investigated dephosphorylation of mutant Tau proteins, P301L and R406W. Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases in rat brain extracts. Compared with wild-type Tau, R406W was dephosphorylated faster and P301L slower. The two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis suggested that faster dephosphorylation of R406W was due to a lack of phosphorylation at Ser-404, which is relatively resistant to dephosphorylation. We studied the effect of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 or microtubule binding on dephosphorylation of wild-type Tau, P301L, and R406W in vitro. Pin1 catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro sequences in a subset of proteins. Dephosphorylation of wild-type Tau was reduced in brain extracts of Pin1-knockout mice, and this reduction was not observed with P301L and R406W. On the other hand, binding to microtubules almost abolished dephosphorylation of wild-type and mutant Tau proteins. These results demonstrate that mutation of Tau and its association with microtubules may change the conformation of Tau, thereby suppressing dephosphorylation and potentially contributing to the etiology of tauopathies. Neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease, are characterized by abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. One group of tauopathies, known as frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), is directly associated with mutations of the gene tau. However, it is unknown why mutant Tau is highly phosphorylated in the patient brain. In contrast to in vivo high phosphorylation, FTDP-17 Tau is phosphorylated less than wild-type Tau in vitro. Because phosphorylation is a balance between kinase and phosphatase activities, we investigated dephosphorylation of mutant Tau proteins, P301L and R406W. Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases in rat brain extracts. Compared with wild-type Tau, R406W was dephosphorylated faster and P301L slower. The two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis suggested that faster dephosphorylation of R406W was due to a lack of phosphorylation at Ser-404, which is relatively resistant to dephosphorylation. We studied the effect of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 or microtubule binding on dephosphorylation of wild-type Tau, P301L, and R406W in vitro. Pin1 catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro sequences in a subset of proteins. Dephosphorylation of wild-type Tau was reduced in brain extracts of Pin1-knockout mice, and this reduction was not observed with P301L and R406W. On the other hand, binding to microtubules almost abolished dephosphorylation of wild-type and mutant Tau proteins. These results demonstrate that mutation of Tau and its association with microtubules may change the conformation of Tau, thereby suppressing dephosphorylation and potentially contributing to the etiology of tauopathies.

Intracellular inclusions comprising Tau are also found in several other neurodegenerative diseases, including Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), collectively called tauopathies (1Lee V.M.

Tau proteins in inclusions are hyperphosphorylated, and extensive studies have identified the phosphorylation sites; for example, more than 20 sites have been identified in PHF-Tau obtained from AD brains (7Morishima-Kawashima M.

Tau can be phosphorylated by a variety of protein kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), mitogen-activated protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), microtubule affinity regulating kinase, and others (9Mandelkow E.M.

Tau is predominantly phosphorylated on the Ser or Thr residue in Ser/Thr-Pro sequences, suggesting the involvement of proline-directed protein kinases such as GSK3β and Cdk5 in hyperphosphorylation. A critical question is how mutations in Tau induce hyperphosphorylation in brain (12Avila J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2922-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Early phosphorylation experiments in vitro and in cultured cells have shown that mutant Tau is less phosphorylated than wild-type (WT) Tau (13Matsumura N. Yamazaki T. Ihara Y. Am. J.

However, two later studies demonstrated higher phosphorylation of mutant Tau using brain extracts as a source of protein kinases in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (19Alonso A. del C. Mederlyova A. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34873-34881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or in immortalized cortical cells (20Krishnamurthy P.K. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7893-7900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, it is not fully understood how mutant Tau becomes highly phosphorylated in vivo. Tau hyperphosphorylation could also be attributed to reduced dephosphorylation activity. Tau is dephosphorylated in vitro by any of the major four classes of protein phosphatases, PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C, but PP2A is thought to be the major protein phosphatase that regulates Tau phosphorylation state in brains (21Gong C.X.

Ono T. Tashima K. Ihara Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Few studies have been done on dephosphorylation of mutant Tau, however, and thus the mechanism remains unclear. One putative factor involved in mutant Tau dephosphorylation is the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro sequences in a subset of proteins (28Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi K. Uchida C. Shin R.W. Shimazaki K. Uchida T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 359-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Pin1 is involved in AD pathogenesis as shown by the fact that it is found in neurofibrillary tangles and that Tau is hyperphosphorylated in Pin1-deficient mouse brains (30Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Pin1 is indicated to facilitate Tau dephosphorylation via PP2A by binding to the phospho-Thr-231-Pro or phospho-Thr-212-Pro site (31Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 32Smet C. Sambo A.V. Wieruszeski J.M. Leroy A. Landrieu I. Buée L.

Chem. 2006; 281: 19296-19304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The effect of Pin1 on the stability of mutant Tau was recently reported (34Lim J. Balastik M. Lee T.H. Nakamura K. Liou Y.C. Sun A. Finn G. Pastorino L. Lee V.M. Lu K.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 1877-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but a detailed analysis of Pin1 action on mutant Tau has not been reported. Another possible factor affecting dephosphorylation of mutant Tau is the binding to microtubules. We previously showed that phosphorylation of Tau is stimulated upon binding to microtubules (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that binding to microtubules may also affect the extent of Tau dephosphorylation. Here, we examined the effects of Pin1 and binding to microtubules on dephosphorylation of WT and FTDP-17 mutant (P301L and R406W) Tau proteins that had been phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 or Cdk5-p35. P301L and R406W are two distinct types of FTDP-17 mutants that have been studied well. We show for the first time how the regulation of Tau dephosphorylation can contribute to the observed Tau hyperphosphorylation in tauopathies. The catalytic subunit of each of PP1 and PP2A was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Brain extract of Pin1-knockout mice and the preparation of GST-Pin1 have been described (36Akiyama H. Shin R.W. Uchida C. Kitamoto T. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cdk5/p35 and Cdk5/p25 were prepared from Sf9 cells as described (37Saito T. Onuki R. Fujita Y. Kusakawa G. Ishiguro K. Bibb J.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSK3β and the catalytic subunit of PKA were purified from rat brain extract as described (38Sasaki T. Taoka M. Ishiguro K. Uchida A.

GSK3β purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA) was also used for some experiments. cDNAs encoding recombinant human WT and FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L and R406W, respectively) with one N-terminal insert and four repeat domains (1N4R, see supplemental Fig. S4A) in the pRK172 bacterial expression vector were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-competent cells (35Sakaue F.

ΔMTB, Tau without microtubule-binding repeats, was constructed by PCR with primers 5′-AATAAAAAGATTGAAACCCACAAGCTGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATTCTTCAGGTCTGGCATGG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated into pSG5. The accuracy of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Tau proteins were purified from the heat-stable supernatant of the E. coli extract by chromatography on a Mono S column as described (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Tubulin was prepared from porcine brains by three cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization/depolymerization (40Wada Y. Ishiguro K. Itoh T.J. Uchida T. Hotani H. Saito T. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tubulin was separated from microtubule-associated proteins using a phosphocellulose column (P11, Whatman, Brentford, UK) as described (40Wada Y. Ishiguro K. Itoh T.J. Uchida T. Hotani H. Saito T. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tau (0.05 mg/ml) was bound to microtubules, which were polymerized from 0.5 mg/ml tubulin with an aid of 20 μm taxol in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, and 1 mm MgCl2 by incubation at 35 °C for 20 min as described (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant Tau (0.1 mg/ml) was phosphorylated with Cdk5-p35 or Cdk5-p25 in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, and 1 mm MgCl2, in the presence of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 35 °C. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by gel-filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column. Fractions containing P-Tau were pooled, stored at −80 °C, and used for dephosphorylation experiments within 10 days. P-Tau (0.05 mg/ml) was incubated with rat brain extracts at 35 °C for various times in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA. Dephosphorylation was stopped by addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling for 2 min, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The remaining 32P-Tau was estimated by a FLA-7000 Bioimage Analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Dephosphorylation was defined as the amount of phosphate removed from P-Tau during incubation. Dephosphorylation of experimental samples was expressed as a percentage of that of P-WT Tau by WT rat or mouse brain extracts. P-Tau separated by SDS-PAGE was digested in gel slices by trypsin (Sigma) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, at 30 °C overnight. The resulting tryptic peptides were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping using a thin-layer cellulose plate (catalogue number 1.05716.0001, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9, and ascending chromatography was performed in n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water (150/100/30/120). Phosphopeptide spots were detected, and the intensity was measured by a FLA-7000 Bioimage Analyzer. Purified, recombinant Tau, either WT Tau or FDTP-17 mutant Tau P301L or R406W, was phosphorylated in vitro by Cdk5-p25 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (supplemental Fig. S1A). About 4 mol of phosphate was incorporated into 1 mol of WT Tau. 32P bound to WT Tau was easily removed by incubation with brain extract (BE) but not without the brain extract (−) (Fig. 1A). The Tau protein was not degraded during incubation. The decrease in the 32P label on Tau was inhibited by the protein phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin LR (supplemental Fig. S2A), indicating that the decrease in the 32P label is dephosphorylation. We measured the dephosphorylation of in vitro phosphorylated P301L and R406W; P-P301L was dephosphorylated slower and P-R406W faster than P-WT Tau (Fig. 1B). These results constitute the evidence of differential rates of dephosphorylation between WT and mutant Taus. Tau is mainly dephosphorylated by PP2A (21Gong C.X. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Goedert M. Jakes R. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Cohen P. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5535-5544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To determine whether our observed difference in dephosphorylation (Fig. 1B) was due to PP2A activity, we dephosphorylated P-Tau by rat brain extract in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor. Dephosphorylation was inhibited by okadaic acid at 10 nm, the concentration specific to PP2A, but not inhibited by inhibitor-2 (40 nm), a heat-stable inhibitory protein for PP1 (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the results using the purified catalytic subunit of PP1 or PP2A. P-Tau was dephosphorylated by PP2A much faster than by PP1 (Fig. 1D), consistent with previous reports (22Goedert M. Jakes R. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Cohen P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2804-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Gong C.X. Lidsky T. Wegiel J. Zuck L. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5535-5544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Further, P-P301L was dephosphorylated by PP2A slower and P-R406W faster compared with P-WT Tau (Fig. 1E), as observed in the brain extract experiments (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that PP2A is the major protein phosphatase differentially dephosphorylating these Tau substrates (i.e. FTDP-17 mutants and WT Tau) in brain extract. WT and P301L Tau are phosphorylated mainly at Ser-202, Ser-235, and Ser-404 by Cdk5-p25, and R406W is phosphorylated mainly at Ser-202 and Ser-235 (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We analyzed the dephosphorylation rate at these sites in P301L or R406W by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Indeed, Ser-202, Ser-235, and Ser-404 were phosphorylated in WT Tau and P301L, and Ser-202 and Ser-235 in R406W (Fig. 2A, 0 min), as shown previously (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide patterns after 10 min of dephosphorylation in the brain extract were similar to those before incubation, although there were differences in relative intensity (Fig. 2A). We quantified the phosphorylation signals in each of four spots in WT or P301L and expressed them as a fraction of the sum of these four phosphorylation spots (Fig. 2B). The data clearly show that Ser-202 was dephosphorylated faster than Ser-404. Because R406W lacks Ser-404 phosphorylation, these also results suggest a rationale for why R406W is dephosphorylated faster than WT or P301L. The prolyl-peptidyl isomerase Pin1 facilitates PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of P-Tau by converting the cis peptide bond of proline at phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro sites to the trans conformation (31Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), thereby yielding a more kinetically favorable P-Tau substrate. However, its effect on dephosphorylation of mutant Tau has not been examined. We measured dephosphorylation of P-WT Tau and P-mutant Taus in brain extracts from Pin1-KO and WT mice. An incubation time of 10 min was chosen as the optimum condition for detecting the difference (supplemental Fig. S2B). Dephosphorylation of P-Tau was slower in Pin1-KO mouse brain extract compared with WT mouse brain extract (Fig. 3 A and B), and the dephosphorylation rate increased upon addition of purified Pin1 at 2 nm (Fig. 3B, WT), a concentration that is sufficient to restore the dephosphorylation activity in Pin1-KO mice (41Fanghänel J. Akiyama H. Uchida C. Uchida T. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the report that Pin1 enhances dephosphorylation of P-Tau by PP2A (32Smet C. Sambo A.V. Wieruszeski J.M. Leroy A. Landrieu I. Buée L. Lippens G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2032-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We then compared dephosphorylation of P-P301L and P-R406W in Pin1-KO and WT extracts. Interestingly, there was less of a difference in dephosphorylation between Pin1-KO and WT mouse brain extract in P301L and R406W compared with WT Tau; moreover, addition of purified Pin1 to Pin1-KO mouse brain extract did not stimulate the dephosphorylation rate of P-P301L and P-R406W (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that FTDP-17 mutations confer insensitivity of P-Tau to Pin1-dependent enhancement of dephosphorylation. We next addressed whether the effect of Pin1 deficiency on dephosphorylation was specific for the phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro sequence. For this experiment, in addition to using Cdk5 we used two other protein kinases, GSK3β, a proline-directed kinase, and PKA, a non-proline-directed kinase, to phosphorylate Tau. About 2–3 mol of phosphate was incorporated into Tau after incubation with these protein kinases (supplemental Fig. S1B), but two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps were different between them as expected based on their different phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3C). Respective phosphopeptide maps are similar to those of GSK3β- and PKA-phosphorylated Tau reported previously (42Schneider A. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 23: 3549-3558Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). P-WT Tau phosphorylated by GSK3β or PKA was dephosphorylated easily by WT brain extract (Fig. 3D). The dephosphorylation of GSK3β-phosphorylated WT Tau as well as Cdk5-phosphorylated WT Tau was decreased in the presence of Pin1-KO mouse brain extract, but this was not the case for PKA-phosphorylated WT Tau, consistent with previous results that the effect of Pin1 on dephosphorylation is specific for certain phosphorylation sequences (31Zhou X.Z.

Phosphorylation of Tau is stimulated when Tau is bound on microtubules (40Wada Y. Ishiguro K. Itoh T.J. Uchida T. Hotani H. Saito T. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Further, phosphorylation by Cdk5-p35 or Cdk5-p25 of mutant Tau bound to microtubules is enhanced to the same extent as that of WT Tau (35Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that binding to microtubules may also affect dephosphorylation of Tau. WT Tau, P301L, or R406W (0.05 mg/ml), each of which had been phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25, was bound to taxol-polymerized microtubules. Under our experimental conditions, essentially 100% of P-Tau was bound to microtubules. When microtubule-bound P-R406W was incubated with rat brain extract, dephosphorylation was almost completely abolished, whereas unbound P-R406W was quickly dephosphorylated (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained for P-WT Tau and P-P301L (Fig. 4B). Several control experiments were performed to substantiate the above results. First, we verified that the tubulin fraction did not contain protein kinases, which could counter any dephosphorylation. In this regard, we checked the phosphorylation state of P-WT Tau after incubation with microtubules; no change was evident, indicating that the tubulin fraction contained neither Tau kinases nor phosphatases (supplemental Fig. S3A). Second, we verified that the GTP used for tubulin polymerization did not act as a competitive substrate for dephosphorylation; we found that dephosphorylation proceeded at a similar rate in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm GTP (supplemental Fig. S3B). Third, we verified that tubulin did not inhibit the protein phosphatases in brain extract. To test this possibility, we used an alternate substrate, neurofilament light chain (NF-L, in this case phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25), which does not interact with microtubules (38Sasaki T. Taoka M. Ishiguro K. Uchida A. Saito T. Isobe T. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36032-36039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of NF-L proceeded in the presence of microtubules, indicating that tubulin does not inhibit brain extract phosphatases (supplemental Fig. S3C). Fourth, it has been suggested that the repeat region of Tau binds to the interior of microtubules when tubulin is co-assembled with Tau (43Amos L.A. Schlieper D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 257-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and thus we verified that P-WT Tau did not bind inside of microtubules in our system. We added P-WT Tau to pre-assembled microtubules and measured dephosphorylation. Indeed, the order of P-WT Tau addition did not affect its dephosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S3D). The above results suggested that, upon binding to microtubules, P-Tau changes its conformation such that dephosphorylation is unfavorable. To demonstrate"

Further analyses revealed that ARR19 was expressed in Leydig cells, and its expression was differentially regulated during Leydig cell development. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ARR19 in Leydig cells inhibited testicular steroidogenesis, down-regulating the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, which suggests that ARR19 is an antisteroidogenic factor. Interestingly, cAMP/luteinizing hormone attenuated ARR19 expression in a fashion similar to that of GATA-1, which was previously reported to be down-regulated by cAMP. Sequence analysis of the Arr19 promoter revealed the presence of two putative GATA-1 binding motifs. Further analyses with 5′ deletion and point mutants of putative GATA-1 binding motifs showed that these GATA-1 binding sites were critical for high promoter activity. CREB-binding protein coactivated GATA-1 and markedly increased the activity of the Arr19 promoter. Both GATA-1 and CREB-binding proteins occupied the GATA-1 motifs within the Arr19 promoter, which was repressed by cAMP treatment. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that ARR19 is the target gene of GATA-1 and suggest that ARR19 gene expression in testicular Leydig cells is regulated by luteinizing hormone/cAMP signaling via the control of GATA-1 expression, resulting in the control of testicular steroidogenesis.

Arr19 (androgen receptor corepressor of 19 kDa), also referred to as Cklfsf2a, is a member of the chemokine-like factor superfamily (CKLFSF), a group of novel proteins that operate as a functional bridge between chemokines and members of the transmembrane 4 superfamily. Members of the CKLFSF family have been suggested to perform an important role across a broad range of physiological and pathological processes. In humans, the CKLFSF family harbors nine genes, CKLF and CKLFSF1 to -8, which exhibit high degrees of similarity at both the amino acid and structural levels. Among these, CKLF, CKLKSF1, and CKLFSF2 are closely related to each other and are tightly linked on chromosome 16q22.1 (1.Han W. Ding P. Xu M. Wang L. Rui M. Shi S. Liu Y. Zheng Y. Chen Y. Yang T.

Human CKLFSF2 is expressed abundantly in the testis and has two counterparts in the mouse, Cklfsf2a and Cklfsf2b. Cklfsf2a and Cklfsf2b evidence a similar expression pattern and amino acid identities of 47.6 and 45.5%, respectively, with human CKLFSF2 (3.Li T. Han W. Yang T. Ding P. Rui M. Liu D. Wang Y. Ma D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mouse Cklfsf2a/Arr19 was originally cloned as a potential androgen response gene in the testis and was further characterized as a novel androgen receptor corepressor (4.Jeong B.C. Hong C.Y.

The Arr19 gene is located on chromosome 8 and encodes for a leucine-rich and highly hydrophobic 19-kDa protein. ARR19 is expressed abundantly in the testis and moderately in other male reproductive organs, such as the prostate (3.Li T. Han W. Yang T. Ding P. Rui M. Liu D. Wang Y. Ma D. Int. J. Biochem.

In response to hormonal signals, gene expression is modulated via the cAMP-dependent intracellular pathway, resulting in the activation of protein kinase A. The best studied target of cAMP/protein kinase A signaling is cAMP-response element (CRE) 2The abbreviations used are: CREcAMP-response elementCREBCRE-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinLHluteinizing hormoneSLCstem Leydig cellPLCprogenitor Leydig cellRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationhCGhuman chorionic gonadotrophin. 2The abbreviations used are: CREcAMP-response elementCREBCRE-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinLHluteinizing hormoneSLCstem Leydig cellPLCprogenitor Leydig cellRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationhCGhuman chorionic gonadotrophin.-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, which binds as a dimer to the 8-bp palindromic sequence CRE detected in the regulatory regions of some cAMP-regulated genes (5.Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). In the testis, however, the promoter of several cAMP-regulated genes, such as StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), inhibin α, P450c17, p450scc, and aromatase, lacks the “classical” CRE elements. This suggests that other transcription factors, besides CREB, must also function as downstream effectors of cAMP signaling. GATA-1, a transcription factor, is expressed in murine testicular cells and in the tumor cell lines derived from them (6.Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms by which CBP intervenes in transcription regulation have been suggested. The binding of CBP to transcription factors may constitute a means by which histone acetyltransferase can be recruited into the vicinity of the nucleosomes. CBP can also serve as a bridging molecule between components of general transcription machinery and enhanceosome complexes (39.Barrett D.M. Gustafson K.S. Wang J. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6194-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CBP has been shown to acetylate transcription factors, including GATA-1, which may exert a direct effect on their function (40.Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the acetylation of GATA-1 promotes its association with other proteins (41.Lamonica J.M. Vakoc C.R. Blobel G.A. Blood. 2006; 108: 3736-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In the present study, we show that Arr19, a control factor for testicular steroidogenesis, is a novel target gene of GATA-1 in testicular Leydig cells. The expression and down-regulation pattern of ARR19 by cAMP/LH were determined to be very similar to those of GATA-1, in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Analysis of the Arr19 promoter revealed that two putative GATA-1 binding sites are functional and necessary for the gene regulation of Arr19 by cAMP/LH. Moreover, CBP coupled with GATA-1 markedly stimulated the Arr19 promoter activity. In addition, we show that both GATA-1 and CBP occupy the GATA-1 binding sites in the testis as well as cells, which were repressed by cAMP treatment. These results indicate that the expression of Arr19 is important for testicular steroidogenesis and is regulated by cAMP/LH via the control of GATA-1 expression in testicular Leydig cells.DiscussionIn this study, we demonstrate that ARR19 is expressed in testicular Leydig cells, and its expression is a direct target of GATA-1, the gene expression of which is down-regulated by LH signaling. Arr19 was originally isolated as a putative androgen-induced gene from murine testis, and its expression was detected in male reproductive organs, including the testis and prostate (4.Jeong B.C. Hong C.Y. Chattopadhyay S. Park J.H. Gong E.Y. Kim H.J. Chun S.Y. Lee K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GATA-1 and GATA-4 have been suggested to be important in the regulation of gonadal development and function. GATA-1 is expressed in mouse testicular Sertoli cells from postnatal day 7 onward (54.Ge R.S. Shan L.X. Hardy M.P. Payne A.H. Hardy M.P. Russell L.D. The Leydig Cell. 1st Ed. Cache River Press, Vienna, IL1996: 159-174Google Scholar). Later in development, it is expressed in adult Sertoli cells of stage VII–IX seminiferous tubules. However, no study has yet been conducted regarding the differential expressions of GATA-1 and ARR19 in the interstitial compartment during the development of the testis.The interstitium is populated by androgen-producing Leydig cells, which are physiologically and structurally heterogeneous. Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in males, and their differentiation in the testis during puberty is a signature event in the development of the male body. It has been hypothesized but remains far from proven that adult Leydig cells first arise from undifferentiated stem cells (stem Leydig cells; SLCs) (44.Hong C.Y. Park J.H. Ahn R.S. Im S.Y. Choi H.S.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2880-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In rats, the putative SLCs are present in the testis at birth, and some of their progeny express Leydig cell-specific genes by 11 days postpartum, thus becoming committed to the Leydig cell lineage (57.Mendis-Handagama S.M. Ariyaratne H.B. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 660-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 58.Lo K.C. Lei Z. Rao Ch.V. Beck J. Lamb D.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The committed cells subsequently undergo phase transitions through the progenitor (PLC) and immature stages and ultimately to the terminally differentiated adult Leydig cell stage (59.Ge R.S. Dong Q. Sottas C.M. Chen H. Zirkin B.R. Hardy M.P. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The PLCs proliferate and also exhibit certain aspects of differentiated function (60.Haider S. Rai U. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1986; 64: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). LH receptors first appear as the PLCs differentiate (61.Wing T.Y. Ewing L.L. Zegeye B. Zirkin B.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the development of the steroidogenic capacity of PLCs requires stimulation by LH (62.Cooke B.A. Payne A.H. Hardy M.P. Russell L.D. The Leydig Cell. 1st Ed. Cache River Press, Vienna, IL1996: 352-363Google Scholar).Our immunohistochemical analyses of 14-day-old and adult mouse testis demonstrated that ARR19 protein was highly expressed in the majority of interstitial cells during prepuberty, but its expression was restricted to a small population of interstitial cells during adulthood (Fig. 1A). Since SLCs and PLCs are present in the 14-day-old mouse testis prior to the onset of steroidogenic activity, and their numbers are very low in the adult testis, we speculate that the ARR19-expressing cells are putative precursors of Leydig cells and/or PLCs. In addition, Western blot analyses revealed that ARR19 was expressed in primary Leydig cells isolated from developing mouse testis, and its expression was gradually decreased with the age of the mouse testis (Fig. 1B). This suggests the involvement of LH/cAMP, an important mediator of Leydig cell differentiation, in the regulation of Arr19 gene expression, which we confirmed using 14-day-old testis injected with hCG and MA-10 Leydig cells treated with LH/cAMP (Figs. 1C and 2). Similar gene regulation by LH was previously reported with undifferentiated SLC markers, such as c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (42.Ge R.S. Dong Q. Sottas C.M. Papadopoulos V. Zirkin B.R. Hardy M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2719-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, further studies are required to correctly identify the ARR19-positive cells with regard to the differentiation of Leydig cells.With regard to the function of ARR19, we hypothesized that ARR19 would inhibit adult Leydig cell differentiation and/or testicular steroidogenesis, because ARR19 was highly expressed in earlier stages of Leydig cell development. In keeping constant with the hypothesis, the overexpression of ARR19 in R2C Leydig cells, which are constitutive steroidogenic and ARR19-negative, inhibited testosterone biosynthesis. Interestingly, the expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes, such as 3β HSD, StAR, and P450scc, was markedly reduced, suggesting that Arr19 may act as a corepressor of transcription factor(s). Arr19 has been previously reported to function as a corepressor of androgen receptor (4.Jeong B.C. Hong C.Y. Chattopadhyay S. Park J.H. Gong E.Y. Kim H.J. Chun S.Y. Lee K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, whether Arr19 directly or indirectly down-regulates the expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes is yet unknown, and we are presently investigating the matter and the mechanism involved.Previous studies have demonstrated that GATA-1 is expressed in Sertoli and Leydig cells of murine testis as well as the tumor cell lines derived from these testicular cells (15.Zhang Z.

Ewing L.L. Zegeye B. Zirkin B.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GATA-1 transactivates the inhibin/activin α gene in Sertoli and Leydig tumor cell lines (56.Davidoff M.S. Middendorff R. Enikolopov G. Riethmacher D. Holstein A.F. Müller D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 61.Wing T.Y. Ewing L.L. Zegeye B. Zirkin B.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this is achieved through the interaction with two GATA motifs in the promoter region (56.Davidoff M.S. Middendorff R. Enikolopov G. Riethmacher D. Holstein A.F. Müller D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mutation of either or both of the GATA motifs markedly reduced the basal promoter activity of the α-subunit gene in testicular cells, but this did not influence the stimulatory effects of cAMP on the transcription of the α-subunit gene (56.Davidoff M.S. Middendorff R. Enikolopov G. Riethmacher D. Holstein A.F. Müller D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, cAMP positively regulated the inhibin α-subunit gene, a target of GATA-1, although it negatively regulated the GATA-1 mRNA and protein levels. The mechanism by which the inhibin α-subunit gene is regulated by cAMP seems to differ considerably from that of Arr19. The elevation of inhibin α-subunit mRNA by cAMP occurred via the CRE motif in the promoter region of the α-subunit (56.Davidoff M.S. Middendorff R. Enikolopov G. Riethmacher D. Holstein A.F. Müller D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which also appeared to compensate for the decreased promoter activity resulting from the cAMP-mediated reduction of GATA-1 protein levels.Several studies have shown that GATA-1 activity is regulated by acetylation and phosphorylation (32.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 64.Hernandez-Hernandez A. Ray P. Litos G. Ciro M. Ottolenghi S. Beug H. Boyes J.

Blood. 2006; 107: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The acetylation of GATA-1 increases DNA binding activity and stimulates the transcription of the GATA-1-dependent promoter (32.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 37.Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), whereas MAPK phosphorylation of GATA-1, in cooperation with acetylation, is involved in its degradation through the ubiquitination (64.Hernandez-Hernandez A. Ray P. Litos G. Ciro M. Ottolenghi S. Beug H. Boyes J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3264-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway is identified as a mediator of Epo-induced phosphorylation of GATA-1 in erythroid cells, which enhances GATA-1 transcriptional activity (65.Zhao W. Kitidis C. Fleming M.D. Lodish H.F. Ghaffari S. Blood. 2006; 107: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our data showed that the levels of ARR19 and GATA-1 protein were rapidly decreased by cAMP/LH treatment, both leaving less than 50% within 2 h (Figs. 2, B and E). In addition, the decrease of Arr19 mRNA level by cAMP was faster than that of GATA-1 (Fig. 2C), in contrast to the simultaneous decrease of their protein levels. These results raise the possibility of additional layers of regulation of GATA-1 activity, such as protein degradation or dissociation from the Arr19 promoter, by cAMP/LH. A previous study has shown that GATA-4 protein, another key regulator of gonadal gene expression, is phosphorylated by protein kinase A in response to cAMP in Leydig cells (63.Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22128-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It will be worthwhile to investigate whether the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway can also modify GATA-1 protein, resulting in the modulation of GATA-1 activity.In MA-10 cells, the expression of ARR19 was negatively regulated by LH/cAMP, and, moreover, the pattern of its negative regulation was similar to that of the GATA-1. In addition, the cloning and characterization of the Arr19 promoter showed that there were two functional GATA motifs, thereby indicating that Arr19 is a novel target gene of GATA-1. Sequence analysis of the Arr19 promoter also revealed a putative CRE motif, which resides proximally to the two GATA motifs. However, the CRE appears to be nonfunctional, since the expression of exogenous CREB protein exerted no effects on the Arr19 promoter (Fig. 3D). In accordance with this observation, the deletion of the CRE had no effect on the promoter activity of the Arr19 gene (Fig. 4D). Thus, CBP appears to function as a coactivator for GATA-1 on the Arr19 promoter.In summary, we have demonstrated 1) the differential expression of ARR19 in Leydig cells during the development of mouse testis, 2) the inhibition of steroidogenesis by overexpression of ARR19 via the regulation of steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions, 3) the effects of LH/cAMP signaling on ARR19 and GATA-1 expression in MA-10 cells, and 4) the promoter regulation of Arr19 by GATA-1, which was augmented by CBP in vivo and in vitro. Together, our results suggest that Arr19 gene expression is controlled by LH/cAMP signaling via GATA-1 gene regulation in testicular Leydig cells. Further, LH/cAMP-mediated regulation of Arr19 gene expression suggests that ARR19 may play an important role in the differentiation of Leydig cells, which is controlled by LH. Arr19 (androgen receptor corepressor of 19 kDa), also referred to as Cklfsf2a, is a member of the chemokine-like factor superfamily (CKLFSF), a group of novel proteins that operate as a functional bridge between chemokines and members of the transmembrane 4 superfamily. Members of the CKLFSF family have been suggested to perform an important role across a broad range of physiological and pathological processes. In humans, the CKLFSF family harbors nine genes, CKLF and CKLFSF1 to -8, which exhibit high degrees of similarity at both the amino acid and structural levels. Among these, CKLF, CKLKSF1, and CKLFSF2 are closely related to each other and are tightly linked on chromosome 16q22.1 (1.Han W. Ding P. Xu M. Wang L. Rui M. Shi S. Liu Y. Zheng Y. Chen Y. Yang T. Ma D. Genomics. 2003; 81: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2.Han W. Lou Y. Tang J. Zhang Y. Chen Y. Li Y. Gu W. Huang J. Gui L. Tang Y. Li F. Song Q. Di C. Wang L. Shi Q. Sun R. Xia D. Rui M. Tang J. Ma D. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Human CKLFSF2 is expressed abundantly in the testis and has two counterparts in the mouse, Cklfsf2a and Cklfsf2b. Cklfsf2a and Cklfsf2b evidence a similar expression pattern and amino acid identities of 47.6 and 45.5%, respectively, with human CKLFSF2 (3.Li T. Han W. Yang T. Ding P. Rui M. Liu D. Wang Y. Ma D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mouse Cklfsf2a/Arr19 was originally cloned as a potential androgen response gene in the testis and was further characterized as a novel androgen receptor corepressor (4.Jeong B.C. Hong C.Y. Chattopadhyay S. Park J.H. Gong E.Y. Kim H.J. Chun S.Y. Lee K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Arr19 gene is located on chromosome 8 and encodes for a leucine-rich and highly hydrophobic 19-kDa protein. ARR19 is expressed abundantly in the testis and moderately in other male reproductive organs, such as the prostate (3.Li T. Han W. Yang T. Ding P. Rui M. Liu D. Wang Y. Ma D. Int. J. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2016205708,"Holliday junction (HJ) resolution is a critical step during homologous recombination. In Escherichia coli this job is performed by a member of the RNase H/Integrase superfamily called RuvC, whereas in Schizosaccharomyces pombe it has been attributed to the XPF family member Mus81-Eme1. HJ resolution is achieved through the sequential cleavage of two strands of like polarity at or close to the junction crossover point. RuvC functions as a dimer, whereas Mus81-Eme1 is thought to function as a dimer of heterodimers. However, in both cases the multimer contains two catalytic sites, which act independently and sequentially during the resolution reaction. To ensure that both strands are cleaved before the nuclease dissociates from the junction, the rate of second strand cleavage is greatly enhanced compared to that of the first. The enhancement of second strand cleavage has been attributed to the increased flexibility of the nicked HJ, which would facilitate rapid engagement of the second active site and scissile bond. Here we have investigated whether other properties of the nicked HJ are important for enhancing second strand cleavage.A comparison of the efficiency of cleavage of nicked HJs with and without a 5' phosphate at the nick site shows that a 5' phosphate is required for most of the enhancement of second strand cleavage by RuvC. In contrast Mus81-Eme1 cleaves nicked HJs with and without a 5' phosphate with equal efficiency, albeit there are differences in cleavage site selection.Our data show that efficient HJ resolution by RuvC depends on the 5' phosphate revealed by incision of the first strand. This is a hitherto unappreciated factor in promoting accelerated second strand cleavage. However, a 5' phosphate is not a universal requirement since efficient cleavage by Mus81-Eme1 appears to depend solely on the increased junction flexibility that is developed by the first incision."
https://openalex.org/W2083797945,"Our recent study has shown that βA3-crystallin along with βB1- and βB2-crystallins were part of high molecular weight complex obtained from young, old, and cataractous lenses suggesting potential interactions between α- and β-crystallins (Srivastava, O. P., Srivastava, K., and Chaves, J. M. (2008) Mol. Vis. 14, 1872–1885). To investigate this further, this study was carried out to determine the interaction sites of βA3-crystallin with αA- and αB-crystallins. The study employed a mammalian two-hybrid method, an in vivo assay to determine the regions of βA3-crystallin that interact with αA- and αB-crystallins. Five regional truncated mutants of βA3-crystallin were generated using specific primers with deletions of N-terminal extension (NT) (named βA3-NT), N-terminal extension plus motif I (named βA3-NT + I), N-terminal extension plus motifs I and II (named βA3-NT + I + II), motif III plus IV (named βA3-III + IV), and motif IV (named βA3-IV). The mammalian two-hybrid studies were complemented with fluorescence resonance energy transfer acceptor photobleaching studies using the above described mutant proteins, fused with DsRed (Red) and AcGFP fluorescent proteins. The results showed that the motifs III and IV of βA3-crystallin were interactive with αA-crystallin, and motifs II and III of βA3-crystallin primarily interacted with αB-crystallin. Our recent study has shown that βA3-crystallin along with βB1- and βB2-crystallins were part of high molecular weight complex obtained from young, old, and cataractous lenses suggesting potential interactions between α- and β-crystallins (Srivastava, O.

The results showed that the motifs III and IV of βA3-crystallin were interactive with αA-crystallin, and motifs II and III of βA3-crystallin primarily interacted with αB-crystallin. The structural proteins (crystallins) of the vertebrate lens belong to two families, i.e. α-crystallin and β-γ crystallins superfamily. Although α-crystallin is made of two primary gene products of αA and αB-crystallins, the β-γ superfamily is constituted by four acidic (βA1, βA2, βA3, and βA4) and three basic (βB1, βB2, and βB3) β-crystallins and six γ-crystallins (γA, γB, γC, γD, γE, and γF) (1.Andley U.P.

High concentrations of these crystallins and their interactions provide refractive power to the lens for focusing light on to the retina. Both αA- and αB-crystallins also function as molecular chaperons and prevent aberrant protein interactions and protein unfolding. The β- and γ-crystallins have only structural properties (2.Bloemendal H. de Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

The expressions of the crystallins are both developmentally and spatially regulated (1.Andley U.P. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2007; 26: 78-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and their interactions lead to the transparency of the lens because of short range order of the crystallin matrix (7.Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8.Xia J.Z. Wang Q. Tatarkova S. Aerts T. Clauwaert J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2815-2822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Previous reports have shown that the α-crystallin interacts with other crystallins and intermediate filaments (2.Bloemendal H. de Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). An interaction of α-crystallin with βL-crystallin produced filament-like structures, and similar interactions between βL-crystallin with αA-crystallin (isolated from UV-A-irradiated lenses) showed even more pronounced filament formation (9.Weinreb O. van Rijk A.F. Dovrat A. Bloemendal H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3893-3897PubMed Google Scholar). A similar study of interaction between α-crystallin and βL-crystallin at 60 °C produced soluble complexes with mean radius of gyration ∼14 nm, mean molecular mass of ∼4 × 106 Da, and maximum size of 40 nm (10.Krivandin A.V. Muranov K.O. Ostrovsky M.A. Dokl. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 394: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recently, we dissociated a fraction containing βA3-, βB1-, and βB2-crystallins from the α-crystallin fraction of human lenses by detergent treatment, which suggested the existence of a complex of these crystallins in the soluble protein fraction (6.Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Chaves J.M. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the above studies suggest potential interactions between α- and β-crystallins in vivo.Delaye and Tardieu proposed in 1983 (7.Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) that the short range order of crystallin proteins accounts for the lens transparency. It is primarily dependent on high crystallin concentrations, interactions among crystallins, and on organization of cytoskeletal and membrane constituents (3.Ponce A. Sorensen C. Takemoto L. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Xia J.Z. Wang Q. Tatarkova S. Aerts T. Clauwaert J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2815-2822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have been done to understand the heterogeneous interactions among α-, β-, and γ-crystallins, yet such interactions remain unclear because of their complex nature. Several investigators have utilized a variety of techniques to study the dynamics involved in crystallin-crystallin interactions and analyze factors that could affect the short range order of crystallins. These techniques included fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 2The abbreviations used are: FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferWTwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineNTN-terminalPTMpost-translational modificationSEAPsecreted alkaline phosphatase. 2The abbreviations used are: FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferWTwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineNTN-terminalPTMpost-translational modificationSEAPsecreted alkaline phosphatase.

Vis. 2006; 12: 581-587PubMed Google Scholar), spectroscopy (13.Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. Lyon C. Canet D. Hernandez H. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. J. Mol.

These studies determined interactions among various crystallins in vitro utilizing either wild-type or mutated crystallins to understand their roles in crystallin-crystallin interactions during normal conditions and cataract development. A study using surface plasmon resonance method showed that the self-association among subunits of α-crystallin was mainly driven by αA-crystallin, and among the two, αB subunit had relatively stronger binding affinity to β- and γ-crystallins (16.Kamei A. Matsuura N. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro experiments have several drawbacks. These include a need to purify proteins, a cumbersome process that might alter their conformation during multiple steps of purification, and the results provide indirect evidence that is nonphysiological.To better understand the crystallin-crystallin interactions that affect protein solubility and therefore lens transparency, in vivo methods such as confocal microscopy with FRET acceptor photobleaching and mammalian two-hybrid assay approaches have recently been used (17.Song S. Hanson M.J. Liu B.F. Chylack L.T. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1282-1287PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Liu B.F. Liang J.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biochem. 2008; 104: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For instance, the study of crystallin interactions by the two-hybrid system showed significant interactions between α- and β/γ-crystallins (23.Fu L. Liang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4255-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Also, the two-hybrid assay exhibited that mutations in αA-, αB-, and γ-crystallins during congenital cataracts altered protein-protein interactions (24.Fu L. Liang J.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which might contribute to decreased protein solubility and cataract development. Because the two-hybrid system is more sensitive to determine protein-protein interactions than in vitro measurements, it can detect weak as well as transient interactions among crystallins. Moreover, the advantage of the two-hybrid system is that it allows detection of biologically significant interactions among crystallins in a physiological environment of living cells. Confocal FRET microscopy (FRET acceptor photobleaching) is yet even a more powerful approach compared with the two-hybrid system as it circumvents the need of a expressed protein to move to nucleus for transcriptional activation of the reporter gene, and it also provides direct visual assessment of crystallin-crystallin interaction in a physiological environment of living cells (19.Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Liu B.F. Anbarasu K. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 854-861PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Liu B.F. Liang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3936-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).During aging and cataract development, post-translational modifications (PTM) of crystallins can disrupt short range order of crystallins, and therefore, PTMs play a crucial role in aggregation, cross-linking, and insolubilization of crystallins (2.Bloemendal H. de Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Our recent studies (25.Srivastava O.P. Kirk M.C. Srivastava K.

Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed the presence of covalent multimers of crystallins in human lenses increased with aging. One of the major findings from our studies was the presence of fragments of β-crystallins, mainly of βA3-crystallin along with α-crystallin in water-soluble high molecular weight and water-insoluble protein fractions of aging and cataractous human lenses (26.Harrington V.

Also, recent genetic studies clearly demonstrated that the association of human inherited autosomal dominant, congenital zonular, or nuclear sutural cataracts with misfolded proteins or premature termination of crystallins was the consequence of truncation at the translational level (30.Lu S. Zhao C. Jiao H. Kere J. Tang X. Zhao F. Zhang X. Zhao K. Larsson C. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 1154-1160PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Cohen D. Bar-Yosef U. Levy J. Gradstein L. Belfair N. Ofir R. Joshua S.

Therefore, truncations of crystallins could occur as a result of PTMs, splice mutation, point mutations, or non-sense mutations and might lead to their altered solubility, oligomerization, and supramolecular assembly (33.Rajan S. Chandrashekar R. Aziz A. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15684-15691Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34.Feil I.K. Malfois M. Hendle J. van Der Zandt H. Svergun D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These aberrations are believed to be averted by virtue of chaperone function of α-crystallin that involves its binding to damaged species of β/γ-crystallins in vivo (2.Bloemendal H. de Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar).Besides the chaperone functions, another function of α-crystallin is the inhibition of proteinases. Numerous studies have shown that both human and bovine α-crystallins exhibited inhibitor activity toward trypsin, elastase (35.Ortwerth B.J. Olesen P.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36.Sharma K.K. Olesen P.R. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Eye Res. 1983; 36: 363-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, our studies have shown that the βA3-proteinase existed in an inactive state in the α-crystallin fraction and gets activated with detergents (5.Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 6.Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Chaves J.M. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that α-crystallin regulates βA3-proteinase as an inhibitor (6.Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Chaves J.M. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). 3O. P. Srivastava, unpublished results. 3O. P. Srivastava, unpublished results. However, the increasing proportion of the α-crystallin-associated trypsin/elastase inhibitor activity shifted from the water-soluble proteins to the water-insoluble protein fraction with aging (40.Srivastava O.P. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 48: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 41.Ortwerth B.J. Sharma K.K. Olesen P.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which suggests that PTMs during aging might disrupt α-crystallin assembly in the water-soluble protein fraction and affect its chaperone ability to prevent aggregation and precipitation of crystallins. Thus, it appears that α-crystallin has dual functions in vivo to provide stability to lens crystallins by preventing their unwanted proteolysis and aggregation/denaturation and eventually keeping the lens transparent.Although the chaperone activity of α-crystallin has been extensively investigated, the interactions of α-crystallin (as an inhibitor) and βA3 (as a proteinase) have yet to be explored. Also, as stated above, the protein-protein interactions play a major role in maintaining lens transparency. Few studies have investigated the interaction among acidic and basic human β-crystallins; however, a detailed study of the region(s) of βA3-crystallin that interact with human αA- and αB-crystallins is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine interacting regions of human βA3-crystallin with human αA- and αB-crystallins. Mammalian two-hybrid assay and FRET acceptor photobleaching methods were used to identify and directly visualize these sites.Experimental ProceduresMaterialsThe mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit, obtained from Clontech, was used to generate desired plasmid constructs. The pDsRed-Monomer-N and pAcGFP1-N In-Fusion ready vectors were obtained from Clontech to generate fluorescent-tagged fusion proteins. HeLa cells were a kind gift from Dr. L. Chow of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, Thermoscientific HyClone (Logan, UT), or Fisher. The restriction endonucleases, the molecular weight protein markers, and DNA markers were purchased from GE Healthcare and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. T7 promoter, T7 terminator, and other primers used in the study were obtained from Invitrogen. The site-specific polyclonal antibodies were raised against αA- and βA3-crystallins in our laboratory as described previously (42.Gupta R. Srivastava K. Srivastava O.P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9964-9978Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the monoclonal anti-αB antibody was obtained from StressGen (Ann Arbor, MI). Molecular biology-grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise.Analyses of Heteromers of αA Plus βA3 or αB Plus βA3 by Size-exclusion HPLC and Dynamic Light Scattering MethodRecombinant His-tagged WT βA3-, WT αA-, and WT αB-crystallins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni2+-affinity chromatography as described earlier (43.Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 644-656PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Gupta R. Srivastava O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44258-44269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (0.3–0.4 mg/ml) of purified αA- or αB-crystallins were mixed with βA3-crystallin in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The heteromers (WT αA plus WT βA3 or WT αB plus WT βA3) were analyzed by size-exclusion HPLC using a TSK G-3000 PWXL column. The individual crystallin homomer preparations (WT αA, WT αB, and WT βA3) were also fractionated through the same size-exclusion HPLC column for their comparative elution with the heteromers.To determine the molecular mass of the heteromers of WT αA plus WT βA3 and WT αB plus WT βA3, the specific column fractions representing heteromer complexes in the above size-exclusion chromatography were analyzed by a multiangle dynamic light scattering method as described previously (44.Gupta R. Srivastava O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44258-44269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A multiangle laser light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA), coupled to HPLC, was used to determine the absolute molar mass of homomers of WT αA, WT αB, and WT βA3 and the heteromers of WT αA plus WT βA3 and WT αB plus WT βA3. Briefly, protein preparations in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter prior to their analysis. Results used 18 different angles, and the angles were normalized with the 90° detector.Immunofluorescence Microscopy to Determine Expression and Co-localization of αA- or αB-crystallins with βA3-crystallinHeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1× with glucose and l-glutamine without sodium pyruvate), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. One day prior to transfection, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in 500 μl of medium in 6-well plates. Transfections were performed with the Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were examined for the distribution of expressed fusion proteins. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by incubation with monoclonal antibodies to WT αB-crystallin (at a dilution of 1:1000) and polyclonal antibodies (at a dilution of 1:500) to WT αA- or WT βA3-crystallins. The cells were then washed and incubated for 1 h in the dark with red/green fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 dilutions. The cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Plan 2) equipped with a high performance C-imaging system (Compix, Tualatin, OR).Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay to Determine Interaction of αA- and αB-crystallins with βA3-crystallinCloning of WT αA-, WT αB-, and WT βA3-crystallins and Truncated Mutants of βA3-crystallinTwo sets of constructs were generated from the two vectors as follows: (a) pM vector, a vector for the DNA-binding domain of the GAL4, and (b) pVP16 vector, a vector for the transcriptional activation domain of VP16. The WT αA-, WT αB-, and WT βA3-crystallin genes were subcloned from previously prepared plasmids, pDIRECT and pCRT7/CT TOPO, respectively, into the pM and pVP16 vectors. PCR was performed for each gene using the specific primers (Table 1). All the primers were incorporated with EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. The five deletion mutants of βA3-crystallin were generated starting with deletion of N-terminal (NT) extension (named βA3-NT), NT plus motif I (named βA3-NT + I), NT plus motifs I and II (named βA3-NT + I + II), motif III + IV (named βA3-III + IV), and motif IV (named βA3-IV) using specific primers (Table 1) and pM βA3- and pVP16 βA3-plasmid DNA as templates. The PCR products were digested by the restriction enzymes and subcloned into pM and pVP16 vectors to yield different plasmid constructs (i.e. pM-WT αA or WT αB or WT βA3, pVP16-WT αA, or WT αB or WT βA3, and all the five mutants of βA3 in pM and pVP16 vectors, respectively). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at the DNA core facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used for generating wild-type crystallins and deletion mutants of βA3 using PCR-based mutagenesis for mammalian two-hybrid assayConstructsPrimers (5′–3′)WT αAForwardCGGATTCATGGACGTGACCATCCAGCACReverseGCTCTAGATTAGGACGAGGGAGCCGAGGTGGGGWT αBForwardCGGATTCATGGACATCGCCATCCACCACCCCReverseGGCTCTAGACTATTTCTTGGGGGCTGCGGTGWT βA3ForwardCGGAATTCATGGAGACCCAGGCTGAGCAGReverseGGCTCTAGACTACTGTTGGATTCGGCGAATCβA3-(N)ForwardGGAATTCTGGAAGATAACCATCTATGATCAGReverseGGCTCTAGACTACTGTTGGATTCGGCGAATCβA3-(N + I)ForwardGGAATTCGGCGCCTGGATTGGTTATGAGCATReverseGGCTCTAGACTACTGTTGGATTCGGCGAATCβA3-(N + I + II)ForwardGGAATTCGCTAATCATAAGGAGTCTAAGATGReverseCTACTGTTGGATTCGGCGAATCGATTGβA3-(III + IV)ForwardCGGAATTCATGGAGACCCAGGCTGAGCAGReverseGCTCTAGACTACTCCTTATGATTAGCTGAβA3-(IV)ForwardCGGAATTCATGGAGACCCAGGCTGAGCAGReverseGCTCTAGACTATTGTATCTTCATGGAGCC Open table in a new tab Tissue Culture and TransfectionsHeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected as described above. For mammalian two-hybrid assay, all three plasmids, pM-X (0.3 μg), pVP16-Y (0.3 μg), and pG5SEAP reporter vector (0.3 μg) were co-transfected into HeLa cells. The cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 52 h of transfection, the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity was detected using the BD Great EscAPe SEAP fluorescence detection kit (Clontech). Each experiment was done in duplicate, and three independent transfections were performed. The inclusion of X and Y controls was to ensure that X or Y protein did not function autonomously as a transcriptional activator. Basal control (pM and pVP16), X-control (pM and pVP16-X), and Y-control (pM and pVIP-Y) were included. The data for basal controls were used for the conversion of SEAP activity to fold activation.SEAP AssayThe level of SEAP activity was detected in cell culture medium after 52 h of transfection using the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cell culture medium was collected and centrifuged to remove any detached cells present in the cell medium. The fluorescence compound, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, was used as a substrate, and its fluorescence was determined by excitation at 360 nm and emission at 449 nm. A standard linear curve was obtained using the positive placental alkaline phosphatase.Confocal FRET Microscopy to Determine Interactions of WT αA/WT αB-crystallins with βA3-crystallin and Its Truncated MutantsCloning of GFP and Red Constructs with WT αA, WT αB, WT βA3, and βA3 Mutant GenesThe pDsRed-Monomer-N (designated as Red) and pAcGFP1-N (designated as GFP) In-Fusion ready vectors were obtained from Clontech to generate the desired constructs. The above mentioned vectors are linearized mammalian expression vectors that encode DsRed-Monomer, a monomeric mutant derived from the tetrametric Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (λex/λem = 557/585 nm) and green fluorescent protein from Aequorea coerulescens (λex/λem = 475/505 nm), respectively. The WT αA, WT αB, and WT βA3-crystallin genes and those of the above described βA3 mutants were subcloned in either Red and/or GFP vectors by following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The primers were designed containing 15 nucleotide sequences (Table 2), which were homologous to the cut ends of the linearized vector at 5′ ends of sense and antisense. Briefly, PCR was performed to amplify the DNA insert using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60–62 °C (depending on Tm of primers) for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. If necessary, the PCR products were purified and then ligated to the required vectors in a dry-down reaction tube containing In-Fusion enzyme (Clontech). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min followed by incubation at 50 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was diluted four times and transformed to Fusion-Blue Competent cells (Clontech) using standard transformation procedure. The recombinant bacteria were selected using kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Five random colonies were picked from each of the constructs; their plasmid DNAs were isolated, and the presence of inserts was analyzed by restriction digestion using SphI and EcoRI. All the constructs were expressed as a fusion protein to the N terminus of Red and/or GFP vectors. The resulting constructs were designated as Red-WT αA, Red-WT αB, GFP-WT αB, GFP-WT βA3 and mutants of βA3 (βA3-NT), NT plus motif I (βA3-NT + I), NT plus motif I and II (βA3-NT + I + II), and motif III + IV (βA3-III + IV), motif IV (βA3-IV) as GFP-βA3-NT, GFP-βA3- (NT + I), GFP-βA3-(NT + I + II), GFP-βA3-(III + IV), and GFP-βA3-(IV), respectively. For positive control, a construct of GFP-Red fusion protein was also prepared by subcloning GFP cDNA to pAcGFP-C1 using homologous 15-nucleotide sequence. For negative control, the unlinked GFP and Red vectors were used. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.TABLE 2Oligonucleotide primers used for generating wild-type crystallins and deletion mutants of βA3 using PCR-based mutagenesis for FRET acceptor photobleachingConstructsPrimers (5′–3′)WT αAForwardAAGGCCTCTGTCGACATGGACGTGACCATCCAGCACReverseAGAATTCGCAAGCTTGGACGAGGGAGCCGAGGTGWT αBForwardAAGGCCTCTGTCGACATGGACATCGCCATCCACCACReverseAGAATTCGCAAGCTTTTTCTTGGGGGCTGCGGTGACWT βA3ForwardAAGGCCTCTGTCGACATG GAGACCCAGGCTGAGCAGReverseAGAATTCGCAAGCTTCTGTTGGATTCGGCGAATCGATTGβA3-(N)ForwardAAGGCCTCTGTCGACATGTGGAAGATAACCATCTATGATCAGReverseAGAATTCGCAAGCTTCTGTTGGATTCGGCGAATCGATTGβA3-(N + I)ForwardAAGGCCTCTGTCGACATGGGCGC"
