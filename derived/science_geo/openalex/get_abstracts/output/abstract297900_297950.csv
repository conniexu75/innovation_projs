This can be explained only by assuming that the lines are deposited during periods of exposure at low tide. The average duration of an increment is 24 hours and 50 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2074239818,"A study has been made of carbon-13 and oxygen-18 variations in Greek marbles from the ancient quarry localities of Naxos, Paros, Mount Hymettus, and Mount Pentelikon. Parian, Hymettian, and Pentelic marbles can be clearly distinguished by the isotopic relationships; Naxian marbles fall into two groups characterized by different oxygen-18/oxygen-16 ratios. Ten archeological samples were also analyzed; the isotopic data indicate that the ""Theseion"" is made of Pentelic marble and a block in the Treasury of Siphnos at Delphi is probably Parian marble."
https://openalex.org/W2064301401,"Above 100 kilobars the apparent absorption edges (approximately 3 electron volts) of single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of the metastable olivine and stable spinel forms of Fe(2)SiO(4) shift rapidly with pressure from the near-ultraviolet into the lower-energy infrared region. Simultaneously, an exponential increase in electrical conductivity occurs. These effects are reversible as pressure is reduced or reapplied and are not accompanied by a first-order phase change in olivine or spinel. These observations relate to fundamental concepts of electrical conductivity and photon absorption in complex transition-metal silicates in that they cannot be readily interpreted in terms of an intrinsic band-gap model. The intensity and energy changes are too great and the effect occurs at too low a pressure to be explained by processes such as spin-pairing and other crystal-field effects. The results suggest that a new mechanism of conduction, perhaps symbiotic and employing an efficient charge-transfer process, is induced at high pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2010287928,"A lightning flash that struck the 150-meter weather tower at Kennedy Space Center was studied by several research groups using varioul techniques. The flash had unusually large peak currents and a stepped leader of relatively short duration. The charged regions neutralized by the three return strokes were located within a horizontal layer between heights of about 6 and 8 kilometers, where environmental temperatures were about -10 degrees to -20 degrees C. The charge source for the first return stroke coincided with a vertical shaft of precipitation inferred to have been graupel or hail. Charge sources for subsequent strokes were near the edge of the detectable precipitation echo. The overall channel length was about 10 kilometers. A Vertically oriented intracloud discharge occurred after the three return strokes."
https://openalex.org/W2080322904,"Yearling steelhead trout held in fresh water at cold temperatures (6.5 degrees or 10 degrees C) showed an increase in gill microsomal Na(+), K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase activity during parr-smolt transformation, whereas trout held in warm water (15 degrees or 20 degrees C) did not. Adenosine triphosphatase activity increased and other indications of transformation were observed in fish transferred from warm to cold water, whereas the reverse occurred on transfer from cold to warm water."
